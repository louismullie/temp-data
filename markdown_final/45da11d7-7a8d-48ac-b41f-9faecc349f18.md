## Question

Craniofacial hyperhidrosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about craniofacial hyperhidrosis management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the condition and confirming the diagnostic framework. Then, I should verify the severity assessment tools that guide treatment selection. Next, I will review first-line therapies, followed by second-line and surgical options, and I must not forget special populations like pediatrics and postmenopausal patients. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and highlight key evidence gaps and counseling points, making sure I double-check each claim against the cited literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and epidemiology so I don't anchor on an imprecise concept. Craniofacial hyperhidrosis is focal, primary hyperhidrosis affecting the face and/or scalp, typically symmetric and episodic, often triggered by emotional stimuli, and it can substantially impair quality of life; prevalence estimates for primary hyperhidrosis overall are around 3–5% in the U.S., with craniofacial involvement being less common than axillary or palmar forms but still clinically significant, and I should remember to exclude secondary causes before labeling it as primary [^115JdZ68] [^114QpaMp].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before jumping to treatments. I need to ensure bilateral symmetry, diurnal predominance, absence of night sweats, and a duration of at least 6 months to support primary focal disease, and I should actively screen for secondary causes such as hyperthyroidism, infections, malignancy, and medication-induced sweating; the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) is a validated, simple tool to stratify severity and guide therapy, and I should confirm that an HDSS of 2 or higher signals clinically meaningful disease warranting escalation beyond lifestyle measures [^115JdZ68] [^116cu34D].

> Next, I should review first-line topical options and make sure I'm not overstating the evidence. Topical glycopyrrolate is consistently recommended as first-line for craniofacial hyperhidrosis, with randomized data showing high efficacy and minimal systemic adverse effects; a split-face trial demonstrated marked sweat reduction versus placebo, and a systematic review supports its use as first-line due to efficacy and safety, though I need to counsel on ocular irritation and consider using gloves to limit periocular transfer [^112QkBvo] [^114wGVMi] [^115qmASq].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of aluminum chloride because I recall older guidelines mentioning it. The Canadian consensus includes topical aluminum chloride as a potential first-line option for craniofacial hyperhidrosis, but the evidence base is weaker than for glycopyrrolate, and many contemporary reviews prioritize glycopyrrolate over aluminum salts for facial sweating; so I can present aluminum chloride as an alternative, especially for mild disease or when glycopyrrolate is unavailable, while setting expectations about skin irritation and limited efficacy in this location [^116cu34D] [^115qmASq].

> I will now examine botulinum toxin as a core option, and I need to check both serotype A and B data. Intradermal botulinum toxin type A achieves high response rates with a median duration around 5–6 months, and meta-analyses show significant sweat reduction and quality-of-life improvements versus placebo; the main facial adverse effect is frontalis muscle inhibition, which is usually transient, and I should confirm that craniofacial use remains off-label in many jurisdictions even though it is guideline-supported for focal sites after topical failure [^114wGVMi] [^114t9BSF] [^1177Dfre] [^1118EmfJ].

> But wait, what if type A is not available or contraindicated; let me consider type B. Small studies and case series suggest botulinum toxin type B can be effective for craniofacial hyperhidrosis, including postmenopausal patients, with meaningful DLQI improvements; however, evidence is limited and injection pain or diffuse muscle weakness may occur, so I should frame BTX-B as a reasonable alternative when type A is unsuitable or unavailable, with careful counseling on expected benefits and risks [^112h48x8] [^116PTx8J].

> Next, I should review systemic anticholinergics and double-check the balance of efficacy and side effects. Oral oxybutynin has high efficacy in observational cohorts but carries a high rate of anticholinergic adverse effects such as dry mouth and blurred vision; nonetheless, real-world long-term data suggest sustained HDSS improvement in many patients, and I should titrate slowly and consider extended-release formulations to improve tolerability, while screening for narrow-angle glaucoma and urinary retention risks [^112AiwGf] [^113Nqied] [^116jzJ6P].

> Let me consider glycopyrrolate orally as an alternative, and I should confirm its relative tolerability. Retrospective data suggest roughly two-thirds of patients respond to oral glycopyrrolate with fewer hypotensive effects than clonidine, though xerostomia remains common; I need to ensure I start low, go slow, and reassess for cognitive effects, especially in older adults, and I should remember that head-to-head superiority data versus oxybutynin are limited [^116emXAB] [^116jzJ6P].

> I should confirm where iontophoresis fits, because I don't want to overgeneralize from palmar-plantar protocols. Iontophoresis is first-line for palmar and plantar hyperhidrosis and is not standard for craniofacial sites due to practical and safety considerations; therefore, I will not recommend iontophoresis for facial sweating outside of exceptional, investigational contexts, and I will keep the focus on topical anticholinergics and botulinum toxin for the face and scalp [^116cu34D] [^115qmASq].

> Now, I need to check surgical options and their trade-offs, especially compensatory hyperhidrosis. Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy or sympathotomy at the T2 level is effective for craniofacial hyperhidrosis with high success rates, but compensatory hyperhidrosis is common and can be severe; clipping techniques may offer reversibility if CH is intolerable, and I should counsel extensively preoperatively about this risk and the potential need for retreatment or reversal [^114YeJMy] [^113JhGMb] [^1156r5qb].

> Let me think about special populations, starting with pediatrics, and I should double-check safety data. Primary hyperhidrosis often begins in childhood or adolescence, and topical glycopyrronium tosylate is FDA-approved for axillary disease from age 9, supporting the safety of topical anticholinergics in youth; botulinum toxin has pediatric safety experience in other indications, but for craniofacial hyperhidrosis it remains off-label, so shared decision-making and conservative dosing are prudent, with topical therapy generally preferred before systemic agents [^114xhB9j] [^111yfMsL] [^112KrzkB].

> For postmenopausal patients, I should verify whether vasomotor symptoms confound the picture. Postmenopausal craniofacial hyperhidrosis may overlap with hot flashes, and small studies suggest botulinum toxin type B can improve DLQI in this subgroup; I need to screen for hormonal contributors and consider topical or injectable therapy before systemic anticholinergics, tailoring to symptom triggers and comorbidities [^112h48x8] [^1167cdGG].

> Next, I should review emerging therapies and make sure I don't overstate their current role. Sofpironium bromide, a topical anticholinergic with retrometabolic design, shows efficacy in axillary hyperhidrosis and may eventually extend to craniofacial sites, but facial-specific data are limited; energy-based devices and laser combinations with botulinum toxin are being explored, but high-quality craniofacial data are sparse, so these remain investigational for facial sweating at present [^111ZWbT6] [^114r14su] [^111Mkuni].

> I will now synthesize a practical, severity-based algorithm, and I should confirm alignment with guidelines. For mild disease, start with topical glycopyrrolate and lifestyle measures; for moderate disease or topical failure, escalate to botulinum toxin injections; for severe or refractory cases, consider oral anticholinergics such as oxybutynin or glycopyrrolate with careful monitoring; reserve endoscopic thoracic sympathotomy for highly selected, treatment-refractory patients after extensive counseling about compensatory hyperhidrosis, and consider repeating or combining modalities as needed given the chronic nature of the condition [^116cu34D] [^114wGVMi] [^1131ssMG].

> Hold on, I should verify key evidence gaps so counseling is honest. High-quality randomized trials directly comparing topical glycopyrrolate, botulinum toxin, and oral anticholinergics for craniofacial hyperhidrosis are lacking; long-term durability data for botulinum toxin beyond 6–9 months are limited; and the optimal level of sympathectomy to minimize compensatory hyperhidrosis while preserving efficacy remains debated, reinforcing the need for individualized, shared decision-making and cautious extrapolation from axillary and palmar data [^114t9BSF] [^114YeJMy] [^1165fMa4].

> Finally, I need to ensure I address quality of life and follow-up. Hyperhidrosis significantly impairs psychological, social, and physical functioning, so I should routinely measure HDSS and DLQI, set expectations about temporary therapies and recurrence, and schedule reassessment every 3–6 months to titrate treatments, manage adverse effects, and consider combination strategies or referral for procedural options when appropriate [^114QpaMp] [^116cu34D].

---

Craniofacial hyperhidrosis is excessive sweating of the face and scalp, often triggered by emotion or heat, and can cause significant social and psychological distress [^114QpaMp]. Diagnosis is clinical, with the **HDSS** and starch-iodine tests aiding severity assessment [^116cu34D]. First-line treatments include topical glycopyrrolate and **botulinum toxin injections** [^114wGVMi]; oral anticholinergics are options for refractory cases, and **endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy** is reserved for severe, treatment-resistant disease [^115qmASq]. Compensatory sweating is the main limitation of surgery, so patients should be counseled accordingly [^1144kEMF].

---

## Clinical features and diagnosis

- **Clinical presentation**: Craniofacial hyperhidrosis presents as excessive sweating of the forehead, scalp, and face, often triggered by emotional stress, anxiety, or heat. It is typically symmetric and episodic, correlating with emotional stimuli [^115JdZ68].

- **Diagnostic criteria**: Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on patient history and physical examination. The Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) is a validated tool used to assess severity and treatment response [^115qmASq].

- **Differential diagnosis**: Secondary causes of hyperhidrosis, such as hyperthyroidism, diabetes, menopause, or medication-induced sweating, must be excluded through appropriate laboratory testing and clinical evaluation [^115JdZ68].

---

## Treatment options

Treatment selection depends on severity, patient preference, and response to previous therapies. A stepwise approach is recommended, starting with less invasive treatments and escalating to more invasive options if necessary [^1131ssMG].

---

### Topical therapies

Among topical therapies, **topical glycopyrrolate** is a first-line anticholinergic that blocks acetylcholine at eccrine glands; it is effective and safe, with minimal systemic absorption and common adverse effects such as dry mouth, blurred vision, and local irritation [^112QkBvo] [^114wGVMi]. Aluminum chloride hexahydrate is an antiperspirant that occludes ducts and is useful for mild cases, though skin irritation is common [^115qmASq].

---

### Botulinum toxin injections

Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) is injected intradermally to inhibit acetylcholine release, providing **high efficacy with a duration of 3–6 months**; repeat injections are required, and temporary muscle weakness or asymmetry may occur [^114t9BSF] [^114g9BsC]. Botulinum toxin type B (BoNT-B) is an alternative when BoNT-A is unavailable or ineffective, with similar efficacy and duration but a higher incidence of dry mouth and muscle weakness [^notfound].

---

### Systemic therapies

Systemic therapies include **oral anticholinergics** (oxybutynin, glycopyrrolate) for refractory cases, but anticholinergic side effects (dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, cognitive effects) limit use; start low and titrate slowly [^112AiwGf] [^113Nqied]. Clonidine, an alpha-2 agonist, is less effective but may be considered for patients who cannot tolerate anticholinergics [^116vKFn5].

---

### Surgical interventions

Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) interrupts the sympathetic chain at T2–T3 and is **highly effective** for severe, refractory craniofacial hyperhidrosis, but compensatory hyperhidrosis (CH) is common and may be severe; clipping allows potential reversal if CH is intolerable [^1156r5qb] [^113JhGMb]. Needlescopic thoracic sympathetic block by clipping is a minimally invasive alternative with reversible outcomes and a lower CH risk, though CH still occurs [^1156r5qb].

---

## Patient-reported outcomes and quality of life

Craniofacial hyperhidrosis significantly impairs quality of life, causing social anxiety, embarrassment, and functional limitations. Effective treatment improves quality of life, with botulinum toxin injections and topical glycopyrrolate demonstrating significant improvements in patient-reported outcomes [^114AUyyJ] [^114t9BSF].

---

## Limitations and side effects of treatments

| **Treatment** | **Limitations/side effects** |
|-|-|
| Topical glycopyrrolate | - Dry mouth <br/> - Blurred vision <br/> - Local irritation [^114bvw4v] |
| Botulinum toxin injections | - Temporary muscle weakness <br/> - Asymmetry <br/> - Pain at injection site <br/> - Repeated injections required [^114wGVMi] |
| Oral anticholinergics | - Dry mouth <br/> - Blurred vision <br/> - Constipation <br/> - Cognitive effects [^116Xe7Zo] |
| ETS | - Compensatory hyperhidrosis <br/> - Horner's syndrome <br/> - Pneumothorax <br/> - Permanent procedure [^1172kBRa] |

## Emerging therapies and research directions

Emerging therapies include topical anticholinergics such as sofpironium bromide, which may offer effective, localized treatment with fewer systemic side effects, and energy-based devices (microwave thermolysis, laser, radiofrequency) that are under investigation for focal hyperhidrosis. Research priorities include evaluating long-term efficacy and safety, comparing treatments, and identifying predictors of response [^111ZWbT6] [^112ji3oz] [^1165fMa4].

---

Craniofacial hyperhidrosis is a chronic condition with **significant psychosocial impact**. Effective management requires a stepwise approach, starting with topical therapies and escalating to **botulinum toxin injections**, systemic medications, or surgery for refractory cases. Compensatory hyperhidrosis remains the **primary limitation** of surgical interventions, necessitating careful patient selection and counseling.

### Treatment of primary craniofacial hyperhidrosis: a systematic review [^114wGVMi]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Primary craniofacial hyperhidrosis (CH) can have a profoundly negative impact on quality of life. No comprehensive review of its management exists.

Objective

The objective of this review is to present the best clinical evidence to guide CH management.

Methods

A systematic review was performed using PRISMA guidelines. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from 1966 to 2014 for articles using the MeSH terms "Hyperhidrosis", "Head", "Neck" and synonymous text words. Inclusion criteria were experimental and observational studies addressing CH treatment. Two reviewers independently assessed study quality and analysed data.

Results

Of 833 references yielded, 27 met inclusion criteria and were analysed. Twenty-two studies evaluated T2 sympathetic ablation (Level III evidence). Outcome measures were subjective and mean follow-up was 29 months. Reported efficacy was high (70–100%), recurrence rates were generally low (0–8%) and complications largely transient (e.g. pneumothorax 0–1%). However, 8–95.4% experienced troubling compensatory sweating. One randomised controlled trial and one observational study evaluated botulinum toxin A (Level Ib and III, respectively). Both employed objective outcome measures and demonstrated similar findings. Efficacy was 100%, lasted a median of 5–6 months and frontalis muscle inhibition was the main adverse effect (50–100%). Three studies evaluated anticholinergic therapy: topical glycopyrrolate demonstrated high efficacy (96%) with minimal adverse effects (Level Ib) and oral oxybutynin demonstrated relatively high efficacy (80–100%) but with noticeable adverse effects (76.6–83.6%) (Level III).

Conclusion

There are few quality studies evaluating CH treatment. Based on available evidence, we recommend topical glycopyrrolate, oral oxybutynin and intradermal botulinum toxin A as first-line therapies due to their efficacy and safety. T2 sympathectomy should be considered for patients refractory to first-line therapy.

### Primary hyperhidrosis in children: a review of therapeutics [^114xhB9j]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperhidrosis, an idiopathic disease that commonly affects the palms, soles, axillae, or craniofacial region, is characterized by perspiration in excess of what is required for physiologic cooling. This disease begins in childhood or adolescence and negatively impacts emotional, physical, and psychologic well-being. This review explores current therapeutic options for primary hyperhidrosis in the pediatric population, including topical therapies, oral therapies, non-surgical and procedural interventions, and adjunctive therapies. In addition, this review identifies new and emerging treatments and highlights the need for further research and therapeutic options for this impactful disease.

### A comprehensive approach to the recognition, diagnosis, and severity-based treatment of focal hyperhidrosis: recommendations of the Canadian hyperhidrosis advisory committee [^116cu34D]. Dermatologic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperhidrosis can have profound effects on a patient's quality of life. Current treatment guidelines ignore disease severity.

Objective

The objective was to establish clinical guidelines for the recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of primary focal hyperhidrosis.

Methods and Materials

A working group of eight nationally recognized experts was convened to develop the consensus statement using an evidence-based approach.

Recommendations

An algorithm was designed to consider both disease severity and location. The Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) provides a qualitative measure that allows tailoring of treatment. Mild axillary, palmar, and plantar hyperhidrosis (HDSS score of 2) should initially be treated with topical aluminum chloride (AC). If the patient fails to respond to AC therapy, botulinum toxin A (BTX-A; axillae, palms, soles) and iontophoresis (palms, soles) should be the second-line therapy. In severe cases of axillary, palmar, and plantar hyperhidrosis (HDSS score of 3 or 4), both BTX-A and topical AC are first-line therapy. Iontophoresis is also first-line therapy for palmar and plantar hyperhidrosis. Craniofacial hyperhidrosis should be treated with oral medications, BTX-A, or topical AC as first-line therapy. Local surgery (axillary) and endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (palms and soles) should only be considered after failure of all other treatment options.

Conclusions

These guidelines offer a rapid method to assess disease severity and to treat primary focal hyperhidrosis according to severity.

Results

Literature Selection and Basic Information

The literature screening process is portrayed in the PRISMA flowchart (Fig. 1). A total of 410 articles were identified upon initial literature search. A total of 134 duplicate entries were recognized and eliminated, resulting in 276 studies. From these, 262 articles were excluded after title and abstract evaluation and six articles were excluded after full-text screening based on given exclusion criteria. In total, eight studies were included in our meta-analysis for final evaluation. A total of 937 patients were comprised in the included studies. All subjects suffered from focal hyperhidrosis affecting the axillae, the craniofacial or the lower limb areas. The treatment modalities employed in the included studies were BTX-A injections in six trials and BTX-B injections in two trials. All analyses were conducted in comparison with placebo injections. Table 1 summarizes the details of the eight eligible studies, respectively.

Overview of the study characteristics

Quality Assessment

All studies were assessed with the help of Cochrane's Collaboration's tool. Allocation concealment was only described in three of the included studies. Other domain assessment revealed a significant bias regarding allocation concealment and selective reporting. Most studies did not allow for complete assessment of reporting bias due to insufficient information provided. Low total risk of bias seemed to be only valid for half of the included studies, aligning with low risk of bias across the remaining domains. A total of three studies were commercially sponsored. Overall, the quality of the included studies was mixed, with only 62.5% of the studies at low risk of bias for attrition. All of the studies included were double-blinded, randomized controlled trials as per our inclusion criteria; however, only five studies delivered sufficient information on the methods implied to grant blinding of personnel and patients. Similarly, outcome reporting bias and random sequence generation have shown to be inconsistent, resulting in a possible influence on the significance of our results. Figures 2 and 3 demonstrate the results of the risk bias assessment.

### Treatment options for hyperhidrosis [^116vKFn5]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is a disorder of excessive sweating beyond what is expected for thermoregulatory needs and environmental conditions. Primary hyperhidrosis has an estimated prevalence of nearly 3% and is associated with significant medical and psychosocial consequences. Most cases of hyperhidrosis involve areas of high eccrine density, particularly the axillae, palms, and soles, and less often the craniofacial area. Multiple therapies are available for the treatment of hyperhidrosis. Options include topical medications (most commonly aluminum chloride), iontophoresis, botulinum toxin injections, systemic medications (including glycopyrrolate and clonidine), and surgery (most commonly endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy [ETS]). The purpose of this article is to comprehensively review the literature on the subject, with a focus on new and emerging treatment options. Updated therapeutic algorithms are proposed for each commonly affected anatomic site, with practical procedural guidelines. For axillary and palmoplantar hyperhidrosis, topical treatment is recommended as first-line treatment. For axillary hyperhidrosis, botulinum toxin injections are recommended as second-line treatment, oral medications as third-line treatment, local surgery as fourth-line treatment, and ETS as fifth-line treatment. For palmar and plantar hyperhidrosis, we consider a trial of oral medications (glycopyrrolate 1–2 mg once or twice daily preferred to clonidine 0.1 mg twice daily) as second-line therapy due to the low cost, convenience, and emerging literature supporting their excellent safety and reasonable efficacy. Iontophoresis is considered third-line therapy for palmoplantar hyperhidrosis; efficacy is high although so are the initial levels of cost and inconvenience. Botulinum toxin injections are considered fourth-line treatment for palmoplantar hyperhidrosis; efficacy is high though the treatment remains expensive, must be repeated every 3–6 months, and is associated with pain and/or anesthesia-related complications. ETS is a fifth-line option for palmar hyperhidrosis but is not recommended for plantar hyperhidrosis due to anatomic risks. For craniofacial hyperhidrosis, oral medications (either glycopyrrolate or clonidine) are considered first-line therapy. Topical medications or botulinum toxin injections may be useful in some cases and ETS is an option for severe craniofacial hyperhidrosis.

### The Society of Thoracic Surgeons expert consensus for the surgical treatment of hyperhidrosis [^114YeJMy]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Significant controversies surround the optimal treatment of primary hyperhidrosis of the hands, axillae, feet, and face. The world's literature on hyperhidrosis from 1991 to 2009 was obtained through PubMed. There were 1,097 published articles, of which 102 were clinical trials. Twelve were randomized clinical trials and 90 were nonrandomized comparative studies. After review and discussion by task force members of The Society of Thoracic Surgeons' General Thoracic Workforce, expert consensus was reached from which specific treatment strategies are suggested. These studies suggest that primary hyperhidrosis of the extremities, axillae or face is best treated by endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS). Interruption of the sympathetic chain can be achieved either by electrocautery or clipping. An international nomenclature should be adopted that refers to the rib levels (R) instead of the vertebral level at which the nerve is interrupted, and how the chain is interrupted, along with systematic pre and postoperative assessments of sweating pattern, intensity and quality-of-life. The recent body of literature suggests that the highest success rates occur when interruption is performed at the top of R3 or the top of R4 for palmar-only hyperhidrosis. R4 may offer a lower incidence of compensatory hyperhidrosis but moister hands. For palmar and axillary, palmar, axillary and pedal and for axillary-only hyperhidrosis interruptions at R4 and R5 are recommended. The top of R3 is best for craniofacial hyperhidrosis.

### The etiology, diagnosis, and management of hyperhidrosis: a comprehensive review: etiology and clinical work-up [^115JdZ68]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperhidrosis (HH) is a dermatologic disorder defined by sweat production exceeding thermoregulatory needs. Clinically, HH is diagnosed when excess sweating creates significant emotional, physical, or social discomfort, causing a negative impact on the patient's quality of life. Existing data imply that this condition may affect at least 4.8% of the US population. The etiology of HH may stem from a complex autonomic nervous system dysfunction, resulting in neurogenic overactivity of otherwise normal eccrine sweat glands. Alternatively, HH may be a result of aberrant central control of emotions. This condition is categorized as primary or secondary HH. Approximately 93% of patients with HH have primary HH, of whom > 90% have a typical focal and bilateral distribution affecting the axillae, palms, soles, and craniofacial areas. Secondary HH presents in a more generalized and asymmetric distribution and is generated by various underlying diseases or medications. Secondary causes of HH need to be excluded before diagnosing primary HH.

Efficacy of BTX Injections

Eight studies describing the effect of BTX injections for the treatment of focal hyperhidrosis were included. The serotype used in given trials differed, with six studies using BTX A and two studies using BTX B with a dose range of 50–200 units and 2.250–20.000 units, respectively. Placebo treatment using 0.9% sodium chloride solution was compared to BTX injections for axillary hyperhidrosis in six studies, for craniofacial and lower limb hyperhidrosis in one study, respectively. We were able to evaluate the following outcome parameters for the comparative meta-analysis with placebo: > 50% sweat reduction from baseline at weeks 2–6 in the gravimetric analysis expressed as risk difference (RD) for axillary hyperhidrosis (RD: 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.51, 0.76], Z = 9.93, P < 0.0001, I² = 83%, five studies) and for craniofacial and lower limb hyperhidrosis (RD: 0.60, 95% CI [0.23, 0.96], Z = 3.21, P < 0.001, I² = 0%, two studies) (Fig. 4); reduction of ≥ 2 points on the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale at week 2–8 expressed as RD (RD: 0.56, 95% CI [0.42, 0.69], Z = 8.16, P < 0.00001, I² = 56%, four studies) (Fig. 5); and mean change in Dermatology Life Quality Index at weeks 2–8 from baseline expressed as mean difference (MD) (MD: − 5.55, 95% CI [− 7.11, − 3.98], Z = 6.95, P < 0.00001, I² = 70%, four studies) (Fig. 6).

### Management of primary focal hyperhidrosis: an algorithmic approach [^112DZkGp]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hyperhidrosis (HH) is defined as perspiration beyond the level required to maintain temperature regulation. HH affects nearly 4.8% of the population in the United States. It can have a great impact on patient&rsquo; s quality of life by disturbing daily activity, performance, confidence, social interactions, and mental health. In the majority of patients with HH (93%), the etiology of excess sweating is idiopathic, which classifies it as primary focal HH. Mild HH may be controlled with topical antiperspirants and lifestyle modifications. Based on the location of involvement, iontophoresis and botulinum toxin may be considered if the patient does not respond to topical therapies. Despite minimizing sweating, chronic use of systemic anticholinergics, in particular oxybutynin, may result in detrimental adverse effects such as dementia. Local surgery, radiofrequency, microwave, and lasers are other potential modalities for HH. Sympathectomy can be a last resort for the treatment of focal HH of the palmar, plantar, axillary, and craniofacial areas after failure of less invasive therapeutic options. In this review, we conducted a comprehensive search in the PubMed electronic database to summarize an algorithmic approach for the treatment of HH. This can help broaden options for managing this difficult disease. J Drugs Dermatol. 20(5): doi:10.36849/JDD.5774.

### Hyperhidrosis: management options [^115qmASq]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is excessive sweating that affects patients' quality of life, resulting in social and work impairment and emotional distress. Primary hyperhidrosis is bilaterally symmetric, focal, excessive sweating of the axillae, palms, soles, or craniofacial region not caused by other underlying conditions. Secondary hyperhidrosis may be focal or generalized, and is caused by an underlying medical condition or medication use. The Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale is a validated survey used to grade the tolerability of sweating and its impact on quality of life. The score can be used to guide treatment. Topical aluminum chloride solution is the initial treatment in most cases of primary focal hyperhidrosis. Topical glycopyrrolate is first-line treatment for craniofacial sweating. Botulinum toxin injection (onabotulinumtoxinA) is considered first- or second-line treatment for axillary, palmar, plantar, or craniofacial hyperhidrosis. Iontophoresis should be considered for treating hyperhidrosis of the palms and soles. Oral anticholinergics are useful adjuncts in severe cases of hyperhidrosis when other treatments fail. Local microwave therapy is a newer treatment option for axillary hyperhidrosis. Local surgery and endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy should be considered in severe cases of hyperhidrosis that have not responded to topical or medical therapies.

### Postmenopausal craniofacial hyperhidrosis treated with botulinum toxin type B [^112h48x8]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperhidrosis can seriously impair patients' quality of life. Medical history, including heredity and hyperhidrosis during youth, as well as current age and time elapsed since menopause, is important to consider when distinguishing between postmenopausal hyperhidrosis and vasomotor symptoms to enable adequate treatment. This report concerns a subgroup of eight postmenopausal patients participating in a randomized controlled trial regarding botulinum toxin (Btx) type B treatment in craniofacial hyperhidrosis. Even though the sample size is small and the enrolment is not yet completed, the promising data collected hitherto are interesting to present in advance because this subtype of craniofacial hyperhidrosis is often underrecognized and challenging to treat. Patients were randomized to receive Btx type B or placebo. Measurements were performed before treatment and 3 ± 1 weeks after. The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score was improved for all patients after Btx type B treatment (n = 3) with a median decrease of 9 points (90% median improvement). The placebo group (n = 5) had a median increase of 2 points (-18% median decline). When the same group (n = 5) received Btx type B (open) the DLQI score decreased with a median of 7 points compared with baseline (91% median improvement). Treatment-related adverse events were temporary and did not prevent improvement of life quality. Furthermore, background data evaluation uncovered interesting findings regarding vasomotor symptoms in relation to postmenopausal hyperhidrosis. In conclusion, the results indicated that Btx type B seems to be a safe and effective treatment in postmenopausal craniofacial hyperhidrosis. Further research is encouraged.

### Primary pediatric hyperhidrosis: a review of current treatment options [^1152Fx5N]. Pediatric Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is a disorder of excessive sweating beyond what is physiologically necessary for thermoregulation. Primary hyperhidrosis is localized; it can affect the axillae, palms, soles, face, and other areas and is idiopathic. The prevalence of hyperhidrosis in the United States is estimated to be 2.8% of the population, with about one-half (1.4%) of these individuals having the axillary form. Hyperhidrosis occurs in both children and adults, with the average age of onset of primary hyperhidrosis being 14–25 years. This disorder can be detrimental to a patient's social, professional, psychological, and physical well-being. Early detection and management can significantly improve a patient's quality of life, yet hyperhidrosis remains widely under diagnosed and under treated, particularly among pediatric patients. The purpose of this article is to review the treatment of pediatric hyperhidrosis, and to increase awareness and inspire further research on this important and often overlooked medical problem.

### Craniofacial hyperhidrosis: clinical characteristics and response to treatment in a cohort of 97 patients treated with oral oxybutynin [^112AiwGf]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

The term craniofacial hyperhidrosis (HH) refers to HH that affects the face and/or scalp. Few studies have focused on this specific location, and even fewer distinguish between the two areas. Our study aims are to describe the clinical characteristics of patients with craniofacial HH, specifying whether the condition affects the scalp, face or both, and to compare these cases with those recorded at other locations. As secondary objectives, we determine the effectiveness and adverse effects of oral oxybutynin (OOx), and assess patients' adherence to treatment. This prospective observational study was carried out with respect to the period 2007–2019. All patients diagnosed with HH of the scalp and/or face and who were treated with OOx at our HH unit were included in the study group. Of 292 patients treated with OOx, 97 (33.2%) had craniofacial HH. Of these, 4 (4.1%) presented HH exclusively on the scalp, 56 (57.7%) exclusively on the face and 37 (38.1%) in both locations. The patients in the latter category (compared with those with exclusively facial HH) were significantly older than the others, had a later onset of HH, a greater frequency of secondary HH, less simultaneous involvement of the classical areas of primary focal HH (the palms, soles, and armpits) and greater generalized HH and of the trunk. No significant differences were observed between the three locations (face, scalp, or both) regarding the efficacy and side effects of OOx. The patients with exclusively facial HH presented greater adherence to treatment.

### Special considerations for children with hyperhidrosis [^113Ko8rX]. Dermatologic Clinics (2014). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis, characterized by excess sweat production, affects children and adults. Primary focal hyperhidrosis affects any anatomic region with sweat appendages present. Primary hyperhidrosis has traditionally been considered a problem for adults, but approximately 1.6% of adolescents and 0.6% of prepubertal children are affected. Psychological and social development and well-being are often affected, leading to profound emotional and social distress. Quality of life can be improved by early diagnosis and therapy; however, underdiagnosis and lack of knowledge regarding therapeutic options has hindered optimization of therapy in the pediatric population. This article reviews the treatment options for hyperhidrosis with a focus on the pediatric population.

### Incorporating diagnosis and treatment of hyperhidrosis into clinical practice [^116zn2Gy]. Dermatologic Clinics (2014). Low credibility.

Proper billing and coding are essential to document the diagnosis of hyperhidrosis and to assure proper reimbursement for treatment. Providers should become familiar with the payment policies of local health plans to streamline the preauthorization process that is often needed for many treatments commonly used for hyperhidrosis. Having a preprinted letter of medical necessity and patient intake forms that record the necessary historical information about the disease, previous treatments, and other pertinent information will help increase the speed of the office flow. This article presents algorithms for treatment of the various forms of primary focal hyperhidrosis.

### Glycopyrronium tosylate in pediatric primary axillary hyperhidrosis: post hoc analysis of efficacy and safety findings by age from two phase three randomized controlled trials [^111yfMsL]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Hyperhidrosis is characterized by excess sweat production beyond what is necessary to maintain thermal homeostasis. In primary hyperhidrosis, idiopathic sympathetic nerve hyperactivity triggers excess sweating, most commonly of the axillae, palms, soles, or craniofacial regions. 1 Hyperhidrosis occurs in children and adults, with ~4.8% of the US population (~15.3 million people) affected. 1, 2 In an online survey of US teens, ~17.1% experienced excessive sweating, with a mean onset age of 11 years. 3 The substantial negative impact of hyperhidrosis on quality of life has been well established 4, 5, 6, 7 and equated as comparable to, or greater than, the impact of psoriasis or eczema. 8 In children, the condition negatively affects psychological and social development and well‐being, which may consequently trigger emotional and social distress. 9

### Setting research priorities for management and treatment of hyperhidrosis: the results of the james lind alliance priority setting partnership [^115mw2bL]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperhidrosis is a common skin condition characterized by abnormal levels of sweating beyond physiological need. Prevalence ranges from 1 to 5% worldwide, and it affects both sexes equally. Hyperhidrosis can be categorized as primary (idiopathic) or secondary to many other conditions. Primary hyperhidrosis often starts in childhood or at puberty, and the most commonly affected areas are hands, feet, underarms, face/head or groin. Hyperhidrosis can have a significant negative impact on quality of life (QoL), causing both physical problems and psychological distress. Many people with hyperhidrosis are embarrassed to seek medical help, and only half ever discuss their condition with a healthcare professional (HCP). When patients with hyperhidrosis do seek medical help, it can be hampered by poor clinical guidelines and a lack of scientific evidence.

A wide range of interventions are available for hyperhidrosis, including topical treatments, injectables, oral anticholinergics and destructive treatments. However, the efficacy of treatments is often limited or they have adverse effects. Compared with other skin disorders of similar prevalence, hyperhidrosis research is less well funded. Currently there are only 9 clinical trials for hyperhidrosis recruiting worldwide, whereas psoriasis, with a similar prevalence, has 193.

Priority setting partnerships (PSPs) enable patients and HCPs to work together as equal partners to identify questions about treatments that are not currently answered by existing research. This PSP aimed to identify and prioritize the Top 10 most important research uncertainties relating to management and treatment of hyperhidrosis, to ensure that funding is directed to the areas of research that matter most to patients and the HCPs who help them.

### The relation between age and outcomes of thoracic sympathectomy for hyperhidrosis: the older the better [^1135cu8L]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Several factors may potentially influence the efficacy and patient satisfaction after bilateral thoracic sympathectomy as the treatment for hyperhidrosis, but few studies have specifically analyzed the impact of age on the efficacy of this treatment, the occurrence of compensatory hyperhidrosis (CH), and variations in the quality of life.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed the effect of age, body mass index, surgical techniques, quality of life before surgery, betterment in the quality of life after surgery, clinical improvement in sweating at the main site, and the occurrence and intensity of CH in patients with hyperhidrosis (n = 1633) who underwent bilateral sympathectomy.

Results

Quality of life improved in more than 90% of patients, and severe CH occurred in 5.4%. Age did not affect these outcomes. The older, the greater reduction in sweating, and CH was linked to other variables (body mass index, craniofacial hyperhidrosis, and level of resection).

Conclusions

We observed that patients with old age reported an improvement in sweating in the main site of hyperhidrosis. Sympathectomy outcomes in older patients are similar to those observed in younger patients in terms of quality of life improvement and occurrence of CH.

### Topical glycopyrrolate for patients with facial hyperhidrosis [^112QkBvo]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Facial hyperhidrosis may negatively impact the quality of life. Although various conservative modalities have been suggested, the condition is not often treated successfully.

Objectives

To examine whether topical glycopyrrolate could be an effective and safe treatment for facial hyperhidrosis.

Methods

Twenty-five patients with facial hyperhidrosis were enrolled and treated with 2% topical glycopyrrolate on one half of the forehead while the other half of the forehead was treated with a placebo.

Results

The sweat production rate of the half of the forehead treated with topical glycopyrrolate was significantly reduced to 37.6 ± 2.8 mg min(-1) (mean ± SEM) compared with 102.2 ± 5.5 mg min(-1) at the placebo-treated half of the forehead (P < 0.001). Patients evaluated their degree of anhidrosis as excellent in six (24%) patients, good in 16 (64%), fair in two (8%) and poor in one (4%). Twenty-four patients (96%) were partially or fully satisfied with their fair to excellent anhidrosis; only one patient (who developed a transient headache after treatment) was dissatisfied with its therapeutic effect. Only seven patients (28%) experienced recurrence within 1 day while 17 patients (68%) had recurrence within 2 days. One patient (4%) remained stable for up to 4 days.

Conclusions

Topical glycopyrrolate application appears to be effective and safe for the treatment of excessive facial sweating in primary craniofacial and secondary gustatory hyperhidrosis following sympathectomy.

### Botulinum toxin for scalp conditions: a systematic review [^1153RMwf]. Dermatologic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Many reports have described the use of botulinum toxin (BTX) in the treatment of scalp conditions, but no studies have synthesized these collective findings.

Objective

We conducted a systematic review to summarize the scalp conditions for which treatment with BTX has been described.

Methods

We searched PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus for articles in English published before November 1, 2022, using the keywords "hair" or "scalp" and BTX-related search terms. Articles that described patients who received injections of BTX for the management of scalp conditions were included.

Results

Twenty-four original articles (12 case reports, 9 clinical trials, and 3 case series) were identified that described 309 patients with a scalp condition treated with BTX. Androgenetic alopecia, craniofacial hyperhidrosis, and scalp hyperseborrhea had the most robust data supporting the clinical efficacy of BTX.

Conclusion

The current quality of evidence is highly variable and, for many conditions, limited to small observational studies. Botulinum toxin may be a promising therapeutic option for patients with various scalp conditions, but future studies are needed to better understand its efficacy and safety.

### Current therapeutic options for treating primary hyperhidrosis [^11258ZTG]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Severe hyperhidrosis can cause extreme embarrassment that may lead to social and professional isolation. Therapeutic strategies to hyperhidrosis should employ the least invasive treatment that provides effective symptom control. The treatment options available for control of hyperhidrosis, non-surgical or surgical, differ in their invasiveness and efficacy. Mechanisms of action of antiperspirants, iontophoresis, cholinergic inhibitor drugs, botulinum toxin, and surgical sympathectomy are reviewed. There is little published evidence in the form of comparative randomised trials to support the use of one treatment over another. However, authors have tended to recommend those therapies that are available to their speciality. Specific therapies should be tailored to the patient's symptoms to gain maximum symptomatic improvement with minimum invasiveness and side-effects. To achieve this, the full range of treatment options should be available to, or accessible by the consulting doctor in order for the patient to have a meaningful choice.

### Diagnosis and management of primary hyperhidrosis: practical guidance and current therapy update [^115Tzit9]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is a chronic medical condition characterized by excessive sweating beyond that which is necessary for thermoregulatory homeostasis. It is estimated to occur in 4.8% of the U.S. population (~15.3 million people) but is both underreported and underdiagnosed. With the busy practitioner and dermatology resident in mind, we provide here a disease state primer for hyperhidrosis, a top-line review of the breadth of literature underscoring the overall burden of the disease, a practical guide to differential diagnosis, and an update on current treatment approaches, including for the most common form of the condition, primary axillary hyperhidrosis. In addition, a case study is presented to provide a real-life perspective from the clinic on the importance of early and effective management strategies for those suffering with hyperhidrosis.

### A review of the etiologies and key clinical features of secondary hyperhidrosis [^1118MAeV]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Secondary hyperhidrosis is a multifactorial condition that poses unique diagnostic and management challenges. Distinguishing secondary from primary hyperhidrosis remains difficult due to overlapping symptoms. This review consolidates existing evidence on the numerous underlying causes and pathophysiologic mechanisms of secondary hyperhidrosis across various disciplines. Secondary hyperhidrosis typically manifests in the fourth decade of life or later, whereas primary hyperhidrosis usually begins earlier. Generalized hyperhidrosis often suggests a secondary cause, though the distribution can vary, including focal symmetric/asymmetric or regional patterns depending on the underlying condition. Key clinical features such as lack of family history and associated symptoms provide additional clues favoring a secondary etiology. Recognizing these distinct characteristics is crucial for accurate differentiation between secondary and primary hyperhidrosis, thereby guiding appropriate evaluation and management of the underlying cause.

### Treatment approaches and outcomes associated with the use of abobotulinumtoxinA for the treatment of hyperhidrosis: a systematic review [^114g9BsC]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Botulinum neurotoxin type A has been used for the treatment of hyperhidrosis.

Objective

To perform a systematic review of the literature to identify evidence on the treatment approaches and outcomes associated with abobotulinumtoxinA (aboBoNT-A) treatment of hyperhidrosis.

Methods

EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library were searched for relevant observational studies, randomized controlled trials, and nonrandomized controlled trials. There were no date or country restrictions. Bibliographies of review articles and recent congress proceedings (2017–2019) were also searched. Articles were screened using predefined eligibility criteria and relevant data were extracted.

Results

Of 191 unique articles identified, 23 were considered relevant (3 observational studies, 10 nonrandomized controlled trials, and 10 randomized controlled trials). These articles provided data on axillary (13), palmar (7), and forehead (1) hyperhidrosis, compensatory hyperhidrosis of the back (1), Frey syndrome (1), and diabetic gustatory sweating (1). All studies reported that aboBoNT-A reduced sweating and no serious adverse events were observed. Patient satisfaction was high and improvements to quality of life were observed after aboBoNT-A treatment.

Limitations

Variability in the injection technique when data were compared across studies.

Conclusion

This study describes a range of treatment approaches and demonstrates positive outcomes of aboBoNT-A treatment for multiple types of hyperhidrosis.

### Resolution of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome after CT-guided, percutaneous T2 ethanol ablation for hyperhidrosis [^112x7X2K]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome is characterized by orthostatic intolerance. Orthostasis (or other mild physical stress) triggers a cascade of inappropriate tachycardia, lightheadedness, palpitations, and often fainting. The underlying defect is sympathetic dysregulation of the heart, which receives its sympathetic tone from the cervical and upper thoracic sympathetic ganglia. Primary hyperhidrosis is also thought to be the result of sympathetic dysregulation. We present the case of a patient treated with CT-guided, percutaneous T2 EtOH sympatholysis for craniofacial hyperhidrosis. The patient also suffered from postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome for many years and was unresponsive to treatment. Immediately after sympatholysis, the patient experienced resolution of both craniofacial hyperhidrosis and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.

### A phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study of 5% sofpironium bromide (BBI-4000) gel in Japanese patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis [^111rkpYQ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hyperhidrosis, a skin disease involving excessive sweating beyond is physiologically required for thermoregulation, is clinically diagnosed when it results in emotional, physical or social distress and impairs patients' quality of life (QOL). 1 Hyperhidrosis can be primary or secondary. Approximately 93% of cases of hyperhidrosis are primary, and more than 90% of cases of primary hyperhidrosis are focal hyperhidrosis affecting the axillae, palms, soles and craniofacial areas. 1 According to an epidemiological study conducted in Japan from 2009 to 2010 (5807 respondents), the prevalence of hyperhidrosis in Japan was 13.95% (810 persons), and 741 persons had primary focal hyperhidrosis. The prevalence of primary axillary hyperhidrosis was 5.75% (334 persons), with a mean onset age of 19.5 years. While 6.3% of patients with primary focal hyperhidrosis, including axillary hyperhidrosis, consulted a physician, 47.8% used non‐antiperspirant deodorants, highlighting the need for an appropriate treatment environment and education of patients. 2

### Type A botulinum toxin: a new treatment for axillary and palmar hyperhidrosis [^111uaHuA]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is an invalidating condition, and one that is difficult to treat. It is characterized by an excessive and uncontrolled production of sweat by the sweat glands, often causing psychological, social, and occupational problems for the patient. Hyperhidrosis can be distinguished in two forms: idiopathic (of unknown etiology), or secondary, due to an alteration of the endocrine system (ex: hyperthyroidism, neuropathy, neoplasia etc.) It is found in about 0.3–0.5% of the population and can be localized (axillary, palmar, plantar, facial) or diffused. The subcutaneous injection of type A botulinum toxin, until now used only for the treatment of blepharospasm or hemifacial spasm, has shown to be a useful treatment for localized hyperhidrosis. The objective of the authors is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy, safety, and management of botulinum toxin treatment in patients affected with axillary or palmar hyperhidrosis resistant to conventional therapies.

### Impact of hyperhidrosis on quality of life and its assessment [^113QsW62]. Dermatologic Clinics (2014). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is an embarrassing condition that may interfere with routine activities, cause emotional distress, and disturb both professional and social lives of patients. Objective examination is variable and unreliable, so efforts have been made in the last 15 years to substantiate the limitations of these patients, especially in primary focal hyperhidrosis. Almost all therapeutic studies use standardized or self-designed instruments to evaluate the impact of the disease on quality of life and the improvement achieved by treatment. This article gives an overview of the difficulties with which patients with hyperhidrosis are confronted and of research investigating the restrictions.

### Setting research priorities for management and treatment of hyperhidrosis: the results of the james lind alliance priority setting partnership [^116uoV7r]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Hyperhidrosis is a common skin condition characterized by excessive sweating, which can negatively impact on quality of life. It is under‐researched compared with other conditions of similar prevalence.

Aim

To generate a Top 10 list of research priorities for the treatment and management of hyperhidrosis, with equal input from people with hyperhidrosis and healthcare professionals (HCPs).

Methods

A priority setting partnership (PSP) was established and processes from the James Lind Alliance Handbook were followed. An online survey asked participants what questions they would like research to answer. These questions were grouped into 'indicative questions', which were ranked in a second survey of 45 indicative questions. The top 23 questions were then taken to a final workshop event attended by key stakeholders, and ranked to generate the Top 10 list of research priorities.

Results

There were 592 questions submitted by 268 respondents for the first survey. For the second survey, 286 participants ranked the indicative questions in order of priority. At the final workshop, the Top 10 list was generated. The top three priorities were: (i) Are there any safe and effective permanent solutions for hyperhidrosis? (ii) What is the most effective and safe oral treatment (drugs taken by mouth) for hyperhidrosis? and (iii) What are the most effective and safe ways to reduce sweating in particular areas of the body?

Conclusions

There are many unanswered research questions that both people with hyperhidrosis and HCPs would like to see answered. The results from this PSP will help to ensure future research funding can be directed to these areas of priority.

### Endoscopic thoracic sympathotomy for primary hyperhidrosis: predictors of outcome over a 10-year period [^113JhGMb]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy/sympathotomy is gold standard of treatment for primary hyperhidrosis. Compensatory hyperhidrosis following surgery and partial response to surgery in some patients can significantly affect surgery outcome and patient satisfaction. In this study we investigated predictors of success rate, side effects, and satisfaction of our patients following ETS over a 10-year period.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed result of 200 Endoscopic thoracic sympathotomy surgeries that was performed in a single center to treat craniofacial, palmar, or axillary primary hyperhidrosis over a 10-year period. Patients were asked to report success of surgery to resolve their primary hyperhidrosis, development of compensatory hyperhidrosis, its severity, and their overall satisfaction with surgery.

Results

Palmar hyperhidrosis was resolved in 167 (94%) patients. Craniofacial hyperhidrosis was resolved in 66 (84%) patients. Axillary hyperhidrosis was resolved in 68 (50%) patients. Compensatory hyperhidrosis developed in 176 (88%) patients. 44 (22%) patients had mild CHH, 79 (40%) patients developed moderate CHH, and 52 (26%) patients experienced severe CHH. A total of 173 (87%) patients were satisfied with surgery. 19 (9%) patients were not satisfied with ETS and 8 (4%) patients regretted ETS. Lower body mass index and grade IV primary hyperhidrosis were found to be independent predictors of patient satisfaction. Pure axillary primary hyperhidrosis was a negative predictor of patient satisfaction.

Conclusion

Best results of ETS are achieved in patients with grade IV PHH and lower body mass indexes. Outcome of ETS for treating axillary PHH is not favorable.

### Postmenopausal craniofacial hyperhidrosis [^1167cdGG]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is a condition marked by excessive sweating, which can either be localized or generalized. Primary focal hyperhidrosis (PFH) can arise from the palms, plantar feet, axillae and also from the face and scalp. PFH primarily affects a younger population of children and young adults, with the majority presenting before the age of 25 years. We report a distinct subtype of craniofacial hyperhidrosis in 20 postmenopausal women; this subtype is often under-recognized.

### Setting research priorities for management and treatment of hyperhidrosis: the results of the james lind alliance priority setting partnership [^1165fMa4]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This PSP has highlighted the lack of evidence currently available for the treatment and management of hyperhidrosis.

The highest priority on the list was 'Are there any safe and permanent solutions for hyperhidrosis?'. This could be answered by further work on current permanent solutions (e.g. surgery and microwave techniques); however, participants also indicated a desire for research into new treatments. The seventh priority, 'Could targeted therapies or biologics (e.g. antibodies, hormones and stem cells), be effective in treating hyperhidrosis?' reflects the appetite for new treatments.

Other priorities focus on whether surgery and oral treatments are effective and safe. These questions have either not been answered due to a lack of high‐quality systematic review and meta‐analysis or, more commonly, due to a lack of quality randomized clinical trials (RCTs) from which to draw data. This highlights the need for funding for more RCTs to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of treatments. A Cochrane review of hyperhidrosis was prioritized by Cochrane Skinand began in July 2021. It will attempt to answer some of the Top 10 questions, and is likely to emphasize the areas where trials are lacking.

Participants also prioritized research questions about treatments for particular areas of the body or particular life stages, and the impact of hyperhidrosis on QoL. A lack of parity over access to treatments in different areas of the UK also led to the prioritization of a question about the most effective severity scale that can be used to determine if a person is eligible for hyperhidrosis treatment; this would also have relevance in other countries with government‐funded healthcare systems.

Outside of the Top 10, there are many other important research questions to be answered, particularly in relation to the management of the condition through lifestyle changes, such as diet, exercise, clothing and footwear.

A strength of the PSP was that it had excellent support from patient groups and clinical networks, which enabled the steering group to share the surveys widely. Another strength was that all of the research questions were included in the list of indicative questions that went forward to the interim priority stage, rather than limiting the list to a selection, as has been necessary in some previous PSPs that generated very large numbers of responses. This ensured that all voices were heard and able to be part of the priority setting.

### Botulinum toxin versus placebo: a meta-analysis of treatment and quality-of-life outcomes for hyperhidrosis [^114Ztfj7]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our data suggest that BTX effectively yields superior results for patients with hyperhidrosis in terms of subjective and quantitative analysis compared to placebo. However, the limited quality of evidence needs to be considered.

Despite there being no gold standard in the treatment of hyperhidrosis, the current therapy scheme advocated recommends the use of BTX after the failure of conventional therapy. However, given its significant anhidrotic superiority over placebo injections, initial BTX treatment may be a good option in clinically severe cases in order to improve treatment response and to avoid unwarranted patient dissatisfaction. General downsides to consider in comparison with treatment alternatives would be discomfort as a result of injection-pain and substantially higher treatment costs.

### Oxybutynin in primary hyperhidrosis: a long-term real-life study [^113Nqied]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is a condition of excessive sweating beyond physiological parameters that can seriously impair quality of life. This study aims to evaluate the oral oxybutynin effectiveness in hyperhidrosis, besides its tolerance and safety. In a real-life long-term study, 30 patients with primary hyperhidrosis and Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) with score of at least two were submitted to a questionnaire to assess demographic data, HDSS and side effects of oxybutynin. Most patients were women (n = 23, 76.7%), median age was 40years (range 12–70, SD 17.5) and 17(56.7%) had family history of hyperhidrosis. The most common hyperhidrosis form was axillary (n = 15, 50.0%), followed by palmoplantar (n = 8, 26.7%), cranio-facial (n = 11, 36.7%) and trunk (n = 5, 16.7%). Median duration of treatment was 2.4years (range 1–6years, SD 1.3). Thus, all patients used oxybutynin for at least 1 year, 30% for 2years, 20% 3years, 17% 4years, and 3% 6years. There was a significant improvement in HDSS score of patients (P < .001). This real life study suggests that oxybutynin is effective and safe for treatment of hyperhidrosis, both in children and adults, with mild and tolerable side effects, with significant improvement in HDSS.

### Botulinum toxin types A and B: comparison of efficacy, duration, and dose-ranging studies for the treatment of facial rhytides and hyperhidrosis [^117UHpWj]. Clinics in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

One of the most common etiologic forces for the persistence of facial rhytides is the repetitive contraction of the intrinsic muscles that are necessary for facial expression. These include the forehead lines, crow's feet, glabellar rhytides, and wrinkles in the lower face. Although filling agents such as collagen and laser procedures can help reduce the appearance of these lines, they do not address the underlying forces that cause these wrinkles to persist. Botulinum toxin type-A and type-B are neurotoxins that address these issues and result in the relaxation of the intrinsic facial muscles and subsequent resolution of these dynamic facial rhytides. This article will compare the efficacy, duration, dose ranging studies, and safety in the treatment of facial rhytides with both types of toxins. In addition, the treatment of hyperhidrosis with type-A and type-B botulinum toxin will also be discussed.

### Update on pediatric hyperhidrosis [^1136TzAD]. Dermatologic Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is a common and under-recognized disease in the pediatric population that has a significant impact on quality of life. Focal and generalized forms of hyperhidrosis exist, which can be idiopathic or secondary to underlying medical conditions or medications. Treatment is tailored to the specific patient needs, characteristics and goals. These include topical preparations, iontophoresis, botulinum toxin and anticholinergic medications.

### Botulinum toxin versus placebo: a meta-analysis of treatment and quality-of-life outcomes for hyperhidrosis [^111rZ7Zv]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperhidrosis is a chronic pathological disorder that is marked by excessive sweating beyond that which is required to maintain the body's physiologic homeostatic thermoregulation. The underlying mechanism is based on the overstimulation of cholinergic receptors of eccrine glands, which are highly concentrated in areas such as the palms, soles, axillae and face. With an estimated prevalence of approximately 3%, idiopathic primary hyperhidrosis per definition shows a bilateral and symmetric pattern in one or several sites of predilection, occurs more than once weekly with consequent disruptions of daily activities, is absent nocturnally, lasts at least for 6 months and typically manifests during puberty and adolescence. In contrast, secondary hyperhidrosis is linked to underlying medical conditions, including endocrine or metabolic disorders and malignancies, and the intake of systemic medications such as psychotropic agents or steroids. In addition to the confirmation of diagnosis derived by clinical evaluation, it can be supported by quantitative sweat production analysis (gravimetry) and iodine starch testing. Hyperhidrosis can significantly impair patients' psychosocial quality of life and be a long-term source of detrimental emotional and physical distress.

Several different therapeutic modalities, surgical and non-surgical, have been established, ranging from topical medications, systemic agents, iontophoresis and endoscopic sympathectomy, with a variable response to available regimens depending on the site of treatment. Similarly, radiofrequency thermotherapy and fractional microneedle radiofrequency have emerged in recent years as alternative treatment modalities. Attempts to reduce the severity and impairment of quality-of-life by hyperhidrosis with given treatment options have had mixed results. First-line non-surgical options such as topical antiperspirants, e.g. aluminum chloride, often tend to alleviate symptoms only short-term, lack effectiveness in sweat reduction, necessitate regular reapplication and often cause secondary dermal skin conditions. Surgical measures, such as endoscopic sympathectomies or sweat gland excisions, are comparatively invasive and bear a high risk for major complications such as wound healing impairment and infections, and often require additional resources such as anesthesia. Accordingly, the optimal treatment agent resulting in ameliorated patient satisfaction would be non-surgical and effective in the long run without the downsides of dermal complications.

### Topical glycopyrronium tosylate in Japanese patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis: a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study [^117MyJB1]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Hyperhidrosis is a skin disorder characterized by excess sweating at a level more than required to maintain normal body temperature. Primary hyperhidrosis is idiopathic, caused by overactive sympathetic nerves, and involves a limited body area, most often the axillae, palms, soles, or craniofacial region. Primary axillary hyperhidrosis affects approximately 5.75% of Japanese children and adults, which is much higher than the prevalence in the United States (1.4%). Patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis usually experience excess underarm sweating, and the disease presents bilaterally with often other body regions also affected. The condition also negatively impacts patient quality of life (QOL) by reducing work productivity and affecting mental health. Despite its high prevalence, significant symptoms, and impact on QOL, most sufferers do not seek medical treatment or wait for a few years before seeking medical help, likely because of the insufficient recognition of primary axillary hyperhidrosis as an intractable and potentially disabling disease with limited treatment options available. In a recent study, the clinical efficacy and safety of a topical cholinergic antagonist, sofpironium bromide, were demonstrated.

Glycopyrronium tosylate (GT) is a competitive inhibitor of acetylcholine receptors, which are expressed in various peripheral tissues, including the sweat glands. GT 3.75% was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018 as a topical anticholinergic drug for primary axillary hyperhidrosis in patients ≥ 9 years of age. However, clinical data for the use of GT in Japanese patients have not been reported.

We developed two doses (2.5% and 3.75%) of a new GT formulation (cloth) with a different ethanol concentration for use in Japan. In this phase II/III study, the efficacy and safety of GT cloth were evaluated in Japanese patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis.

### Systemic therapy for primary hyperhidrosis: a retrospective study of 59 patients treated with glycopyrrolate or clonidine [^116emXAB]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Data regarding systemic medications in the management of hyperhidrosis (HH) are limited.

Objective

The goal of this study was to provide evidence for the safety and efficacy of systemic medications for primary HH.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients seen at an academic dermatology department prescribed systemic medications for primary HH.

Results

A total of 71 patients were prescribed systemic agents. Twelve patients (17%) were lost to follow-up and were excluded from further analysis. A total of 59 patients with at least 2 months of follow-up data (mean age 28.9 ± 12.0 years; 37 women, 22 men; mean follow-up 19.5 months) were included in the analysis. Palmoplantar and/or axillary HH was most common (42/59; 71%); followed by generalized (9/59; 15%) and craniofacial (8/59; 14%) HH. Glycopyrrolate (generally 1–2 mg once or twice daily) was prescribed to 45 patients, with response rate of 67% (30/45). Fifteen treatment failures included 6 nonresponders and 9 with adverse effects, including xerostomia and gastrointestinal disturbance. Clonidine (0.1 mg twice daily) was prescribed to 13 patients, with a response rate of 46% (6/13). Seven treatment failures included 3 nonresponders and 4 with adverse effects, all relating to decreased blood pressure. One patient responded to oxybutynin at 5 mg twice daily. There were no significant differences in efficacy (P = 0.21; odds ratios 0.43, 95% confidence interval 0.12–1.5) or adverse effects (P = 0.46; odds ratios 1.78, 95% confidence interval 0.44–7.1) in comparing glycopyrrolate versus clonidine.

Limitations

This was a retrospective study from a single, university-based population.

Conclusion

Systemic therapy with glycopyrrolate or clonidine can be effective for HH. Nearly two-thirds responded to therapy, and less than a quarter had treatment-limiting adverse effects, all of which were self-limited and nonserious.

### Therapeutic hotline: topical glycopyrrolate: a successful treatment for craniofacial hyperhidrosis and eccrine hidrocystomas [^1139mmR4]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Eccrine hidrocystoma is a benign tumor derived from eccrine sudoriparous glands. Most eccrine hidrocystomas are solitary and asymptomatic lesions. Multiple hidrocystomas are unusual and have been associated with Graves' disease, Parkinson's disease, and idiopathic craniofacial hyperhidrosis. This report describes the successful treatment of multiple center facial eccrine hidrocystomas associated with craniofacial hyperhidrosis with 0.5% glycopyrrolate aqueous solution applied locally for 1 week. The present authors obtained a very significant improvement without leaving any trace of clinical examination. Multiple eccrine hidrocystomas are a rare condition and, to date, no effective treatment has been reported. Topical glycopyrrolate is a very good first-line treatment option.

### Botulinum toxin-B and the management of hyperhidrosis [^116PTx8J]. Clinics in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

A new serotype of botulinum toxin has recently arrived in the US. Botulinum toxin type B (BTX-B), known as Myobloc in the United States and as Neurobloc in Europe, is one of seven different antigenic members of the botulinum toxin family, five of which the human nervous system is susceptible to. Like botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A), BTX-B has been used for a myriad of both dermatologic and nondermatologic problems since its recent approval by the FDA for the treatment of cervical dystonia in December 2000. It is currently not approved however, for a cosmetic use but has been used for this purpose in an "off-label" fashion. It has followed in the therapeutic footsteps of BTX-A in the prevention and treatment of facial wrinkles such as crow's feet and glabellar frown lines. In addition, one of its current and popular uses is in the management of hyperhidrosis, a disease in search of a long needed treatment. This past year researchers have been investigating the efficacy as well as defining the dosing and application regiments of BTX-B in the treatment of hyperhidrosis. In addition, recent studies have been examining its side effect profile, which may be very different than that seen with BTX-A. There are only a handful of studies in the literature examining the cosmetic applications of BTX-B. This chapter will review what is currently known about BTX-B and its current use in regards to the treatment of hyperhidrosis.

### Needlescopic thoracic sympathetic block by clipping for craniofacial hyperhidrosis: an analysis of 28 cases [^1156r5qb]. Surgical Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy or sympathicotomy of the lower part of the stellate ganglion is an efficient method for the treatment of craniofacial hyperhidrosis, but postoperative compensatory sweating may be troublesome in some patients. Needlescopic thoracic sympathetic block by clipping may achieve a similar effect as well as providing a possible reverse operation for patients who suffer from intolerable postoperative compensatory sweating.

Methods

Between January 1998 and June 2000, we collected a total of 28 patients with craniofacial hyperhidrosis. There were 15 men and 13 women with a mean age of 39.2 years (ranges, 19–50). All patients were placed under single-lumen intubated anesthesia in a semisitting position. Two ports were needed. We used a 2-mm 0 degrees thoracoscope and endo clips to perform a sympathetic block by clipping the lower third of the stellate ganglion at the second intercostal space.

Results

The operation was usually accomplished within 20 min (ranges, 15–30). All patients were discharged within 4 h after the operation. There were no surgical complications or surgical mortality cases. All patients achieved improvement of craniofacial hyperhidrosis without recurrent symptoms after a mean of 25.3 months (range, 12–41) of follow-up. Twenty-five patients (85.7%) developed compensatory sweating of the trunk and lower limbs. One of these patients could not tolerate this postoperative sweating; he therefore underwent a reverse operation and obtained improvement of the compensatory sweating 18 days after removal of the endo clips.

Conclusion

Needlescopic thoracic sympathetic block by clipping is a safe and effective method for the treatment of craniofacial hyperhidrosis; compensatory sweating may be improved after a reverse operation and removal of the endo clips.

### The etiology, diagnosis, and management of hyperhidrosis: a comprehensive review: therapeutic options [^1131ssMG]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperhidrosis (HH) is a chronic disorder of excess sweat production that may have a significant adverse effect on quality of life. A variety of treatment modalities currently exist to manage HH. Initial treatment includes lifestyle and behavioral recommendations. Antiperspirants are regarded as the first-line therapy for primary focal HH and can provide significant benefit. Iontophoresis is the primary remedy for palmar and plantar HH. Botulinum toxin injections are administered at the dermal-subcutaneous junction and serve as a safe and effective treatment option for focal HH. Oral systemic agents are reserved for treatment-resistant cases or for generalized HH. Energy-delivering devices such as lasers, ultrasound technology, microwave thermolysis, and fractional microneedle radiofrequency may also be utilized to reduce focal sweating. Surgery may be considered when more conservative treatments have failed. Local surgical techniques, particularly for axillary HH, include excision, curettage, liposuction, or a combination of these techniques. Sympathectomy is the treatment of last resort when conservative treatments are unsuccessful or intolerable, and after accepting secondary compensatory HH as a potential complication. A review of treatment modalities for HH and a sequenced approach are presented.

### Long-term assessment of percutaneous stereotactic thermocoagulation of upper thoracic ganglionectomy and sympathectomy for palmar and craniofacial hyperhidrosisin 1742 cases [^113zqSyJ]. Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to determine the long-term outcome of percutaneous stereotactic thermocoagulation for upper thoracic ganglionectomy and sympathectomy in patients with palmar and craniofacial hyperhidrosis with the use of a three-dimensional system of coordinates for the location of the T2 and T3 ganglia on the basis of the findings in a cadaveric study.

Methods

From November 1986 to May 1998, upper thoracic ganglionectomy and sympathectomy with the use of percutaneous stereotactic thermocoagulation were performed in 1688 patients with palmar hyperhidrosis and 54 patients with craniofacial hyperhidrosis as outpatient surgical procedures based on a three-dimensional coordinate system for determining the location of the thermocoagulation point, which was developed by the authors in a cadaveric study. The technique requires only local anesthesia.

Results

After initial thermocoagulation, sweating stopped in 3465 (99.5%) of 3484 sides. Hyperhidrosis recurred within 2 to 59 months of treatment in 268 procedures. All patients in whom hyperhidrosis recurred were retreated successfully, resulting in a final success rate of 99.9%. Complications of treatment included pneumothorax in seven procedures (0.2%) and partial Horner's syndrome in five procedures (0.15%). Decreased plantar sweating was noted during follow-up in 92% of patients.

Conclusion

The results of this study indicate that upper thoracic ganglionectomy and sympathectomy performed with the use of percutaneous thermocoagulation are a very effective treatment for palmar and craniofacial hyperhidrosis that provides excellent immediate and long-term results as well as a low complication rate. The method is also effective as a retreatment for recurrences. Our data also suggest that performing ganglionectomy and sympathectomy in both T2 and T3 is unnecessary, because the procedure had equal long-term effectiveness when performed in T2 alone.

### Thoracoscopic sympathectomy for hyperhidrosis: analysis of 642 procedures with special attention to Horner's syndrome and compensatory hyperhidrosis [^116XkCQR]. Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperhidrosis (HH) profoundly affects a patient's well-being.

Objective

We report indications and outcomes of 322 patients treated for HH via thoracoscopic sympathectomy or sympathotomy at the Barrow Neurological Institute.

Methods

A prospectively maintained database of all patients who underwent sympathectomy or sympathotomy between 1996 and 2008 was examined. Additional follow-up was obtained in clinic, by phone, or by written questionnaire.

Results

A total of 322 patients (218 female patients) had thoracoscopic treatment (mean age 27.6 years; range, 10–60 years). Mean follow-up was 8 months. Presentations included HH of the palms (43 patients, 13.4%), axillae (13 patients, 4.0%), craniofacial region (4 patients, 1.2%), or some combination (262 patients, 81.4%). Sympathectomy and sympathotomy were equally effective in relieving HH. Palmar HH resolved in 99.7% of patients. Axillary or craniofacial HH resolved or improved in 89.1% and 100% of cases, respectively. Hospital stay averaged 0.5 days. Ablating the sympathetic chain at T5 increased the incidence of severe compensatory sweating (P = 0.0078). Sympathectomy was associated with a significantly higher incidence of Horner's syndrome compared with sympathotomy (5% vs 0.9%, P = 0.0319). Patients reported satisfaction and willingness to undergo the procedure again in 98.1% of cases.

Conclusion

Thoracoscopic sympathectomy is effective and safe treatment for severe palmar, axillary, and craniofacial HH. Ablating the T5 ganglion tends to increase the severity of compensatory sweating. Sympathectomy led to a higher incidence of ipsilateral Horner's syndrome compared with sympathotomy.

### Inguinal hyperhidrosis in a patient with a mildly elevated autonomic symptom score being misdiagnosed as urinary incontinence [^114sHvUz]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary focal hyperhidrosis is a common disorder resulting in sweat in excess of physiologic needs affecting approximately 15 million individuals or up to 4.8% of the general U.S. population. Hyperhidrosis not only occurs in the axillae, palms, soles, and craniofacial areas but also affects the inguinal region or groin. Inguinal sweating can be debilitating and result in profound anxiety, social life impact, and mental exhaustion. We describe a case of inguinal hyperhidrosis, where the severity and rapidity of onset of the hyperhidrosis led to multiple misdiagnoses, unnecessary treatments, and patient anxiety. An innovative diagnostic method, conceived by the patient herself, achieved the correct diagnosis.

### Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy [^113eEPnc]. Dermatologic Clinics (2014). Low credibility.

Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy is a surgical technique most commonly used in the treatment of severe palmar hyperhidrosis in selected patients. The procedure also has limited use in the treatment axillary and craniofacial hyperhidrosis. Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy is associated with a high rate of the development of compensatory hyperhidrosis, which may affect patient satisfaction with the procedure and quality of life.

### Over a decade of single-center experience with thoracoscopic sympathicolysis for primary palmar hyperhidrosis: a case series [^117Xgvcx]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

One of the problems of comparability of studies is that a multitude of different techniques have been used. Not only do different surgeons treat different levels of the sympathetic chain (an overview of the levels is given in Table 2), but different modalities of sympathicolysis or sympathectomy are being employed, ranging from transection, resection, clipping, as well as chemical or CO 2 -laser ablation. In our center, the described technique has produced exceedingly good results, is reproducible and easy to perform. In 2011, an expert consensus was published, noting that interruption of the sympathetic chain should be achieved either by electrocautery (as performed in our center) or clipping. Also, disruption just cranial to the third rib produces the highest success rate in treating primary palmar and craniofacial hyperhidrosis. In another systematic review, the authors found that T2-free interventions lowered the risk of Horner's syndrome without compromising efficacy. However, these conclusions are all based on retrospective reports, mainly in the adult population, and should be validated in prospective controlled trials.

Besides its retrospective data acquisition, the main limitation of our study is the non-validated assessment of postoperative satisfaction. Unfortunately, this is common among the other referenced studies listed in our systematic review (Table 2). It makes comparability difficult, although the numbers reported are surprisingly congruent. Overall, the satisfaction rates after the procedure seem to be almost universally high, irrespective of the technique employed or the target levels on the sympathetic chain. Unfortunately, we lost 4 of the 102 patients to follow-up. Several attempts were made to contact these respective patients and families by telephone, mail, and by a search through the social security system. Unfortunately, they had moved away without any follow-up information. The relatively high follow-up quota of 96% (98 of 102 patients) is most likely associated with the geographic circumstances of the Canary islands, in which the population tends to be confined to one island and remains relatively stable and accessible.

### Botulinum toxin versus placebo: a meta-analysis of treatment and quality-of-life outcomes for hyperhidrosis [^11497rLy]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Data Extraction

Data extraction was performed independently by two researchers (DO and MS) and comprised: the first author, publication year, characteristics of the trial, study period, number of total and subgroup patients enrolled, demographics (age, sex, country), localization of hyperhidrosis, treatment regimen and dosage, BTX manufacturer, treatment duration and discontinuation and the study results. Again, conflicting data extractions were discussed and adjusted upon agreement.

Assessment of Quality

All of the included studies were randomized controlled trials, and their quality was independently weighed by two reviewers (DO and MS) employing the Cochrane Collaboration's tool, which allows for the evaluation of risk bias (low, high or unclear) of six particular domains comprising randomization, blinding of subjects and outcome assessors, possible sources of bias, allocation concealment, reporting of incomplete outcome data or selective outcome reporting.

Statistical Analysis

We performed a meta-analysis of the data from a total of eight included studies using RevMan 5.3 software (Review Manager (RevMan), Version 5.3. Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration 2014). To evaluate the risk difference in dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference in continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals in forest plots, the random effects model through the Mantel–Haenszel estimator was chosen due to the various populations' origins. The studies' heterogeneity was evaluated with the I 2 statistic and the Chi-squared test. I 2 values > 50% implied significant heterogeneity. Additional subgroup analyses were conducted to identify potential sources of heterogeneity. Meta-regressions and further subgroup analyses were not considered due to the small number of included studies.

### Treatment of hyperhidrosis: an update [^111Fd3ou]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is a dermatosis presenting as pathologically excessive focal or generalized sweating. The stigmatizing nature of hyperhidrosis may cause patients to feel embarrassment and apprehension about their symptoms and experience a significant decrease in well-being. Severe cases of hyperhidrosis can also increase the risk of developing psychiatric and somatic comorbidities. Conventional non-surgical treatments of hyperhidrosis include aluminum salts, iontophoresis, botulinum toxin injections, and oral glycopyrronium. In recent years, new topical anticholinergic medications and devices have emerged that may improve the patients' symptoms and even prevent the development of comorbidities. The treatment of hyperhidrosis can be a complex matter and may require the combination of several therapies. The purpose of this paper was to firstly review the literature on existing non-surgical treatment options for hyperhidrosis, and secondly provide a stepwise approach to investigating and treating patients with hyperhidrosis.

### Setting research priorities for management and treatment of hyperhidrosis: the results of the james lind alliance priority setting partnership [^117XGdKh]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Steering group

A steering group was set up, comprising people with hyperhidrosis, a representative of the Hyperhidrosis UK support group, HCPs and academics, and chaired by an advisor from the James Lind Alliance. The group set the terms of reference, scope and protocol of the projected, and monitored progress throughout the various stages (Fig. 1). Established methods and best practice from the James Lind Alliance Guidebook were used.

Figure 1
The Hyperhidrosis Priority Setting Partnership prioritization process.

Gathering uncertainties

An initial survey was administered online via SurveyMonkey®, which was open for 14 weeks. Participants aged ≥ 16 years, with hyperhidrosis of any severity, who were self‐diagnosed or diagnosed by an HCP, were sought via the Hyperhidrosis UK website and social media. HCPs were targeted via professional groups and societies. All contacted participants consented to take part in the PSP. The survey asked participants to suggest any questions about the treatment and management of hyperhidrosis that they would like to see answered by research, or where they felt there was uncertainty about the treatment or management of the condition. Demographic data was also collected to ensure a spread of participants from all backgrounds. This was reviewed part way through the open period, so that advertising could be targeted towards any groups that were under‐represented.

Following the initial survey responses, the steering group reviewed all submitted questions and removed any that were out of the scope of the project. Repeated or very similar questions were grouped together, and an indicative question formed to represent them (Table 1). Once the indicative questions were agreed, databases including the Cochrane Library and MEDLINE were searched to look for systematic reviews about hyperhidrosis treatments and management. A question was considered to be an 'uncertainty' if there was no systematic review to answer it, or if a systematic review concluded that an uncertainty existed.

### A phase III, 52-week, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 5% sofpironium bromide (BBI-4000) gel in Japanese patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis [^114r14su]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Hyperhidrosis, a skin disease involving excessive sweating beyond what is physiologically required for thermoregulation, is clinically diagnosed when excessive sweating results in emotional, physical, or social distress and impairs patients' quality of life (QOL). Hyperhidrosis can be primary or secondary. Approximately 93% of cases of hyperhidrosis are primary, and more than 90% of cases of primary hyperhidrosis are focal hyperhidrosis affecting the axillae, palms, soles, and craniofacial areas. According to an epidemiological study conducted in Japan from 2009 to 2010 (5807 respondents), the prevalence of primary axillary hyperhidrosis was 5.75% (334 persons), with a mean onset age of 19.5 years.

Primary axillary hyperhidrosis is a refractory disease that not only limits daily and social activities, but also causes psychological or emotional distress to the patients. In addition, this disease interferes with daily activities of the patients because of need for frequent changes of clothes or showers, with limited choice of clothing. Primary axillary hyperhidrosis is also characterized by a very high prevalence in the socially active and productive generation. This disease often manifests in puberty and adolescence and persists for the rest of life, requiring long‐term treatment unless curatively treated with, for instance, surgical therapy.

Sofpironium bromide (BBI‐4000) is a muscarinic acetylcholine, M3 receptor ligand that resembles anticholinergic glycopyrronium bromide in chemical structure and has been developed as a retrometabolically designed drug with ethyl ester residue. It is considered that sofpironium bromide has a high binding affinity for the M3 acetylcholinergic receptor at the local site of administration, but is hydrolyzed at the ester linkage to less active metabolites upon entry into blood. Therefore, sofpironium bromide is expected to be effective in reducing sweating in primary axillary hyperhidrosis and to be associated with fewer systemic anticholinergic adverse drug reactions (ADRs) compared to the parent drug, glycopyrronium.

### Intradermal botulinum toxin A injection versus topical 2% glycopyrrolate for the treatment of primary facial hyperhidrosis: a pilot study and review of literature [^114AUyyJ]. Dermatologic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Facial hyperhidrosis (HH), a common problem with both cosmetic and psychological impact, interferes with quality of life. Wide range of treatment options is available for HH. Finding the most effective and yet a safe, tolerable option is the main target.

Objective

To evaluate and compare clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of topical 2% glycopyrrolate versus intradermal Botulinum toxin A injection in facial HH treatment.

Materials and Methods

Twenty-four patients with primary facial HH were randomly divided into 2 equal groups: Group A included patients treated by intradermal Botulinum toxin A injection and Group B included patients treated by topical glycopyrrolate gel 2%. Starch iodine test was performed before and after treatment to assess response, along with Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and patient satisfaction.

Results

Both modalities showed complete response in 75% of cases with a longer duration of action in botulinum toxin group up to 6 months. Side effects were minor and temporary. Both Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale and DLQI showed statistically significant improvement after treatment.

Conclusion

Topical glycopyrrolate 2% showed comparable results to Botulinum toxin A in facial HH treatment with faster onset but shorter duration of action.

### Oral medications [^116jzJ6P]. Dermatologic Clinics (2014). Low credibility.

Primary hyperhidrosis commonly affects the axillae, palms, soles, scalp, face, and groin. Patients may have multiple areas involved making localized therapy challenging. Systemic therapy may be necessary and can be used as monotherapy or combined with other hyperhidrosis treatments for optimal outcomes. Systemic therapy can also be used to treat secondary hyperhidrosis and compensatory hyperhidrosis.

### Single-port one-stage bilateral thoracoscopic sympathicotomy for severe hyperhidrosis: prospective analysis of a standardized approach [^117Y8kVa]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Primary hyperhidrosis (PHH) is characterized by excessive sweat secretion beyond the need for physiological thermoregulation without an underlying systemic condition. PHH tends to begin around the mid second to early third decade of life, affects men and woman equally and has a focal and often symmetric character. It typically affects hands, feet and axillae, although combined palmar-axillary and craniofacial forms are relatively common as well.

Severe palmar and/or axillary focal PHH leads to feelings of shame and low self-esteem resulting in withdrawal from social activities, negatively affecting relational and professional development. Although PHH is considered a benign disorder, it may have a deleterious impact on health related quality of life (HR-QoL). The reality that the latter has been underestimated until very recently is supported by the increasing reported prevalence in the literature, growing from 0.6% in 1977 to a recent 4.6% of the general population. This observation substantiates that we might be looking at the tip of the iceberg called PHH. Non-surgical treatment modalities, like topical solutions, iontophoresis and botulinum toxin injections have proven to be temporarily successful in the treatment of PHH. However, non-surgical treatment modalities strain health care resources because of their temporary relief and demand a high level of patient compliance due to the need for repetitive administration. And while acceptable results have been achieved with local surgery that aims at the eccrine-gland level, these strategies are quite invasive and by nature only able to relieve axillary PHH.

Minimal invasive endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) has become a well-established treatment modality and first-line treatment in palmar PHH. Large series have shown success rates of 71–100% following conventional ETS for all forms of PHH with improved quality of life and treatment satisfaction of 93–95%. Recent experience is obtained with even less-invasive surgery and single-port access techniques. Since results, methods, nomenclature and used instruments vary widely, we sought to study the feasibility of our standardized, one-stage bilateral, single-port sympathicotomy.

### Biportal thoracoscopic sympathectomy: surgical techniques and clinical results for the treatment of hyperhidrosis [^1172kBRa]. Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a bilateral thoracoscopic sympathectomy procedure, using a biportal approach, for the treatment of severe hyperhidrosis.

Methods

Between May 1996 and September 2000, 103 consecutive patients underwent thoracoscopic sympathectomy procedures to treat bilateral hyperhidrosis (206 procedures). Operative results, complications, and patient satisfaction were determined by reviews of hospital and office charts and by follow-up assessments in the outpatient clinic. Long-term results were determined with clinical examinations, follow-up office visits, and follow-up questionnaires.

Results

Ninety-three patients presented with primary palmar hyperhidrosis, eight with primary axillary hyperhidrosis, and two with primary craniofacial hyperhidrosis. Rates of complete resolution in the primary area affected were 100% in palmar and craniofacial cases and 75% in axillary cases. The average length of hospitalization was 1.06 days, and 96 patients (93.2%) were discharged on or before the end of the first postoperative day. Of 59 patients (57.3%) who developed compensatory hyperhidrosis, only 11 patients (10.7%) reported that it was bothersome and none considered it disabling. All postoperative complications were transient; five patients experienced unilateral Horner's syndrome, three patients experienced intercostal neuralgia, and two patients required a chest tube after surgery because of a pneumothorax.

Conclusion

Thoracoscopic sympathectomy using a biportal approach effectively treats hyperhidrosis and is associated with short hospital stays, high patient satisfaction rates, and low rates of compensatory hyperhidrosis or other complications.

### Familial secondary hyperhidrosis associated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor treatment [^1128cyVq]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hyperhidrosis is a disorder caused by overactivity of the eccrine glands and characterized by excessive sweating beyond what is essential for thermoregulation. Its prevalence is 3% in the US population and affects men and women equally. Hyperhidrosis can be classified as either primary, which tends to be focal, or secondary, which tends to be more generalized. Primary hyperhidrosis specifically affects the palms, soles, axillae, and face in a bilateral, symmetric distribution; begins in adolescence; and does not occur during sleep. In contrast, secondary hyperhidrosis typically presents in adults, affects a wider distribution of the body asymmetrically during both waking and sleeping hours, and is caused by either underlying medical conditions or medications.

### Anxiety after sympathectomy in patients with primary palmar hyperhidrosis may prolong the duration of compensatory hyperhidrosis [^1115FXHh]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Severe CH is one of the refractory complications after sympathectomy for PH treatment, causing patient dissatisfaction and depression. The incidence of CH ranges from 33 to 85%, and CH may persist 6–12 months. In the current study, CH occurred in 57 patients (46.72%) and the medium DCH was 11.47 weeks. To obtain detailed CH information, our follow-up period lasted 52 weeks, indicating a gradual decrease in the intensity of CH.

Sweating is influenced by two factors (emotional stimulation [central control] and environmental temperature [peripheral control]); however, PH was more likely triggered by emotional stimulation (anxiety and depression), but less related to environmental temperature. Based on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Braganca et al. reported that anxiety, rather than depression, is main cause of primary PH. Kumagai et al. showed that less anxiety was accompanied with a lower degree of CH after sympathectomy. Our study revealed more severe pre-operative anxiety in patients with CH compared to patients without CH, and severe post-operative anxiety may be critical to prolong DCH, especially in patients with moderate-to-severe CH.

The incidence of anxiety was reported to be higher in patients with axillary or craniofacial PH compared with other anatomic areas. Nevertheless, we found forearm CH to be more severe compared with other anatomic areas, and exacerbated anxiety resulting from CH may predispose to prolonged CH in these patients.

Before the introduction of sympathectomy, there were a variety of anti-anxiety treatments for PH, such as hypnosis, psychotherapy, biofeedback, and tranquilizing drugs. Anti-anxiety treatment may reduce negative physiologic manifestations, risk of infection, and the induction of anesthesia, but increase wound healing and promote post-operative recovery. Patients who underwent psychosocial intervention following coronary artery bypass grafting were at reduced risk of adverse post-operative events.

In our cohort, there was one patient with insomnia caused by anxiety who was treated with eszopiclone (3 mg/qd) for the 10-day perioperative period. Interestingly, although the patient had severe PH pre-operatively, he did not exhibit CH after sympathectomy. As a result, a randomized clinical trial is warranted to study the impact of pre-operative anti-anxiety treatment on CH and DCH.

In summary, our study has shown that pre- and post-operative anxiety should be evaluated, and anti-anxiety treatment should be administered to patients with moderate-to-severe CH in an effort to shorten the DCH.

### Setting research priorities for management and treatment of hyperhidrosis: the results of the james lind alliance priority setting partnership [^1129Z71a]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Data provision

The data that support the findings of this study are openly available in Figshare.

Initial survey

The initial survey was completed by 268 respondents, who suggested 592 questions they would like to see answered by research. The demographic data of the respondents are shown in Table 2. Although there was a spread across all ages, 42% were in the 25–44‐year age group and 37% in the 45–64‐year age group. More women than men (79% vs. 18%) completed the survey. The majority of respondents identified as White (80%), 11% as Asian/British Asian and 4% as Black/African/Caribbean/Black British. Different groups of participants were well represented in the cohort; 58% were people with hyperhidrosis, 29% were HCPs, 11% were friends or family of people with hyperhidrosis and 2% fell into > 1 category.

Table 2
Participant characteristics of the participants of the first survey (n = 242 a).

Out of 592 questions, 160 were deemed to be out of scope (Fig. 2). The main reasons for this were individuals asking for medical advice, questions about the cause of hyperhidrosis or service provision, or questions about raising awareness of hyperhidrosis. Others were precluded because the questions were about different health conditions, or it was unclear what question was being asked. From the remaining 432 questions, 48 indicative questions were formed. Three were questions about adverse effects for which the answer is already known, leaving 45 questions that were the research uncertainties for the interim prioritization (Supplementary Table S1).

Figure 2
Flowchart of participant responses and prioritization.

Interim survey

The interim prioritization survey was completed by 286 participants. The demographic composition of this group was not significantly different to the participants in the first survey (data not shown). Following the interim prioritization, 23 uncertainties were selected for the final workshop. The top 23 uncertainties were ranked according to the total number of respondents who ranked the uncertainty in their Top 10. A further adjusted ranking was calculated, with the groups divided into one group comprising people with hyperhidrosis plus friends and family and a second group comprising HCPs, and given equal weightings. However, this did not change the uncertainties that were included in the top 23; instead, it made only minor changes to the ranking order.

### Botulinum toxin use in pediatric plastic surgery [^112KrzkB]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Botulinum toxin has increasingly become a prevalent treatment option for a wide range of conditions, many of which have their roots in plastic surgery and have been well studied. In adults, chronic headache, hyperhidrosis, and facial muscular hypertrophy have been effectively treated with botulinum toxin, and emerging studies have begun looking at its efficacy in children, as well. Successful treatment of spasticity and muscular contraction has allowed for the creation of safety profiles and dosage guidelines for botulinum toxin usage in children. The expanded indications for its use have since flourished in all arenas of pediatric care, including plastic surgery. Recent studies have described the use of botulinum toxin as an adjunct to the treatment of congenital torticollis and cleft lip. This review discusses the various applications of botulinum toxin for pediatric patients in the field of plastic surgery.

### Diagnosis, impact, and management of focal hyperhidrosis: treatment review including botulinum toxin therapy [^116j851G]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Idiopathic localized hyperhidrosis, called for hyperhidrosis, affects almost 3% of the US population. The most frequent anatomic sites of involvement include the axillae, palms, soles, and face. For those affected, this condition can be extremely socially debilitating and interfere with work activities. Until recently, frequently ineffective topical regimens or problematic surgical procedures have been the treatments of choice. Since 1996, intracutaneous injections of botulinum toxin have been used as a minimally invasive treatment for this condition with numerous studies documenting safety, efficacy, and extremely high levels of patient satisfaction. Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2004 for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis.

Anhidrotic/hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia is a rare disorder, genetically heterogeneous, commonly X-linked recessive inherited, characterized by hypoplasia up to the absence of the eccrine glands with hypo-anhidrosis and secondary hyperpyrexia, hypodontia and some typical craniofacial features. Some papers have described how these patients may show poor growth, while other recent research shows normal growth. We report a boy with anhidrotic/hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia and growth hormone neurosecretory dysfunction, an association not previously reported, and we discuss the possible causes as well as the patient's response to growth hormone treatment until he reached final height.

All studies performed so far indicate that BTX-A is a safe and effective treatment for focal hyperhidrosis of the axillae and palms, for gustatory sweating, and for some other rare conditions associated with focal hyperhidrosis. Based on two large well-designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled study there is class 1 evidence for the efficacy of BTX-A in axillary hyperhidrosis, and class 2 evidence for BTX-A in gustatory and palmar sweating (classification according to the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology, 1994). Other indications (forehead sweating, plantar hyperhidrosis, truncal sweating) are only anecdotally reported.

### Botulinum toxin versus placebo: a meta-analysis of treatment and quality-of-life outcomes for hyperhidrosis [^116b5Qmy]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

All in all, our results hint at a pronounced and significant effect in favor of BTX injections over the course of eight weeks with clinically relevant sweat reduction and improvements in subjective quality-of-life. However, there is a considerable lack of evidence regarding given association in the mid- to long run and hyperhidrosis sites that were not listed in our included trials.

Hyperhidrosis presents a common condition in clinical practice and despite many treatment options available, the results frequently remain unsatisfactory. The condition assumes several facets of daily life with almost 40% of patients describing physical distress. Accordingly, several aspects determining the quality-of-life such as psychological, professional and emotional well-being may be significantly impaired. In addition to the added multi-generational burden that comes with the diagnosis of the far-reaching disease, comorbidities, e.g. psoriasis and various other dermatologic conditions may develop consecutively.

Until today, BTX treatment remains one of the most commonly performed noninvasive aesthetic procedures and the neurotoxin has been standing firm as an effective and predictable agent. An avalanche of indications that extend beyond the known profound cosmetic benefits can be derived by BTX use. With its high anhidrotic efficacy, adequate safety profile and favorable impact on patients' quality of life, BTX has also quickly proven to be an efficient multidisciplinary therapeutic option in the treatment of hyperhidrosis. Based on the results of this meta-analysis, it could be inferred that BTX injections seem to be superior over the use of placebo.

Our study results showed promising implications for patients seeking medical help in practice for the treatment of hyperhidrosis. Based on mostly moderate quality evidence from eight randomized controlled trials, BTX injections derived superior gravimetric sweat reduction rates of ≥ 50% from baseline at week 2–6. For patients with debilitating hyperhidrosis and psychosocial distress, likely refractory to first line treatment, a significant sweat reduction may certainly represent a profound effect.

### Hyperhidrosis and botulinum toxin A: patient selection and techniques [^111HNHPs]. Clinics in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Focal idiopathic excessive eccrine sweating presents most commonly as an affliction of three anatomically distinct area: the axillae, the palms and soles, and the upper face. The true incidence is not known, but about half of the patients referred to us with this condition have at least one first-degree relative similarly affected. Only a fraction of patients afflicted are thought to seek medical care because of the social stigma, lack of understanding on the part of medical providers as to the cause and nature of the problem, and, until now, lack of effective nonsurgical therapy. A large social sample is required to accurately measure both the incidence and the exact nature of the genetic influence.

### Botulinum toxin versus placebo: a meta-analysis of treatment and quality-of-life outcomes for hyperhidrosis [^112r1sZF]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The injection of the neurotoxin botulinum toxin (BTX) has gained popularity as a treatment option, owing to its high anhidrotic efficacy. By irreversibly inhibiting acetylcholine release from presynaptic vesicles, the minimally invasive procedure allows for the block of cholinergic pathways to apocrine and eccrine glands and thereby results in considerable reduction of perspiration.

First-line topical and oral regimens are widely used for the treatment of hyperhidrosis; however, their use is frequently met by unsatisfactory results and adverse events such as skin irritation or dryness of surrounding tissues. Several randomized clinical trials have investigated the use of BTX injections in patients with hyperhidrosis in comparison with placebo and alternative treatment modalities. Mostly, the use of the neurotoxin has proven to be clinically effective and successful in increasing patient satisfaction when employed.

Study features such as treatment regimen, therapeutic site, duration of application, patient characteristics, severity of disease and sample size can differ between trials, resulting in a compromised generalizability of given individual studies. Accordingly, this meta-analysis aimed to examine the efficacy of BTX injections versus placebo in patients over the age of 16 years suffering from hyperhidrosis.

### Efficacy and safety of botulinum toxin type A in primary axillary hyperhidrosis: a meta-analysis and systematic review [^113qLHE1]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analyses

We conducted statistical analyses using RevMan5.4, a software specifically designed for meta-analyses, which offers robust features for data synthesis and analysis. Additionally, to independently evaluate the quality of the included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), two reviewers utilized the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool, ensuring a systemic and standardized assessment of study quality. The meta-analysis was performed on a dataset derived from a total of 12 including studies. In cases where significant heterogeneity was present among the studies (I 2 > 50%), we employed random-effects models for the meta-analysis.

Subgroup Analyses

Included studies were divided into 2 subgroups based on the different measurement received by the control group (placebo versus non-placebo). This method provided a more nuanced understanding of the intervention's efficacy and safety in relation to the choice of control group.

Sensitivity Analyses

We conducted sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the meta-analysis results by excluding trials with high or unknown risk of bias. We excluded trials with high risk of bias in one or more domains, unknown risk of bias with an unclear risk of bias in key domains where the information provided was insufficient to make a definitive assessment, as well as quasi randomized or cluster randomized trials.

After excluding the studies based on the aforementioned criteria, we recalculated the pooled effect estimates and confidence intervals for both the primary and secondary outcomes using the random-effects model. This allowed us to compare the results of the sensitivity analyses with those of the main analysis to determine if excluding studies with a high or unknown risk of bias significantly altered the conclusions.

### Botulinum toxin versus placebo: a meta-analysis of treatment and quality-of-life outcomes for hyperhidrosis [^117A7D2w]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Nonetheless, given current guidelines on the treatment of hyperhidrosis, BTX therapy remains one of the most well-studied treatment options for focal hyperhidrosis and remains a solid treatment modality following unsuccessful initial topical treatment. Of note, a total of three BTX A products are cleared for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis, whereas the treatment of other focal sites has yet to be approved, rendering any such treatment currently off-label. Further research on the efficacy of BTX injections is warranted in order to extend its approval and broader application for various focal sites affected by hyperhidrosis.

Regarding the limitations of this meta-analysis, a large-scale and adequately powered randomized controlled trial analyzing the effectiveness of BTX in comparison with established treatment modalities such as topical treatments, iontophoresis and surgical options would be warranted.

Additionally, further comparative studies with radiofrequency thermotherapy and fractional microneedle radiofrequency in hyperhidrosis may also be warranted. Rummaneethorn et al. showed in a prospective, randomized, split-side comparative study between BTX A injections and fractional microneedle radiofrequency in axillary hyperhidrosis a significantly superior reduction of mean HDSS scores and significantly better participant satisfaction scores for the BTX injections 12 weeks after the intervention. However, given that thermotherapeutic options allow the maintenance of the skin's integrity and reduction of patient discomfort and downtime, they may be a valid alternative to BTX injections.

### Botulinum toxin versus placebo: a meta-analysis of treatment and quality-of-life outcomes for hyperhidrosis [^1158bAUT]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Similarly, the reduction of ≥ 2 points on the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale and the mean score reduction of the Dermatology Life Quality Index from baseline within 2–8 weeks showed to be superior. Even though these effects were derived from trials with limited patient cohorts and moderate quality evidence, the differences in severity scores indicate that BTX could significantly improve overall disease severity and quality-of-life.

Neither BTX effects nor quality-of-life or safety outcomes were available for long-term evaluation. Our results are accordingly limited to the first 8 weeks after initial injection. Therefore, the long-term determination of treatment effect would still be warranted in the future.

Current guidelines recommend BTX application after failure of topical agents; however, study data suggest its superior efficacy in hyperhidrosis patients in comparison with first line topical treatments. Due to the lack of efficacy comparison with other treatment agents, conclusions cannot be drawn from our analysis to adjust the order of treatment modalities and the role of BTX injections. However, the confidence in the efficacy of the alternative treatment options is arguably no greater than that for BTX.

Despite its significant treatment effect and appropriate safety profile, common downsides need to be considered when administering BTX in the treatment of hyperhidrosis. Treatment costs are still high in comparison with readily available topical and systemic agents, especially when considering the necessity of multiple injections over the course of longer treatment periods. In our analysis, the lack of direct comparisons with other treatment modalities prevents the evaluation of cost effectiveness of the BTX treatment. Were it not for the significantly higher costs, it would probably be recommended earlier for hyperhidrosis care.

Besides, the pain induced by injections, particularly in sensitive areas such as the palms or axillae, can negatively impact patient comfort and tolerance, as well as long-term adherence. Given the chronic character of the disease and the requirement for multiple injections during the course of the long-term treatment, transdermal BTX applications may be of interest in the future. Additionally, the minimal risk of anaphylactoid reactions and the risk of muscle atrophy with subsequent intramuscular fat deposition should always be born in mind and discussed with the patient prior to injection. Skilled injections and substantial knowledge of anatomical target sites are therefore of utmost importance for safe application. Studies included in our analysis generally depict that BTX has a substantial safety profile and the results from all included trials that evaluated adverse events agree with those assertions.

### Treatment of hyperhidrosis with botulinum toxin [^115g8MUo]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Focal hyperhidrosis is a common problem that affects up to 2.8% of the population with significant psychosocial implications. Traditional therapies have not proven effective for most of these patients, which further adds to patient anxiety. Botulinum toxin is emerging as a novel treatment for focal hyperhidrosis and is proving to be safe and effective. A therapeutic protocol for focal hyperhidrosis includes an individualized treatment plan for each site of involvement. For those who are affected in the palms and soles, the most common treatments include topical treatment with aluminum chloride, iontophoresis, botulinum toxin, systemic medications, and sympathectomy. For those who have axillary focal hyperhidrosis, iontophoresis is often difficult and botulinum toxin becomes the second line therapy. As of June 2003, BTX A has been approved for the treatment of hyperhidrosis in 13 countries: England, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Taiwan, Netherlands, Switzerland, Brazil, Argentina, Columbia, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Mexico. With the currently available literature and ongoing studies, it should only be a short time before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approves botulinum toxin therapy for focal hyperhidrosis in the United States.

### Bilateral one-stage single-port sympathicotomy in primary focal hyperhidrosis, a prospective cohort study: treat earlier? [^115Wubze]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Severity of PFH was classified according to the 4-point Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS), a disease-specific scale for PFH patients providing a qualitative measure based on the detrimental effect of hyperhidrosis on daily activities (Fig. 1). Patients with a HDSS score of ≥ 3, classifying hyperhidrosis as severe or intolerable, qualified for surgery. A post-operative 1-point improvement in HDSS score is associated with a 50% reduction in sweat production; a post-operative 2-point improvement constitutes an 80% reduction. Informed consent was obtained from all patients.

BOTOX is indicated for the treatment of severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis that is inadequately managed with topical agents.

Limitations of Use

The safety and effectiveness of BOTOX for hyperhidrosis in other body areas have not been established. Weakness of hand muscles and blepharoptosis may occur in patients who receive BOTOX for palmar hyperhidrosis and facial hyperhidrosis, respectively. Patients should be evaluated for potential causes of secondary hyperhidrosis (e.g., hyperthyroidism) to avoid symptomatic treatment of hyperhidrosis without the diagnosis and/or treatment of the underlying disease.

Safety and effectiveness of BOTOX have not been established for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis in pediatric patients under age 18.

Background

Botulinum toxin A has been used increasingly in the treatment of focal hyperhidrosis.

Objective

To assess the long-term efficacy of botulinum toxin A in the treatment of hyperhidrosis and the changes in quality of life and patient satisfaction with treatment.

Methods

A questionnaire was designed to assess the efficacy using visual analog scales and the quality of life both before and after treatment using a modified Dermatology Life Quality Index scale.

Results

There was a reduction in the hyperhidrosis and a statistically significant improvement in the quality of life scores for the axillae, palms, and forehead.

Conclusion

Botulinum toxin A injections are safe and effective for the treatment of hyperhidrosis of the axillae, palms, and forehead, resulting in an improved quality of life for patients.

### Setting research priorities for management and treatment of hyperhidrosis: the results of the james lind alliance priority setting partnership [^113QDuzD]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Interim priority setting

A second survey listed all the indicative questions in a random order, and was open for 8 weeks. Participants were asked to select up to 10 uncertainties that they felt were the most important for research to answer. After the survey closed, the uncertainties were ranked in order of the number of times they were each selected. The uncertainties were ranked separately for HCPs and for people with hyperhidrosis and their family and friends to see whether the priorities of the two groups were different. In order to include the Top 10 priorities from each group, a total of 23 uncertainties were taken to the final workshop.

Final workshop

Participants were invited to attend a final workshop event at De Montfort University, Leicester, UK on 30 November 2018. The participants (n = 18) were divided into two groups, each of which included both people with hyperhidrosis and HCPs. Each group had a trained facilitator from the James Lind Alliance who used a nominal group technique. Ground rules were set, including the need to keep discussions confidential and respect the opinions of others. The 23 questions were randomized and allocated a letter of the alphabet. Cards for each question were provided and participants worked together to rank them in order of priority. The rankings from each group were scored from 1 (the top priority) to 23 (the lowest priority), and then combined to give a total score whereby the lowest score represented the highest priority. The groups were then mixed up and given the combined rankings and the process was repeated again. Finally, a plenary session including all participants that agreed the final ranking for all 23 questions, and came up with the final Top 10 list.

### The initial exploration of polidocanol sclerotherapy for the treatment of axillary osmidrosis: a retrospective study [^113fcXmK]. Dermatologic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Axillary osmidrosis treatment can be divided into surgical and nonsurgical. Although surgery for AO is generally known to be more thorough, it may result in physical damage, scarring, and other complications. However, nonsurgical treatments are less invasive options, including laser therapy, microwave therapy, BTX-A injection, and ethanol injection therapy, all of which have been clinically studied in different countries.

An ideal perfect treatment for AO would need to possess the following conditions simultaneously: complete alleviation of symptoms, minimal trauma, long-lasting efficacy, and should be safe and simple. Results in this study indicated that this treatment method had optimistic short-term and long-term therapeutic effects, while also demonstrating treatment safety. It was easy to handle the injection procedures for operator, and patients can resume their normal lives early after injection, which provided a potential novel option in treating AO with advantage of long-term efficacy and minimal invasiveness.

First introduced as a temporary treatment for axillary hyperhidrosis, the effects of the BTX-A injection could persist for 6 to 8 months. In 2018, McConaghy and Fosselman recommended BTX-A injection as a first- or second-line treatment for not only AO but also palmar, plantar, or craniofacial hyperhidrosis. The mechanism of BTX-A was chemodenervation of cholinergic nerve terminals to the eccrine and apocrine glands, presumably inhibiting bacterial overgrowth and reducing axillary sweating. Current studies found BTX-A injection for treating AO to have good efficacy but had a predictable possibility of half-year recurrence and required further treatment, which was consistent with the authors' findings.– In order to achieve long-term control of symptoms, treatment of AO with BTX-A injections requires repeated injections every 6 months or so. This repeated injection increases the treatment cost and psychological burden, which also reduces the quality of life. Accordingly, it is necessary to explore other treatment methods with higher efficacy and a lower recurrence rate that do not require repetitive injections.

### Therapeutic treatment of multiple eccrine hidrocystomas with topical glycopyrronium tosylate 2.4% solution [^114bvw4v]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A variety of nonpharmacologic treatments have been used for eccrine hidrocystomas with varying rates of success, including needle puncture, electrodessication, carbon dioxide laser vaporization, and laser treatment. Because eccrine activation is driven by cholinergic pathways, anticholinergic medications are reasonable treatment options for patients with eccrine hidrocystomas that are bothersome. Oral anticholinergic medications, including oxybutynin and glycopyrrolate, have been reported to treat hidrocystomas successfully. However, oral medications pose significant risk of systemic adverse effects, such as dry mouth, blurred vision, and vomiting.

Topical, rather than oral, anticholinergic medications may represent the safest long-term therapy for eccrine hidrocystomas because of the lower likelihood of systemic absorption. Sanz-Sánchez and colleaguesperformed a head-to-head study to compare the efficacy of 3 topical anticholinergic medications (1% atropine sulphate, 40% scopolamine butylbromide, and 1% ipratropium bromide) in patients with multiple hidrocystomas and found all to be well tolerated, although topical ipratropium was the only medication to result in complete remission. Topical anticholinergic glycopyrrolate 0.5% in aqueous solution has been reported in the literature only once previously, in 2010, to successfully treat eccrine hidrocystomas in a patient with concurrent craniofacial hyperhidrosis.

The topical glycopyrronium tosylate 2.4% solution in cloth towelette used by our patient was approved in June 2018 by the Food and Drug Administration as the first and only topical anticholinergic to treat primary axillary hyperhidrosis in adult and pediatric patients aged 9 years and older. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report to demonstrate resolution of multiple eccrine hidrocystomas with this novel application method of glycopyrronium tosylate. Because this drug is a topical anticholinergic, there is a risk of blurred vision, mydriasis, and dry mouth with periocular or perioral absorption. For this reason, use of disposable gloves has been proposed as a safety measure to reduce manual transfer. The patient described in this report has not noted any systemic anticholinergic adverse effects and continues to maintain clearance with targeted facial application 2 to 3 times per week.

Figure 1 shows the article selection and Delphi process. After deduplication and screening of the remaining 3344 articles, 94 met the eligibility criteria. Another fourteen articles were supplemented by the expert panel to fill evidence gaps. From these articles, 96 statements were derived, 84 were subsequently added by the panel based on their expert opinion, and 16 were added based on the patient survey (17 responses). For the second voting round, 24 additional statements were added by the expert panel to increase coverage, given the broad nature of FDS. In total, 196, 98, and 27 statements entered the first, second, and third voting rounds, of which 92 (46.9%), 58 (59.2%), and 19 (70.4%) reached consensus. Overall, 92 experts from various specialties and 3 patient representatives were involved in the voting process (Supplemental Digital Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content 1).

Data Extraction and Quality Assessment

Two independent researchers (SJ and LPH) extracted data from the included trials using standardized data extraction tables. This approach ensured consistency and reduced the potential for error or bias in the data collection process. Both researchers have significant experience in evidence-based medicine and are well-versed in the nuances of data extraction for systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

In instances where a randomized controlled trial reported multiple outcome measures (e.g. 2 or 3), we summarize and include all of them; event outcomes in our analysis. This comprehensive approach provides a broader perspective on the efficacy and safety profiles of the interventions assessed.

When confronted with insufficient data in a particular study, we contacted the corresponding author to request the missing information. This proactive measure was taken to ensure that the meta-analysis was as comprehensive and accurate as possible, thereby enhancing the validity of our conclusions.

Any disagreement between two researchers during the data extraction process were resolved through consensus. This involved engaging in detailed discussions to understand each other's perspectives and using critical thinking to reach a mutually acceptable decision. This process helped to mitigate personal biases and ensured that the data extracted were both accurate and reliable.

### Botulinum A toxin and laser therapy: evidence and recommendations for combination treatment [^111Mkuni]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) is widely employed in the treatment of facial rhytids, facial asymmetry, and hyperhidrosis. Its pathophysiology involves presynaptic inhibition of acetylcholine release at neuromuscular junctions, causing targeted muscle paralysis. Its ease of use, efficacy, and excellent safety profile make it a popular treatment option in aesthetic practice.

Laser therapy is another widely utilized treatment modality in aesthetic practice, with proven benefit in treating facial rhytids, scars, and skin resurfacing. A variety of lasers are utilized, each targeting particular chromophores such as melanin, water, and hemoglobin, using specific wavelengths of collimated light to induce thermal, chemical, or mechanical changes in the respective tissue. Lasers can be ablative, removing the epidermis and heating the dermis to stimulate collagen formation, as with carbon dioxide (CO2) and erbium lasers, or nonablative lasers, which are less aggressive and do not remove the epidermis, as with pulsed dye, Erbium:YAG lasers, and intense pulsed light (IPL). Both ablative and nonablative lasers can be fractionated, producing microscopic columns of unaffected tissue within the treatment zone to accelerate recovery and minimize local side effects. There is evidence to suggest that routine adjunctive use of botulinum A toxin and laser therapy is more efficacious, and safer, than a single treatment alone (Table 1).

### Bilateral one-stage single-port sympathicotomy in primary focal hyperhidrosis, a prospective cohort study: treat earlier? [^116Wat26]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Historically ETS consisted of a true sympathectomy by removing a segment of the sympathetic nerve including multiple ganglia. More recently the switch to a sympathicotomy was made, with transection of the sympathetic nerve while striving to save the ganglia. It is hypothesized that reducing damage to the ganglia may reduce CH severity by leaving crucial feedback-loops intact. Furthermore, surgical optimization resulted in a minimally invasive uniportal one-stage bilateral technique. Given these improvements, aforementioned arguments 2 and 3 are waived, and argument 1 should be addressed by raising awareness.

Study objective

To evaluate the long-term results, safety and effectiveness of a Bilateral One-stage Single-port Sympathicotomy (BOSS) in patients suffering from PFH and to identify which patient groups benefit most from the procedure.

### Palmoplantar hyperhidrosis: a therapeutic challenge [^115rAif4]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Excessive sweating from the palms and soles, known as palmoplantar hyperhidrosis, affects both children and adults. Diagnosis of this potentially embarrassing and socially disabling condition is based on the patient's history and visible signs of sweating. The condition usually is idiopathic. Treatment remains a challenge: options include topical and systemic agents, iontophoresis, and botulinum toxin type A injections, with surgical sympathectomy as a last resort. None of the treatments is without limitations or associated complications. Topical aluminum chloride hexahydrate therapy and iontophoresis are simple, safe, and inexpensive therapies; however, continuous application is required because results are often short-lived, and they may be insufficient. Systemic agents such as anticholinergic drugs are tolerated poorly at the dosages required for efficacy and usually are not an option because of their associated toxicity. While botulinum toxin can be used in treatment-resistant cases, numerous painful injections are required, and effects are limited to a few months. Surgical sympathectomy should be reserved for the most severe cases and should be performed only after all other treatments have failed. Although the safety and reliability of treatments for palmoplantar hyperhidrosis have improved dramatically, side effects and compensatory sweating are still common, potentially severe problems.

### The impact of hyperhidrosis on quality of life: a review of the literature [^114QpaMp]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is a condition of excessive sweating, which can have profound physical and mental effects. Hyperhidrosis is a significantly impactful and distressing illness that warrants equal attention as other more well-known dermatologic conditions. However, because of a lack of awareness among the public, stigma, and difficulty with access to treatments (due to cost or insurance coverage), patients are less likely to be diagnosed and treated. In hyperhidrosis, quality-of-life surveys can be useful for determining the magnitude of symptoms and to evaluate treatment outcomes. The purpose of this study was to conduct a narrative literature review to investigate the impact of hyperhidrosis on quality of life. A total of 49 articles investigating the impact of primary hyperhidrosis on quality of life were selected for the review. Hyperhidrosis is a potentially debilitating illness that affects multiple domains of patients' lives including their psychological, physical, and social functioning. Despite the significant impacts, patients with hyperhidrosis are less likely to seek care. Here, we explore these impacts, and disparities in care, in more detail.

### Efficacy and safety of botulinum toxin type A in primary axillary hyperhidrosis: a meta-analysis and systematic review [^111uCzwU]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations of the Study

The present meta-analysis, while synthesizing the current evidence on the treatment of PAH with BTX-A, encounters several limitations that must be considered when interpreting the findings. Firstly, there is a scarcity of studies reporting the long-term maintenance effects of BTX-A injections. Understanding the duration of effectiveness is crucial for both clinicians and patients in deciding the frequency and necessity of repeated interventions.

Additionally, the dosage variation of BTX-A and the potential differences in efficacy between different manufacturers (e.g. Botox vs. Dysport) have not been thoroughly investigated. The conversion ratio of BTX-A to BTX-B and its implications in clinical practice likewise require more robust evidence.

Lastly, the adverse reaction profile of BTX-A, although generally favorable compared to placebo, needs to be assessed in larger cohorts to determine its true incidence and severity. This is particularly important for patients and practitioners when balancing the risk-benefit ratio of treatments.

In conclusion, while this meta-analysis provides insights into the treatment of PAH with BTX-A, future research should focus on large-scale RCTs with consistent outcome measures and longer follow-up periods to validate these findings and guide clinical decision-making.

### Optimal diagnostic and treatment practices for facial dysostosis syndromes: a clinical consensus statement among European experts [^113V3XfB]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Delphi Process

Health care providers with expertise in FDS from 13 centers affiliated with ERN CRANIO in 9 European countries were invited to participate in the Delphi voting process, along with 3 patient representatives. Experts were urged to only vote on statements related to their area of expertise. A 9-point Likert scale was used to measure agreement, from (1) "strongly disagree" to (9) "strongly agree". Consensus on a statement was defined as a mean score of ≥ 7.00 and ≤ 1 outlier, where outliers were defined as any rating ≥ 2 Likert points away from the mean. To achieve consensus, a minimum of 5 votes per statement was required. A statement was considered "near consensus" with a mean score of ≥ 6.50 and/or ≤ 2 outliers.

In total, the Delphi process involved 3 voting rounds. Statements that were near consensus and remaining statements that were pointed out by members of the expert panel, were discussed after each round in plenary (online) sessions or in subgroups based on specialty. These statements were then refined or replaced with alternative ones by the expert panel for the subsequent voting round. After the final (third) voting round, no further adjustments or replacements were made.

### Sofpironium topical gel, 12.45%, for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis: pooled efficacy and safety results from 2 phase 3 randomized, controlled, double-blind studies [^111ZWbT6]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Current treatments for primary axillary hyperhidrosis are insufficient for some patients. Sofpironium topical gel is a retrometabolically-designed topical anticholinergic with rapid metabolism, which is associated with reduced side effects and targeted efficacy.

Objective

To assess efficacy and safety of sofpironium topical gel for primary axillary hyperhidrosis.

Methods

Cardigan I and Cardigan II were double-blind, randomized, controlled pivotal phase 3 studies of sofpironium topical gel, 12.45%, versus vehicle gel (1:1 randomization) for daily application to the axillae for 6 weeks.

Results

The combined Phase 3 studies included 353 subjects in the treatment groups and 348 subjects in the control groups. For the co-primary endpoint of ≥ 2-point improvement from baseline to end of treatment on Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Measure-Axillary-7, pooled analyses showed significantly better results for treatment versus control (P < .0001). For the pooled co-primary endpoint of gravimetric sweat production at treatment end, the treatment group had greater reduction in sweat production (P = 0.0002). Secondary endpoints also showed a statistically significant benefit for sofpironium topical gel versus control. Treatment was well-tolerated.

Limitations

Short treatment and follow-up periods.

Conclusion

Sofpironium topical gel, 12.45%, applied topically once daily before bedtime is effective and well-tolerated for treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in patients ≥ 9 years old.

### Bilateral one-stage single-port sympathicotomy in primary focal hyperhidrosis, a prospective cohort study: treat earlier? [^111CVCSE]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperhidrosis is a pathologic condition in which sweat production exceeds the need for physiological thermoregulation. It may develop secondary to psychological causes or a variety of medical disorders, but is mostly cryptogenic / primary, thus without an identifiable underlying medical disorder. Primary Focal Hyperhidrosis (PFH) is usually severe and symmetrical with a focus on the palms, axillae, and feet. PFH, and its associated symptoms have a major impact on Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL). An increasing prevalence is seen over time, ranging from 0.6% in the past to almost 5% in recent literature. Current treatment options consist of 1) topical solutions like aluminum chloride, 2) intradermal application of sweat gland blockers like botulinum toxin, 3) oral anticholinergics including oxybutynin and glycopyrrolate, 4) iontophoresis and 5) Endoscopic Thoracic Sympathectomy (ETS). The first four options offer temporary result; discontinuation of these treatments is followed by certain relapse, since they are fundamentally non-curative in nature.

Repeating these non-curative symptomatic strategies seems futile, as ETS, a permanent curative treatment without systemic side-effects, exists. ETS is currently only offered to patients at the end of the treatment algorithm or even not at all due to three arguments: 1) unfamiliarity of medical professionals with the 'modern-day' ETS procedure, 2) prejudice and unjust perceived surgical invasiveness, and 3) fear to induce Compensatory Hyperhidrosis (CH) i.e. new postoperative hyperhidrosis in a non-targeted area.

Thoracic sympathetic surgery is not a novel treatment. In 1934 Leriche was the first to perform a sympathectomy for PFH, although surgical access has dramatically improved since the introduction of Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS). While the first thoracoscopic technique was described in the earlier 1950's by Kux, a series of 55 patients who had excellent results after thoracoscopic sympathectomy (TS) for hyperhidrosis, large series of conventional multiportal endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy were performed in the late nineties of the twentieth century reporting improved quality of life and treatment satisfaction of 93–95% with success rates of 71–100%. Recent further optimization of technique led to standardized and reproducible single-port techniques, allowing for bilateral treatment in a single session while minimizing post-operative discomfort.

### Bilateral one-stage single-port sympathicotomy in primary focal hyperhidrosis, a prospective cohort study: treat earlier? [^1144kEMF]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Instead of true sympathectomy (surgically removing a part of the sympathetic chain including one or more ganglia), a sympathicotomy, in which the ganglia are left unaffected is now performed. Although the pathogenic mechanism of CH is poorly understood, it is hypothesized that severing sympathetic reflex arcs that run through the ganglia to the hypothalamus, lead to CH through dysfunctional sweat regulation in the affected body parts. This finding corroborates with earlier studies, showing higher rates of dissatisfaction and severe CH in patients treated for axillary PFH when compared to patients treated for palmar PFH, and so adds to the understanding that the ganglia should be left untouched.

CH remains the only lasting cause for discontent postoperatively. It is of interest to note that CH is however still preferred by most patients over the distress experienced from PFH. Only 8 out of the 48 patients (17%) experiencing severe CH at any moment after surgery were not satisfied with the obtained result. It must be stressed that CH is a side-effect of surgery on the sympathetic nerve and not a complication of the surgery. The key for accepting and living with CH after BOSS lies in thorough and accurate pre-operative information about its risk. The importance of thorough pre-operative counseling and consent cannot be overstated.

### Topical therapy… [^116Xe7Zo]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of palmoplantar hyperhidrosis is obvious because the excess sweating may be readily observed. Various treatment options are available. Some work by interrupting the innervation of sweat glands by sympathetic nerves with acetylcholine as the neurotransmitter, but all have limitations or associated complications. Thus, treatment of palmoplantar hyperhidrosis remains a challenge, and a logical approach must be taken to individualize therapy based on the degree of functional impairment. Systemic Therapy In the past, systemic anticholinergic drugs have been somewhat successful in the treatment of palmoplantar hyperhidrosis, based on the action of acetylcholine as the periglandular neurotransmitter within the sympathetic innervation of sweat glands. Despite their potential, systemic anticholinergic drugs are impractical treatments for this condition.

Long-term therapy is required, and the drugs have numerous side effects, including dry mouth, dry eyes, constipation, blurry vision, mydriasis, and difficulty with urination. IONTOPHORESIS Iontophoresis, the passage of a direct electrical current onto the skin, is a long-established therapy for hyperhidrosis. Successful induction of hypohidrosis by tap-water ion-tophoresis requires the application of 15 to 20 mA to each palm or sole for 30 minutes per session for 10 consecutive days, followed by one or two maintenance sessions per week. Initially, many patients experience an aggravation of their symptoms, but this problem resolves after three to five treatments. Without maintenance therapy, symptoms recur in one to two weeks. Use of combined aluminum chloride, an anticholinergic drug, and tap-water iontophoresis for one hour each day resulted in the remission of symptoms for 20 days, compared with 3.

5 days for the use of iontophoresis alone; this combination also was more effective in reducing the severity of symptoms. 15 Employing a device for home use makes this treatment relatively affordable and accessible. 26 All but one patient with palmar hyperhidrosis were cured. Within the two cauterization groups, the satisfaction rate was 94. 3 percent for early treatment and
95. 1 percent for late treatment; the satisfaction rate was 98 percent in the clamping group. Fewer than 6 percent of patients had severe compensatory hidrosis, and the recurrence rate was 3 percent. Clamping was shown to be at least as effective and safe as electrocautery and had the advantage of being potentially reversible.
