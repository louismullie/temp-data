## Question

Can thrombocytopenia be seen with menstruation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether thrombocytopenia can be seen with menstruation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the directionality of the relationship: does menstruation cause thrombocytopenia, or does thrombocytopenia cause menstrual bleeding abnormalities. Then, I should verify the prevalence and clinical significance of heavy menstrual bleeding in thrombocytopenic conditions, especially ITP. Next, I will examine whether normal menstruation ever precipitates clinically meaningful thrombocytopenia. Finally, I should consider special contexts like pregnancy, malignancy, and toxic shock, and synthesize a clear conclusion with practical implications for evaluation and management.

> Let me first confirm the core relationship. Thrombocytopenia does not arise from normal menstruation; rather, thrombocytopenia causes abnormal uterine bleeding, including heavy menstrual bleeding, because platelets are central to endometrial hemostasis and low counts impair clot formation and stability, leading to prolonged, heavy menses and increased risk of anemia and quality-of-life impairment [^111EZDQ8] [^1175proL] [^112xsRTV].

> Wait, let me verify the prevalence and severity in ITP specifically. Multiple cohorts and reviews show that heavy menstrual bleeding is common in ITP, with 39% of women meeting objective criteria for HMB in a prospective cohort and 51% reporting HMB at diagnosis in a large survey, and many rating HMB among their most severe symptoms; importantly, HMB can persist even when platelet counts are modestly reduced or near-normal, underscoring platelet function and local hemostatic factors beyond absolute count alone [^1169wjar] [^1175proL] [^113mK8Qs] [^1122fn48].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality in the opposite direction. I initially wondered if menstruation could transiently lower platelets, but I should double-check that. Normal menstrual blood loss is on the order of tens of milliliters and does not meaningfully reduce circulating platelet mass; clinically significant thrombocytopenia is not a recognized consequence of normal menses, whereas menstrual blood loss can be dangerously amplified in patients who are already thrombocytopenic, which is why guidelines emphasize menstrual suppression in adolescents with thrombocytopenia or anticipated myelosuppression [^116kY7vK] [^116MvZFW] [^114ffeqY].

> I need to check special contexts where menstruation and thrombocytopenia coexist. In pregnancy, gestational thrombocytopenia is common and benign, but new-onset or severe thrombocytopenia warrants evaluation for hypertensive disease, TTP/HUS, or ITP; heavy menstrual bleeding may be the presenting symptom of hematologic malignancy or immune thrombocytopenia in young women, so new HMB with cytopenias should trigger hematology referral rather than attributing it to "just menstruation" [^117NKAy4] [^111huFp6] [^115Sg1ik].

> Let me consider adolescent and oncology populations to ensure I'm not missing a key signal. Adolescents with HMB have a notable prevalence of underlying bleeding disorders, including thrombocytopenia, and cancer therapy–related thrombocytopenia frequently manifests as HMB; in both settings, proactive menstrual suppression is recommended to mitigate bleeding risk and anemia, reinforcing that the causal arrow points from thrombocytopenia to HMB, not vice versa [^115Sg1ik] [^116kY7vK] [^116MvZFW].

> I should confirm practical implications for evaluation. In a woman with heavy menstrual bleeding, especially adolescent or young adult, guidelines advise screening for bleeding disorders, including platelet disorders and von Willebrand disease, because identifying and treating the hemostatic defect improves outcomes; conversely, in a patient with known thrombocytopenia, anticipatory guidance and menstrual suppression strategies should be discussed early to prevent HMB and its sequelae [^115Sg1ik] [^116kY7vK] [^114FmPPk].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion is precise. Normal menstruation does not cause thrombocytopenia; rather, thrombocytopenia causes heavy menstrual bleeding and can make menses a major clinical problem, with substantial prevalence in ITP and other platelet disorders, and with impact on quality of life even at modestly reduced platelet counts; therefore, clinicians should screen for bleeding disorders in HMB and proactively manage menses in thrombocytopenic patients to reduce morbidity [^11116SA2] [^1169wjar] [^115Sg1ik] [^116kY7vK].

Thrombocytopenia is not caused by normal menstruation, but **menstruation can exacerbate bleeding** in women with pre-existing thrombocytopenia, leading to heavy menstrual bleeding and anemia [^111EZDQ8] [^1175proL]. Heavy menstrual bleeding is a common symptom in thrombocytopenic disorders such as ITP, von Willebrand disease, and platelet function defects, and can be the presenting complaint in adolescents and young women [^115Sg1ik] [^113bfpbR]. Management includes hormonal therapy, antifibrinolytics, and platelet support as needed, with multidisciplinary care to optimize hemostasis and quality of life [^116kY7vK] [^113yLrEo].

## Relationship between thrombocytopenia and menstruation

Thrombocytopenia is not a direct consequence of normal menstruation; however, **menstruation can significantly worsen bleeding** in women with underlying platelet disorders, leading to heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) and associated complications such as iron deficiency anemia [^111EZDQ8] [^1175proL].

---

## Prevalence of heavy menstrual bleeding in thrombocytopenia

Heavy menstrual bleeding is a common clinical manifestation in women with thrombocytopenia. Studies indicate that **HMB is present in approximately 13–20% of adolescents with HMB**, with thrombocytopenia being a significant underlying cause [^115Sg1ik] [^113bfpbR]. In chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), HMB is reported in 51% of patients at diagnosis and persists in 17% during the course of the disease, significantly impacting quality of life [^1175proL] [^113mK8Qs].

---

## Clinical implications and complications

Thrombocytopenia-related HMB can lead to **severe clinical consequences**, including:

- **Iron deficiency anemia**: Chronic blood loss results in iron deficiency, causing fatigue, cognitive impairment, and reduced quality of life [^1175proL] [^115Sg1ik].

- **Acute hemorrhagic episodes**: Severe thrombocytopenia can precipitate life-threatening uterine bleeding, necessitating urgent medical intervention [^117JVoDv].

- **Psychosocial impact**: Persistent HMB leads to anxiety, depression, and social isolation, significantly affecting daily functioning [^1175proL] [^113mK8Qs].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management of HMB in thrombocytopenic patients requires a **multidisciplinary approach** involving hematologists, gynecologists, and primary care providers:

- **Hormonal therapy**: Combined oral contraceptives, progestin-only therapy, and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices (LNG-IUDs) are effective in reducing menstrual blood loss [^116kY7vK] [^115c7PCF].

- **Antifibrinolytic therapy**: Tranexamic acid is beneficial in reducing menstrual blood loss, although its efficacy may vary depending on the underlying cause of thrombocytopenia [^116XCxGG].

- **Platelet transfusion**: Reserved for severe thrombocytopenia with acute bleeding episodes, typically targeting platelet counts above 50,000/µL for hemostasis [^117Bjy6B].

- **Iron supplementation**: Essential to correct iron deficiency anemia and improve overall health outcomes [^115c7PCF].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of recognizing and managing HMB in thrombocytopenic patients:

- **Screening and diagnosis**: Women presenting with HMB should be evaluated for underlying bleeding disorders, including thrombocytopenia, von Willebrand disease, and platelet function defects [^115Sg1ik] [^114dGGfe].

- **Individualized management**: Treatment plans should be tailored based on the severity of thrombocytopenia, patient preferences, and reproductive goals [^116kY7vK] [^115c7PCF].

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Collaboration between hematologists, gynecologists, and primary care providers is essential for optimal patient outcomes [^1151jBKo] [^116vBgid].

---

## Conclusion

Thrombocytopenia is not caused by normal menstruation, but **menstruation can significantly exacerbate bleeding** in women with pre-existing platelet disorders. Heavy menstrual bleeding is a common and clinically significant manifestation of thrombocytopenia, requiring careful evaluation and management to prevent complications such as iron deficiency anemia and improve quality of life.

Unanswered questions and future research

Further research should address why menstrual problems in chronic ITP patients seem to exist despite management. For example, defects in platelet function or the presence of gynaecological abnormalities in ITP patients may be relevant. Furthermore, effective management strategies and the role of menstrual problems in the patient's quality of life should be the subject of study. Because randomized trials are likely unfeasible, we suggest the use of prospective observational studies to assess the effectiveness of interventions in ITP patients, and qualitative research to inform clinicians on the patient's appreciation of current management, identify areas with room for improvement, and explore the role of menstrual problems in fatigue and health‐related quality of life as a whole.

### Screening and management of bleeding disorders in adolescents with heavy menstrual bleeding: ACOG COMMITTEE OPINION, number 785 [^115Sg1ik]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 785 — common bleeding disorders and presenting features in adolescents — states that the most common bleeding disorders in adolescent girls who present with heavy menstrual bleeding are von Willebrand disease, platelet function defects, Thrombocytopenia, and clotting factor deficiencies. Thrombocytopenia can be congenital or acquired; heavy menses can be the presenting symptom of immune thrombocytopenic purpura or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Approximately one half of adolescent girls with bleeding disorders present with heavy menstrual bleeding at menarche; others may not present until cycles become ovulatory. Of adolescent girls and women with an inherited bleeding disorder, 75–80% report having heavy menses as the most commonly cited clinical manifestation of their disorder. Of children and adolescents with a bleeding disorder, 70% report passage of clots and bleeding through clothes and sheets. Recurrent hemorrhagic corpus luteum, with or without rupture, or hemoperitoneum with ovulation also can be gynecologic indications of a bleeding disorder. Anemia that results from bleeding can cause associated symptoms of headaches and fatigue, and low iron stores in adolescents with heavy menstrual bleeding, reflected by a low ferritin level, even without anemia, are associated with fatigue and decreased cognition.

### New and emerging therapies for women, girls, and people with the potential to menstruate with VWD [^1164D21r]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition, the pathophysiology of bleeding in VWD is complex and involves deficiency of both the multimeric glycoprotein von Willebrand factor (VWF) as well as coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), in addition to multiple possible specific functional VWF defects (ie, impaired platelet, collagen, or FVIII binding). This makes designing and implementing treatments, as well as performing clinical trials to evaluate novel VWD therapies, challenging.

VWD is currently classified into 3 types: type 1 is characterized by reduced levels of functionally normal VWF; type 2 is divided into 4 subtypes: 2A (decreased VWF–platelet binding because of loss of high molecular weight multimers), 2B (increased affinity of VWF for platelets, resulting in loss of high molecular weight multimers and variable thrombocytopenia), 2M (decreased VWF–platelet binding with normal multimers), and 2N (decreased VWF–FVIII binding); and type 3, which is caused by a virtual absence of VWF with secondary FVIII deficiency. Patients present with a variety of bleeding symptoms including heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) and postpartum hemorrhage but also nonsex-specific symptoms such as hemarthrosis, gastrointestinal bleeds, epistaxis, easy bruising, oral cavity bleeding, and bleeding after surgery and dental procedures. Currently existing treatments for VWD, including antifibrinolytics, desmopressin, and plasma-derived von Willebrand factor (pdVWF) replacement have been around for decades and are widely considered safe and effective. However, quality of life in patients with VWD is known to be poor, especially for those with HMB, which is the most common presenting symptom. This disconnect underscores the problem facing the VWD community: if current treatments are good, why are patients still suffering?

### Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^112ELnts]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2010). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia occurs commonly during pregnancy, and may result from diverse etiologies. Awareness of these many causes facilitates proper diagnosis and management of thrombocytopenia in the pregnant setting. Some causes of thrombocytopenia are unique to pregnancy and may not be familiar to hematologists. In the review, we will discuss the differential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy, and the pathogenesis of selected thrombocytopenic disorders. Considerations for optimal management of the pregnant patient with thrombocytopenia will also be described.

### Platelet disorders [^112xsRTV]. Pediatrics in Review (2020). Medium credibility.

After vascular injury and exposure of subendothelial matrix proteins to the intravascular space, mediators of hemostasis are triggered and allow for clot formation and restoration of vascular integrity. Platelets are the mediators of primary hemostasis, creating a platelet plug and allowing for initial cessation of bleeding. Platelet disorders, qualitative and quantitative, may result in bleeding signs and symptoms, particularly mucocutaneous bleeding such as epistaxis, bruising, petechiae, and heavy menstrual bleeding. Increasing evidence suggests that platelets have functional capabilities beyond hemostasis, but this review focuses solely on platelet hemostatic properties. Herein, normal platelet function as well as the effects of abnormal function and thrombocytopenia are reviewed.

### Options for prevention and management of menstrual bleeding in adolescent patients undergoing cancer treatment: ACOG committee opinion, number 817 [^116kY7vK]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Background — menstrual bleeding in adolescents undergoing cancer treatment should be managed with individualized, oncology-coordinated care: adolescents undergoing cancer treatment are at high risk of abnormal menstrual bleeding from malignancy or treatment-related myelosuppression leading to thrombocytopenia, even normal menstrual blood loss may pose a threat to adolescents who already are anemic or thrombocytopenic, therapy for both menstrual suppression and management of acute bleeding episodes should be tailored to the patient, the cancer diagnosis and treatment plan, and the individual's contraceptive needs, and collaboration with the adolescent's oncologist is highly recommended; options for menstrual suppression include GnRH agonists, progestin-only therapy, and combined hormonal contraception, and in emergent severe uterine bleeding, adolescents usually require only medical management; considerations for acute bleeding treatment selection include menstrual status, hemoglobin and platelet count, expected nadirs, planned cancer treatments, risk of thromboembolism, and request for contraception.

INTRODUCTION

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease, in which autoantibodies attack the platelets and megakaryocytes. This leads to thrombocytopenia and sometimes also platelet function defects. The most common clinical features include petechiae, bruises, epistaxis, and gum bleeds. A less frequently mentioned, but possibly very relevant symptom is heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), as ITP often affects women of reproductive age.

HMB is defined as menstrual periods with abnormally heavy bleeding and/or prolonged bleeding (more than 7 days).HMB poses a monthly challenge for women and often affects their quality of life. The heavy blood flow leads to impairments in several domains, including physical, social, and emotional functioning, vitality and general health. Additionally, HMB can deplete the iron stores and thus cause iron deficiency and/or anaemia, which can also significantly impair cognitive and physical performance and quality of life.

HMB is often associated with bleeding disorders. For example, thrombocytopenia is found in 13%–20% of adolescents with HMB. In ITP, a recent large‐scale survey revealed that self‐reported HMB was present in 51% of the patients at the time of diagnosis, compared to up to 30% in the normal population. Furthermore, HMB was rated as one of the most severe symptoms by 83% of the women who experienced it. During the course of ITP the proportion of self‐reported HMB decreased to 17% at the time of survey completion. However, this survey relied on patients' own interpretation, and did not take into account the platelet count or use of hormonal and antifibrinolytic therapy.

Therapeutic options for HMB include hormonal therapy, endometrial ablation and hysterectomy. However, since some of these treatments impair fertility permanently, the options can be limited in ITP women. In case of a future pregnancy wish, hormonal modalities, such as oral contraceptive pills (OCP) or intrauterine devices (IUD), combined with antifibrinolytic therapy may be used. In case of an active pregnancy wish or a wish to avoid hormonal therapy, only antifibrinolytic therapy is an option. These management options may successfully manage HMB. However, if these options are unsuccessful and women want to preserve their fertility, it is sometimes impossible to effectively treat HMB.

Literature review

We searched Pubmed up to 11 April 2022 for research regarding HMB and the impact of menstruation in ITP patients, at diagnosis or throughout the course of the disease. We combined key terms for ITP and (heavy) menstruation. Specific search terms were added for ITP‐specific questionnaires that include items regarding menstruation, namely the ITP‐PAQ, the I‐WISh and the ITP‐BAT. Only articles with the full text available in English were included. We excluded review articles, therapeutic studies, case reports/series, and studies that assessed fertility or follicle and ovarian bleeding rather than menstrual problems. Data from the included articles were extracted using a standardized data extraction form. For the critical appraisal, the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tool that was appropriate for the respective type of study was used, with emphasis on whether the remission state of the ITP was reported and whether the menstrual problems were assessed objectively.

In the absence of studies that objectively assess the amount of blood loss and the impact of menstruation in chronic ITP, we performed this explorative cross‐sectional cohort study. We assessed the extent of menstrual problems using the pictorial bleeding assessment calendar (PBAC) and the menorrhagia multiattribute scale (MMAS) and explored which factors are related to menstrual problems. Additionally, we reviewed the available literature.

Reproductive tract bleeding in women is a naturally occurring event during menstruation and childbirth. In women with menorrhagia, however, congenital bleeding disorders historically have been underdiagnosed. This consensus is intended to allow physicians to better recognize bleeding disorders as a cause of menorrhagia and consequently offer effective disease-specific therapies.

Treatments to prevent bleeding

As already discussed, most patients with IT have mild, moderate, or even absent spontaneous bleeding, and intervention is required only on the occasion of hemostatic challenges.

Simple and cheap general measures can effectively reduce the risk of bleeding in everyday life

Preventing hemostatic challenges is an important general recommendation to be given to patients with IT. They need to know that many drugs inhibit platelet function and facilitate bleeding. Aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents should certainly be avoided, but many other frequently used drugs, e.g. some antibiotics and antidepressants, can also affect platelet function. Patients with IT should, therefore, consult their physician before taking any medication and discuss the risk-to-benefit ratio of each treatment.

Oral contraceptives are usually effective in preventing or controlling menorrhagia and their use should be considered in women with heavy menstruation. In case they develop iron deficiency anemia, this must be corrected with iron administration, not only to improve their quality of life, but also because it has been suggested that anemia facilitates bleeding. In fact, in vitro studies showed that red blood cells push the platelets towards the vessel wall and facilitate their hemostatic effect.

Dental interventions are among the most frequent hemostatic challenges, and maintaining good oral hygiene with regular dental visits are simple measures to prevent the need for these invasive procedures. Moreover, adherence to screening programs for early cancer detection is particularly recommended, as thrombocytopenia can be a major obstacle to the treatment of advanced malignancies. Finally, activities such as contact sports should be discouraged in patients with severe thrombocytopenia (< 20×10⁹ platelets/L) or with bleeding episodes following even minor trauma. Fortunately, this is only rarely required.

CONCLUSION

This explorative study suggests that women with ITP of child‐bearing age seem prone to menstrual problems, including HMB and a high impact of the menstruation on quality of life. The use of an LNG‐IUD seems associated with less blood loss, but the effect on the impact of menstruation is not evident in this study. Clinicians should be aware that menstrual problems may exist even in the case of (sub)normal platelet counts, normal haemoglobin and ferritin levels, and the use of OCP or antifibrinolytics. A close collaboration between haematologists and gynaecologists is encouraged to improve counselling and management, focusing on interventions to increase a woman's quality of life, while taking into account an active or passive pregnancy wish.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 207: thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^111EZDQ8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Platelet function — clinical manifestations of thrombocytopenia: Platelet disorders such as thrombocytopenia usually result in bleeding into mucous membranes, with common manifestations including petechiae, ecchymosis, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, and abnormal uterine bleeding. Bleeding into joints usually does not occur, and although life-threatening bleeding is uncommon, when bleeding occurs it is associated with hematuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, and rarely, intracranial hemorrhage.

### Introduction to a review series on the treatment of thrombocytopenic disorders: something old, something new [^1167vNBM]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

It is still debatable what is an optimal platelet count sufficient to avoid spontaneous bleeding or to prevent hemorrhages associated with menstruation or parturition or in preparation for surgery or dental extraction. We have to admit that despite intensive research we still do not understand why patients with the same platelet count manifest bleeding at different frequencies and with different severity. The seminal research by Harker and Slichterproved that the bleeding time (a surrogate measurement in vivo of the bleeding tendency) is differently correlated to the actual platelet count in different disorders. Indeed, at parity of platelet count, the bleeding time was most prolonged in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, followed by aplastic anemia and only moderately increased in ITP. A correlation was found with the platelet volume, in keeping with the increased volume of the more active and young, regenerating platelets. Experience with ITP also suggests that platelet count and platelet activity are not the only determinants of bleeding severity.

### Menstrual problems in chronic immune thrombocytopenia: a monthly challenge-a cohort study and review [^1122fn48]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

The effect of platelet count on menstrual problems was contradictory between our cohort, where we found no association, and our review, where we found a larger impact on quality of life in patients with low platelet counts. In our study, the vast majority (68%) had platelet counts of > 50×10⁹/L and management for HMB was often already initiated, which could be the reason why platelet counts were unrelated to PBAC/MMAS scores. In this scenario, platelet function defects may be causing the menstrual problems. Although more research is necessary to further explore this subject, our results do suggest that menstrual problems can be present despite almost normal platelet counts.

We found no association between the amount of blood loss and haemoglobin or ferritin levels, despite the association found in previous studies. Iron deficiency and anaemia were previously found to be associated with a decreased quality of life. In our study, however, no patients were anaemic and 73% had normal iron levels, probably due to frequent monitoring. In conclusion, our study suggests that in chronic ITP an increased impact of HMB might exist despite the prevention of anaemia and iron deficiency.

Clinical implications

This study should raise awareness of menstrual problems in patients with chronic ITP. Even despite the use of tranexamic acid or OCP, normal haemoglobin and ferritin levels, and normal platelet counts, our study suggests that patients may still experience HMB and a negative impact of their menstruation on their quality of life. It important to realize that embarrassment or not knowing what is normal may prevent a patient to raise the topic herself. It is, therefore, the responsibility of the clinician to discuss any menstrual problems and counsel patients about possible treatment options. An LNG‐IUD should be considered in case of HMB without an active pregnancy wish, considering the effectiveness we found in our study. The PBAC and/or MMAS may aid in the identification and discussion of menstrual problems and assessing the effect of treatment. Any counselling and intervening should focus primarily on increasing a woman's quality of life. Particular attention should be given to counselling regarding a pregnancy wish, as this might lead to patients' quitting effective hormonal treatment. Close collaboration between haematologists and gynaecologists is encouraged to provide patients with the best care.

### The hospitalized adolescent [^114ffeqY]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Menstrual disorders in hospitalized adolescents — if evidence of a menstrual disorder is revealed, it can be addressed during the hospitalization, and an adolescent with a history of heavy periods, particularly if anemic, should be evaluated for the etiology of this menstrual concern with consultation from adolescent medicine or gynecology and possibly hematology, with empirical anemia treatment considered. Adolescents with irregular menses with no anemia could have the evaluation begin in the hospital and be scheduled for follow-up with their PCP, an adolescent medicine specialist, or a gynecologist. If an adolescent admitted for another medical or surgical concern is found to be anemic and is currently menstruating, treatment to stop menses or address menorrhagia can be considered during the hospitalization, and adolescent medicine or gynecology could be consulted to initiate medical treatment to stop menses, if warranted. Menstrual suppression can be addressed and initiated in the inpatient setting for those who with IDDs, those who will undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), or those who have thrombocytopenia or a functional platelet disorder or another clotting disorder.

Summary

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) may cause menstrual problems. This cross‐sectional study assessed menstrual problems in premenopausal chronic ITP women by several questionnaires, including the pictorial bleeding assessment calendar (PBAC; score ≥ 100 indicates heavy menstrual bleeding [HMB]), and the menorrhagia multiattribute scale (MMAS). Spearman was used for assessing correlations. A literature review was performed in Pubmed. The cohort comprised 37 women (mean age 31 ± 9). A total of 29/37 (78%) had experienced clinical menstrual problems in the present or past. Of the 33 patients who returned the PBAC, 13 (39%) had a score of ≥ 100. The median MMAS score was 79 (IQR 60–95). The PBAC scores correlated with the MMAS. Both questionnaires were unrelated to the platelet count. Patients with a levonorgestrel intrauterine device (LNG‐IUD) had lower PBAC scores than patients with other or no hormonal therapy. MMAS scores were correlated with fatigue. The review identified 14 papers. HMB occurred in 6%–55% at ITP diagnosis and 17%–79% during disease. Menstrual symptoms influenced the quality of life, particularly in patients with a low platelet count. This explorative study suggested that HMB is frequent in women with chronic ITP despite management and platelet counts > 50×10⁹/L. An LNG‐IUD seemed to reduce blood loss significantly.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^115c7PCF]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

What if the patient is persistently anemic despite iron supplementation?

If the mean corpuscular volume is low, consider workup for underlying thalassemia trait or iron deficiency with the latter being common in the setting of heavy menses. Iron replacement is not always straightforward; using oral replacement every other day may be equally effective as daily administration. Resorting to IV iron may be important especially if oral replacement does not correct iron status and/or there are signs of a chronic inflammatory disease. If the mean corpuscular volume is high, bone marrow failure must be considered. There could also be pernicious anemia secondary to vitamin B12 deficiency or an autoimmune hemolytic anemia, such as Evans syndrome. Another possibility is microangiopathic anemia with thrombocytopenia, whether in the form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or hemolytic uremic syndrome. In these cases, there would likely be increased reticulocytosis. While individually each of these conditions is rare, having one of many rare conditions would not be as surprising.

If heavy menstrual bleeding persists, a progesterone-based approach is superior to an estrogen-based approach in women with ITP as the former raises the platelet count. While estrogen-based therapies are more commonly used in general practice for heavy menstrual bleeding, they might worsen ITP. In contrast, progestational agents have previously been tried as treatment in ITP with good effect. Progesterone may be administered orally at a dose of 5–10 mg daily or medroxyprogresterone acetate (Depo-Provera) can be given intramuscularly once every 3 months but the latter may result in intermittent vaginal bleeding.

### Platelet disorders in adolescents [^112CPd9J]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Acquired and inherited platelet disorders can present with bleeding symptoms during adolescence. Platelet disorders include disorders of platelet number and disorders of platelet function. In adolescent females with platelet disorders, menorrhagia is a common presenting bleeding symptom. Other associated bleeding symptoms are also primarily mucocutaneous, including epistaxis and bruising. Excessive bleeding may also occur after hemostatic challenges. Diagnosis of disorders of platelet function usually requires light transmission platelet aggregometry. Management of menorrhagia in the adolescent with platelet disorders requires both hematologic and gynecologic treatment.

### Menstrual problems in chronic immune thrombocytopenia: a monthly challenge-a cohort study and review [^112dxAMs]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In our explorative study, 39% of the women with chronic ITP experienced HMB and 78% had experienced clinical menstrual problems now or in the past. The use of an LNG‐IUD seemed associated with less blood loss. Furthermore, a higher impact of menstrual problems on patients' daily life correlated with higher levels of fatigue. Both HMB and a high impact of the menstruation seemed to occur despite the use of tranexamic acid or OCP and despite normal platelet counts. Our review showed that menstrual symptoms impact the quality of life in ITP and showed a particularly high prevalence of HMB at the time of ITP diagnosis.

The study is the first to prospectively assess the extent of menstrual problems in chronic ITP with (semi‐)objective assessment methods. Furthermore, it is the first to explore the correlation of menstrual problems with other factors in ITP patients. The most important weaknesses of the study are the small sample size, the lack of a control group, and the missing data in the PBAC and the ITP‐BAT HMB item. However, as an explorative study, it does highlight this underestimated problem. Furthermore, the reliability of the PBAC has been questioned. However, a systematic review found the reliability of the PBAC to be reasonably high, despite some low values for sensitivity, specificity and discriminatory power (sensitivity 86%–99% and specificity 7.5%–89% for diagnosing > 80 mL blood loss with a cut‐off of 100 points). Furthermore, the PBAC is practical and more reliable than self‐rapportage. Another weakness of our study is that, although the MMAS has previously been validated, there are no normative data available to place the outcomes of our study in context. The last weakness is that, due to the explorative design of the study, the information on the dose and frequency of antifibrinolytic therapy and oral contraceptives is incomplete.

### Treatment of menorrhagia in women with thrombocytopenia using platelets or platelets and hormones… [^117JVoDv]. ClinicalTrials (2007). Low credibility.

Treatment of Menorrhagia in Women With Thrombocytopenia Using Platelets or Platelets and HormonesClinicalTrials. gov ID. Participants will also receive platelet transfusions as needed to ensure that their platelet counts remain over 20, 000/microliter. After seven days, researchers will assess participants' uterine bleeding and all participants will be given oral contraceptives in the second week of the study. Participants whose bleeding has decreased will receive only one tablet; participants who still have moderate to severe uterine bleeding will receive two tablets. A final assessment will be performed on day 14 of the study. Low platelet counts can occur as a result of blood diseases like bone marrow failure, or from undergoing procedures such as chemotherapy treatment or stem cell transplantation. A major complication of low platelet counts in reproductive aged women is uterine bleeding, which can be life threatening.

Sometimes this bleeding begins with a normal menstrual cycle but may start unexpectedly. In either instance, stopping uterine bleeding not only requires blood products including platelets but also hormonal treatments. The hormones estrogen or progesterone can aid in this setting presumably by promoting endometrial angiogenesis. Continuous oral contraceptive pills have been shown to be very effective in the management of heavy menstrual bleeding in healthy women, but few studies have been carried out in women with low platelet counts. Moreover, they have few side-effects and are contraceptive. High-dose intravenous Premarin is also useful but only for a couple of days after which heavy bleeding will ensue. Progestin hormones are similarly effective and are also contraceptive.

Oral contraceptive pills are routinely used to control uterine bleeding in thrombocytopenia secondary to bone marrow failure, chemotherapy and/or stem cell transplantation, during episodes of severe thrombocytopenia. There are no current data supporting whether the use of hormonal management is necessary in addition to platelet transfusion. We expect to show that using continuous OCP in addition to having platelet transfusions will result in a better and more rapid control of uterine bleeding than having platelet transfusions only. Eligible subjects will be hemodynamically stable, menstruating women aged 12–55, who have bone marrow failure, or are undergoing chemotherapy and/or stem cell transplantation for other diseases with platelet levels less than 50, 000/ microliter and present with heavy menstrual bleeding which is expected to last at least 2 weeks.

4 DISCUSSION

Patients with benign or malignant hematologic diseases may experience abnormal hematologic conditions, particularly thrombocytopenia, due to underlying diseases, chemotherapy regimens, HSCT conditioning, and other reasons, making them susceptible to HMB. Current research has found that in patients with normal ovarian function, chemotherapy‐induced thrombocytopenia can lead to HMB in 40% of cases. However, the potent gonadotoxicity of chemotherapy during HSCT conditioning often results in ovarian dysfunction and subsequent hormonal imbalances, further increasing the incidence of HMB, and complicating the patient's condition. Therefore, menstrual management of premenopausal women scheduled for HSCT is crucial in reducing the incidence of menstruation during transplantation and preventing HMB.

There is relatively limited research on the feasibility and effectiveness of premenstrual management before HSCT to prevent secondary HMB due to hematologic changes in patients after conditioning. Our study aims to investigate the impact of menstrual management before HSCT on uterine bleeding in the LAFR and provide a reference for the menstrual management of patients with HMB.

In clinical admissions, there is a high proportion of blood disorder patients complaining of HMB. With the poor correlation between patient perception and objective menstrual blood volume, as well as the lack of validated diagnostic tools, HMB is an under‐diagnosed and under‐treated disease.NICE pointed out that HMB should be defined as excessive menstrual blood loss that interferes with the woman's physical, emotional, social, and material quality of life, and can occur alone or in combination with other symptomsAnemia can be used as a reference for HMB. Anemia has a wide range of health impacts on female patients, including causing nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, hair loss, lack of concentration, palpitations, and dizziness. Severe anemia can lead to arrhythmias, edema, and even heart failure in patients, as well as an increased need for blood transfusions. The present study found that 83.9% of patients had varying degrees of anemia before HSCT, suggesting a high likelihood of HMB. Including patients who need medication for hemostasis before HSCT, the proportion of HMB patients in the enrolled population can reach 90% (297/330). At the same time, these patients were a high‐risk group for HMB in the LAFR.

### Heavy menstrual bleeding as a common presenting symptom of rare platelet disorders: illustrative case examples [^112CdE5t]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is a common symptom in patients who present to the obstetrician-gynecologist or adolescent medicine specialist and might result from an underlying inherited bleeding disorder. Whereas relatively common bleeding disorders such as von Willebrand disease are often included in standard laboratory assessments, rarer platelet function disorders can be challenging to diagnose. Additionally, HMB can be a particularly difficult symptom to manage in adolescents with platelet function disorders, and it is associated with decreased quality of life. We review the diagnostic and management issues of patients with platelet function disorders through the presentation of 2 patient case reports, with a focus on a diagnosis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, an inherited qualitative disorder that affects platelet function. Whereas the first patient presented to the emergency department before the diagnosis of a bleeding disorder and required a hematologic referral and extensive laboratory assessments, the second patient had been diagnosed with Glanzmann thrombasthenia as a child but experienced severe management challenges at the onset of menarche. In both patients, collaboration between the obstetrician-gynecologist or adolescent medicine specialist and the hematologist was critical for achieving acute management of the bleeding symptoms and for ensuring optimal long-term disease management. Together, these cases highlight the importance of properly identifying females with HMB who might have an undiagnosed bleeding disorder and of consulting with a hematologist to determine an appropriate management plan throughout all life stages.

### Options for prevention and management of menstrual bleeding in adolescent patients undergoing cancer treatment: ACOG committee opinion, number 817 [^116MvZFW]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion — recommendations for prevention and management — states that adolescents undergoing cancer treatment are at high risk of abnormal menstrual bleeding as a direct result of hematologic malignancies or as a secondary effect of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or pretreatment regimens for stem cell or bone marrow transplantation. Therapy for both menstrual suppression and management of acute bleeding episodes should be tailored to the patient, the cancer diagnosis and treatment plan, and the individual's contraceptive needs, and collaboration with the adolescent's oncologist is highly recommended. Considerations for acute bleeding treatment include the patient's current menstrual status, current hemoglobin and platelet count, expected nadirs, planned cancer treatments, risk of thromboembolism, and request for contraception. Options for menstrual suppression include gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, progestin-only therapy, and combined hormonal contraception. It is important to remember that oncology patients may still be engaging in sexual intercourse and could become pregnant.

Associated factors with the amount of blood loss or impact of heavy menstrual bleeding

No studies assessed which factors were correlated with the amount of blood loss or the presence of HMB in ITP. However, several studies assessed ITP‐specific factors related to the impact of the menstruation measured with the ITP‐PAQ subscale. None of the studies provided information on the use of OCP, IUD or antifibrinolytics.

Platelet count

The platelet count seemed to relevantly impact patients' quality of life concerning menstrual symptoms (Table 4). Snyder et al. and Mathias et al. (2009) showed higher ITP‐PAQ scores in patients with higher platelet counts. Although Mathias et al. (2007) found no significant difference between patients with a platelet count of more or less than 50×10⁹/L, this was only in a small sample of patients. Lastly, Mathias et al. (2007) reported a mean score of 3.8 (standard deviation 1.0) for the individual item "Thinking about your last period, how bothered were you by: heavier bleeding than before having ITP?"This item ranges from one (most bothered) to five (not bothered) and was asked in patients with "active" disease (as judged by a clinician).

Other factors

No significant differences in menstrual symptom scores on the ITP‐PAQ were found between splenectomised and non‐splenectomised ITP patients.

### Options for prevention and management of menstrual bleeding in adolescent patients undergoing cancer treatment: ACOG committee opinion, number 817 [^11379qee]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) for menstrual suppression in adolescent cancer care has limitations for rapid control because initial irregular bleeding makes it a less reliable method and breakthrough bleeding can be challenging to manage. It is classified as a Category 2 method (the advantages of using the method generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks) among those with a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and active cancer according to the U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria. DMPA typically is administered every 12 weeks, but the dosing interval can be shortened to achieve amenorrhea quickly, and its long dosing interval of up to 3 months minimizes concerns over adherence. A subcutaneous formulation (dose of 104 mg) is available and is recommended for adolescents with thrombocytopenia who are at risk of developing an intramuscular hematoma with intramuscular administration.

### Absence of hyperfibrinolysis may explain lack of efficacy of tranexamic acid in hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia [^116XCxGG]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

The absence of any evidence of systemic activation of fibrinolysis defined by the ECLT in the FEAT study samples is thus in marked contrast to trauma and leads to the hypothesis that this finding may explain the absence of hemostatic efficacy of TXA in A-TREAT. Given that platelets are a rich source of PAI-1, an a priori hypothesis in the A-TREAT trial was that local PAI-1 levels (both on the surface of activated platelets and in the surrounding milieu of a hemostatic plug) would be significantly reduced in the presence of severe thrombocytopenia, thereby promoting local fibrinolysis-related bleeding. Indeed, the concept of local hyperfibrinolysis as a contributor to bleeding in the absence of systemic hyperfibrinolysis has precedent in clinical medicine. For example, in women with heavy menstrual bleeding (whether associated with a known hemostatic defect such as von Willebrand disease or not), TXA is widely used. Several studies have shown that menstrual fluid from women with heavy menstrual bleeding has elevated fibrinolytic activity compared with control subjects. Although these patients do not have any evidence of associated systemic fibrinolysis, they respond well to TXA with quantitative bleeding reduction of 34% to 59%. Clearly, assessment of local hyperfibrinolysis in subjects with thrombocytopenia requires a different approach, but the absence of any hemostatic benefit of TXA in A-TREAT suggests that this is unlikely to be a major contributor to bleeding in these patients. However, it should be noted that subjects with acute promyelocytic leukemia, a distinct subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML M3) that is commonly associated with hyperfibrinolytic disseminated intravascular coagulation and associated bleeding, were excluded from participation in A-TREAT. In aggregate, these data suggest that a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms that affect hemostasis may help to select the optimal clinical situations for the use of TXA.

### Overview of bleeding disorders in adolescent females with menorrhagia [^111uRAkZ]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Women bleed with menses, during childbirth, and after childbirth. Women are more likely to manifest a bleeding disorder as they have more opportunities to experience bleeding challenges in their lifetime. Bleeding disorders such as hemophilia and von Willebrand disease affect 2.5–3 million American women. The most common inherited bleeding disorder in the population is von Willebrand disease with an estimated prevalence of 1–2%. von Willebrand factor (vWF) is required to adhere platelets to exposed subendothelium and protects factor VIII from proteolysis in the circulation. The prevalence of vWF rises in studies involving women with menorrhagia, with estimates ranging as high as 10–20% in white women, and 1–2% among African American women. Other bleeding disorders seen in adolescents with menorrhagia are disorders of inherited platelet dysfunction, clotting factor deficiencies, thrombocytopenia, and disorders of the fibrinolytic pathway. Not only are women more likely to present early in their life with a bleeding disorder, they are also more likely to have other gynecologic manifestations as a result of these disorders. This article presents an overview of the problem and touches upon the different management strategies available.

### Menstrual problems in chronic immune thrombocytopenia: a monthly challenge-a cohort study and review [^114azjeV]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Prevalence of

Our study suggests a prevalence of HMB (PBAC ≥ 100 or ITP‐BAT HMB score of ≥ 2) of 39% in patients with chronic ITP. This proportion seems higher than the 30% reported for the general population, although a direct comparison should confirm this. At diagnosis, a high prevalence of HMB has been previously reported. Our study suggests, however, that the proportion remains high despite management of ITP in a specialized centre. Of note, the prevalence of HMB throughout the course of disease was found to vary largely in different studies be much lower (17%–79%). These studies all relied on self‐rapportage, which is known to be unreliable. For example, in one study, only 27% of patients with a PBAC score of ≥ 100 reported having HMB through self‐assessment. Furthermore, the disease activity and the use of hormonal therapy, antifibrinolytic agents, or an IUD were not considered in any of these studies. Based on our data, awareness of HMB in ITP patients may be warranted even in later phases of the ITP and when platelet counts are > 50 × 10⁹/L.

Impact of the menstruation

We found a median MMAS score of 79 (IQR 60–95). For comparison: at the start of clinical trials for HMB treatments, MMAS scores were much lower (range 35–58), than in our ITP cohort. After treatment for HMB, trial patients had a score of 80–100, indicating that there is room for improvement for at least half of our ITP patients. The impact of the menstruation seemed related to the amount of blood loss, which is in line with the positive effects of HMB treatment on women's quality of life. Furthermore, the correlation between MMAS scores and fatigue as well as our review showed that menstrual problems impact the quality of life, which is in line with previous research. Of note, an overview of the current standards for women with ITP reported that moderate menorrhagia may be present with a platelet count < 20–30 × 10⁹/L, but is "easily manageable". This advice seems not in line with the findings of our study. We suggest, therefore, that ITP patients may experience a negative impact of their menstruation on their quality of life and may be related to the frequently reported symptom of fatigue.

### Recommendations for the management of the haematological and onco-haematological aspects of gaucher disease [^116UHnLm]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Results

Non-malignant haematological disease

Cytopenia is an almost universal finding in untreated Gaucher patients. Anaemia, thrombocytopenia and to a lesser extent, leucopenia, may be observed simultaneously or independently. Before the availability of enzyme replacement therapy, splenectomy was frequently carried out to reduce severe cytopenia due to functional hypersplenism and to reduce the mechanical effects of an enlarged spleen on abdominal viscera.

Anaemia

Data from the ICGG Registry shows that 36% of enroled patients were anaemic at diagnosis, as defined by the haemoglobin levels shown in Table I.pointed out that the criteria for defining anaemia were widely based on World Health Organization expert committee recommendations made over 40 years ago, and which do not reflect differences between ethnic groups. They propose new haemoglobin lower limits defining anaemia for black and white adults (Table II). These are relevant in Gaucher disease where higher incidence is associated with certain ethnicities and where it could be useful to relate the degree of anaemia to ethnicity. Most cases of anaemia in Gaucher patients are thought to be related to increased red blood cell destruction in the spleen. Pre-treatment, severe and moderate anaemia has been shown to be more prevalent in non-splenectomized compared with splenectomized patients. Nevertheless, it has been shown that there is no direct correlation between the degree of splenomegaly and degree of cytopenias, suggesting that other mechanisms may be involved. These may include Gaucher cell infiltration into bone marrow with consequent pancytopenia, and other causes (alone or in combination), such as iron deficiency (which in addition to the common causes of diet, menstruation and pregnancy, can also occur as a consequence of blood loss in Gaucher patients with a bleeding tendency), alterations in iron metabolism and transport, vitamin B12 deficiency and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia is sometimes associated with recurrent abortions in women with Gaucher disease. Anaemia may also result from co-morbidities such as myelodysplastic syndrome and haematological malignancy.

5.1 Hemorrhage

Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks.

Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure, or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of hemorrhagic event.

Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including:

Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension.
Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye.
Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia, and some vascular purpuras.
Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine.
Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy – The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human).
Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis.

3.3 symptoms and severity

Petechiae (64%, diagnosis; 31%, survey completion) and bruising of unknown origin (65%, diagnosis; 30%, survey completion) were among the most frequent patient‐reported signs and symptoms at diagnosis and, though substantially reduced, were prevalent at survey completion (Figure 1A, B). In contrast, anxiety around maintaining a stable platelet count (34%, diagnosis; 32%, survey completion) and fatigue (discussed below) were also frequent. These four were the top signs and symptoms that patients most wanted resolved. Very few patients reported no symptoms at diagnosis (6%) or survey completion (13%).

Data presented are for scores ≥ 5. ITP, immune thrombocytopenia; QoL, quality of life [Color figure can be viewed at]

Anxiety around maintaining stable platelet counts did not change over time, and patients who experienced it rated it as one of their most severe symptoms (scored ≥ 5 on a Likert scale 1‐7; 7 = the worst imaginable), at diagnosis (77% with n = 400/517) and survey completion (64% with n = 303/474) (Figure 1A, B). Thrombosis had occurred in 103 patients at diagnosis and 35 at survey completion, patients who experienced thrombosis considered it as one of their most severe complications (60%, n = 62/103 and 74%, n = 26/35; Figure 1B). Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) was experienced by 439 women at ITP diagnosis and 161 at survey completion, of whom 83% (n = 364/439) and 62% (n = 100/161) rated it as one of their most severe symptoms.

Table 4 shows the proportion of patients with HMB, as assessed by eight studies. At diagnosis, the reported prevalence ranged from 6% to 55%. None of these articles provided a clear definition of HMB. During the disease, the proportion of self‐reported HMB ranged from −17% to 79%. A higher proportion was found in the Indian subset of the I‐WISh study than in the complete study population (73% vs. 51% at diagnosis and 38% vs. 17% during the disease). Again, none of these studies used a clear definition of HMB. Furthermore, information on disease activity and use of (hormonal) therapy at the time of the survey was unavailable.

TABLE 4
Heavy menstrual bleeding in immune thrombocytopenia patients: results of the review

Impact of

The impact of HMB was assessed by seven studies. First, the study by Cooper et al. (mentioned above) showed that HMB was rated as one of the most severe ITP symptoms by 83% of the women with HMB at diagnosis and 62% of the women with HMB throughout the course of disease (at the time of the survey). The other six studies assessed the impact by using the ITP‐Patient Assessment Questionnaire (ITP‐PAQ), which contains a subscale regarding menstrual symptoms (Table 4). The score of this subscale ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores reflecting a better quality of life, and the minimally important difference is 8. The ITP‐PAQ was developed based on the qualitative data by Mathias et al. (2008). This study identified reproductive issues, including heavy menstrual bleeding and hysterectomy because of bleeding, as a relevant concept in ITP‐related quality of life. Since the ITP‐PAQ is an ITP‐specific questionnaire, the data cannot be interpreted in the context of other populations.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 207: thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^117NKAy4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 207 — gestational thrombocytopenia is the most common etiology of thrombocytopenia during pregnancy and accounts for 80% of cases. It affects 5–11% of pregnant women. Onset can occur at any point in pregnancy, with most cases having a platelet count more than 75 × 10⁹/L, although some cases have been described with platelet counts as low as 43 × 10⁹/L. Women are asymptomatic with no history of bleeding and have no history of thrombocytopenia outside of pregnancy, and platelet counts usually return to normal within 1–2 months after giving birth. A retrospective cohort found the risk of gestational thrombocytopenia was 14.2 times as high among women with previous gestational thrombocytopenia. The incidence of neonatal thrombocytopenia has been reported to range from 0.1% to 2.3%. Thus, women with gestational thrombocytopenia are not at risk of maternal or fetal hemorrhage or bleeding complications. There are no specific laboratory tests to confirm gestational thrombocytopenia, and the diagnosis is one of exclusion.

Von Willebrand disease, the most common inherited bleeding disorder among American women, is a common cause of heavy menstrual bleeding and other bleeding problems in women and adolescent girls. Von Willebrand disease and other inherited and acquired disorders of coagulation and hemostasis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all patients being evaluated for heavy menstrual bleeding, regardless of age. There are many treatment options available for patients with von Willebrand disease and heavy menstrual bleeding, including hormonal and nonhormonal therapies. A multidisciplinary approach to management, which involves obstetrician-gynecologists and hematologists, results in optimal treatment outcomes. Many resources exist for patients and health care providers through the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; National Hemophilia Foundation; and the American Society of Hematology.

Adolescent cancer treatment — acute heavy menstrual bleeding hormonal therapy details high-dose oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) regimens and related options: in one series of 24 adolescents, oral MPA 120 mg (5 mg every 1–2 hours) for the first day followed by 20 mg daily for 10 days successfully controlled bleeding, with complete cessation in 25% within 24 hours and in all patients by the fourth day; another suggested regimen is high-dose MPA 60–80 mg two times a day until bleeding stops, then begin a progestin taper such as MPA 10 mg every 4–6 hours; norethindrone metabolism yields approximately 4 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol per 5 mg; in adults, DMPA 150 mg intramuscularly plus 3 days of MPA 20 mg every 8 hours stopped bleeding within 2.6 days; estrogen therapy with combined oral contraceptives (OCs) or intravenous estrogen has proven useful, estrogen therapy for acute bleeding should be balanced against the elevated risk of VTE, therapy should continue with standard-dose combined OCs until platelet counts have recovered and withdrawal bleeding can occur, and if there is a risk of recurrent bleeding, menstrual suppression with another agent such as a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist should be strongly considered.

### Burden of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP): special considerations for refractory ITP [^113x4GuT]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Medium credibility.

It is known that patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) have fatigue and impairment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL). However, it is hypothesized that patients with refractory ITP have additional burdens that should be considered. Specifically, fatigue is more pronounced in patients with refractory disease, there are additional side effects from second- and third-line treatments, additional anxiety about the long-term course of the disease, impairment in HRQoL resulting from heavy menstrual bleeding and concerns related to family planning. The burden of disease, therefore, should be carefully assessed and considered in these patients. However, researchers have utilized numerous tools for evaluating HRQoL and fatigue, making comparison of data across studies challenging. There is a need to standardize assessment using either disease-specific or generic instruments that can be easily implemented in routine clinical practice. Additionally, whether treatment of low platelet count and bleeding symptoms will have a positive influence on HRQoL remains to be seen and published evidence is conflicting. Nevertheless, improvement of HRQoL is a major treatment goal for both patients and physicians and should be especially considered when treating patients with refractory ITP.

Monitoring and Dosing

Patients who are not able to adhere to the recommended laboratory monitoring or to the related treatment recommendations must not receive TEGSEDI. Do not initiate TEGSEDI in patients with a platelet count below 100×10⁹/L. Follow recommended monitoring and treatment recommendations for platelet count [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. If a patient develops signs or symptoms of thrombocytopenia, obtain a platelet count as soon as possible, and hold TEGSEDI dosing unless the platelet count is confirmed to be acceptable. Recheck the platelet count as soon as possible if a platelet measurement is uninterpretable (e.g., clumped sample) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Hold TEGSEDI dosing until an acceptable platelet count is confirmed with an interpretable blood sample.

Concomitant Medications with Platelet Effects

When considering use of TEGSEDI concomitantly with antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants, be aware of the risk of potential bleeding from thrombocytopenia with TEGSEDI, and consider discontinuation of these drugs in patients with a platelet count less than 50×10⁹/L [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Symptoms of Thrombocytopenia

Symptoms of thrombocytopenia can include unusual or prolonged bleeding (e.g., petechiae, easy bruising, hematoma, subconjunctival bleeding, gingival bleeding, epistaxis, hemoptysis, irregular or heavier than normal menstrual bleeding, hematemesis, hematuria, hematochezia, melena), neck stiffness or atypical severe headache. Patients and caregivers should be instructed to be vigilant for symptoms of thrombocytopenia and seek immediate medical help if they have concerns.

Severe Thrombocytopenia: Treatment with Glucocorticoids

Glucocorticoid therapy is strongly recommended in patients with a platelet count below 50×10⁹/L, and in patients with suspected immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. Avoid using TEGSEDI in patients for whom glucocorticoid treatment is not advised.

Menstrual bleeding assessment

Heavy menstrual bleeding

We have assessed and described the presence of menstrual bleeding in three different ways:

(1) First, menstrual blood loss was quantified using the PBAC; a validated semi‐objective chart that calculates a total score based on the number of pads and/or tampons that were used in a month. In this study, lightly stained pads or tampons were scored with one, moderately stained pads or tampons with five, and soaked pads or tampons with 10 points. Days on which clots were present were scored with five additional points. HMB was considered present if the score was ≥ 100. Patients who used a vaginal cup were asked to use pads and tampons for the duration of the PBAC to obtain reliable estimates.

(2) The presence of clinical menstrual problems at any point during the patient's course of disease was based on a description of ≥ 1 clinical criterion for HMB or a note by the treating physician in the patient's electronic file. The clinical criteria were: a cycle of ≥ 7 days, the need to change pads and/or tampons at least every 2 h or at night, clots, iron deficiency, and menstruation complaints leading to decreased social participation.

(3) The HMB item of the ITP‐bleeding assessment tool (ITP‐BAT, explained further below) has a score ranging from zero to four: zero indicates no problems, one indicates "doubling of the number of pads/tampons in the last cycle compared to pre‐ITP or a phase of the disease with normal platelet count", two indicates either "changing pads more frequently than every two hours or clot and flooding" or "requiring combined treatment with antifibrinolytics and hormonal therapy or gynaecological investigation", three indicates "acute menorrhagia requiring hospital admission or endometrial ablation", and four indicates "red blood cell transfusion or haemoglobin drop of > 20 g/l".

Impact of menstrual problems

The impact of menstrual problems on the quality of life was assessed by the MMAS. It comprises six items assessing practical difficulties of the menstruation, and the impact on social life, mental health, physical health, work‐life, and family life. A total score is calculated by the weighted response scores, which ranges from 0 to 100; zero indicates the most severe impact, and 100 indicates no impact.

### Toxic shock syndrome: still a timely diagnosis [^115sCwyH]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an acute, severe, toxin-mediated disease, characterized by fever, hypotension, and multiorgan system involvement. Toxic shock syndrome has made headlines because of its high associated morbidity and mortality rate in previously healthy young females. Incidence peaked in the early 1980s owing to increased usage of ultra-absorbent tampons. After improved patient education and tampon labeling, the incidence of menstrual TSS has declined.

Case

A previously healthy 14-year-old girl presented to an urgent care center with a 2-day history of fever, erythematous maculopapular rash, vomiting, diarrhea, and malaise. She was found to be tachycardic and hypotensive. Investigations revealed thrombocytopenia, an elevated white count and lactate, and acute kidney injury, consistent with septic shock. Recent tampon usage with menstruation was reported, and a pelvic examination revealed purulent vaginal discharge. The patient was transferred to a pediatric intensive care unit for antibiotic and vasopressor therapy. Vaginal swabs later tested positive for Staphylococcus aureus and TSS toxin-1.

Conclusions

Although the incidence of TSS has decreased in recent years, it is crucial that clinicians rapidly recognize and treat this life-threatening condition. Emergency physicians should always have a high index of suspicion for TSS in young females presenting without another obvious cause of shock. A pelvic examination should always be completed in these cases.

### New and emerging therapies for women, girls, and people with the potential to menstruate with VWD [^11498dAo]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

BT200 (rondoraptivon pegol)

BT200 (rondoraptivon pegol) is a pegylated aptamer that binds to the VWF A1 domain and increases VWF and FVIII by decreasing the clearance of both molecules. Interestingly, its predecessor, ARC1779, was originally developed as an antithrombotic agent because of its ability to inhibit VWF–platelet interactions.BT200 has been studied in type 2B VWD in a prospective phase 2 trial. Participants initially received loading doses of 3 mg SC on days 1, 4, and 7, followed by 6 to 9 mg every week until day 28. Five patients, including 2 women, were included, and participant-level data presented. VWF and FVIII levels increased more than twofold, and platelet counts by more than threefold. In all patients with thrombocytopenia, plasma levels of VWF:GPIbM (glycoprotein Ib binding assay for VWF using recombinant mutated GPIb [no ristocetin]) and VWF–collagen binding increased, and high molecular weight multimers were restored. Data presented at the 2023 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis congress showed that BT200 prolongs VWF half-life by blocking its interaction with the macrophage scavenger receptor LRP1, providing in vitro support for a role beyond type 2B VWD. Further studies evaluating this molecule in larger numbers of patients with VWD, with bleeding end points, are necessary.

### Menstrual problems in chronic immune thrombocytopenia: a monthly challenge-a cohort study and review [^11479LyX]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study population and design

This study was performed in a subset of the "PICI" study, a cross‐sectional cohort study. The PICI study comprised 60 patients included between April 2019 and June 2021 at the University Medical Centre Utrecht (UMCU), who: (1) had a diagnosis of primary chronic ITP; (2) who were ≥ 16 years of age; (3) visited the outpatient clinic of our tertiary centre; and (4) gave written informed consent to participate in the study. Chronic primary ITP was defined as an ITP diagnosis of more than one year ago, a current platelet count of less than 100×10⁹/L or use of ITP‐treatment, and no indication of an underlying condition. The included patients were mainly patients who were currently in care of the clinic, but we also included patients who were visiting for a second opinion or re‐evaluation or were already referred back to the general practitioner or haematologist elsewhere. The PICI study was approved by the local Medical Ethical Committee (reference number: 18–585) and was conducted in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice guidelines.

The current study was performed in a subset of the PICI study, consisting of all premenopausal women with a uterus. Furthermore, the study reopened between February and May 2022 to include extra patients who fulfilled the criteria of the subset. For this extension, patients were recruited through the social media platforms of the Dutch ITP patient association.

Study procedures

The study procedures comprised blood withdrawal and the completion of several questionnaires in a single visit. One questionnaire, the pictorial bleeding assessment calendar (PBAC), was to be completed at home during one subsequent month and then sent back. Additionally, data were extracted from the electronic patient files.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 207: thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^112vpQL3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Practice Bulletin No. 207 — methodology and evidence grading for thrombocytopenia in pregnancy are outlined, including search parameters, study-quality levels, and recommendation grades. The literature search used MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and ACOG resources to identify articles published between January 1985 and July 2018, was restricted to English-language publications, prioritized original research, stated that abstracts of research presented at symposia and scientific conferences were not considered adequate for inclusion in this document, reviewed guidelines (e.g. National Institutes of Health and ACOG) and bibliographies, and used expert opinions when reliable research was not available. Studies were evaluated using the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force levels: I evidence obtained from at least one properly de-signed randomized controlled trial; II-1 evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization; II-2 evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case–control analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group; II-3 evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention, with dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments also regarded as this type of evidence; and III opinions of respected authorities based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees. Recommendations are graded by the highest evidence level as Level A (recommendations are based on good and consistent scientific evidence), Level B (recommendations are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence), and Level C (recommendations are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion).

### Cryptic conspirators: a conversation about thrombocytopenia and antiphospholipid syndrome [^114mFWq3]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Although APS is best known for its association with thrombotic events and pregnancy morbidity, thrombocytopenia is a common (perhaps the most common) 'extra-criteria' manifestation. Until the pathophysiology is better defined, the approach to when and how to treat will need to remain individualized. Furthermore, with the balance of evidence pointing to thrombocytopenia as a predictor of a more severe APS phenotype, we feel strongly that the cryptic conspirators of thrombocytopenia and APS warrant further investigation in animal models and prospective patient cohorts.

Management in heparin allergy or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia — The risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in the obstetric population is generally estimated at less than 0.1%. Guidelines recommend obtaining platelet counts at the initiation of anticoagulation when the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is greater than 1%; therefore, in the absence of other risk factors, most obstetric patients will not require platelet monitoring. In cases of severe cutaneous allergies or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in pregnancy, consultation with a hematologist is recommended, and fondaparinux may be the preferred anticoagulant. A retrospective comparison of fondaparinux with enoxaparin administered between day 6 of the menstrual cycle and continued until 12 weeks of gestation was unable to uncover net effects of fondaparinux on the woman or infant, but anticoagulant activity has been detected in umbilical cord blood of exposed fetuses.

### Menstrual problems in chronic immune thrombocytopenia: a monthly challenge-a cohort study and review [^113d1AQW]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

This study included 39 premenopausal women with a uterus, of whom 37 were included in the final analyses (Table 1). One woman was excluded from the analyses because she had no vaginal bleeding at the time of the study due to pregnancy. One other woman was excluded retrospectively because the ITP was found to be secondary to an underlying disease.

TABLE 1
Characteristics of the study population

Prevalence of

The PBAC data showed that 13 (39%) of the 33 patients who returned the PBAC had a score of ≥ 100. The median PBAC score was 88 (IQR 12–124). Concerning the ITP‐BAT HMB item, 14/35 (40%; two missing values) had a score of two, indicating HMB. None of the patients recently required hospital admission for menstrual problems, although one 17‐year old received intravenous immunoglobulins to raise the platelet count prior to an upcoming menstruation. Clinically, 29/37 (78%) had experienced menstrual problems now or in the past. These problems were considered controlled in 23 of them, although 8/21 (38%; two missing values) still had a PBAC score of ≥ 100. The clinical improvement in the eight patients with a present PBAC score of ≥ 100 was due to an IUD (n = 1), OCP (n = 2), tranexamic acid (n = 2), IUD/OCP and tranexamic acid combined (n = 1), (partial) remission of the ITP (n = 1), and an unknown reason (n = 1). Similarly, in the other 15 patients (13 with a PBAC score < 100, 2 with missing PBACs) patients, improvement of clinical problems was due to an IUD (n = 7), OCP (n = 1), contraceptive injections (n = 1), a vaginal ring (n = 1), tranexamic acid (n = 3), (partial) remission of the ITP (n = 1), and an unknown reason (n = 1). A higher PBAC score was found in patients with current clinical menstrual problems and/or a high score on the ITP‐BAT HMB item, although the relation with clinical menstrual problems was not statistically significant (Table 2).

### Heparin sodium (heparin sodium and dextrose) [^115ZLFeM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Fatal Medication Errors

Do not use this product as a "catheter lock flush" product. Heparin is supplied in various strengths. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred due to medication errors. Carefully examine all heparin products to confirm the correct container choice prior to administration of the drug.

5.2	Hemorrhage

Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving heparin sodium. Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks.

Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. An unexplained fall in hematocrit or fall in blood pressure should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event.

Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including:

Cardiovascular — Subacute bacterial endocarditis. Severe hypertension.
Surgical — During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord or eye.
Hematologic — Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras.
Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy – The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human).
Gastrointestinal — Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine.
Other — Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis.

Sodium and glycerol phenylbutyrate may also cause a range of side effects, but are usually limited to gastrointestinal distress with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. These symptoms are often dose‐dependent and may occur if high doses are required for treatment. Some patients may experience tiredness, fatigue, or drowsiness, as well as loss of appetite, which may lead to unintended weight loss, possibly even leading to a vicious circle perpetuating hyperammonemia. There may also be effects on blood cells, including leukocytopenia and thrombocytopenia, although these are less common and typically occur in patients younger than 2 years. Allergic responses, including skin rashes, itching, or more severe hypersensitivity reactions, can occur but are rare.

Besides these aforementioned adverse events, it has been observed that phenylbutyrate, particularly when used over long periods, may have an impact on ovarian function. Approximately one quarter of fertile female patients reported irregular periods or a complete abstinence of their menstruation. The exact mechanisms by which this could occur are not fully understood. As a HDAC inhibitor, sodium phenylbutyrate has the ability to alter gene expression, which could theoretically affect reproductive hormones and ovarian function. More research into understanding the pathogenesis of this adverse effect is needed, also to evaluate long term risks on reproductive health and the endocrine system.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 207: thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^113zwbrY]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Definition of thrombocytopenia — reference ranges in pregnancy and nonpregnancy: The normal platelet count in nonpregnant individuals is 165–415 × 10⁹/L, and in pregnant women thrombocytopenia has traditionally been defined as a platelet count less than 150 × 10⁹/L. During pregnancy, laboratory ranges vary by trimester with a gradual decrease as pregnancy progresses, and women in the third trimester have significantly lower mean platelet levels than nonpregnant women. The definition is described as somewhat arbitrary and not necessarily clinically relevant; in two prospective observational trials of more than 11,000 pregnant women, mean platelet count in the last month of pregnancy at or delivery ranged from 213 × 10⁹/L to 228 × 10⁹/L, with lower normal limits varying from 116 × 10⁹/L to 123 × 10⁹/L.

### Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^117TPuSM]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2022). Medium credibility.

Hematologists are often consulted for thrombocytopenia in pregnancy, especially when there is a concern for a non-pregnancy-specific etiology or an insufficient platelet count for the hemostatic challenges of delivery. The severity of thrombocytopenia and trimester of onset can help guide the differential diagnosis. Hematologists need to be aware of the typical signs of preeclampsia with severe features and other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy to help distinguish these conditions, which typically resolve with delivery, from other thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) (eg, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or complement-mediated TMA). Patients with chronic thrombocytopenic conditions, such as immune thrombocytopenia, should receive counseling on the safety and efficacy of various medications during pregnancy. The management of pregnant patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia who are refractory to first-line treatments is an area that warrants further research. This review uses a case-based approach to discuss recent updates in diagnosing and managing thrombocytopenia in pregnancy.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^115XZsxe]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

What if the immune thrombocytopenia is secondary to other blood disorders?

While chronic lymphocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome would be very unlikely in our patient given her young age, other clinical conditions could be present, such as autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. It has not yet been decided which tests should be performed to search for specific conditions, particularly if there are not specific symptoms or conditions suggesting a particular entity. We assay immunoglobulin levels and do thyroid tests in our patients, as we certainly did in this young woman. Ideally in the future there would be an established panel of tests for patients with putative ITP which would explore inherited thrombocytopenias, bone marrow failure, secondary ITP, other diagnoses that could resemble ITP such as myelodysplastic syndrome, markers of the future course of the ITP, the degree of bleeding, and to which treatments the patient would respond best.

What is the optimal second-line treatment for a young female with immune thrombocytopenia?

There are numerous options that can be considered in this non-pregnant premenopausal female (Table 1)

Rituximab

Rituximab and other (generic) anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies exert immunosuppressive effects by depleting B lymphocytes. This occurs uniformly in the blood and bone marrow but what happens to B cells in lymph nodes is not well-defined. Women under the age of 40 years with a less than 2-year history of ITP usually respond to rituximab, with the response rate and especially the "cure" rate being high. If our patient and her hematologist opt for rituximab, she would receive four infusions of 375 mg/mweekly for 4 weeks. If she has a good response, close monitoring may not be needed. While studies have not determined the optimal dose, 375 mg/monce a week for 4 weeks is the most commonly used dosing regiman. The addition of dexamethasone to the rituximab may provide an extra "curative" effect via the former's anti-plasma cell effect, although it also increases the risk of hypogammaglobulinemia. Administration of dexamethasone would reduce the first-infusion side effects of rituximab, and our patient could stop the steroid after one or two cycles if she does not tolerate it well instead of completing three cycles.

### Bleeding disorders: a common cause of menorrhagia in adolescents [^113bfpbR]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the frequency of underlying bleeding disorders in adolescents with menorrhagia.

Study Design

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all girls, aged 10 to 19 years, who presented to our children's hospital for inpatient or outpatient evaluation of menorrhagia between January 1990 and November 1998.

Results

At presentation, 9 of the 71 girls (13%) had thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 150,000/microL; range, 5000–106,000/microL). The most common causes for thrombocytopenia were immune thrombocytopenic purpura (n = 5) and myelosuppression caused by chemotherapy (n = 2). Of 14 girls who underwent a more detailed hemostatic evaluation, 8 were given a diagnosis of a hereditary coagulation disorder: 6 had platelet function defects and 2 had type 1 von Willebrand disease. Excessive menstrual bleeding commonly results in anemia. One half of the total group had anemia (hemoglobin < 12.0 g/dL). Seven girls (10%) had potentially life-threatening anemia (hemoglobin < 5.0 g/dL).

Conclusions

Acquired and congenital bleeding disorders are common causes of menorrhagia in adolescent girls. Severe anemia is a frequent complication of menorrhagia. We recommend that adolescents without thrombocytopenia who present with menorrhagia receive a comprehensive hemostatic evaluation, including testing for von Willebrand disease and platelet function defects.

### Major differences in clinical presentation, diagnosis and management of men and women with autosomal inherited bleeding disorders [^113wdvAW]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

CPDs are disorders of primary hemostasis caused by defects in adhesion, activation, secretion, or aggregation of platelets. Patients typically present with mucocutaneous bleeds or persistent bleeding following a hemostatic challenge such as dental extraction, invasive procedures or childbirth.

Although the autosomal inheritance pattern of these bleeding disorders should lead to an equal distribution amongst men and women, differences in prevalence have been reported. Moreover, increasingly more awareness is raised in recent years about sex-specific problems in patients with inherited bleeding disorders due to menstruation and delivery as physiologic hemostatic challenges in women. To our knowledge, no comprehensive studies have been conducted yet to investigate sex differences in symptoms, diagnosis and management of patients with autosomal inherited bleeding disorders.

Therefore, we investigated sex-specific differences in clinical phenotype, diagnosis and management of men and women with autosomal inherited bleeding disorders in a large cohort of well-defined patients with VWD, RBDs and CPDs from three nationwide cross-sectional studies in the Netherlands.

### Requirements for research investigations to clarify the relationships and management of menstrual abnormalities in women with hemostatic disorders [^111fMAv7]. Fertility and Sterility (2005). Low credibility.

This article highlights a comprehensive range of research investigations which are required to clarify the relationships between the symptom of excessively heavy menstrual bleeding and different disorders of systemic hemostasis and their management. The need for these investigations was stimulated by an international workshop involving hematologists and gynecologists with expertise and interests in these fields. The field was reviewed by a group of experts who systematically considered nomenclature, definitions, investigations, and management and identified areas of uncertainty, controversy, or absence of information. This article is an extension of those preliminary research discussions. Recommendations are made for a range of important research studies to define the nomenclature, definitions, mechanisms, clinical investigations and management of heavy menstrual bleeding in women with disorders of systemic hemostasis.

### Women with bleeding disorders [^116jqXaH]. Journal of Women's Health (2007). Low credibility.

Menorrhagia, or excessive menstrual bleeding, is a common clinical problem affecting reproductive-age women; however, the cause is undetermined in 50% of cases. Von Willebrand disease (VWD) or other bleeding disorders may be the underlying source of heavy bleeding. Women with menorrhagia and/or VWD are at increased risk for several conditions including anemia, bleeding during pregnancy, post-partum hemorrhage, and reduced quality of life (OOL). Proper diagnosis and management can decrease complications and unnecessary surgical interventions.

Impact of

The median MMAS score was 79 (IQR 60–95). Only in 9/37 (24%) patients, menstruation did not at all affect daily life (MMAS score of 100). The MMAS score correlated with the PBAC score (ρ −0.55, corrected p ‐value 0.02). The group with the worst MMAS scores was the group who experienced clinical menstrual problems at the time of the study (51 [IQR 17–54]) (Table 2).

Associated factors with the amount of blood loss or impact of heavy menstrual bleeding: Explorative analyses

Hormonal therapy and antifibrinolytics

The relation between hormonal therapy and PBAC and MMAS scores are depicted in Figure 1A, B, respectively. All 11 patients with an IUD had a levonorgestrel‐IUD (LNG‐IUD) (Mirena in 10 patients, Kyleena in 1 patient). PBAC scores were remarkably better for patients with an LNG‐IUD than for patients with OCP or without contraceptives (p = 0.01). MMAS scores were similar among the contraception groups (p = 0.32). There was no significant difference in PBAC scores between patients with and without tranexamic acid (p = 1.00). The MMAS scores were worse in tranexamic acid users than in non‐tranexamic acid users, although not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing (56 [IQR 20–65] vs. 85 [63–100], p = 0.17). The median MMAS scores in patients who used tranexamic acid were the lowest after patients with current clinical menstrual problems.

### Mitotane (Lysodren) [^111YZee8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Ovarian Macrocysts in Premenopausal Women

LYSODREN can cause non-malignant, multiple and bilateral ovarian macrocysts in premenopausal women.

Ovarian macrocysts can be symptomatic (e.g., pelvic pain or discomfort, or menstrual irregularities) or asymptomatic.

Complications from these cysts, including adnexal torsion and hemorrhagic cyst rupture, have occurred.

Advise female patients to contact their healthcare provider immediately for gynecological symptoms such as vaginal bleeding and/or pelvic pain [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Monitor pelvic imaging in premenopausal females at baseline and in regular intervals during treatment with LYSODREN.

Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue LYSODREN based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.4 Hepatotoxicity

LYSODREN can cause hepatoxicity, including liver injury or failure.

Monitor liver function tests prior to starting treatment with LYSODREN, during dose titration, and periodically during treatment as clinically indicated.

Isolated gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) elevation may occur.

Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue LYSODREN based on severity of hepatoxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.5 Hematologic toxicity

LYSODREN can cause leukopenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Monitor complete blood counts including neutrophil count prior to starting treatment with LYSODREN, during dose titration, and periodically during treatment as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue LYSODREN based on severity of cytopenia [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.6 Prolonged Bleeding Time

LYSODREN can cause platelet function disorders due to abnormal adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation. Some patients may have a prolonged bleeding time, while others may have a normal bleeding time.

Routine in vitro bleeding time is not suitable to detect this platelet defect and to assess bleeding risk.

Perform ADP-inducted platelet aggregometry testing prior to surgery or dental procedures to determine mitotane-induced bleeding risk. For patients with prolonged bleeding time, withhold or reduce the dose of LYSODREN as clinically indicated.

5.7 Hormone binding protein

Mitotane has been shown to increase plasma levels of hormone binding proteins (e.g., sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG)). This should be taken into account when interpreting the results of hormonal assays and may result in gynecomastia.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 207: thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^111wrhnT]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Maternal immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) — definitions and classification: ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of less than 100×10⁹/L in the absence of other etiologies. Primary ITP is an acquired immune-mediated disorder with isolated thrombocytopenia without an obvious initiating or underlying cause, whereas "secondary" ITP includes immune-mediated thrombocytopenia due to an underlying disease or drug exposure. ITP is classified by duration into newly diagnosed, persistent (3–12 months), and chronic (12 months or more), and in pregnancy it affects approximately 1 in 1,000–10,000 pregnancies.

Heavy menstrual bleeding – PBAC score and menstrual cup measurement

In addition to the subjective, self‐reported prevalence of HMB, PBAC and menstruation cup measurement were used to objectively quantify blood loss during menstruation. In all, 11 of the 25 women who were still menstruating completed the PBAC (10) or menstruation cup assessment (one), during 22 menstruations in total. The median (range) PBAC score was 59 (21–699) and median menstrual cup measurement was 89 ml; these results are indicative for (ongoing) HMB in three of the 11 women despite eight receiving HMB treatment. Women with ongoing HMB had a natural menstrual cycle (two) or treatment with oral contraceptives (one). Of the eight women without HMB currently, seven received hormonal treatment (three, IUD; and four oral contraceptives) and one had a natural cycle. No further analyses were made due to limited amount of available data.

### Etiology and diagnosis of heavy menstrual bleeding among adolescent and adult patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature [^114dGGfe]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is excessive menstrual blood loss that interferes with an individual's quality of life. Many individuals with HMB are inadequately managed by health care providers.

Objectives

This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the etiologies and diagnosis of HMB while calculating the prevalence of underlying causes among premenopausal patients and quantifying the test accuracy of diagnostic strategies.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched since inception to include studies investigating the prevalence of underlying etiology and diagnostic accuracy of investigations for HMB. The primary outcome was the prevalence of the causes of HMB, secondary outcome included the prevalence of etiology by age. Meta-analyses were conducted via random-effects model.

Results

In total, 53 studies were included. Forty-five studies included data on the prevalence of underlying HMB etiology, totaling 41 541 patients. The overall prevalence of bleeding disorders was 30% (95% CI, 14–46); von Willebrand disease, 8% (95% CI, 7–10); platelet function defect, 9% (95% CI, 7–12); abnormal thyroid, 3% (95% CI, 0–6); and polycystic ovarian syndrome, 8% (95% CI, 4–12). Subgroup analysis showed bleeding disorders were prevalent in 16% (95% CI, -8 to 41) of adults with HMB but in 39% (95% CI 18–60) of adolescents with HMB.

Conclusion

Many diagnoses were associated with bleeding disorders and, therefore, warrant investigation when assessing a patient with HMB of unknown etiology. The causes are likely age dependent and should be considered when diagnosing HMB.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) general supportive care for patients who prefer not to receive blood transfusions includes the following: There is no established treatment of AML that does not require the use of blood and blood products for supportive care. Discuss goals of care and understanding of complications without transfusion, clarify acceptance of certain blood products (eg, cryoprecipitate) under certain circumstances including whether stem cells (donor or autologous) will be acceptable, and minimize risk of bleeding including consideration for use of oral contraceptive pills or medroxyprogesterone acetate in menstruating individuals; proton pump inhibitor, aggressive antiemetic prophylaxis, and stool softeners are advised to reduce risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed; nasal saline sprays are advised to reduce epistaxis; and fall precautions are advised, particularly in patients with thrombocytopenia. Avoid concomitant medicines or procedures that can increase the risk of bleeding or myelosuppression; consider using vitamin K (to potentially reverse coagulopathy) and aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid in patients at risk of bleeding (eg, when platelet count drops below 30 × 10⁹/L) or for management of bleeding; consider use of aminocaproic acid rinses for oral bleeding or significant mucositis that could result in bleeding; consider using acetaminophen to manage fever; consider iron, folate, and vitamin B12 supplementation if deficient with iron supplementation avoided in someone with excess iron levels; consider use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA), G-CSF, and thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetics after a thorough discussion of potential risks, benefits, and uncertainties; and consider bed rest and supplemental oxygenation in patients with severe anemia.

### Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^111qf54j]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy is most frequently a benign process that does not require intervention. However, 35% of cases of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy are related to disease processes that may have serious bleeding consequences at delivery or for which thrombocytopenia may be an indicator of a more severe systemic disorder requiring emergent maternal and fetal care. Thus, all pregnant women with platelet counts less than 100,000/μL require careful hematological and obstetric consultation to exclude more serious disorders.

### Diagnosis and management of maternal thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^1121u5bd]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common finding in pregnancy, occurring in approximately 7–10% of pregnancies. It may be a diagnostic and management problem, and has many causes, some of which are specific to pregnancy. Although most cases of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy are mild, and have no adverse outcome for either mother or baby, occasionally a low platelet count may be part of a more complex disorder with significant morbidity and may be life-threatening. Overall, about 75% of cases are due to gestational thrombocytopenia, 15–20% secondary to hypertensive disorders; 3–4% due to an immune process, and the remaining 1–2% made up of rare constitutional thrombocytopenias, infections and malignancies. In this review, a diagnostic approach to investigating thrombocytopenia in pregnancy is presented, together with antenatal, anaesthetic and peri-natal management issues for mother and baby, followed by a detailed discussion on the specific causes of thrombocytopenia and the management options in each case.

### The prevalence of thrombocytopenia among pregnant women in Ethiopia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116dS3fs]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hematological changes, including significant changes in blood volume, take place throughout pregnancy to meet the needs of the growing fetus and placenta. The direct effects of progesterone and estrogen on the kidney, which result in the release of renin and the activation of the aldosterone renin-angiotensin system, cause an average rise in plasma volume of 40 to 45%. As a result, there is an increase in body water overall and renal sodium retention. However, due to hemodilution, increased platelet activation, and consumption, especially in the third trimester, the platelet count drops during pregnancy. According to studies, pregnant women are four times more likely than non-pregnant women to have low platelet count.

Thrombocytopenia is a disorder characterized by a decreased platelet count. Between 6 and 15% of pregnancies are affected by it, which is the second most common cause of hematological abnormalities during pregnancy next to anemia. Human platelet counts typically range from 150,000 to 450,000/ mm 3. Platelet counts below 150,000 cells/mcL are considered to be indicative of thrombocytopenia, which can be mild (100,000–150,000/ mm 3), moderate (50,000–100,000/ mm 3), or severe (less than 50,000/mm 3).

Most low platelet counts during pregnancy are brought on by gestational thrombocytopenia (GT), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), or preeclampsia. Other causes include illnesses such as leukemia and aplastic anemia as well as infections such as malaria or a folate deficiency.

Pregnant women with thrombocytopenia are more likely to experience excessive bleeding during or after delivery, especially if they require a cesarean section or other type of medical procedure during pregnancy or labor. When the platelet count is less than 50,000/mm 3, such bleeding issues are more prone to occur.

Pregnancy-related thrombocytopenia has led to needless, frequently invasive extra tests and cesarean deliveries. The diagnosis and care for this ailment can be costly, upsetting for the patient, and have unfavorable effects. Pregnancy-related thrombocytopenia is poorly recognized and treated. Although it has been discussed in numerous types of research, it is crucial to conduct a more thorough analysis, such as a meta-analysis, to clarify the pooled prevalence and variability between various samples due to the variety of the numbers discovered in different studies. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of thrombocytopenia among pregnant women in Ethiopia.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding as the presenting symptom of hematologic cancer [^111huFp6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the percentage of women with a hematologic cancer who present with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB).

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of the records of women with hematologic malignancies treated at our institution from January 2002 through January 2016. Women with AUB as the chief presenting symptom were identified.

Results

Of the 10,682 women with hematologic malignancies, 38 had AUB as their chief presenting symptom. These women were young (median age 34 years), premenopausal, and otherwise healthy. The top four additional presenting symptoms were fatigue, dyspnea or shortness of breath, bruising or petechiae, and fever, with means (95% confidence interval) of 58% (41–74%), 42% (26–59%), 42% (26–59%), and 24% (11–40%), respectively. The complete blood count on initial presentation with AUB revealed that 33 (87%) women had anemia (mean hemoglobin level 8.6 g/dL) and 34 (89%) had thrombocytopenia (mean platelet count 81,000/microliter). Twelve (32%) women had neutropenia, eight (21%) women had normal white blood cell counts, and 18 (47%) women had leukocytosis. Thirty-three women (87%) were diagnosed with acute leukemia, one with myelodysplastic syndrome (3%) and four (11%) with chronic leukemia.

Conclusion

We estimate the incidence of AUB as the chief presenting symptom is 3.6 cases per 1,000 women with hematologic cancer. These young, otherwise healthy women who present with acute, new-onset heavy menstrual bleeding in conjunction with thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia should be referred to hematology for evaluation of possible hematologic malignancy.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^114mPBmp]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Section IV: Third-line therapy for immune thrombocytopenia and beyond

What happens if the thrombopoietin agent used in the two patients does not work or at least cannot be tapered?

In the case of the young woman, the platelet count remained less than 20×10⁹/L and the young woman had heavy menses, bruising and nosebleeds. The now 26-year-old woman opted for rituximab. She had a long-term response but unfortunately relapsed after 4 years. She considered repeating the rituximab and undergoing splenectomy but opted to try a different thrombopoietin agent since she was not planning another pregnancy in the immediate future. Previously she used eltrombopag so she now tried avatrombopag. On a dose of 20 mg/day she was able to maintain an adequate platelet count and is very slowly tapering her dose. This choice was consistent with evidence that not responding well to one TPO-RA does not preclude good response to another.

Our older, male patient, given his continued bruising and minor nosebleeds, was afraid of major bleeding; he also felt very tired even though he was not anemic. The now 64-year-old man opted to try rituximab since avatrombopag did not work well for him. He received the standard dose of rituximab with dexamethasone. He responded which a platelet count of 60×10⁹/L by 6 weeks after initiating treatment; however, his count started to fall monthly down to 30×10⁹/L. He and his doctor decided to initiate mycophenolate mofetil and he began with a dose of 500 mg twice daily and then increased to 1000 mg twice a day. He tolerates this treatment well and his platelet counts remain around 40–50×10⁹/L.

Thus, both patients needed treatment. Some patients with low (not very low) platelet counts who have no bleeding or other issues e.g. need for anticoagulants or fatigue, may not require treatment. Avoiding treatment is always optimal if this does not jeopardize quality of life.

Section I. A young female patient with immune thrombocytopenia: second-line treatment options

The patient's history

A 20-year-old female returns home from college. She notes heavier periods and easy bruising. Her internist sees that she is pale and has visible petechiae on her arms. Complete blood counts show mild anemia (hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 5×10⁹/L The internist sends her urgently to the emergency room concerned that she might possibly have leukemia. There is no hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy or other abnormal findings on physical examination.

Review of a peripheral blood smear reveals no blasts or abnormalities of other cell lines although her mean corpuscular volume is low (72 fL) and several of her very few platelets are large. She is diagnosed with ITP and given prednisone 1 mg/kg. Over the next few days, she has typical steroid-related side effects: feeling "a little crazy", insomnia and abdominal pain. Her bruises and petechiae disappear, and her period ends. Her hematologist prescribes oral iron supplements and changes her prednisone to dexamethasone 40 mg daily for 4 days. Her steroid-related side effects worsen during the 4 days on dexamethasone 40 mg; however, she soon feels better with no further petechiae, bruising, or menstrual bleeding noted. Her platelet count normalizes to 147×10⁹/L and her hemoglobin improves to 11.2 g/dL. She begins checking her blood counts monthly. The improved complete blood count with a nearly normal mean corpuscular volume excludes bone marrow failure, and also thalassemia trait or microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Similarly, the normal hemoglobin and neutrophil count do not suggest Evans syndrome. Her platelet counts remain in the normal range and her hemoglobin improves to the normal range. At her next visit, her platelet count has decreased to 80×10⁹/L. One month later, her platelet count is 28×10⁹/L with continued normal hemoglobin and infrequent small bruises. With her platelets trending downward, second-line treatment for her ITP is considered.

There is less urgency to consider secondary ITP or a missed diagnosis since she is doing well but at any change of management, it is good practice to re-evaluate. Below we consider some of the " what if " clinical scenarios for this young female.

ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 207 — platelet count thresholds for gestational thrombocytopenia versus ITP: In asymptomatic pregnant women with no history of bleeding problems, maternal thrombocytopenia between 100 × 10⁹/L and 149 × 10⁹/L is usually due to gestational thrombocytopenia, whereas a platelet count less than 100 × 10⁹/L is more suggestive of ITP and a platelet count less than 50 × 10⁹/L is almost certainly due to ITP. Gestational thrombocytopenia typically manifests later in pregnancy, and in the third trimester or postpartum the sudden onset of significant maternal thrombocytopenia should lead to consideration of preeclampsia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic uremic syndrome, acute fatty liver, or disseminated intravascular coagulation.
