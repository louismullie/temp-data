## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to estimate the angular diameter of Betelgeuse from a stellar interferometer observation where fringe visibility drops to zero at a baseline of 3 meters for a wavelength in the middle of the visible spectrum. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physics of stellar interferometry and the visibility function. Then, I should verify the formula that relates the first null in visibility to angular diameter. Next, I will choose a representative mid-visible wavelength and plug in the numbers. After that, I should double-check unit conversions, especially from radians to arcseconds. Finally, I will compare the result to the provided options and consider whether any assumptions need adjustment.

> Let me first confirm the physical principle. In a two-aperture stellar interferometer, the fringe visibility depends on the spatial coherence of the starlight, which is reduced as the baseline increases. For a uniform circular source, the visibility function has a first zero when the baseline times the angular diameter equals about 1.22 times the wavelength, analogous to the Airy pattern's first minimum in diffraction, so the first null condition is Bθ ≈ 1.22λ, where B is the baseline, θ is the angular diameter, and λ is the wavelength.

> Wait, let me verify the exact formula and its interpretation. The visibility V for a uniform disk is given by V = |2J1(x)/x|, where x = πBθ/λ and J1 is the first-order Bessel function; the first zero of J1 occurs at x ≈ 3.83, which corresponds to πBθ/λ ≈ 3.83, so Bθ ≈ 1.22λ. Thus, at the first null, θ ≈ 1.22λ/B, which is the relation I should use to estimate the angular diameter from the baseline at zero visibility.

> I need to check the wavelength choice. The problem says "middle of the visible spectrum". A common representative value is around 550 nm, which is close to green and often used as a canonical visible wavelength. I will use λ = 550 nm = 5.50 × 10^-7 m, but I should keep in mind that if I picked 500 nm or 600 nm the answer would shift by about 10% in either direction, which could affect which option is closest.

> Now, I will plug in the numbers. With B = 3.0 m and λ = 5.50 × 10^-7 m, θ ≈ 1.22 × (5.50 × 10^-7 m) / (3.0 m) ≈ 2.24 × 10^-7 radians. Hold on, I should verify the unit conversion to arcseconds. 1 radian ≈ 206265 arcseconds, so θ ≈ 2.24 × 10^-7 × 206265 ≈ 0.046 arcseconds. That matches option A, but wait, let me double-check the arithmetic to avoid a rounding error.

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the calculation gave 0.045 arcseconds, but on rechecking, 2.24 × 10^-7 × 206265 is closer to 0.046 arcseconds, so option A is indeed the best match. If I had used 500 nm, I would get about 0.042 arcseconds, and at 600 nm about 0.050 arcseconds, which would still keep the closest option as A, though the exact value drifts slightly with wavelength choice.

> I should confirm whether any of the provided references directly cite Betelgeuse's angular diameter to validate plausibility. Contemporary interferometric measurements of Betelgeuse report a uniform-disk angular diameter around 19–20 milliarcseconds, which is about 0.019–0.020 arcseconds, so my estimate of roughly 0.046 arcseconds is about a factor of 2.3 too large. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — this discrepancy likely reflects that the "first null" calculation assumes a uniform-disk model and ideal conditions, whereas real stars have limb darkening and complex atmospheres that modify the visibility function and shift the null to somewhat longer baselines, meaning the true angular diameter is smaller than the uniform-disk estimate from the first null. Thus, the calculation is internally consistent with the physics, but the uniform-disk approximation overestimates the diameter compared with modern limb-darkened fits, which explains why the options include values smaller than 0.046 arcseconds and why the closest uniform-disk estimate still points to option A.

> Final answer: Given the first-null condition and a mid-visible wavelength of 550 nm, the uniform-disk angular diameter is approximately 0.046 arcseconds, which corresponds to option A. I should emphasize again that the uniform-disk model overestimates the true limb-darkened angular diameter of Betelgeuse by a factor of about 2, so the correct astrophysical diameter is nearer 0.02 arcseconds, but among the provided choices, the uniform-disk estimate selects A.

The angular diameter of Betelgeuse is **0.046 arcseconds**, calculated from the first null in visibility at a 3 m baseline using the formula θ = 1.22λ/B, where λ = 550 nm (mid-visible) and B = 3 m. This matches option A.

## Calculation

Key parameters:

- **Baseline (B)**: 3 m
- **Wavelength (λ)**: 550 nm (mid-visible)
- **Formula**: θ = 1.22λ/B

Substitute values:

θ = 1.22 × 550 × 10⁻⁹ m / 3 m\
θ = 2.24 × 10⁻⁷ rad\
θ = 2.24 × 10⁻⁷ × 206265 arcsec/rad\
θ ≈ 0.046 arcseconds

---

## Conclusion

The calculated angular diameter is **0.046 arcseconds**, which corresponds to option A.

### A dusty veil shading betelgeuse during its great dimming [^116h37M7]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Red supergiants are the most common final evolutionary stage of stars that have initial masses between 8 and 35 times that of the Sun 1. During this stage, which lasts roughly 100,000 years 1, red supergiants experience substantial mass loss. However, the mechanism for this mass loss is unknown 2. Mass loss may affect the evolutionary path, collapse and future supernova light curve 3 of a red supergiant, and its ultimate fate as either a neutron star or a black hole 4. From November 2019 to March 2020, Betelgeuse-the second-closest red supergiant to Earth (roughly 220 parsecs, or 724 light years, away) 5,6 -experienced a historic dimming of its visible brightness. Usually having an apparent magnitude between 0.1 and 1.0, its visual brightness decreased to 1.614 ± 0.008 magnitudes around 7–13 February 2020 7 -an event referred to as Betelgeuse's Great Dimming. Here we report high-angular-resolution observations showing that the southern hemisphere of Betelgeuse was ten times darker than usual in the visible spectrum during its Great Dimming. Observations and modelling support a scenario in which a dust clump formed recently in the vicinity of the star, owing to a local temperature decrease in a cool patch that appeared on the photosphere. The directly imaged brightness variations of Betelgeuse evolved on a timescale of weeks. Our findings suggest that a component of mass loss from red supergiants 8 is inhomogeneous, linked to a very contrasted and rapidly changing photosphere.

### Scalable photonic-based nulling interferometry with the dispersed multi-baseline GLINT instrument [^114NPGUH]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy of spectral dispersion, the stellar diameter was also obtained from spectrally binned null depth data over the same bandwidth. The found diameter is 24.2 ± 1.7 mas, which is systematically larger than the established value (between 19.1 and 20.4 mas). This overestimation of null depth is explained by the fact the fringes of the two baselines N5 and N6 could not be set to the central dark fringe (Fig. 3 e) causing a systematic loss of coherence. The spectrally dispersed signal allows this to be accounted for in the model resulting in the delivery of the expected value of null depths.

The histograms of the null depths for δ Vir were processed and fitted in the same way. As before, the four source null data points yield an excellent fit to the model (Fig. 8 b), which in turn is in agreement with literature expectations for this star (expected UD diameter of 10.6 mas). The angular diameter found is 10.9 ± 0.1 mas with a reduced χ 2 of 11.2 where the uncertainty has been rescaled as before. As for α Boo, the high χ 2 betrays the presence of systematic errors not taken into account in the measurement of the null depth, such as high-frequency phase jitter. One option would be to combine the self-calibration with a standard PSF-reference star calibration.

### A laboratory demonstration of the capability to image an earth-like extrasolar planet [^113q3XFs]. Nature (2007). Excellent credibility.

The detection and characterization of an Earth-like planet orbiting a nearby star requires a telescope with an extraordinarily large contrast at small angular separations. At visible wavelengths, an Earth-like planet would be 1 x 10(-10) times fainter than the star at angular separations of typically 0.1 arcsecond or less. There are several proposed space telescope systems that could, in principle, achieve this. Here we report a laboratory experiment that reaches these limits. We have suppressed the diffracted and scattered light near a star-like source to a level of 6 x 10(-10) times the peak intensity in individual coronagraph images. In a series of such images, together with simple image processing, we have effectively reduced this to a residual noise level of about 0.1 x 10(-10). This demonstrates that a coronagraphic telescope in space could detect and spectroscopically characterize nearby exoplanetary systems, with the sensitivity to image an 'Earth-twin' orbiting a nearby star.

### A history of visual acuity testing and optotypes [^1114Rtmv]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

The Greeks had no documented knowledge about ophthalmic optics but they did have two theories about the seeing mechanism: The emanating or emission theory in which the eye sends rays towards objects to be seen and the immission or intromission concept of Aristotle and Epicure in which objects send rays towards the eye. Nevertheless, Euclid, a mathematician living 300 BCE in Alexandria, postulated important axioms. He stated that the rays emanating from the eye move in straight lines, that they form a cone with its tip in the eye and its base on the visible object, and that we can only see objects on which rays fall. He tried to prove that there exists a minimum visible and a minimum separable angle (Fig. 1). Thus, Euclid correctly formulated our present view that VA depends on the smallest visual angle that fits an object in the cone of vision, with its tip on a photoreceptor in the retina. In a Latin translation AD 1350 of Euclid's Greek book it says next to a geometric figure with points a, b and d "Sit igitur minimus angulus abd determinatus visui" (thus the minimum angle abd of vision should be determined) and that seems to be the first time that the expression "minimum angle" appeared. The Arab scientists Avicenna and Alhazen disproved around AD 1000 the Greek emission theory.

Fig. 1
The visual angle and its minimums.

The visual angle V is the angle the chief rays from object AB subtend at the nodal point O of the eye, usually expressed in degrees, minutes or seconds of arc. The central one of the three lines from A and B to O is the chief ray. The nodal point O of the eye lies about in the middle of the lens. The minimum visual angle is the smallest angle under which a stimulus S can be seen. The minimum separable angle is the minimum angle under which an observer can see two adjacent high-contrast stimuli. Visual acuity, measured with optotypes, is expressed as the reciprocal of the smallest visual angle in minutes of arc at which two objects are seen separately.

### Daylight space debris laser ranging [^114VAtgZ]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Methods

A guideline to daylight observations

The visibility of space debris objects during daytime is limited by the contrast against the sky background. The contrast and brightness on a detector is influenced by the diffraction limit of the optics, objects' dimensions, the field of view per detector pixel, atmospheric seeing, and the exposure time of the detector. To reach optimal contrast the telescope aperture should be chosen large enough to minimize the size of the Airy disk on the sensor. The angle of the first Airy minimum (Θ a) of a star is connected to the wavelength of light λ and the aperture diameter of the telescope d via Θ a = 1.22 λ / d.

Reducing the size of the Airy disk (increasing the telescope aperture) while staying in perfect focus maximizes the light concentrated on each individual pixel, directly increasing contrast at a given detector field of view. The detector and focal length of the telescope should be chosen in a way that the field of view per pixel matches the angular size of the object on the sky. A field of view per pixel larger than the object size on the sensor (undersampling) will decrease the contrast as the pixel relatively gathers more skylight than light from the object. Reducing the field of view per pixel (f p) below the object size will equally decrease skylight and object light and the contrast will remain unaffected. Due to atmospheric turbulences at very short exposure times in the order of a few milliseconds the image shows speckles. These individual distorted images of the star correspond to the current atmospheric conditions. Speckles also distribute the intensity of the object across the sensor but each individual speckle will remain diffraction limited. The field of view per pixel should hence be fitted to the Airy disk and not to the seeing. What should be avoided though are longer exposure times which let pixels accumulate sky light while not being exposed to starlight.

### Matter-wave interference of a native polypeptide [^117UQs6j]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Grating lasers

The grating laser beams are emitted by three GAM EX50 fluorine lasers (λ L = 157.6 nm, 4 mJ, 8 ns, flat top profile). All beams are reflected by the same dielectric mirror 3 × 5 cm 2, coated onto a 2 cm thick CaF 2 substrate with the best technically available reflectivity in this wavelength range to date, i.e. R ≃ 97%. The laser waists are elongated parallel to the molecular beam axis z (10 × 1 mm 2) and spatially separated by ≈2 cm which allows molecules of different velocities to interact with a laser grating at the same time.

Mirror imperfections

For a perfectly flat mirror and in the absence of external accelerations, S N is positive and equal to the theoretical visibility. In a real world scenario, S N is given by the visibility of the molecular density pattern at the position of G (3) and its relative displacement Δ D = Δ x 1 −2 Δ x 2 + Δ x 3 of this Talbot image with respect to G (3). Here, Δ x i captures both the possible mirror corrugations at either grating site or the displacement of the molecular fringe due to external accelerations — for instance gravity. The molecular transmission is maximized for Δ D = n d and minimized for Δ D = (n + 1∕2) d with. If the mirror surface had deformations exceeding 10 nm across the 10 mm grating laser beam profile, molecules of the same gas pulse but with different velocities would experience differently shifted interferometers. To avoid the ensuing reduction in fringe contrast, the effective grating width is set to < 3 mm by the geometry of the final detection laser.

Vibrational stability

The most important vibration frequencies in the experiment are related to the frequencies of the turbomolecular pumps. Taking 3000 Hz as a higher order worst case scenario the amplitude required for a 1∕ e contrast reduction is ≈15 nm, while the noise at that frequency is estimated to be ≈1 nm.

Coriolis force

Considering the latitude (48.22 ∘ N) and orientation (162 ∘ SSE) of the molecular beam on Earth and assuming a velocity of 600 ms −1 the Coriolis force on gramicidin causes a shift of around 1 nm. Even for large velocity spreads phase averaging can be neglected. Also path-length differences arising from the Coriolis force are negligible for the mass considered here.

### Dark-field chest X-ray imaging for the assessment of COVID-19-pneumonia [^114UW2ZU]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

This large-scale system posed challenges previously not encountered. As the production of large area absorbing gratings with a high aspect ratio remains challenging, the analyser grating consists of six separate tiles. To prevent shadowing resulting from the cone beam geometry of the setup, we designed a grating holder that allows bending the gratings along the axis of their lamellae via dowel pins, as well as individual positioning of the tiles. Figs. 2 c and 2d depict a schematic and a photograph of the grating holder with its components, respectively.

Further, an in-depth optimisation of the gratings themselves is necessary for the optimal performance of the interferometer. Interferometric visibility is a measure of contrast in the interference pattern generated by the gratings. A higher initial visibility results in a better signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio in the final dark-field image, which is retrieved from the visibility reduction induced by small-angle scattering. Depending on setup-specific parameters, such as the length of the interferometer and X-ray spectrum, the grating parameters, such as duty cycle and lamella height, need to be adapted for maximum visibility. Therefore, a propagation and simulation framework for X-ray grating interferometers was created to optimise these grating parameters. An exemplary simulated visibility map for optimising G1 height and duty cycle can be found in Fig. 2d. In an iterative process, parameters of all three gratings were optimised regarding obtained visibility and producibility.

Ensuring the uniformity of the gratings' duty cycle and lamella height is crucial for maximising the visibility of the setup and, thus, image quality. The newly developed angular X-ray transmission(Fig. 2f) allows for non-destructive and easily implementable parameter examination of gratings, and conventional SEM (Fig. 2f, inset) was used for local and surface-based analysis.

The interferometric visibility also depends on the number of moiré fringes, as depicted in Fig. 2g. The change in fringe number is achieved by adjusting the exact position of the phase grating within the beam path. A certain number of moiré fringes is observed because the grating periods do not exactly match the magnification condition of the cone beam geometry anymore. We found the highest visibility of 35% for 11 fringes and chose this configuration for clinical operation (see Fig. 3b).

### Matter-wave interference of a native polypeptide [^113NbAgf]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

One may also ask for the role of external forces, such as gravity, in this setting. The normalized signal difference is a function of the pulse separation time T and the Earth's gravitational acceleration g via, with b a constant offset on the laser mirror. At fixed Talbot order, gravity influences the absolute fringe height, but within the 100 ns fringe envelope, of Fig. 3 gravity does not cause any noticeable time-dependence.

In summary, we have demonstrated matter-wave interferometry with a complex native polypeptide, the antibiotic gramicidin. The fringe visibility of around 20% in the first Talbot order stands in marked discrepancy to a classical phase space description and is in very good agreement with quantum mechanics, including a detailed quantum chemical analysis of the molecular electronic properties. Our source techniques based on UV femtosecond desorption can volatilize fragile biomolecules in a more efficient way than other methods to date. While matter-wave experiments with biomolecules in the gas phase do not elucidate biological function per se — which is related to electronic structure determining folding dynamics and interactions with matrix environments — our experiments show that quantum phenomena can be observed with building blocks of life under suitable boundary conditions. Molecular interference patterns can be used as flying nanorulersthat will become important in studies of optoelectronic and structural properties of complex biomolecules.

### Seismic evidence for the loss of stellar angular momentum before the white-dwarf stage [^113my4Qg]. Nature (2009). Excellent credibility.

White-dwarf stars represent the final products of the evolution of some 95% of all stars. If stars were to keep their angular momentum throughout their evolution, their white-dwarf descendants, owing to their compact nature, should all rotate relatively rapidly, with typical periods of the order of a few seconds. Observations of their photospheres show, in contrast, that they rotate much more slowly, with periods ranging from hours to tens of years. It is not known, however, whether a white dwarf could 'hide' some of its original angular momentum below the superficial layers, perhaps spinning much more rapidly inside than at its surface. Here we report a determination of the internal rotation profile of a white dwarf using a method based on asteroseismology. We show that the pulsating white dwarf PG 1159–035 rotates as a solid body (encompassing more than 97.5% of its mass) with the relatively long period of 33.61 ± 0.59 h. This implies that it has lost essentially all of its angular momentum, thus favouring theories which suggest important angular momentum transfer and loss in evolutionary phases before the white-dwarf stage.

### Quantum interferometric visibility as a witness of general relativistic proper time [^115Pbcjc]. Nature Communications (2011). Medium credibility.

The introduction of the 'clock' degrees of freedom results in two new quantum effects that cannot be explained without including general relativity: the change of the interferometric visibility and the extra phase shift proportional to the average internal energy (Fig. 2; equation (12)). The drop in the visibility is a consequence of a direct coupling of the particle's internal degrees of freedom to the potential in the effective Hamiltonian (7). Such a coupling is never found in Newtonian gravity, and it is the mathematical expression of the prediction that the 'clock' ticks at different rates when placed in different gravitational potentials. This coupling can directly be obtained from the Einstein equivalence principle. Recall that the latter postulates that accelerated reference frames are physically equivalent to those in the gravitational field of massive objects. When applied within special relativity, this exactly results in the prediction that initially synchronized clocks subject to different gravitational potentials will show different times when brought together. The proposed experiment probes the presence of such a gravitational time dilation effect for a quantum system — it directly shows whether the 'clock' would tick at different rates when taken along the two possible trajectories in the interferometer. On the other hand, to obtain the correct phase shift, it is sufficient to consider a semiclassical coupling of the average total energy of the system to the gravitational potential. With such a coupling, the time displayed by the 'clock' used in the experiment will not depend on the path taken. This means that a gravitationally induced phase shift can probe general relativistic corrections to the Newtonian gravitational potential but is always consistent with having an operationally well-defined notion of global time, that is, with a flat space–time.

The effect described in our work follows directly from the Einstein equivalence principle, which is itself crucial for the formulation of general relativity as a metric theory. Thus, the drop in the fringe contrast is not only genuinely quantum mechanical but also a genuine general relativistic effect that in particular unambiguously probes the general relativistic notion of proper time.

### Vega is a rapidly rotating star [^116dcaRD]. Nature (2006). Excellent credibility.

Vega, the second brightest star in the northern hemisphere, serves as a primary spectral type standard. Although its spectrum is dominated by broad hydrogen lines, the narrower lines of the heavy elements suggested slow to moderate rotation, giving confidence that the ground-based calibration of its visible spectrum could be safely extrapolated into the ultraviolet and near-infrared (through atmosphere models), where it also serves as the primary photometric calibrator. But there have been problems: the star is too bright compared to its peers and it has unusually shaped absorption line profiles, leading some to suggest that it is a distorted, rapidly rotating star seen pole-on. Here we report optical interferometric observations that show that Vega has the asymmetric brightness distribution of the bright, slightly offset polar axis of a star rotating at 93 per cent of its breakup speed. In addition to explaining the unusual brightness and line shape peculiarities, this result leads to the prediction of an excess of near-infrared emission compared to the visible, in agreement with observations. The large temperature differences predicted across its surface call into question composition determinations, adding uncertainty to Vega's age and opening the possibility that its debris disk could be substantially older than previously thought.

### Probing three-dimensional mesoscopic interfacial structures in a single view using multibeam X-ray coherent surface scattering and holography imaging [^114THJDb]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The first-principles holography simulation

While the FE-DWBA method produces high-fidelity simulation results, like other numerical methods, the computation requires an excessive amount of computing resources. In many cases, the grid must be fine enough to match the experimental conditions, and the electric field in each cell must be computed. This may hinder its application in iterative image reconstruction algorithms, which involve multiple forward and backward calculations. Close examination of the four terms in Eq. S12 reveals that the first and the second term dominate if the incident angle α i is above and the exit angle α f is below the critical angles (i.e. the region where we observe the dynamical scattering fringes). The other two terms are relatively weak due to the scattering geometry. This enables the translation of the complex scattering process for samples on a surface into a much simpler approximation. The scattering is approximately the kinematically scattered wave of the sample mixed with its reflected wave from the substrate if the incident angle is above the system's critical angles, in a simplified scheme without the presence of the cells and layers, the interfering scattered waves in Eq. 1 and S12 can be:where the first term is the unperturbed scattering (Path A in Fig. 4a) and the second is the mirror image of the first term but modified with a complex reflection coefficient, and the phase shiftdue to the mirroring effect by the total external reflection at the substrate surface (Path B, mirrored scattering, in Fig. 4 a), in the condition of a higher incident angle (α i) and lower exit angle (α f). The distance between the two scattering sources at the sample location is effectively 2 z. With known substrate optical prosperities, the calculation ofis relatively straightforward based on Parratt's algorithm, which also predictswith a phase shift of π upon reflection in Path B. This constraint is shown in the holography images as the scattering intensity I (0°,2 θ) = 0, so that the intensity at the detector corresponding to the direction of the sample/substrate horizon is always 0, an absolute constraint imposed onto the interfering waves, regardless of the incident angle and the sample structure. Therefore, within such angular ranges, the surface scattering is reduced to a two-beam holography mechanism, which can also be the preferred experimental condition for CSSI measurements. The simplified model demonstrates the true holographic nature of the multibeam scattering method that can be extended to using hard X-rays of tens-keV photon energy.

### Visualizing nanometric structures with sub-millimeter waves [^111jvSHQ]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Optical surface topography plays a key role in many fields, ranging from large distance, airborne, or satellite imaging and monitoring of earth, down to table-top, contact-less and non-destructive characterization of objects such as the roughness and shape of surfaces, and inspection and quality control. For the latter, optical far-field methods underwent a steady evolution and are amongst the main methods of choice, in particular, when high aspect ratio combined with nanometric depth resolution is required. In the surface plane, perpendicular to the propagation direction, the resolution of far-field imagers is limited by the Abbe limit or Rayleigh criterion, leading to a spatial resolution that is larger than the imaging wavelength. Along the propagation direction, however, exploiting the interference properties of light enables resolution of dimensions much smaller than the wavelength. When two waves interfere they create an interference pattern, where one interference fringe refers to a path length difference of one wavelength between the two waves. By trimming the path length difference to follow the interference maximum, the resolution can be a small fraction of the wavelength. It is then rather limited by how fine and how accurate the path length difference between the two waves can be trimmed or measured. Typical system architectures are, e.g. Michelson Interferometers where the object is placed in one of the interferometer arms or replaces a mirror in one arm while the other arm length is swept. Common examples of such setups are white light interferometersand optical coherence tomography – (OCT) with a depth resolution in the range of 0.1–1 µm using visible or broadband light, i.e. still of the order of the wavelength. In the Terahertz (100 GHz–10 THz) range, where the research reported in this manuscript has been performed, the best OCT resolution demonstrated so far is much worse, namely 43.9–220 µm, attributed to the about a factor of 1000 longer wavelength. Using monochromatic light sources allows for surpassing the wavelength limit in terms of depth resolution. Frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) techniques allow for resolving an optical thickness of, being the speed of light in vacuum andthe measurement bandwidth. But even with a bandwidth of a several THz, the optical thickness resolution lies above 10 µm. Still, the method can be highly accurate, with a reported measurement error as low as 360 nm. Using a heterodyne technique with advanced data processing, the measurement error of a single frequency system running at 600 GHz was reduced to about 0.5 µm. However, single frequency systems are prone toerrors when surfaces with thickness variations larger than half the wavelength are examined. After decades of evolution, visible-light phase-shift interferometers and swept-frequency interferometers yet achieve a resolution in the range of 0.1 nm, corresponding to. With advanced techniques such as locking to high-quality-factor external cavities (Fabry–Pérot Interferometers), by using multiple roundtripsor simply by using much shorter wavelengths, e.g. X-rays, (sub-)picometer resolution has been achieved, however, requiring a confinement of the measurement range to a few µm. Terahertz far-field systems so far achieved a thickness resolution around 0.2–10 µm – typically exploiting a bandwidth beyond 3 THz, yet with standard deviations as low as 40 nm. Only Terahertz near-field methods achieve few nanometer resolution. In this paper, we demonstrate a Terahertz far-field system working at imaging wavelengths between 0.375 mm and 0.5 mm with the ability to visualize surface structures with heights of only 49 nm. The root mean square error (i.e. the precision) is as small as 31 nm on a silicon sample that is as thick as 0.5 mm, despite the employed bandwidth of 0.2 THz is at least 15 times smaller than that of the THz systems with the best thickness resolution to date.

### Optical parametric amplification of sub-cycle shortwave infrared pulses [^113dpi4S]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Nevertheless, we did not directly measure the spectrum because the spectral resolution of the commercially available spectrometer used in the SWIR wavelength region is generally insufficient to resolve the fringes. Therefore, we aimed to apply a high-resolution spectrometer in the visible-wavelength region (~480 nm) to resolve the spectral interference fringes. We applied the SFG of the non-diffracted beam by mixing it in a type-II BBO nonlinear crystal with the residual pump beam after OPA3 to up-convert the wavelength to the visible region. The pulse duration of the residual pump beam was increased to approximately 800 fs by inserting a pair of transmission gratings in the beam path because the spectral edge components from the short- and long-wavelength arms should be temporally separated with a time delay of ~700 fs to generate spectral interference fringes with a period of ~1 nm, which is appropriate for the high-resolution spectrometer in the visible-wavelength region that we adopted (HR4000, Ocean Insights). By considering the negative chirp given by the grating pair to the residual pump pulse, we adjusted the time order of the two wavelength components so that the shortest edge of the long-wavelength component is advanced to the longest edge of the short-wavelength component. We expect that the broad range of the spectrum in each spectral component will contribute to the generation of the same visible-wavelength component with this time order because the short-wavelength component of the pump pulse temporally overlaps with the long-wavelength component of the non-diffracted beam and vice versa.

In the experiment, we successfully observed clear interference fringes ranging from 476 to 483 nm, as shown in Fig. 4 c. The temporal variation of the spectral interference fringes in Fig. 4 c was measured under the active feedback control of the path length in the interferometer to stabilize the fringes. We can perform shot-by-shot acquisition (5-ms integration) of each spectrum owing to the high sensitivity to the visible light of the spectrometer, and thus the number of 6 × 10 4 shots is equivalent to 5 min. The phase extracted from the fringes, as shown in Fig. 4 d, exhibits good stability with an rms error of 130 mrad (in-loop). Therefore, we are convinced that the short- and long-spectral components are coherently superposed or synthesized behind the interferometer. The histogram of the relative phase shift is shown in Fig. 4 e.

### Optical quantum super-resolution imaging and hypothesis testing [^11219Ux7]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In this work, we have analysed theoretically, and demonstrated experimentally, two tasks for super-resolution imaging based on hypothesis testing, quantum state discrimination and quantum parameter estimation. Estimating the angular separation between two sources is a challenging task for direct imaging, especially when their angular separation is smaller than the point spread function of the imaging system. The task of determining whether there are one or two sources is in itself a difficult task, especially when one source is much dimmer than the other.

We solved both these problems and, compared with previous works, we have reduced the experimental complexity down to a simple two-input interferometer: we show that a simple set-up achieves sub-Rayleigh scaling for the state discrimination task, and if the two sources are of equal brightness, then this measurement can optimally estimate their angular separation, saturating the quantum Cramér–Rao bound.

We developed the theoretical analysis in the framework of single photons. However, the results extend to the regime of thermal sources as discussed in ref. The experiment was conducted with weak thermal sources, where the probability of detecting multiple photons is highly suppressed. This reflects the fact that the measurement is post-selecting on single-photon events, which explains why the experimental data saturates the single-photon quantum limit. A similar observation was made for the problem of estimating the transverse separation. In the absence of background noise, losses do not affect our resolution apart from reducing the total photon count.

Our experiment also shows a practical optical set-up that could potentially be integrated with current stellar interferometers. However, this would require a different approach for the phase stabilisation of the interferometer. For example, the stabilisation could be provided by a ground-based coherent source or an artificial guide star which are suitably multiplexed into the interferometry system.

### Infrared diffuse interstellar bands in the galactic centre region [^115PyDPU]. Nature (2011). Excellent credibility.

The spectrum of any star viewed through a sufficient quantity of diffuse interstellar material reveals a number of absorption features collectively called 'diffuse interstellar bands' (DIBs). The first DIBs were reported about 90 years ago, and currently well over 500 are known. None of them has been convincingly identified with any specific element or molecule, although recent studies suggest that the DIB carriers are polyatomic molecules containing carbon. Most of the DIBs currently known are at visible and very near-infrared wavelengths, with only two previously known at wavelengths beyond one micrometre (10,000 ångströms), the longer of which is at 1.318micrometres (ref. 6). Here we report 13 diffuse interstellar bands in the 1.5–1.8 micrometre interval on high-extinction sightlines towards stars in the Galactic Centre. We argue that they originate almost entirely in the Galactic Centre region, a considerably warmer and harsher environment than where DIBs have been observed previously. The relative strengths of these DIBs towards the Galactic Centre and the Cygnus OB2 diffuse cloud are consistent with their strengths scaling mainly with the extinction by diffuse material.

### Atom interferometry at arbitrary orientations and rotation rates [^11423c5p]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Correction of the phase shift in the inertial pointing mode

The calculation of the rotation phase in the inertial pointing mode reveals an anomaly in the reconstructed interference pattern. Supplementary Fig. 2 shows the population ratio measured at the output of the interferometer as a function of the rotation phase calculated with equation (4) when no correction is performed. This interferogram clearly exhibits a sinusoidal pattern but not with the expected 2 π -periodicity. This shows that the evaluation of the phase shift is not perfect, even if the periodicity of the reconstructed fringes indicates a strong correlation between the true and estimated phase shifts. We therefore look at the potential systematic errors in the determination of the experimental parameters: the tilt angle θ, the device's rotation rate Ω, and the mirror's rotation rate Ω m.

For each of them, we evaluate the error that would explain our signal, and rule out the ones which are incompatible with independent estimations. We find that all the suspected effects can be rejected, except for a calibration error of the tip-tilt mirror.

Tilt angle

The tilt θ of the experiment with respect to gravity determines the transverse velocity of the atoms and intervenes in several terms of the phase shift. This angle is calculated from the measurements of the classical accelerometers of the device. To evaluate the effect of an error in the measurement of the tilt angle, we make the substitution θ → (1 + ε) θ in the expression of the phase shift. For each value of ε, the corrected data is fitted with a sinusoidal function for which the contrast and offset are fixed, while the period and phase are the fitting parameters. We keep the value ε leading to a 2 π -periodic signal and find ε = −0.103.

We can reject this error on the tilt angle for two reasons. First, the measurement of the angle from the accelerometers is consistent with the goniometer of our rotation platform, whereas such a large error (10% corresponds to 3° at 30°) would be clearly visible. Second, this error disagrees with the analysis done in the rigid mode. Introducing a 10% error on the tilt angle for the rigid mode leads to a severely degraded reconstruction of the interference pattern.

### Recovering three-dimensional shape around a corner using ultrafast time-of-flight imaging [^115hZ2wQ]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

The recovery of objects obscured by scattering is an important goal in imaging and has been approached by exploiting, for example, coherence properties, ballistic photons or penetrating wavelengths. Common methods use scattered light transmitted through an occluding material, although these fail if the occluder is opaque. Light is scattered not only by transmission through objects, but also by multiple reflection from diffuse surfaces in a scene. This reflected light contains information about the scene that becomes mixed by the diffuse reflections before reaching the image sensor. This mixing is difficult to decode using traditional cameras. Here we report the combination of a time-of-flight technique and computational reconstruction algorithms to untangle image information mixed by diffuse reflection. We demonstrate a three-dimensional range camera able to look around a corner using diffusely reflected light that achieves sub-millimetre depth precision and centimetre lateral precision over 40 cm×40 cm×40 cm of hidden space.

### A complementarity experiment with an interferometer at the quantum-classical boundary [^114hqJ4E]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

To illustrate the quantum mechanical principle of complementarity, Bohr described an interferometer with a microscopic slit that records the particle's path. Recoil of the quantum slit causes it to become entangled with the particle, resulting in a kind of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair. As the motion of the slit can be observed, the ambiguity of the particle's trajectory is lifted, suppressing interference effects. In contrast, the state of a sufficiently massive slit does not depend on the particle's path; hence, interference fringes are visible. Although many experiments illustrating various aspects of complementarity have been proposed and realized, none has addressed the quantum-classical limit in the design of the interferometer. Here we report an experimental investigation of complementarity using an interferometer in which the properties of one of the beam-splitting elements can be tuned continuously from being effectively microscopic to macroscopic. Following a recent proposal, we use an atomic double-pulse Ramsey interferometer, in which microwave pulses act as beam-splitters for the quantum states of the atoms. One of the pulses is a coherent field stored in a cavity, comprising a small, adjustable mean photon number. The visibility of the interference fringes in the final atomic state probability increases with this photon number, illustrating the quantum to classical transition.

### Strong in-plane scattering of acoustic graphene plasmons by surface atomic steps [^116AMrMS]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

It is noteworthy that obvious interference fringes appear in Fig. 3 a, though the height of these scatterers changes less than 3 nm, which is about four orders of magnitude lower than the incident wavelength of light. Besides, the amplitude of the main fringe of the scatterers is not the same for different gate voltages. Therefore, we further studied the visibility of the main fringe between the scatterers and the boundary of the encapsulated graphene. Three obvious scatterers in the sample are selected and labeled by black arrows. Here, the visibility of the fringes is defined as V = Δ S S /Δ S R, where Δ S S and Δ S R are the magnitudes of the first peak in the near-field image relative to the near-field amplitude far away from it for the scatterer and boundary, respectively. Δ S R keeps almost unchanged as the back voltage increases (Supplementary Fig. 12). However, the visibility gradually increases to 0.82 when the voltage changes from 1.6 to 2.9 V (Fig. 3 c). These features can be understood for the following reasons. Firstly, the scattering of AGPs by holes is more divergent in directions than that for a boundary. This point is illustrated by the comparison of the angular resolved energy flow and the corresponding near-field distributions (Supplementary Figs. 13 and 14). As a result, the fringe visibility is always less than 1. Secondly, the larger visibility with higher voltages can be attributed to larger reflectivity of AGPs, which comes from the increase of Fermi energy of graphene by gate voltages (Fig. 2 d). In further, for different scatterers, the visibility is not exactly the same under the same gate voltage, which may attribute to differences in the size and height of the scatterers.

### Large granulation cells on the surface of the giant star π gruis [^112esYQZ]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

Convection plays a major part in many astrophysical processes, including energy transport, pulsation, dynamos and winds on evolved stars, in dust clouds and on brown dwarfs. Most of our knowledge about stellar convection has come from studying the Sun: about two million convective cells with typical sizes of around 2,000 kilometres across are present on the surface of the Sun-a phenomenon known as granulation. But on the surfaces of giant and supergiant stars there should be only a few large (several tens of thousands of times larger than those on the Sun) convective cells, owing to low surface gravity. Deriving the characteristic properties of convection (such as granule size and contrast) for the most evolved giant and supergiant stars is challenging because their photospheres are obscured by dust, which partially masks the convective patterns. These properties can be inferred from geometric model fitting, but this indirect method does not provide information about the physical origin of the convective cells. Here we report interferometric images of the surface of the evolved giant star π 1 Gruis, of spectral type S5,7. Our images show a nearly circular, dust-free atmosphere, which is very compact and only weakly affected by molecular opacity. We find that the stellar surface has a complex convective pattern with an average intensity contrast of 12 per cent, which increases towards shorter wavelengths. We derive a characteristic horizontal granule size of about 1.2×10 11 metres, which corresponds to 27 per cent of the diameter of the star. Our measurements fall along the scaling relations between granule size, effective temperature and surface gravity that are predicted by simulations of stellar surface convection.

### Light interference from single atoms and their mirror images [^113pAteU]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

A single atom emitting single photons is a fundamental source of light. But the characteristics of this light depend strongly on the environment of the atom. For example, if an atom is placed between two mirrors, both the total rate and the spectral composition of the spontaneous emission can be modified. Such effects have been observed using various systems: molecules deposited on mirrors, dye molecules in an optical cavity, an atom beam traversing a two-mirror optical resonator, single atoms traversing a microwave cavity and a single trapped electron. A related and equally fundamental phenomenon is the optical interaction between two atoms of the same kind when their separation is comparable to their emission wavelength. In this situation, light emitted by one atom may be reabsorbed by the other, leading to cooperative processes in the emission. Here we observe these phenomena with high visibility by using one or two single atom(s), a collimating lens and a mirror, and by recording the individual photons scattered by the atom(s). Our experiments highlight the intimate connection between one-atom and two-atom effects, and allow their continuous observation using the same apparatus.

### Experimental demonstration of quantum digital signatures using phase-encoded coherent States of light [^115MrHcF]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Methods

System implementation

The experimental implementation of the QDS system is shown schematically in Fig. 6. This system encodes phase onto highly attenuated laser pulses and compares two copies of the quantum signature, simultaneously symmetrizing the states, using the multiport. Finally, Bob and Charlie measure the phases of the pulses and detect the photons using silicon single-photon avalanche diodes (Si-SPADs). The addition of a phase modulator in the final section of fibre between Alice and Bob allows us to test the multiport performance when Alice tries to cheat by sending different signatures to different recipients. The air-gap in the other arm allows the transmission losses to be balanced between each arm so that the same | α | 2 value is launched to each recipient, and permits compensation for small path-length differences between the two launch arms; | α | 2 is defined after Alice's phase modulator/air-gap at the inputs to the multiport.

To ensure a high interferometric fringe visibility in the interferometers of the system, it is necessary to ensure that the relative path-length differences remain constant to within a fraction of the emission wavelength of the source laser. Adjustable air-gaps in active feedback loops are used to compensate for any slow time-dependent variations in the relative path lengths. The fringe visibility is monitored during operation of the system and when a deviation from the expected value is obtained, signature distribution is halted and tuning carried out using a higher intensity signal with known phase modulation until the optimum visibility is obtained. Our interferometers had fringe visibilities of 98%. It is likely that the greatest contributions to the reduction in the visibility of the interferometers from 100% are owing to the linewidth of our laser sourceand loss of polarization extinction ratio (PER) at non-ideal fusion splice and flat-polish bulkhead joins between the various fibres, which comprise the system. The stress members in the polarization-maintaining fibre must be aligned by eye during the splicing process, introducing human error and the flat-polish bulkhead connectors have variable misalignment because of manufacturing tolerances.

### Synthetic optical holography for rapid nanoimaging [^116yQvhN]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

In the two-wavelength case presented in Fig. 3, a slightly different scheme for the generation of SRWs was employed where the reference mirror was translated stepwise by Δ d = 0.708 μm at the beginning of each line, although this was not a requirement in Fig. 3 and a linear motion of the reference mirror could have been applied as well. For the infrared wavelength λ 2 = 5.75 μm, this translation corresponds to a phase step of Δ ϕ 2 = 2 π ·2Δ d / λ 2 = 1.547 = 0.49 π for each line. In case of the visible wavelength λ 1 = 633 nm, a phase step of Δ ϕ 1 = 14.055 = 4.47 π was obtained, which is equivalent to a phase step ofbecause integer multiples of 2 π in phase cannot be distinguished. Thus, virtual wave vectors of about a quarter of the total bandwidth of the image could be generated for both wavelengths, providing best spatial resolution in the reconstructed amplitude and phase images. We note that for certain combinations of wavelengths, this situation might not be achievable and a virtual wave vector significantly smaller or larger than the quarter bandwidth might need to be accepted for one of the two wavelengths, resulting in a reduction of the spatial resolution in the reconstructed images for this wavelength.

### A hot compact dust disk around a massive young stellar object [^114SFuBb]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

Circumstellar disks are an essential ingredient of the formation of low-mass stars. It is unclear, however, whether the accretion-disk paradigm can also account for the formation of stars more massive than about 10 solar masses, in which strong radiation pressure might halt mass infall. Massive stars may form by stellar merging, although more recent theoretical investigations suggest that the radiative-pressure limit may be overcome by considering more complex, non-spherical infall geometries. Clear observational evidence, such as the detection of compact dusty disks around massive young stellar objects, is needed to identify unambiguously the formation mode of the most massive stars. Here we report near-infrared interferometric observations that spatially resolve the astronomical-unit-scale distribution of hot material around a high-mass (approximately 20 solar masses) young stellar object. The image shows an elongated structure with a size of approximately 13 x 19 astronomical units, consistent with a disk seen at an inclination angle of approximately 45 degrees. Using geometric and detailed physical models, we found a radial temperature gradient in the disk, with a dust-free region less than 9.5 astronomical units from the star, qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the disks observed in low-mass star formation. Perpendicular to the disk plane we observed a molecular outflow and two bow shocks, indicating that a bipolar outflow emanates from the inner regions of the system.

### Femtometer-amplitude imaging of coherent super high frequency vibrations in micromechanical resonators [^111ycS8i]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Additional experimental details

Before mapping the vibrational wavefields of the device, we first find the mid-fringe quadrature point of the Michelson interferometer by measuring the interference fringes using the slow photodetector (see Supplementary Fig. 2) while the piezoelectric nanopositioner, which the reference mirror sits on, is driven by a triangular wave (shown with the blue dashed line in Fig. S2) with the controller turned off. The amplitude of the fringes is a function of the percentage of overlap between two interfering pulses and the quadrature points are the nodes of the fringes. Integral feedback control is used to stabilize the interferometer to a quadrature point for maximized detection sensitivity.

We then must determine the effective wavelength of the pulsed laser interferometer. The optical spectrum of a femtosecond pulsed laser is broad and complex, without a clear single wavelength, unlike a single-frequency CW HeNe laser. To measure the effective wavelength, field auto-correlation is obtained by stepping the reference mirror through a wider overlapping range of the two interfering pulses (see Supplementary Fig. 5). The asymmetry about zero delay time is caused by the difference in the optical spectra of the two interfering pulses reflected back from the reference mirror and the device surface, respectively. Based on this set of fringes, along with a second quadrature of fringes that is obtained simultaneously (not shown in the figure), the interferometric effective wavelength can be calibrated with the help of a frequency stabilized HeNe laser and is shown in blue in Supplementary Fig. 5. Because the optical paths of the interferometer are carefully adjusted such that the two interfering pulses are perfectly aligned in time, a constant effective wavelength near zero delay time can be assumed and a value of 783.6 nm was determined. This assumption is valid because the delay between two interfering pulses resulting from a typical nanomechanical displacement of 1 nm is only 0.007 fs.

### Synthetic five-wave mixing in an integrated microcavity for visible-telecom entanglement generation [^1161sGsd]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

To verify the quantum coherence property of the synthetic χ (4) and explore its potential applications, the time-energy entanglement between the emitted visible-telecom photon pairs is demonstrated. Through the two-unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs), the photon pairs are divided into four paths namely, short–short, long–long, short–long and long–short for visible–telecom channels, corresponding to twin-photon amplitude of different times. The time-energy entanglement is characterized via the Franson interferometer. As shown at the top of Fig. 4 (a), both the short-short and long-long twin-photon states contribute to the center peak of the coincidence spectrum, thus interference is expected for coherent parametric interaction. The equal time twin-photon quantum state can be expressed as: whereandstand for twin photons from the short–short and long–long arms of the unbalanced MZI. The amplitude of the coincidence interference peak depends on the phases (ϕ 1, ϕ 2) of the two MZIs. In our experiment, we tune the phase ϕ 1 + ϕ 2 and track the coincidence spectrum. The remarkable change of the center peak in Fig. 4 (b, c) demonstrates the existence of quantum interference. In particular, the visibility of the amplitude at the center peak achieves 72.7% ± 3.3%, corresponding S = 2.056 ± 0.093 for the Bell inequality test, which shows 72% confidence to violate the Bell's inequality for a visible-telecom entangled photon-pair source.

### High-precision time-domain stereoscopic imaging with a femtosecond electro-optic comb [^114nUXdB]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Remote 3D imaging and depth measurement

First, we demonstrate TDS for 3D imaging by detecting four staggered mirror targets at a standoff distance of > 1.3 m (from a reference point). Figure 4a exemplifies 2D images recorded by the two cameras at a frame rate of 165 fps (frames per second), with the comb f r linearly changing from 165.33 to 165.60 MHz. For these images, we identify spatially correlated pixel pairs, such as points A 1 and A 2 or B 1 and B 2 (Fig. 4a), by matching corresponding features with a widely-used scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm. We then obtain the balanced signals from the paired pixels A 1 A 2 and B 1 B 2, as plotted in Fig. 4b. By linear fitting the central portions of the signals, we determine the zero-crossing points at 165.372 MHz and 165.510 MHz for A 1 A 2 and B 1 B 2, respectively. We continue tuning f r, searching for the second zero-crossing points and calculating Δ f r as 16.54 MHz for A 1 A 2 and 16.55 MHz for B 1 B 2, which determine their absolute distances to be d 0 + 1.308 m and d 0 + 1.3 m, respectively. The effective optical path difference (d 0) between the detection and reference arms at the reference point in Fig. 3a is pre-calibrated to be 15.5 m.

### Inhomogeneous terminators on the exoplanet WASP-39 B [^1179QyCW]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Robustness of morning and evening spectra to stellar heterogeneities

Stellar heterogeneities (caused by, for example, spots and faculae) could, in principle, impact our ability to retrieve limb asymmetries from transit light curves. WASP-39, however, is a relatively quiet G-type star. While photometric variability has been detected in Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and Next Generation Transit Survey light curves with a low amplitude level of 0.06% in ref. — on the lower tail of the photometric variability observed in Kepler for G8-type stars like WASP-39 (ref.) — no evidence of spot-crossing events on the transit light curves of WASP-39 has been detected so far.

Unnoculted stellar heterogeneities, such as those modelled by the transit light-source effect, would impact the limb spectra of the morning and evening in similar ways, and would thus be unable to give rise to the morning and evening differences observed in this work. Occulted cool or hot spots could, in principle, cause asymmetries in the transit light curve. These would, however, have to be larger than about 100 ppm in amplitude in the transit light curve at about 4 μm to give rise to the approximately 400 ppm differences we observed between the mornings and evenings (Fig. 1d). In turn, these should increase in amplitude for shorter wavelengths, which does not match the wavelength-dependence of the limb asymmetries observed in our work. In addition, any such features would be several times larger at optical wavelengths. However, although such features should be easily detectable, no such features were reported in the optical NIRSpec/PRISM light curves analysed in ref.

Based on this, we suggest that stellar activity is unlikely to give rise to the morning and evening differences observed in this work.

### Amber rainbow ribbon effect in broadband optical metamaterials [^114YZewJ]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

GH shift of a standard K9 crystal is measured using the He-Ne laser with a frequency of 632.8 nm to verify the reliability of the optical path (Fig. 2c). The spliced interference patterns show that the interference fringes in the right part have an upward movement with respect to those in the left part, and a normal GH shift occurs after light passes through the K9 crystal. This result is consistent with those given in the literatureand verifies the effectiveness of our measuring optical path. Further measurements of the GH shifts for the red-light sample (S R) and green-light sample (S G)at different incident angles (vary from 30° to 50°) are exhibited in Fig. 2c. The movement of interference fringes is opposite to that of K9, and GH shifts generated by S R and S G at corresponding resonance wavelength are all negative. Next, we measured the GH shifts of broadband metamaterial samples assembled by Ag/AgCl/TiO 2 @PMMA particles. It can be seen in Fig. 2d that negative shifts indeed occur when the wavelength of incident light beams matches the negative refraction wavelength (532, 589, 632.8 and 671 nm) of the planar samples, and a normal GH shift occurs at 473 nm (beyond the negative refraction wave band).

Trapped rainbow effect

Slow-wave structures can be applied to optical cache and deep subwavelength optical waveguide. In 2007, Hess et al. proposed a three-layer wedge-shaped optical waveguide model for stopping light waves. The middle layer of this theoretical model is filled by homogenous isotropic negative-index metamaterials, and both the top and bottom layer are made of ordinary positive-index materials. Spatial separation of light waves at different wavelengths — "the trapped rainbow effect" — is a result of the anomalous GH shift when a forward propagating wave hit upon the interface between the positive and negative index layers. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, a trapped rainbow effect experimentally achieved through negative-index metamaterials in the visible spectrum has not been reported yet. Herein, we realized the trapped rainbow effect in an experimental setting by using wedge-shaped visible-light metamaterial waveguides assembled by Ag/AgCl/TiO 2 @PMMA particles.

### Atom interferometry at arbitrary orientations and rotation rates [^117TsAK5]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The exquisite precision of atom interferometers has sparked the interest of a large community for uses ranging from fundamental physics to geodesy and inertial navigation. However, their implementation for onboard applications is still limited, not least because rotation and acceleration are intertwined in a single phase shift, which makes the extraction of a useful signal more challenging. Moreover, the spatial separation of the wave packets due to rotations leads to a loss of signal. We present an atom interferometer operating over a large range of random angles, rotation rates and accelerations. A model of the expected phase shift allows us to untangle the rotation and acceleration signals. We also implement a real-time compensation system using fiber-optic gyroscopes and a rotating reference mirror to maintain the full contrast of the interferometer. We demonstrate a single-shot sensitivity to acceleration of 24 μg for rotation rates reaching 14°s -1.

### Angle-based wavefront sensing enabled by the near fields of flat optics [^111SgGkN]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

There is a long history of using angle sensors to measure wavefront. The best example is the Shack-Hartmann sensor. Compared to other methods of wavefront sensing, angle-based approach is more broadly used in industrial applications and scientific research. Its wide adoption is attributed to its fully integrated setup, robustness, and fast speed. However, there is a long-standing issue in its low spatial resolution, which is limited by the size of the angle sensor. Here we report a angle-based wavefront sensor to overcome this challenge. It uses ultra-compact angle sensor built from flat optics. It is directly integrated on focal plane array. This wavefront sensor inherits all the benefits of the angle-based method. Moreover, it improves the spatial sampling density by over two orders of magnitude. The drastically improved resolution allows angle-based sensors to be used for quantitative phase imaging, enabling capabilities such as video-frame recording of high-resolution surface topography.

### Harnessing speckle for a sub-femtometre resolved broadband wavemeter and laser stabilization [^116DPtqt]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Results

Wavemeter setup

All data in this letter were acquired with the setup shown in Fig. 1. The laser beam is split into two paths. The first path is used for reference measurements of the laser wavelength with a commercial wavemeter or a Fabry–Perot interferometer. The second path is coupled into a Spectralon-coated integrating sphere through an angle-cleaved single-mode fibre to ensure a spatially-static input beam and eradicate back reflections, which could otherwise hinder stable laser operation. The speckle pattern produced inside the sphere is measured by a camera placed at a distance L from the exit port of the integrating sphere. In contrast to interferometer-based wavemeters, no accurate alignment of the individual components is necessary. For example, the camera and fibre can be offset by several degrees without perturbing the measurement results, as long as stability is maintained after the calibration step.

The mean free path in the sphere plays a prominent role in increasing the resolution of the system, analogous to the spectral to spatial mapping principle of a spectrometer. Thus, both the sphere diameter D sphere and propagation distance L from sphere to camera dictate the resolution and range of the wavemeter, as detailed in the Methods section. Unless otherwise stated, here D sphere = 5 cm and L = 20 cm. The acquisition rate of the wavemeter depends on the digital processing and the camera speed, which can be above 200 kHz for a small detector area. The total power sent to the sphere was below 1 mW for the highest frame rates, and can be lowered when a short exposure time and high frame rate are not required. Further details of the experimental setup can be found in the Methods section.

### Exploiting volumetric wave correlation for enhanced depth imaging in scattering medium [^111tXP9o]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Imaging an object embedded within a scattering medium requires the correction of complex sample-induced wave distortions. Existing approaches have been designed to resolve them by optimizing signal waves recorded in each 2D image. Here, we present a volumetric image reconstruction framework that merges two fundamental degrees of freedom, the wavelength and propagation angles of light waves, based on the object momentum conservation principle. On this basis, we propose methods for exploiting the correlation of signal waves from volumetric images to better cope with multiple scattering. By constructing experimental systems scanning both wavelength and illumination angle of the light source, we demonstrated a 32-fold increase in the use of signal waves compared with that of existing 2D-based approaches and achieved ultrahigh volumetric resolution (lateral resolution: 0.41 [Formula: see text], axial resolution: 0.60 [Formula: see text]) even within complex scattering medium owing to the optimal coherent use of the broad spectral bandwidth (225nm).

### Pathfinder experiments with atom interferometry in the cold atom lab onboard the international space station [^112RDoVg]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this article, we reported on three pathfinding experiments based on matter-wave interference of ultracold rubidium gases in orbital microgravity, which were each found to be robust and repeatable over timescales spanning months. We utilized the long freefall times available for atoms in space within the relatively compact CAL apparatus and compared the atom interferometer performance with ISS environmental data to gain insight into the high-frequency vibration environment experienced by the instrument. We further employed shear-wave interferometry to demonstrate the effects of matter-wave interference that are clearly visible in a single experimental run for more than 150 ms of freefall. Additionally, photon recoil measurements served to provide characterizations of the Bragg wave number using only the atomic feedback resulting from interferometer sequences, demonstrating the utility of CAL as the first quantum matter-wave sensor in space.

These efforts and findings serve as important milestones for maturing space-based atom interferometry for numerous mission concepts. Notably, observation of high-contrast interference fringes after long freefall times and within a single experimental run, as demonstrated here with shear-wave interferometry, is a technique that can be utilized for precision sensors, allowing for shot-to-shot determination of AI contrast and phase shifts. AI-based measurements of the photon recoil in space is also promising for multiple applications. Experiments to determine the fine structure constant, are expected to benefit from the extended freefall environment of microgravity for higher precision and reduced systematic errors by achieving long T in a relatively compact and freely-falling apparatus. Additionally, measuring the frequency of the AI laser via atomic feedback, as directly demonstrated in this article, will enable characterization and control over leading systematics for future missions and can remove the need for launching dedicated wave meters for the AI lasers. Finally, understanding the influence of ISS vibrations to the Rb-based AI allows researchers to understand limitations and optimize near-term experiments using differential interferometry for fundamental physics investigations on the ISS.

### Circular polarimetry reveals helical magnetic fields in the young stellar object HH 135–136 [^11747225]. Nature (2007). Excellent credibility.

Magnetic fields are believed to have a vital role in regulating and shaping the flow of material onto and away from protostars during their initial mass accretion phase. It is becoming increasingly accepted that bipolar outflows are generated and collimated as material is driven along magnetic field lines and centrifugally accelerated off a rotating accretion disk. However, the precise role of the magnetic field is poorly understood and evidence for its shape and structure has not been forthcoming. Here we report imaging circular polarimetry in the near-infrared and Monte Carlo modelling showing that the magnetic field along the bipolar outflow of the HH 135–136 young stellar object is helical. The field retains this shape for large distances along the outflow, so the field structure can also provide the necessary magnetic pressure for collimation of the outflow. This result lends further weight to the hypothesis — central to any theory of star formation — that the outflow is an important instrument for the removal of high-angular-momentum material from the accretion disk, thereby allowing the central protostar to increase its mass.

### Ultrathin wide-angle large-area digital 3D holographic display using a non-periodic photon sieve [^114w92SP]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Holographic image generation

To confirm the 3D nature of the holographic images, we generated and captured a helix hologram consisting of 75 points at different viewing angles (Fig. 3). The helix was positioned 4.2 cm behind the photon sieve, which consists of 2.2 μm sized pinholes. For this experiment, we mounted the 4- f telescopic imaging system (NA = 0.16) on a movable stage to observe the motion parallax of the hologram. Figure 3b clearly shows that the images of the hologram vary according to the observation angle, and the experimental results are consistent with those from simulations. Although the actual viewing angle was measured as 30°, the holographic images can be observed at higher angles because our imaging system has a non-zero numerical aperture. It is worth noting that we achieved a wide viewing angle of about 30° using a single flat-panel wavefront modulator without additional optics. By using the smaller sized pinholes, the viewing angle can be further enhanced (Supplementary Figure 3; Supplementary Figure 4).

### Optical focusing into scattering media via iterative time reversal guided by absorption nonlinearity [^112LW3Zi]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Guide star-assisted time-reversal enables deep optical focusing in scattering media such as biological tissue, overcoming the diffusion limit of light. However, in practice, guide stars formed using contrast agents or ultrasonic modulation naturally occupy regions much larger than the optical resolution, thus limiting their effectiveness. We propose and experimentally demonstrate a time-reversal focusing mechanism in scattering media that achieves focusing to a single speckle grain without the need for point-like guide stars. We exploit optical absorption nonlinearity as a light-induced perturbation to create virtual guide stars. The back-scattered fields in response to high- and low-intensity illuminations are subtracted after scaling to synthesize the field from the dominant speckle grains in the medium. We use this time-reversed field as the incident illumination in subsequent iterations. The focusing is achieved despite the extended layer of nonlinear absorber via a positive feedback loop that favors higher-intensity speckle grains, converging to a single virtual guide star at the optical resolution. We also demonstrate that by adding a phase ramp in each iteration, this focus can be gradually steered beyond the memory effect range.

### Infinitesimal optical singularity ruler for three-dimensional picometric metrology [^111jt2k9]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Optical metrology has been critical in the development of science and technology, an important example being the application as a high-precision ruler. As early as 1887, optical Michelson interferometer was used in the well-known Michelson-Morley experiment for the measurement of light velocity. Until today, optical interferometers still play a very important role in a lot of research fields, such as gravitational wave detection, star observation, topological insulator detection, microscopic particle vibration, semiconductor inspection, gravitational constant measurement, etc. With the advances of scientific researches from macroscopic to microscopic dimensions, especially in molecular and atomic scales, the accuracy of optical metrology needs to be improved urgently. For instance, the capillary condensation phenomenon of the liquid molecular layer, and the overlay control for high-precision semiconductor manufacturing, both need to be measured with the accuracy of 10 picometers.

The precision with which one can measure a small displacement is determined by two factors namely the sharpness of the variation of the optical field and the signal to noise ratio. Consider an optical interferometer where the minimum detectable displacement, for, say, a Michelson interferometer, can be represented as:whereis the wavelength, thearises from the standing wave in the Michelson type interferometer and SNR is the signal to noise ratio of the measurement. The first term is basically the reciprocal of the phase gradient as shown in the last equality. If the phase gradient can be increased the minimum detectable displacement will decrease provided the SNR is not degraded too much. In regions where the phase gradient is high the intensity inevitably deceases, and the SNR will suffer in the case of shot noise limited detection. In many cases, however, the limiting noise factor is not shot noise so provided so the achievable SNR is good even in regions of low intensity. In these circumstances increasing the phase gradient is highly desirable to achieve good sensitivity in situations of non-optimal noise conditions. To obtain a larger phase gradient than can be achieved with a conventional interferometer such as shown in Fig. 1a we seek the optical field with sharper phase gradient.

### One-third of sun-like stars are born with misaligned planet-forming disks [^112atxqZ]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Exoplanets are organized in a broad array of orbital configurations 1,2 that reflect their formation along with billions of years of dynamical processing through gravitational interactions 3. This history is encoded in the angular momentum architecture of planetary systems-the relation between the rotational properties of the central star and the orbital geometry of planets. A primary observable is the alignment (or misalignment) between the rotational axis of the star and the orbital plane of its planets, known as stellar obliquity. Hundreds of spin-orbit constraints have been measured for giant planets close to their host stars 4, many of which have revealed planets on misaligned orbits. A leading question that has emerged is whether stellar obliquity originates primarily from gravitational interactions with other planets or distant stars in the same system, or if it is 'primordial'-imprinted during the star-formation process. Here we present a comprehensive assessment of primordial obliquities between the spin axes of young, isolated Sun-like stars and the orientation of the outer regions of their protoplanetary disks. Most systems are consistent with angular momentum alignment but about one-third of isolated young systems exhibit primordial misalignment. This suggests that some obliquities identified in planetary systems at older ages-including the Sun's modest misalignment with planets in the Solar System-could originate from initial conditions of their formation.

### Broadband angular spectrum differentiation using dielectric metasurfaces [^116g5rrS]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Signal processing is of critical importance for various science and technology fields. Analog optical processing can provide an effective solution to perform large-scale and real-time data processing, superior to its digital counterparts, which have the disadvantages of low operation speed and large energy consumption. As an important branch of modern optics, Fourier optics exhibits great potential for analog optical image processing, for instance for edge detection. While these operations have been commonly explored to manipulate the spatial content of an image, mathematical operations that act directly over the angular spectrum of an image have not been pursued. Here, we demonstrate manipulation of the angular spectrum of an image, and in particular its differentiation, using dielectric metasurfaces operating across the whole visible spectrum. We experimentally show that this technique can be used to enhance desired portions of the angular spectrum of an image. Our approach can be extended to develop more general angular spectrum analog meta-processors, and may open opportunities for optical analog data processing and biological imaging.

### Ubiquitous time variability of integrated stellar populations [^116ykdvJ]. Nature (2015). Excellent credibility.

Long-period variable stars arise in the final stages of the asymptotic giant branch phase of stellar evolution. They have periods of up to about 1,000 days and amplitudes that can exceed a factor of three in the I-band flux. These stars pulsate predominantly in their fundamental mode, which is a function of mass and radius, and so the pulsation periods are sensitive to the age of the underlying stellar population. The overall number of long-period variables in a population is directly related to their lifetimes, which is difficult to predict from first principles because of uncertainties associated with stellar mass-loss and convective mixing. The time variability of these stars has not previously been taken into account when modelling the spectral energy distributions of galaxies. Here we construct time-dependent stellar population models that include the effects of long-period variable stars, and report the ubiquitous detection of this expected 'pixel shimmer' in the massive metal-rich galaxy M87. The pixel light curves display a variety of behaviours. The observed variation of 0.1 to 1 per cent is very well matched to the predictions of our models. The data provide a strong constraint on the properties of variable stars in an old and metal-rich stellar population, and we infer that the lifetime of long-period variables in M87 is shorter by approximately 30 per cent compared to predictions from the latest stellar evolution models.

### High-precision time-domain stereoscopic imaging with a femtosecond electro-optic comb [^112FjL8K]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Stereoscopy harnesses two spatially offset cameras to mimic human vision for depth perception, enabling 3D optical imaging for various remote sensing applications. However, its depth precision and accuracy are limited by insufficient spatial resolving power. Achieving high precision alongside extensive measurable ranges and high-speed measuring capabilities has long been a challenge in 3D imaging. To address this, we introduce time-domain stereoscopy, a concept inspired by space-time duality in optics. Specifically, it employs two temporally offset optical gating cameras to capture time-domain parallax signals, enabling rapid and precise time-of-flight measurements for depth retrieval. Leveraging two advanced technologies-femtosecond electro-optical comb synthesis and nonlinear optical sampling-this method achieves sub-100-nanometer depth precision across multimeter-scale imaging ranges and supports millisecond-scale displacement and velocity measurements for 47 million spatial points simultaneously. As such, it provides a versatile tool for applications in surface metrology, mechanical dynamics, and precision manufacturing.

### X-ray photonic microsystems for the manipulation of synchrotron light [^1173XFFU]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

The diffraction profiles are normalized and shown in Fig. 4b as a function of the offset angle Δ θ (and the mirror images) retain the features measured in the static rocking curve (Fig. 2b). However the width of the Si(400) peak varies with Δ θ (or in time, Δ t w); in fact, it is inversely proportional to the angular velocity of the MEMS, as expected from equation 3. Of all the peaks in the profiles, the narrowest and highest intensity peaks occur when Δ θ = 0°, at which the MEMS reaches the maximum angular velocity ω max = 1.261° μs −1. The peak width reduces and intensity increases when the angular velocity increases as |Δ θ | decreases (Fig. 4a, b). Therefore, the time-domain diffraction profiles can be analysed with confidence using the same three-Gaussian model to extract the width Δ t w of the most prominent Si(400) diffraction peak. The values of Δ t w are shown as a function of Δ θ in Fig. 4d, along with calculated values (solid line) using equation 3 with no adjustable parameters. Within experimental error, the data are adequately accounted for at Δ θ = 0° by equation 3, without introducing additional strain-related broadening of the rocking curve, demonstrating negligible dynamic distortion of the MEMS at the X-ray Bragg diffraction angle. Away from this angle, the measured value of Δ t w departs rapidly from that predicted by equation 3, suggesting that the additional broadening of Δ θ (400) stems from a growing amount of strain introduced by dynamic deformation. The dynamic deformation is also evident in Supplementary Data 3 and Supplementary Fig. 5 measured by dynamic optical profilometry. Supplementary Fig. 5a illustrates the surface profile of the mirror at the equilibrium position, where the averaged bending angle is minimal, especially the centre part of the crystal, perfectly supporting the X-ray measurement shown in Fig. 4d.

### Primary angle-closure disease preferred practice pattern ® [^114pFDzU]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Gonioscopy — gonioscopy of both eyes should be performed on all patients in whom PACD is suspected to evaluate the angle anatomy, and compression gonioscopy with a four-mirror or similar lens is particularly helpful to determine if visible appositional closure is actually permanent synechial closure. Gonioscopy should be performed in a dark room with a bright, short (approximately 1 mm in length) beam that does not pass through the pupil, and waiting for 10 seconds after placement of the gonioscopy lens allows the pupil to resume its resting state and may demonstrate pupillary block configuration when it reaches a mid-dilated position. A useful technique is to have the patient look slightly towards the mirror of the goniosprism into which the examiner is looking, and the gonioscopy lens may also be used to examine the optic disc through the central portion of the lens. Gonioscopic visualization of the angle may be impaired secondary to corneal edema in the setting of AACC, and topical glycerin may be used to clear the cornea to obtain a better view.

### Anisotropic leaky-mode modulator for holographic video displays [^112ociA7]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

Every holographic video display is built on a spatial light modulator, which directs light by diffraction to form points in three-dimensional space. The modulators currently used for holographic video displays are challenging to use for several reasons: they have relatively low bandwidth, high cost, low diffraction angle, poor scalability, and the presence of quantization noise, unwanted diffractive orders and zero-order light. Here we present modulators for holographic video displays based on anisotropic leaky-mode couplers, which have the potential to address all of these challenges. These modulators can be fabricated simply, monolithically and at low cost. Additionally, these modulators are capable of new functionalities, such as wavelength division multiplexing for colour display. We demonstrate three enabling properties of particular interest-polarization rotation, enlarged angular diffraction, and frequency domain colour filtering-and suggest that this technology can be used as a platform for low-cost, high-performance holographic video displays.

### Dark-field chest X-ray imaging for the assessment of COVID-19-pneumonia [^1145hwzg]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Optimising interferometer performance

Uniform visibility in the FOV ensures a constant dark-field sampling range, as the dark-field corresponds to a loss of visibility induced by a sample. The interferometric visibility without a sample in the beam path amounts to approximately 35%, as depicted for one interferometer position in Fig. 3a. The achieved visibility corresponds to the simulated visibility with the optimised grating parameters (cf. Fig. 2e). An exemplary raw data frame without a sample in the beam path can be seen in Fig. 3b. The moiré fringes, introduced by a small mismatch of the grating positions, are used to sample the intensity pattern with different relative grating positions when scanning the illuminated area over one pixel. Furthermore, the stitching gaps between the six grating tiles of the analyser grating subdivide the raw frame. By introducing a sample in the beam path, both the fringe pattern's mean intensity as well as its contrast can change. Figure 3c depicts the raw data of a frame taken from an exemplary patient scan. Absorbing features appear dark, while the scattering lung reduces the contrast of the fringe pattern.

### Quantum interferometric visibility as a witness of general relativistic proper time [^116i2XNc]. Nature Communications (2011). Medium credibility.

Here we predict a quantum effect that cannot be explained without the general relativistic notion of proper time and thus show how it is possible to unambiguously distinguish between the two interpretations discussed above. We consider a Mach–Zehnder interferometer placed in the gravitational potential and with a 'clock' used as an interfering particle. By 'clock' we mean some evolving internal degree of freedom of the particle. If there is a difference in proper time elapsed along the two trajectories, the 'clock' will evolve into different quantum states for the two paths of the interferometer. Because of quantum complementarity between interference and which-path information the interferometric visibility will decrease by an amount given by the which-way information accessible from the final state of the clock. Such a reduction in the visibility is a direct consequence of the general relativistic time dilation, which follows from the Einstein equivalence principle. Seeing the Einstein equivalence principle as a corner stone of general relativity, observation of the predicted loss of the interference contrast would be the first confirmation of a genuine general relativistic effect in quantum mechanics.

One might sustain the view that the interference observed with particles without evolving degrees of freedom is a manifestation of some intrinsic oscillations associated with the particle and that such oscillations can still be seen as the ticking of a clock that keeps track of the particle's time. If any operational meaning was to be attributed to this clock, it would imply that which-way information is, in principle, accessible. One should then either assume that proper time is a quantum degree of freedom, in which case, there should be a drop in the interferometric visibility, or that the quantum complementarity relation (between which-path information and interferometric visibility) would be violated when general relativistic effects become relevant. Our proposed experiment allows to test these possibilities. The hypothesis that proper time is a degree of freedom has indeed been considered in various works.

### Ultra-compact snapshot spectral light-field imaging [^1167AVbC]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Ideal imaging, which is constantly pursued, requires the collection of all kinds of optical information of the objects in view, such as three-dimensional spatial information (3D) including the planar distribution and depth, and the colors, i.e., spectral information (1D). Although three-dimensional spatial imaging and spectral imaging have individually evolved rapidly, their straightforward combination is a cumbersome system, severely hindering the practical applications of four-dimensional (4D) imaging. Here, we demonstrate the ultra-compact spectral light-field imaging (SLIM) by using a transversely dispersive metalens array and a monochrome imaging sensor. With only one snapshot, the SLIM presents advanced imaging with a 4 nm spectral resolution and near-diffraction-limit spatial resolution. Consequently, visually indistinguishable objects and materials can be discriminated through SLIM, which promotes significant progress towards ideal plenoptic imaging.

### Preventing childhood toxic stress: partnering with families and communities to promote relational health [^113UUayz]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Summary and recommendations — Preventing childhood toxic stress responses and promoting resilience will require that all children be afforded the SSNRs that buffer adversities, and translating these principles into pediatric practice will require FCPHMs to understand the toxic stress framework; understand the relational health framework; foster strong, trusted, respectful, and supportive relationships with patients and families to encourage acceptance of individualized prevention, intervention, and treatment strategies; foster strong, trusted, respectful, and effective collaborations with community partners; acknowledge that a wide range of adversities can trigger toxic stress responses and inhibit the formation of SSNRs; embrace an ecobiodevelopmental model linking relational experiences to biologic embedding and life-course outcomes; move beyond singular, panacea programs toward layered, vertically and horizontally integrated interventions; and employ a vertically integrated public health approach founded on universal primary preventions (such as positive parenting programs, ROR, and developmentally appropriate play) with precise screening for relational health barriers and indicated treatments (such as ABC, CPP, PCIT, and TF-CBT).

### Angle-based wavefront sensing enabled by the near fields of flat optics [^117NhaRq]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

After calibration, we first characterize a simple wavefront formed by a collimated beam passing through a biconvex lens as in Fig. 3f. We measured the wavefront at three different distances away from the focal point. The curvature of the measured wavefront agrees very well with analytical calculation based on a spherical wavefront originating from the focal point [see details in Supplementary Section 4].

The most significant advantage of this wavefront sensor is its high resolution. The density of spatial sampling is two orders of magnitude higher than most traditional angle-based sensors. For example, here the sampling density is 9246 point/mm 2, whereas it is usually 44 points/mm 2 for a Shack–Hartmann sensor (e.g. Thorlabs WFS20-5C). A high sampling density makes it possible to resolve fine features in a wavefront. The capability of resolving fine features can be quantified by the maximum phase gradient that can be measured by a wavefront sensor. It is determined by the spatial sampling density and angular dynamic range. Commercial Shack–Hartmann sensors such as Thorlabs WFS20-5C typically have a spatial resolution of 100 μm and an angular dynamic range of < 1°. As a result, its maximum phase gradient at the entrance of the sensor is limited to 0.1 mrad/μm. The sensor shown here has a spatial resolution of 10 μm and an angular dynamic range of 30°. The maximum phase gradient can reach up to 50 mrad/μm, which is 500 times larger than Shack–Hartmann sensor. Such enhanced capability allows angle-based sensors to perform quantitative phase measurement, which is traditionally dominated by the interference-based method.
