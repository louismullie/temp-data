## Question

What is the preferred anti-platelet agent for STEMI?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the preferred antiplatelet agent is for STEMI. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the patient is undergoing primary PCI versus fibrinolysis. Then, I should verify the foundational role of aspirin and the concept of dual antiplatelet therapy. Next, I will compare P2Y12 inhibitors (clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) by potency, onset, and outcomes. After that, I need to align recommendations with major guidelines (ACC/AHA/SCAI, ESC, CCS/CAIC). Finally, I will consider special populations, dosing nuances, and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with monitoring and duration guidance.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: STEMI management hinges on reperfusion strategy, and antiplatelet therapy is layered on top of that, so the "preferred" P2Y12 inhibitor differs if the patient is going to primary PCI versus fibrinolysis, and I need to keep bleeding risk and timing in mind as I proceed [^117K9ruC] [^114kgoLj].

> I need to ensure the foundation is solid: aspirin remains mandatory in essentially all patients with STEMI unless contraindicated, typically with a 150–300 mg loading dose and 75–100 mg daily maintenance, forming the backbone of dual antiplatelet therapy alongside a P2Y12 inhibitor for 12 months unless bleeding risk dictates otherwise [^113u9Tgt] [^1173DwCa] [^114oSDFE].

> Now, for primary PCI, I should confirm the preferred P2Y12 inhibitors. The ACC/AHA/SCAI and 2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP guidelines consistently recommend prasugrel or ticagrelor over clopidogrel to reduce MACE and stent thrombosis, with prasugrel favored over ticagrelor in some statements, reflecting faster onset and greater potency, while acknowledging higher bleeding risk in certain subgroups [^112VPm13] [^117K9ruC] [^115TW3T5] [^116Wddrm].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for prasugrel and ticagrelor in STEMI. In TRITON-TIMI 38, prasugrel reduced the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke by 21% and stent thrombosis by 42% versus clopidogrel in the STEMI subgroup, without excess non-CABG major bleeding, supporting its preference in PCI-treated STEMI [^1127JYo7] [^111FK99B]. In PLATO, ticagrelor reduced all-cause mortality and stent thrombosis versus clopidogrel in ACS including STEMI, reinforcing ticagrelor as a preferred option when prasugrel is unsuitable or contraindicated [^111FK99B] [^115bqeNN].

> Hold on, I should verify onset and pharmacodynamics because timing matters in STEMI. Prasugrel achieves faster and more consistent platelet inhibition than clopidogrel, with ETAMI showing lower platelet reactivity at 2–4 hours, which is clinically meaningful in the pre-PCI window, while ticagrelor also has rapid onset and reversible binding, though dyspnea and bleeding risks should be weighed [^11278BJg] [^111u3uNH].

> For fibrinolysis, I need to check the preferred P2Y12 inhibitor. The ACC/AHA guidance recommends clopidogrel as the P2Y12 inhibitor of choice with fibrinolytic therapy, with a 300 mg load for patients < 75 years and 75 mg daily without a load for those ≥ 75 years, based on CLARITY-TIMI 28 and COMMIT showing reduced death, reinfarction, or stroke without excess major bleeding, and TREAT demonstrating noninferior safety of ticagrelor versus clopidogrel when started after fibrinolysis, though clopidogrel remains standard given robust evidence and lower bleeding risk in this setting [^114NLLLs] [^114kgoLj] [^113RqquC].

> Let me consider special populations and dosing nuances. In patients ≥ 75 years or with body weight < 60 kg, prasugrel maintenance should be reduced to 5 mg daily, and prasugrel is contraindicated in those with prior stroke/TIA or active bleeding; ticagrelor is contraindicated with prior intracranial hemorrhage or ongoing major bleeding, so I should double-check contraindications before choosing agents [^116Wddrm] [^111u3uNH]. For high bleeding risk, guidelines allow shorter DAPT courses and consideration of P2Y12 monotherapy after 1 month, with de-escalation strategies (e.g., prasugrel/ticagrelor to clopidogrel) to mitigate bleeding, which I should tailor case-by-case [^112TgzhJ] [^115RvkYU] [^116xjdJ1].

> I should confirm pretreatment considerations. Routine prehospital P2Y12 loading has not shown clear mortality benefit in randomized data (e.g. ATLANTIC), though some observational and meta-analytic signals suggest reduced reinfarction with prehospital administration; practically, many centers still preload in PCI-capable systems, but I need to balance bleeding risk and delay to PCI when deciding to pretreat [^111FK99B] [^114czNsy] [^11181e2q].

> Next, I should review duration and de-escalation. Standard DAPT duration is 12 months after STEMI if bleeding risk is not high, with consideration of shorter courses (even 1 month) in high bleeding risk and de-escalation from prasugrel/ticagrelor to clopidogrel as a strategy to reduce bleeding while preserving ischemic protection, which I should individualize using clinical judgment and risk tools [^1173DwCa] [^112TgzhJ] [^115RvkYU].

> But wait, what if the patient is on oral anticoagulation? I need to ensure antithrombotic minimization: in patients requiring OAC, guidelines favor a single antiplatelet agent (usually a P2Y12 inhibitor) with OAC for up to 1 year rather than triple therapy when feasible to reduce bleeding, with DOACs preferred over VKAs when combined with antiplatelet therapy in eligible patients [^111CQ7FK] [^1126enz6].

> Putting this together, my practical, risk-stratified recommendation is as follows: for STEMI undergoing primary PCI, prasugrel or ticagrelor plus aspirin is preferred, with prasugrel favored when anatomy is known and there is no excessive bleeding risk, and ticagrelor when prasugrel is contraindicated or unavailable; for STEMI managed with fibrinolysis, clopidogrel plus aspirin is preferred; for all patients, reassess bleeding risk to guide DAPT duration and consider de-escalation or shorter DAPT in high bleeding risk, ensuring aspirin is maintained unless contraindicated [^117K9ruC] [^114NLLLs] [^1173DwCa] [^112TgzhJ].

---

The preferred antiplatelet therapy for STEMI is **dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor** [^1173DwCa] [^115WxJji]. For primary PCI, **prasugrel or ticagrelor are preferred** over clopidogrel due to greater potency and faster onset [^112VPm13] [^117K9ruC] [^1127JYo7] [^111FK99B]; clopidogrel is reserved when prasugrel/ticagrelor are unavailable or contraindicated [^112yxnST]. For fibrinolysis, **clopidogrel is the only P2Y12 inhibitor with proven benefit** and should be used with aspirin [^114NLLLs] [^114kgoLj]. DAPT is continued for 12 months unless bleeding risk mandates earlier de-escalation or shorter duration [^1173DwCa] [^112TgzhJ] [^11159JUH].

---

## Aspirin: foundational antiplatelet therapy

Aspirin is **first-line** and should be given as a loading dose of 150–300 mg orally or chewed, followed by 75–100 mg daily [^113u9Tgt] [^114oSDFE]. It irreversibly inhibits COX-1, reducing thromboxane A2–mediated platelet aggregation and ischemic events [^notfound].

---

## P2Y12 inhibitors: choice depends on reperfusion strategy

### Primary PCI (PPCI)

- **Prasugrel or ticagrelor are preferred** over clopidogrel because they provide faster, more potent, and more consistent platelet inhibition, reducing ischemic events and stent thrombosis [^112VPm13] [^117K9ruC] [^1127JYo7] [^111FK99B].

- **Prasugrel**: 60 mg loading dose, then 10 mg daily (5 mg if ≥ 75 years or < 60 kg) [^116Wddrm].

- **Ticagrelor**: 180 mg loading dose, then 90 mg twice daily [^notfound].

- **Clopidogrel**: 600 mg loading dose, then 75 mg daily; use only when prasugrel/ticagrelor are unavailable or contraindicated [^112yxnST].

---

### Fibrinolysis

Clopidogrel is the **only P2Y12 inhibitor with proven benefit** in fibrinolysis and should be used with aspirin [^114NLLLs] [^114kgoLj]. For patients < 75 years, give a 300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg daily; for those ≥ 75 years, start 75 mg daily without a loading dose to limit bleeding risk [^114kgoLj].

---

## Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)

Standard DAPT duration is **12 months** after STEMI unless bleeding risk mandates modification [^1173DwCa] [^11159JUH]. In patients at high bleeding risk, consider shorter DAPT (1–3 months) followed by single antiplatelet therapy, preferably with a P2Y12 inhibitor [^112TgzhJ] [^112esBxk]. In patients at high ischemic risk, consider extending DAPT beyond 12 months [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Bleeding risk**: Assess and individualize therapy; use PPIs with DAPT in patients at high GI bleeding risk [^114Toudw].

- **Surgery**: Plan DAPT duration around elective procedures to balance ischemic and bleeding risks [^notfound].

- **Genetic variability**: CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles reduce clopidogrel efficacy, favoring prasugrel or ticagrelor when available [^notfound].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Reperfusion strategy** | **Preferred P2Y12 inhibitor** | **Alternative** | **Duration of DAPT** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Primary PCI | Prasugrel or ticagrelor | Clopidogrel (if unavailable/contraindicated) | 12 months (unless high bleeding risk) |
| Fibrinolysis | Clopidogrel | None | 12 months (unless high bleeding risk) |

---

The preferred antiplatelet therapy for STEMI is **DAPT with aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor**, with prasugrel or ticagrelor preferred for PPCI and clopidogrel for fibrinolysis, tailored to bleeding risk and continued for 12 months when feasible [^1173DwCa] [^115WxJji].

### Evolving management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: update on recent data [^1173SdBw]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Significant recent advances have been made in strategies for managing ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Based on new findings, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have updated their guidelines for acute myocardial infarction (MI) with newer recommendations for STEMI management. Many of these recommendations focus on antithrombotic agents, with a movement toward lower doses of long-term aspirin and lower doses of unfractionated heparin (UFH). Studies have also been completed on the use of enoxaparin and fondaparinux as potential alternatives to heparin, and clinical trial data support the early use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (along with aspirin, UFH, and clopidogrel) in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention for acute STEMI. Clopidogrel has also been shown to improve angiographic and clinical outcomes in patients with STEMI who are undergoing thrombolysis or being treated medically. The new ACC/AHA recommendations support clopidogrel pretreatment and long-term therapy.

### Challenges in oral antiplatelet therapy: ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^111irwMf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) poses unique challenges to cardiologists because short- and long-term therapeutic plans occur rapidly and often with limited information. Dual oral antiplatelet therapy is a mainstay of treatment, although limitations exist for all agents. Simple algorithms will improve prompt use of these medications in emergency room settings, although simplicity may not be possible for high-risk patient populations, especially those with an increased risk of bleeding. Caution is therefore warranted against the usual process of generalization of clinical trial results to the entire spectrum of patients with STEMI. This concern is especially important for those at highest risk for bleeding, where high-dose clopidogrel or short- or long-term prasugrel may carry significant risks. Maximizing the efficacy and safety of long-term oral antiplatelet therapy requires individualization of therapy, heightened clinical judgement, and caution.

### ST-elevation myocardial infarction: the role of adjunctive antiplatelet therapy [^1126GJZb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy to reduce the risks of recurrent myocardial infarction and restenosis after primary percutaneous coronary intervention is critically important to optimize the early treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Traditionally, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; aspirin) has been recommended for patients with suspected STEMI, but this agent targets only one of several pathways of platelet aggregation. Antiplatelet agents with different inhibitory mechanisms may act synergistically with ASA. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are generally not used with fibrinolytic agents in acute STEMI management; indeed, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors plus bolus fibrinolytics increase the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Aggressive antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel reduces mortality in STEMI patients and offers significant clinical benefits, without an associated increase in major bleeding events. Recent trials support the development of an early and aggressive approach to more complete platelet inhibition using clopidogrel, in combination with ASA, for patients with STEMI.

Oral antiplatelet drugs are central in the management of acute coronary syndromes, including unstable angina/non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and percutaneous coronary intervention. However, the mechanisms that confer the benefits of these agents also increase bleeding risk. Thus, the selection of appropriate pharmacotherapy requires close attention to the delicate balance between reducing the risk of ischemic events and minimizing bleeding risk. A critical review of the 2007 guidelines in these areas and new clinical data with currently available and soon-to-be-approved antiplatelet agents are presented.

### ACC / AHA guideline update for the management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^114uMZXu]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association, in collaboration with the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, have issued an update of the 2004 guideline for the management of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The American Academy of Family Physicians endorses and accepts this guideline as its policy. Early recognition and prompt initiation of reperfusion therapy remains the cornerstone of management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Aspirin should be given to symptomatic patients. Beta blockers should be used cautiously in the acute setting because they may increase the risk of cardiogenic shock and death. The combination of clopidogrel and aspirin is indicated in patients who have had ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. A stepped care approach to analgesia for musculoskeletal pain in patients with coronary heart disease is provided. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increase mortality risk and should be avoided. Primary prevention is important to reduce the burden of heart disease. Secondary prevention interventions are critically important to prevent recurrent events in patients who survive.

### Coronary artery revascularization in the older adult population: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1178qMjk]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

St-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) reperfusion in older adults — preferred strategy, timelines, and key adjuncts: American and European society guidelines recommend primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) as the preferred reperfusion strategy in all acute STEMI when symptom onset to first medical contact is < 12 hours, with door-to-balloon time < 90 minutes or anticipated transfer to reperfusion time < 120 minutes (Class 1; Level of Evidence A). If pPCI is not possible, it is recommended that older patients should receive fibrinolysis when appropriate; trials demonstrated the importance of half-dose fibrinolytic therapy in patients ≥ 75 years and that in elderly patients presenting within 3 hours of symptom onset when pPCI was not available within 1 hour, half-dose fibrinolysis had similar safety and efficacy compared with pPCI. As adjunctive therapy with fibrinolysis, clopidogrel should be considered the preferred P2Y12 inhibitor, with patients > 75 years receiving an initial dose of 75 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 75 mg once daily; for access during pPCI, transradial access has been proven safe in older patients and should be considered the preferred access site to lower bleeding, vascular complications, acute kidney injury, and perhaps death in STEMI.

### Acute myocardial infarction [^112X6vZR]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction has traditionally been divided into ST elevation or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction; however, therapies are similar between the two, and the overall management of acute myocardial infarction can be reviewed for simplicity. Acute myocardial infarction remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, despite substantial improvements in prognosis over the past decade. The progress is a result of several major trends, including improvements in risk stratification, more widespread use of an invasive strategy, implementation of care delivery systems prioritising immediate revascularisation through percutaneous coronary intervention (or fibrinolysis), advances in antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, and greater use of secondary prevention strategies such as statins. This seminar discusses the important topics of the pathophysiology, epidemiological trends, and modern management of acute myocardial infarction, focusing on the recent advances in reperfusion strategies and pharmacological treatment approaches.

### Highlights from the 2013 ACCF / AHA guidelines for the management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction and beyond [^116h6b5j]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is considered a cardiology emergency requiring immediate recognition and treatment aimed at successful and early reperfusion to ensure optimal outcomes. The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have issued guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with acute myocardial infarction since 1990. These guidelines are based on clinical research exploring reperfusion modalities and adjunctive therapies. They are further supported by expert opinion where randomized trial evidence is lacking. In January 2013, the ACCF/AHA released the most recent guidelines for the management of patients with STEMI. This review focuses on the newest and most important recommendations taken from the 2013 ACCF/AHA Guidelines for the Management of STEMI and highlight important new studies that have emerged over the past year.

### Effects of P2Y12 receptor inhibition in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^116VRpUV]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

In ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), an effective antiplatelet treatment adjunctive to primary percutaneous coronary intervention is of utmost importance. High dose of clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor provides a faster, more potent, and more consistent platelet inhibition than standard clopidogrel. Oral P2Y12 inhibitors have been studied in large clinical trials and are in use in clinical practice. Intravenously administered P2Y12 inhibitors such as cangrelor have also been tested. However, statistically significant anti-ischemic superiority of stronger platelet inhibition regimens versus standard clopidogrel has not been proved exclusively in patients receiving primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Whether orally administered antiplatelet agents suffice in patients with STEMI has been recently disputed, mainly because of their delayed onset of action. Platelet reactivity variability before P2Y12 blockade and its evolution over time, genetic predisposition, antiplatelet agent used, timing, and method of platelet function testing significantly affect the rates of high on-treatment platelet reactivity. Although ominous signs of greater bleeding potential of stronger antiplatelet regimens have not appeared in STEMI, this should be carefully tested.

### Invasive and antiplatelet treatment of patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: understanding and addressing the global risk-treatment paradox [^1157AyYy]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical guidelines for the treatment of patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) recommend an invasive strategy with cardiac catheterization, revascularization when clinically appropriate, and initiation of dual antiplatelet therapy regardless of whether the patient receives revascularization. However, although patients with NSTEMI have a higher long-term mortality risk than patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), they are often treated less aggressively; with those who have the highest ischemic risk often receiving the least aggressive treatment (the "treatment-risk paradox"). Here, using evidence gathered from across the world, we examine some reasons behind the suboptimal treatment of patients with NSTEMI, and recommend approaches to address this issue in order to improve the standard of healthcare for this group of patients. The challenges for the treatment of patients with NSTEMI can be categorized into four "P" factors that contribute to poor clinical outcomes: patient characteristics being heterogeneous; physicians underestimating the high ischemic risk compared with bleeding risk; procedure availability; and policy within the healthcare system. To address these challenges, potential approaches include: developing guidelines and protocols that incorporate rigorous definitions of NSTEMI; risk assessment and integrated quality assessment measures; providing education to physicians on the management of long-term cardiovascular risk in patients with NSTEMI; and making stents and antiplatelet therapies more accessible to patients.

### Long-term ticagrelor versus prasugrel pharmacodynamics in patients with ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction [^115bqeNN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Current practice guidelines recommend a dual regimen consisting of a platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor in combination with aspirin for 12 months, followed by at least one antiplatelet agent lifelong in patients with ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) not requiring oral anticoagulation. In particular, the direct‐acting, oral cyclopentyltriazolopyrimidine ticagrelor, which reversibly blocks the adenosine diphosphate receptor P2Y12 on platelets, and the third‐generation thienopyridine prasugrel, which exerts an irreversible antagonism on the same cellular target, should be preferred over the second‐generation thienopyridine clopidogrel. 1

Two large‐scale randomized trials have tested either ticagrelor or prasugrel against clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes, including STEMI, and contribute to the solid scientific background supporting this recommendation. In the PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes) trial, patients with STEMI treated with ticagrelor showed less recurrent ischemic events without excess risk of bleeding compared with those receiving clopidogrel. 2 Similarly, in the TRITON‐TIMI (Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition With Prasugrel–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) 38, patients with STEMI allocated to prasugrel showed a significant clinical benefit without safety issues compared with those treated with clopidogrel. 3

### Invasive and antiplatelet treatment of patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: understanding and addressing the global risk-treatment paradox [^114MNqKw]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Patients with NSTEMI have a higher long‐term mortality risk than patients with STEMI but are often treated less aggressively, with those who have the highest ischemic risk often receiving the least aggressive treatment (the "treatment‐risk paradox"). The suboptimal treatment of patients with NSTEMI can be explained by the heterogeneity of patient characteristics, an underestimation of the high ischemic risk compared with bleeding risk by physicians, procedure availability, and policy. To address these challenges, potential approaches include: developing guidelines and protocols that include rigorous definitions of NSTEMI, risk assessment, and integrated quality assessment measures; providing education to physicians on the management of long‐term cardiovascular risk in patients with NSTEMI; and making stents and antiplatelet therapies more accessible to patients.

### What anti-thrombotic therapy is best with primary PCI for acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: how should the HORIZONS trial change current practice? [^115Dzi8j]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2008). Low credibility.

The current standard of care for anti-thrombotic therapy with primary PCI for acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is aspirin, clopidogrel, unfractionated heparin and platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. However, heparin and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are associated with a high incidence of bleeding, and many of the trials documenting benefit with this therapy were performed before the widespread use of stents and clopidogrel. Bivalirudin is a direct thrombin inhibitor which has been found to have similar efficacy with less bleeding compared with heparin plus glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors when used with elective PCI and with PCI for unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. The HORIZONS trial evaluated bivalirudin compared with unfractionated heparin and IIb/IIIa inhibitors in patients with STEMI treated with primary PCI and found similar MACE (major adverse cardiac events) with less bleeding and a lower incidence of net adverse clinical events (MACE or major bleeding) at 30 days. Mortality at 30 days was also significantly less with bivalirudin. These results make a strong case for the use of bivalirudin with primary PCI in the great majority of patients with STEMI, with the possible exception of patients with cardiogenic shock or stent thrombosis, and patients with a large thrombus burden or no re-flow following PCI. In the latter case, platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors would be used as a bail-out strategy.

### Updates and current recommendations for the management of patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes: what it means for clinical practice [^116b9UiC]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) have recently updated their joint guidelines for the management of patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS, including unstable angina [UA] and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI]). These guidelines replace the 2007 guidelines and the focused updates from 2011 and 2012 and now combine UA and NSTEMI into a new classification, NSTE-ACS, and updating the terminology around noninvasive management to ischemia-guided strategy. The latest guidelines include updated recommendations for the use of the oral antiplatelet agents (P2Y12 inhibitors) prasugrel and ticagrelor as part of dual-antiplatelet therapy-the cornerstone of treatment for these patients. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the new and modified recommendations for the management of patients with NSTE-ACS and the evidence supporting them. Also, where appropriate, similarities and differences between the current recommendations of the AHA/ACC and those of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) are highlighted. For example, the AHA/ACC recommends the P2Y12 inhibitor ticagrelor over clopidogrel in all patients with NSTE-ACS and clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor for patients in whom percutaneous coronary intervention is planned, whereas the ESC guidelines specifically recommend individual P2Y12 inhibitors for particular patient subgroups.

### Use of ticagrelor alongside fibrinolytic therapy in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: practical perspectives based on data from the TREAT study [^113RqquC]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred reperfusion method in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In patients with STEMI who cannot undergo timely primary PCI, pharmacoinvasive treatment is recommended, comprising immediate fibrinolytic therapy with subsequent coronary angiography and rescue PCI if needed. Improving clinical outcomes following fibrinolysis remains of great importance for the many patients globally for whom rapid treatment with primary PCI is not possible. For patients with acute coronary syndrome who underwent primary PCI, the PLATO trial demonstrated superior efficacy of ticagrelor relative to clopidogrel. Results in the predefined subgroup of patients with STEMI were consistent with the overall PLATO trial. Patients who received fibrinolytic therapy in the 24hours before randomization were excluded from PLATO, and there is thus a lack of data on the safety of using ticagrelor in conjunction with fibrinolytic therapy in the first 24hours after STEMI. The TREAT study addresses this knowledge gap; patients with STEMI who had symptom onset within the previous 24hours and had received fibrinolytic therapy (of whom 89.4% had also received clopidogrel) were randomized to treatment with ticagrelor or clopidogrel (median time between fibrinolysis and randomization: 11.5hours). At 30days, ticagrelor was found to be non-inferior to clopidogrel for the primary safety outcome of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI)-defined first major bleeding. Considering together the results of the PLATO and TREAT studies, initiating or switching to treatment with ticagrelor within the first 24hours after STEMI in patients receiving fibrinolysis is reasonable.

### 2007 guideline update for unstable angina / non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: focus on antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies [^112BC7Qz]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarize key changes in the 2007 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline recommendations for pharmacologic therapy as they relate to antiplatelets and anticoagulants, and to evaluate the evidence from several landmark trials that was used to support the guideline updates for these agents.

Data Sources

Literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1950-January 2008) using the search terms acute coronary syndromes, unstable angina (UA), non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), antiplatelet, and anticoagulant. All papers were cross-referenced to identify additional studies.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

ACC/AHA guidelines, relevant original research articles, and review articles were evaluated. Studies with more than 1000 patients were the focus of the review.

Data Synthesis

UA and NSTEMI are the most common presentations of acute coronary syndrome. The recently updated ACC/AHA guidelines for management of this condition were based on significant advances in pharmacotherapy including expanded use of drug-eluting stents, pretreatment with clopidogrel, and newer anticoagulants such as bivalirudin and fondaparinux. Landmark trials have been published that describe advances in the use of antiplatelets and anticoagulants. According to the guidelines, unfractionated heparin (UFH) and enoxaparin are preferred options for both invasive and conservative management. Enoxaparin was noninferior to UFH for invasive management in the SYNERGY trial, although it was associated with a higher incidence of bleeding. Other alternatives for an invasive strategy per the guidelines include bivalirudin and fondaparinux. Bivalirudin (alone or with glycoprotein [GP] IIb/IIIa inhibitor) was compared with heparin plus GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor in the ACUITY trial of patients undergoing early invasive management. The bivalirudin groups were noninferior to standard of care, although bivalirudin alone was associated with less bleeding. Fondaparinux was found to be noninferior to enoxaparin and was associated with fewer bleeding events in the OASIS-5 study of patients who were not treated with an early invasive approach. Accordingly, the guidelines 1list fondaparinux as an alternative for a conservative strategy or in patients at increased risk of bleeding.

Conclusions

Clinicians should be familiar with the updated 2007 ACC/AHA guidelines and the clinical trial evidence that serves as the basis for these recommendations. It is paramount for institutions to outline a preferred and consistent treatment approach. These decisions should involve a review of established efficacy, bleeding risk, need for anticoagulant reversal, costs, and clinician familiarity with different treatment regimens.

Familiarize clinicians with recent information regarding the diagnosis and treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.

Data Sources

PubMed search and review of relevant medical literature.

Summary

Definition, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction are reviewed.

Conclusions

Patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction benefit from prompt reperfusion therapy. Adjunctive antianginal, antiplatelet, antithrombotic, beta blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and statin agents minimize ongoing cardiac ischemia, prevent thrombus propagation, and reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events.

### Incidence, predictors, and clinical impact of early prasugrel cessation in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^111C1brU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

While current recommendations advocate DAPT for 1 year following acute MI, there is limited evidence regarding adherence to prasugrel — one of the preferred antiplatelet agents in this context. This study assessed the incidence, reasons, and clinical impact of early prasugrel cessation in a sizable, contemporary cohort of patients with STEMI treated with PCI by current standards. Prasugrel cessation before 1 year was not uncommon (≈14%), but was less frequent compared with previous studies focusing on any DAPT cessation post‐PCI in more stable clinical settings. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Crossover to another P2Y 12 ‐inhibitor, mainly clopidogrel, was more frequent compared with physician‐recommended discontinuation or disruption (because of bleeding, side effects, or noncompliance). Clinical characteristics previously linked to higher bleeding risk 18 were more common in patients who stopped prasugrel, suggesting that concerns about bleeding likely influenced decision‐making regarding antiplatelet management. Even though the rate of major adverse cardiac events was numerically higher following discontinuation, disruption was the only mode of early prasugrel cessation associated with a statistically significant adverse impact on subsequent cardiovascular outcomes.

Rapid mechanical reperfusion with coronary stenting and potent adjunctive antithrombotic treatment are the principles for optimal management of patients with STEMI. Prasugrel, a potent and rapid‐acting thienopyridine, is more effective than clopidogrel for prevention of ischemic events in patients with MI including those with STEMI. 4, 19 Current guidelines recommend 12‐month DAPT consisting of aspirin and a P2Y 12 ‐inhibitor, preferably prasugrel or ticagrelor unless contraindicated. 1, 2 In this study, 86% of patients with STEMI remained on continuous prasugrel treatment within 1 year following PCI. Considering that more than half of early prasugrel cessations involved switching to another P2Y 12 ‐inhibitor and in conjunction with high adherence to aspirin, our findings show adherence to guideline‐recommended DAPT duration in > 90% of patients. This finding likely reflects appreciation of the persistently elevated ischemic risk following acute STEMI. Previous investigations reported higher rates of early DAPT cessation within 1 year post PCI, ranging between 18.5% and 24%, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 but this needs to be interpreted in view of different study populations (primarily stable patients with CAD) and antiplatelet treatments (mostly clopidogrel) as well as varying definitions of treatment cessation across studies.

### Reperfusion therapy reduces the risk of myocardial rupture complicating ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^111oSYz6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The debate about the advantages of fibrinolytic therapy or primary percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PCI) as a superior reperfusion strategy for ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has continued for 30 years. In the first decade, primary PCI was limited by first‐generation equipment, inadequate radiographic imaging systems, suboptimal adjunctive antithrombotic therapy, and delays in time‐to‐treatment. Successful reperfusion rates were too low and infarct artery reocclusion and restenosis rates were too high, so fibrinolytic therapy was associated with better clinical outcomes. Since then, fibrinolytic therapy improvements have included bolus administration of newer agents, adjunctive dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, and cardiac catheterization as soon as possible for reperfusion failure and within 24 hours after successful reperfusion to maximize sustained infarct artery patency rates. Perhaps more impressive has been the improvement in primary PCI that now makes it the preferred reperfusion strategy. The PCI wires and catheters are well engineered, radiographic and intravascular imaging capability allows excellent visualization of the coronary arteries, antithrombotic medications decrease the risk of acute closure, and drug‐eluting stents assure excellent long‐term infarct artery patency rates. Most importantly, pre‐hospital and in‐hospital systems of care have been developed to decrease time‐to‐treatment and offer reperfusion therapy to almost all patients with STEMI unless treatment is deemed futile.

### Management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: comparison of the updated guidelines from north America and Europe [^115xT4sB]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology each recently published updated guidelines for management of patients with acute ST elevation myocardial infarction. In this article, we highlight the most important new recommendations, review their supporting data, and describe differences between the guidelines. Key aspects of these updates include detailed guidance regarding the selection of a reperfusion strategy and the incorporation of newer adjunctive antithrombotic agents. Both new guidelines suggest caution in the administration of intravenous beta-blockers, avoidance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and support a more aggressive approach to secondary risk factor management. The 2 guidelines have some nuanced differences as well as some recommendations that are unique to each guideline. They present different levels of support for the 4 available adjunctive parenteral anticoagulants, vary in their endorsement of routine elective coronary angiography after fibrinolysis, and cite different targets for low density lipoprotein long-term. Major unique recommendations include the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Assocaition's emphasis of a stepped approach to analgesia in patients with musculoskeletal pain beginning with acetaminophen or aspirin and a lower target international normalized ratio in patients receiving warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel. Meanwhile, unique recommendations in the European Society of Cardiology guidelines include measures to prevent/treat microvascular obstruction and reperfusion injury associated with percutaneous coronary intervention and greater emphasis on maintaining eugylcemia. As these guidelines represent an evidence based approach, health care providers should become familiar with the new data and the resultant updated recommendations to ensure optimal treatment of their patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

### Pretreatment with P2Y12 inhibitors in ST-elevation myocardial infarction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114czNsy]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pretreatment with oral P2Y12 inhibitors is a standard practice for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, the efficacy and safety of P2Y12 inhibitors pretreatment remain unclear.

Objectives

We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the impact of P2Y12 inhibitor pretreatment on thrombotic and hemorrhagic endpoints in STEMI patients.

Methods

We searched multiple databases for studies that compared P2Y12 inhibitor pretreatment with no pretreatment in STEMI patients and reported endpoints of interest. Random effects model was used for the meta-analysis.

Results

Our meta-analysis included 3 randomized controlled trials and 14 observational studies, comprising 70,465 patients assigned to either P2Y12 inhibitor pretreatment (50,328 patients) or no pretreatment (20,137 patients). Compared to no pretreatment, P2Y12 inhibitor pretreatment did not result in significant reductions in all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52–1.03; p = 0.07), myocardial infarction (RR 0.75; 95% CI: 0.53–1.07; p = 0.11), or major bleeding (RR 0.80; 95% CI: 0.56–1.16; p = 0.22) at 30 days. However, our subgroup analysis revealed that P2Y12 inhibitor pretreatment administered in the pre-hospital setting was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of myocardial infarction compared to no pretreatment (RR 0.73; 95% CI: 0.56–0.91; p < 0.01).

Conclusion

Our analysis suggests that pretreatment with oral P2Y12 inhibitors before PCI in patients with STEMI was not associated with reduced all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or major bleeding. However, pretreatment with P2Y12 inhibitors in the pre-hospital setting appears to be beneficial in reducing reinfarction.

### Antiplatelet and antithrombotic treatment after primary percutaneous coronary intervention: balancing safety and efficacy [^115yxMdY]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of serious vascular events in high-risk patients, including those with a prior acute ischemic event. The long-term use of antiplatelet agents is a key component of secondary prevention measures following acute coronary syndromes, including ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. While minimizing ischemic recurrences, an intensified antiplatelet regimen also invariably leads to an increased risk for bleeding, which can in turn lead to treatment discontinuation and worse overall cardiovascular outcomes. Thus, a critical balance between efficacy and safety must be pursued in clinical practice. Selection of agents and their combination, dose optimization, and a customized approach based on genotype or assessment of on-treatment phenotype are discussed in the context of available evidence.

### Management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in EDs [^112YTX1N]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Emergency department (ED) physicians are critical in the accurate diagnosis, efficient management, and treatment of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The initial reperfusion strategy involves the choice between mechanical reperfusion using primary percutaneous coronary intervention and pharmacologic treatment with fibrinolytics. The benefits of these approaches are time dependent, and practices vary according to institutional resources and local guidelines. Nevertheless, the need for early intervention and the use of certain therapies are well recognized. Therefore, ED physicians must be aware of all treatment options available, including the use of adjunctive therapies. Initial treatment should include beta-blockers, aspirin (or clopidogrel if aspirin is contraindicated), nitroglycerin, and analgesia, regardless of reperfusion strategy. Clopidogrel is now approved as an adjunctive therapy for patients undergoing fibrinolysis as their reperfusion therapy. Both unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin are feasible adjunctives in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing reperfusion therapy. In addition, multiple new antithrombin agents are being investigated. The choice adjunctive treatments should be based on specific patient populations and on the initial reperfusion strategy.

Abstract

Clinical guidelines for the treatment of patients with non‐ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) recommend an invasive strategy with cardiac catheterization, revascularization when clinically appropriate, and initiation of dual antiplatelet therapy regardless of whether the patient receives revascularization. However, although patients with NSTEMI have a higher long‐term mortality risk than patients with ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), they are often treated less aggressively; with those who have the highest ischemic risk often receiving the least aggressive treatment (the "treatment‐risk paradox"). Here, using evidence gathered from across the world, we examine some reasons behind the suboptimal treatment of patients with NSTEMI, and recommend approaches to address this issue in order to improve the standard of healthcare for this group of patients. The challenges for the treatment of patients with NSTEMI can be categorized into four "P" factors that contribute to poor clinical outcomes: p atient characteristics being heterogeneous; p hysicians underestimating the high ischemic risk compared with bleeding risk; p rocedure availability; and p olicy within the healthcare system. To address these challenges, potential approaches include: developing guidelines and protocols that incorporate rigorous definitions of NSTEMI; risk assessment and integrated quality assessment measures; providing education to physicians on the management of long‐term cardiovascular risk in patients with NSTEMI; and making stents and antiplatelet therapies more accessible to patients.

### Pre-treatment with P2Y12 inhibitors in ACS patients: who, when, why, and which agent? [^111MpTSC]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12receptor inhibitor is the mainstay of treatment for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients, whether they undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or are managed medically. In recent years, the most appropriate timing for initiation and duration of P2Y12receptor inhibition has been a focus of great interest. Many observational studies and a single prospective trial (CREDO) utilizing clopidogrel had focused on whether pre-treatment with clopidogrel, i.e. its administration upstream of coronary angiography and PCI, is beneficial. Although the rationale for pre-treatment is obvious, large-scale randomized trials supporting a pre-treatment strategy with clopidogrel or with the newer P2Y12inhibitors prasugrel and ticagrelor did not exist. Proponents of a pre-treatment strategy had to rely on their best guess, on non-randomized studies, or on negative studies in which a trend for a benefit had been demonstrated. Recently, however, two randomized trials directly evaluated the value of pre-treatment-one in patients with a non-STE elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)-the Comparison of Prasugrel at the Time of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention or as Pretreatment at the Time of Diagnosis in Patients with Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (ACCOAST) trial, and a second trial evaluating the use of ticagrelor in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients, the Administration of Ticagrelor in the Cath Lab or in the Ambulance for New ST-elevation myocardial Infarction to open the Coronary artery (ATLANTIC) trial. Neither of the two trials, however, answered all the questions clinicians have about pre-treatment. And given the recent approval of the intravenous and rapidly acting P2Y12inhibitor cangrelor, the choice of who should receive treatment with a P2Y12inhibitor, which one should be used, and when it should be administered, should be carefully re-evaluated for all patients. This clinical review aims at evaluating the available evidence regarding the value of pre-treatment with the now four available oral and intravenous P2Y12inhibitors that can be administered to patients in whom coronary angiography followed by a possible PCI is planned.

### First human use of RUC-4: a nonactivating second-generation small-molecule platelet glycoprotein IIb / IIIa (integrin α IIb β 3) inhibitor designed for subcutaneous point-of-care treatment of ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction [^113ikGcE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Rapid restoration of normal coronary blood flow in an occluded coronary artery by mechanical recanalization, thrombolytic agent, or a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa; integrin αIIbβ3) receptor inhibitor limits the extent of myocardial necrosis and reduces mortality in patients presenting with ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). 1, 2, 3, 4 Primary percutaneous coronary intervention with stent deployment is currently the preferred reperfusion modality for STEMI. 1, 2 Despite national initiatives that have reduced median door‐to‐balloon times to < 60 minutes, mortality from STEMI has plateaued 5, 6 and focus has turned toward reducing total ischemic time (time from chest pain onset to coronary recanalization) to further limit infarct size and improve clinical outcomes. 7, 8 Multiple studies have reported that early (pre–primary percutaneous coronary intervention) therapy with a GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor can increase preprocedural infarct artery blood flow, speed ST‐segment resolution, limit infarct size, and improve survival in STEMI, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11 regardless of the presence or intensity of concurrent P2Y12 receptor inhibition. 12, 13 However, currently available platelet GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors require intravenous administration as a bolus and continuous infusion controlled by a pump, making their use in urgent situations and/or ambulance settings difficult. Oral P2Y12 receptor inhibitors are easier to administer but are poorly absorbed during STEMI, particularly among patients administered opioid analgesics, and require hours to achieve their maximal effect, even when the pills are crushed. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 P2Y12 inhibitors are less potent than GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors as they target only 1 of the ADP receptors, whereas GPIIb/IIIa inhibition blocks the final common pathway for platelet aggregation regardless of upstream agonist, including thrombin, which is central to the pathogenesis of platelet thrombus formation in acute coronary syndromes. 15, 19, 20, 21, 22

### Ticagrelor versus clopidogrel after fibrinolytic therapy in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction: rationale and design of the ticagrelor in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction treated with thrombolysis (TREAT) trial [^115y7t6D]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The safety and efficacy of ticagrelor in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with fibrinolytic therapy remain uncertain.

Objectives

The primary objective of the TicagRElor in pAtients with ST elevation myocardial infarction treated with Thrombolysis (TREAT) trial is to evaluate the short-term safety of ticagrelor when compared with clopidogrel in STEMI patients treated with fibrinolytic therapy. Key secondary objectives are to assess the safety and efficacy of ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel at 12-months.

Design

The TREAT trial is a multicenter, randomized, phase III, Prospective randomized open blinded end-point (PROBE) study that enrolled 3,799 patients in 152 sites from 10 countries. Following administration of fibrinolytic therapy patients were randomized to a loading dose of ticagrelor 180 mg or clopidogrel 300 mg followed by a maintenance dose of ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg/day for 12-months. The primary outcome is the rate of TIMI major bleeding at 30-days and will be assessed for non-inferiority using an intention-to-treat analysis. Co-treatments include aspirin and anticoagulants. Other evidence based therapies are also recommended. Secondary efficacy outcome include a composite of death from vascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, severe recurrent ischemia, transient ischemic attack or other arterial thrombotic event. All-cause mortality as well as individual components of the combined efficacy endpoint will also be ascertained.

Summary

TREAT is an international randomized controlled trial comparing ticagrelor with clopidogrel in STEMI patients treated with fibrinolytic therapy. The results of this trial will inform clinical practice and international guidelines.

### Double-blind, randomized, prospective comparison of loading doses of 600 mg clopidogrel versus 60 mg prasugrel in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction scheduled for primary percutaneous intervention: the ETAMI trial (early thienopyridine treatment to improve primary PCI in patients with acute myocardial infarction) [^11278BJg]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study compared the timing of onset of antiplatelet action after treatment with clopidogrel and prasugrel at first medical contact in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) scheduled for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI).

Background

Little is known about the timing of onset of antiplatelet action after a pre-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) loading dose of clopidogrel or prasugrel in patients with STEMI.

Methods

This double-blind, prospective study randomized 62 patients with STEMI scheduled for PPCI in the ambulance or the emergency department to 60 mg prasugrel (n = 31) or 600 mg clopidogrel (n = 31). The primary endpoint was the platelet reactivity index (PRI) measured with the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein assay 2 h after intake of the study medication. Secondary endpoints were PRI after 4 h, TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) patency of the infarct-related artery before and after PCI, and clinical events until day 30.

Results

The PRI after 2 h (50.4 ± 32.7% vs. 66.3 ± 22.2%; p = 0.035) and after 4 h (39.1 ± 27.5% vs. 54.5 ± 49.3%; p = 0.038) were significantly lower with prasugrel compared with clopidogrel. In addition, the rate of patients with a PRI < 50% tended to be higher with prasugrel compared with clopidogrel after 2 h (46.7% vs. 28.6%; p = 0.15) and after 4 h (63.0% vs. 38.9%; p = 0.06). There were no significant differences in TIMI 2/3 patency before PCI (39.2% vs. 31.0%; p = 0.43) and TIMI 3 patency after PCI (88.5% vs. 89.3%; p = 0.92).

Conclusions

The pre-PCI administration of prasugrel in patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI was associated with a significant faster platelet inhibition compared with clopidogrel. Therefore, prasugrel should be preferred to clopidogrel in this setting.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Oral P2Y12 inhibitors — Clinically available oral P2Y12 inhibitors include clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor; clopidogrel is the least potent oral P2Y12 inhibitor and requires more time to reach its maximal platelet inhibition after a loading dose because it requires biotransformation in the liver to form its active metabolite. Ticagrelor and prasugrel are more potent than clopidogrel and achieve more rapid onset of inhibition of platelet activation but with increased risk of bleeding compared with clopidogrel. Ticagrelor may cause subjective transient dyspnea in approximately 10% to 15% of patients after acute coronary syndromes (ACS). In patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with fibrinolytic therapy, the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin reduces 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including recurrent myocardial infarction, and improves survival. In a secondary analysis of TRITON-TIMI 38, subgroup analyses using an outcome of net clinical benefit demonstrated net harm with prasugrel versus clopidogrel among patients with previous transient ischemic attack or stroke; dose reduction of prasugrel should be considered in patients ≥ 75 years of age and in those with a body weight < 60 kg.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of emergency department patients with suspected Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes [^112KR39K]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy for acute non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the emergency department — recommendation strength states that Level A recommendations are none specified, Level B recommendations are none specified, and Level C recommendations state that P2Y12 inhibitors and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors may be given in the ED or delayed until cardiac catheterization. The policy question asked whether adult patients with acute NSTEMI should receive immediate antiplatelet therapy in addition to aspirin to reduce 30-day MACE, and the document notes that beyond aspirin the emergency physician does not need to make an immediate decision on these agents and can defer to local cardiologists, which may help avoid delays in transitions of care and increased costs and potential adverse effects from excessive ED use.

Fibrinolytic-treated STEMI antiplatelet dosing and PCI alternatives — In CLARITY-TIMI 28, adding clopidogrel to aspirin in STEMI patients who were < 75 years and received fibrinolytic therapy reduced the odds of an occluded infarct-related artery and the 30-day composite of cardiovascular death, recurrent myocardial infarction, or recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization. In COMMIT among suspected myocardial infarction (93% STEMI, 54% fibrinolytic-treated) receiving aspirin, clopidogrel 75 mg/day (without a loading dose) significantly lowered the composite of death, reinfarction, or stroke and mortality alone, with no significant excess in bleeding versus placebo. Based on the design of these trials, when administered concurrently with fibrinolytic therapy, clopidogrel is recommended to be administered with a loading dose (300 mg, then 75 mg daily) for patients < 75 years of age and starting without a loading dose (75 mg daily) for patients ≥ 75 years of age. For patients treated with a fibrinolytic agent who undergo subsequent PCI, either clopidogrel or ticagrelor (age < 75 years, within 24 hours after a fibrinolytic agent) or prasugrel (> 24 hours after a fibrinolytic agent) are alternatives to support PCI. In a trial of 3799 fibrinolytic-treated STEMI patients, 89% of whom also received clopidogrel, ticagrelor initiated at a median of 11.4 hours (interquartile range, 5.8–18.2 hours) after fibrinolysis was noninferior to clopidogrel for major bleeding.

### SCAI expert consensus statement on the management of patients with STEMI referred for primary PCI [^117PdDxW]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2024). High credibility.

ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — managing thrombus — should assess thrombus after guide wire placement because an initial TIMI thrombus grade 5 may rapidly improve to grade 0 or grade 1 once crossed. Large routine manual aspiration trials collectively enrolled over 18,000 patients and failed to reduce all-cause mortality or cardiovascular events; accordingly, current guidelines recommend against the routine use of thrombus aspiration in STEMI, although this recommendation does not apply to extensive thrombus burden with failure of reperfusion from clot embolization or unsuccessful balloon angioplasty, where selective thrombectomy may be needed, and a higher stroke risk with thrombus aspiration was noted only in patients with a large thrombus burden. When aspiration thrombectomy is performed, optimal technique includes avoiding thrombectomy in severely tortuous arteries, deep seating of the guiding catheter upon withdrawal to minimize dislodgement down a side branch or into the aorta, continuous active aspiration until just before the catheter enters the hemostatic valve, and "back bleeding" followed by flushing to clear residual thrombus. For persistent thrombus, adjunctive pharmacology can be considered; a meta-analysis reporting on 14 trials (3754 patients) of intracoronary versus intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (GPI) showed no difference in long-term major adverse cardiovascular events, and intracoronary agents are generally reserved for significantly large thrombus or no-reflow. The laser is generally reserved for refractory thrombus (particularly in saphenous venous grafts or in COVID-19 complicated STEMI), and with residual large thrombus after reestablished flow, deferred stenting improved coronary blood flow in a small randomized trial but larger studies did not confirm a reduction in clinical events.

Initial choice of P2Y12 inhibitor in patients not requiring an oral anticoagulant — PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) for non–ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) or ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI): aspirin + ticagrelor or prasugrel (Class 1); clopidogrel when ticagrelor or prasugrel are not available, cannot be tolerated or contraindicated. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG): aspirin + ticagrelor or clopidogrel (Class 1), and continue aspirin during CABG and start P2Y12 inhibitor when safe postoperatively. No planned invasive evaluation: aspirin + ticagrelor (Class 1); clopidogrel when ticagrelor is not available, cannot be tolerated or contraindicated. Fibrinolytic therapy in STEMI: aspirin + clopidogrel (Class 1), and an alternate P2Y12 inhibitor can be considered at PCI if applicable.

### Prasugrel compared with clopidogrel in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (TRITON-TIMI 38): double-blind, randomised controlled trial [^1127JYo7]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Mechanical reperfusion with stenting for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is supported by dual antiplatelet treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel. Prasugrel, a potent and rapid-acting thienopyridine, is a potential alternative to clopidogrel. We aimed to assess prasugrel versus clopidogrel in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for STEMI.

Methods

We undertook a double-blind, randomised controlled trial in 707 sites in 30 countries. 3534 participants presenting with STEMI were randomly assigned by interactive voice response system either prasugrel (60 mg loading, 10 mg maintenance [n = 1769]) or clopidogrel (300 mg loading, 75 mg maintenance [n = 1765]) and were unaware of the allocation. The primary endpoint was cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke. Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat. Follow-up was to 15 months, with secondary analyses at 30 days. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00097591.

Findings

At 30 days, 115 (6.5%) individuals assigned prasugrel had met the primary endpoint compared with 166 (9.5%) allocated clopidogrel (hazard ratio 0.68 [95% CI 0.54–0.87]; p = 0.0017). This effect continued to 15 months (174 [10.0%] vs 216 [12.4%]; 0.79 [0.65–0.97]; p = 0.0221). The key secondary endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or urgent target vessel revascularisation was also significantly reduced with prasugrel at 30 days (0.75 [0.59–0.96]; p = 0.0205) and 15 months (0.79 [0.65–0.97]; p = 0.0250), as was stent thrombosis. Treatments did not differ with respect to thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) major bleeding unrelated to coronary-artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery at 30 days (p = 0.3359) and 15 months (p = 0.6451). TIMI life-threatening bleeding and TIMI major or minor bleeding were also similar with the two treatments, and only TIMI major bleeding after CABG surgery was significantly increased with prasugrel (p = 0.0033).

Interpretation

In patients with STEMI undergoing PCI, prasugrel is more effective than clopidogrel for prevention of ischaemic events, without an apparent excess in bleeding.

### Antiplatelet therapy in diabetes: efficacy and limitations of current treatment strategies and future directions [^114gieW7]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The current American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for the management of unstable angina and NSTEMI recommend the addition of clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose and 75 mg/day maintenance dose) to aspirin in patients presenting with unstable angina and NSTEMI. Recently, the use of clopidogrel in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and endorsed by the current ACC/AHA guidelines on the management of STEMI patients. In acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients, guidelines state that clopidogrel should be used regardless of the treatment strategy adopted (invasive or noninvasive) and should, ideally, be continued for up to 1 year. The prognostic implications of compliance with adjunctive clopidogrel therapy are underscored by a rebound increase in death and myocardial infarctions following its withdrawal. This phenomenon is particularly apparent in diabetic patients and may be attributed to a more marked increase in platelet reactivity in these patients following clopidogrel withdrawal.

In contrast to the clear benefit seen with dual antiplatelet therapy across the spectrum of patients with ACS, including those undergoing PCI, the results of the Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk and Ischemic Stabilization, Management, and Avoidance (CHARISMA) trial showed that in high-risk but nonacute patients (n = 15,603) with clinically evident cardiovascular disease (n = 12,153) or multiple cardiovascular risk factors (n = 3,284), treatment with clopidogrel plus aspirin was not significantly more effective than that with aspirin alone in reducing the rate of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (6.8 vs. 7.3%, respectively; P = 0.22). Although a subgroup analysis in a higher-risk group (n = 9,478) with prior myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or symptomatic PAD ("CAPRIE-like" population) showed a 17% relative risk reduction (P = 0.01) with dual antiplatelet therapy, the opposite findings were observed in patients in the lower-risk cohort who were enrolled in the study based on the presence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors in which an increase in mortality was observed. Importantly, a large number of patients enrolled in this latter subgroup had diabetes, as diabetes diagnosis represented one of the key inclusion criteria. Therefore, dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel should not be advocated in the primary prevention setting for diabetic individuals.

### New recommendations from the 1999 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association acute myocardial infarction guidelines [^113wPcCs]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To review literature relating to significant changes in drug therapy recommendations in the 1999 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for treating patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

Data Sources

1999 ACC/AHA AMI guidelines, English-language clinical trials, reviews, and editorials researching the role of drug therapy and primary angioplasty for AMI that were referenced in the guidelines were included. Additional data published in 2000 or unpublished were also included if relevant to interpretation of the guidelines.

Study Selection

The articles selected influence AMI treatment recommendations.

Data Synthesis

Many clinicians and health systems use the ACC/AHA AMI guidelines to develop treatment plans for AMI patients. This review highlights important changes in AMI drug therapy recommendations by reviewing the results of recent clinical trials. Insights into evolving drug therapy strategies that may impact future guideline development are also described.

Conclusions

Several changes in drug therapy recommendations were included in the 1999 AMI ACC/AHA guidelines. There is emphasis on administering fibrin-specific thrombolytics secondary to enhanced efficacy. Selection between fibrin-specific agents is unclear at this time. Low response rates to thrombolytics have been noted in the elderly, women, patients with heart failure, and those showing left bundle-branch block on the electrocardiogram. These patient groups should be targeted for improved utilization programs. The use of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors in non-ST-segment elevation MI was emphasized. Small trials combining reduced doses of thrombolytics with GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors have shown promise by increasing reperfusion rates without increasing bleeding risk, but firm conclusions cannot be made until the results of larger trials are known. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) trials suggest lower mortality rates for primary PCI when compared with thrombolysis alone. However, primary PCI, including coronary angioplasty, is only available at approximately 13% of US hospitals, making thrombolysis the preferred strategy for most patients. Clopidogrel has supplanted ticlopidine as the recommended antiplatelet agent for patients with aspirin allergy or intolerance following reports of a better safety profile. The recommended dose of unfractionated heparin is lower than previously recommended, necessitating a separate nomogram for patients with acute coronary syndromes. Routine use of warfarin, either alone or in combination with aspirin, is not supported by clinical trials; however, warfarin remains a choice for antithrombotic therapy in patients intolerant to aspirin. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockers continue to be recommended, and emphasis is placed on improving rates of early administration (during hospitalization), even in patients with moderate left ventricular dysfunction. New recommendations for drug treatment of post-AMI patients with low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and/or elevated triglycerides are included, with either niacin or gemfibrozil recommended as an option. Supplementary antioxidants are not recommended for either primary or secondary prevention of AMI, with new data demonstrating lack of efficacy vitamin E in primary prevention. Estrogen replacement therapy or hormonal replacement therapy should not be initiated solely for prevention of cardiovascular disease, but can be continued in cardiovascular patients already taking long-term therapy for other reasons. Bupropion has been added as a new treatment option for smoking cessation. As drug therapy continues to evolve in treating AMI, more frequent updates of therapy guidelines will be necessary.

### Challenges of long-term dual antiplatelet therapy use following acute coronary syndromes [^1117Z6DN]. American Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

An acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event is associated with a high risk of recurrent ACS, stroke, and death. To ameliorate the risk of subsequent events, current guidelines for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST-segment elevation ACS recommend long-term management strategies for secondary prevention including risk factor modification and anti-ischemic and antiplatelet therapies. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), comprising aspirin plus a P2Y 12 inhibitor, is a critical component of secondary prevention therapy following ACS. However, despite the importance of DAPT for secondary prevention after ACS, questions remain over the optimal duration of therapy. Clinical evidence is emerging that maintenance DAPT > 12 months lowers the risk of recurrent ACS events; however, this benefit must be considered against any potential risks of prolonged DAPT such as bleeding. Several tools for bleeding risk assessment have shown promise; however, their limited accuracy and discriminative power necessitates further development. Assessment of patient ischemic risk should consider the complexity of the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure, anatomic burden of coronary artery disease, and additional underlying risk factors. Consequently, identifying patients in whom the risk:benefit ratio favors prolonged DAPT may prove invaluable for clinicians in deciding which patients should continue or stop taking DAPT at 12 months after PCI, or consider P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy as an option. This article reviews the most recent information about the risks and benefits of DAPT continued for > 12 months after ACS and provides critical guidance to assist physicians in identifying patients most likely to benefit from a secondary prevention strategy with DAPT.

1.2 Guideline recommendations for invasive and antiplatelet treatment of patients with NSTEMI

The standard of care for patients with NSTEMI at high ischemic risk is an early invasive strategy with cardiac catheterization within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms, with prompt revascularization using PCI or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery as clinically indicated. 13, 14, 15 Major international guidelines also recommend initiation of at least 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y 12 inhibitor (ticagrelor, prasugrel, or clopidogrel) in patients with NSTEMI who are managed with medical therapy and/or who are treated with revascularization (ie, irrespective of initial treatment strategy), unless there are previous or ongoing contraindications. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Ticagrelor is recommended over clopidogrel for patients with NSTEMI, including those pretreated with clopidogrel (which should be discontinued when ticagrelor is started). Ticagrelor is contraindicated in patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage or ongoing bleeds. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Prasugrel is recommended for patients with NSTEMI who have received angiography and are undergoing PCI. However, prasugrel is not recommended for patients in whom coronary anatomy is unknown and an indication for PCI is not clearly established; patients who are 75 years of age or older; or patients with a body weight of less than 60 kg. Prasugrel is contraindicated in patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, or ongoing bleeds. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Clopidogrel is a less potent P2Y 12 inhibitor than ticagrelor and prasugrel; it is recommended for patients who cannot receive ticagrelor or prasugrel, or who require oral anticoagulation. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18

Clinical risk scores, such as the DAPT score, can help guide decisions around whether to continue antiplatelet therapy beyond 1 year, by providing a risk‐benefit ratio based on age, smoking status, comorbidity, and medical history. 19 For patients with NSTEMI who are elderly and have a high comorbidity burden, conservative treatment could be a reasonable approach. 16, 19

### Prasugrel [^114PgrHm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Prasugrel tablets is a P2Y12platelet inhibitor indicated for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events (including stent thrombosis) in patients with acute coronary syndrome who are to be managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as follows:

Patients with unstable angina or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) (1.1).
Patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) when managed with either primary or delayed PCI (1.1).

1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome

Prasugrel tablet is indicated to reduce the rate of thrombotic cardiovascular (CV) events (including stent thrombosis) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who are to be managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as follows:

Patients with unstable angina (UA) or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
Patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) when managed with primary or delayed PCI.

Prasugrel tablet has been shown to reduce the rate of a combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), or nonfatal stroke compared to clopidogrel. The difference between treatments was driven predominantly by MI, with no difference on strokes and little difference on CV death [see Clinical Studies (14)].

### Incidence, predictors, and clinical impact of early prasugrel cessation in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^1174oPEV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Flow restoration in the infarct‐related artery by means of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for potent platelet inhibition are the cornerstones for management of patients with acute ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). 1, 2 Compared with clopidogrel, prasugrel provides rapid‐onset, more potent and consistent inhibition of platelet aggregation, 3 and reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality and stent thrombosis in patients with myocardial infarction (MI). 4 Prasugrel is recommended over clopidogrel following primary PCI 1, 2 and is used increasingly in real‐world clinical practice. 5

Nonadherence to recommended antiplatelet therapy following PCI is not uncommon and increases the risk of adverse ischemic events. 6, 7, 8 Notably, different modes of DAPT cessation (either driven by physician recommendation, patient noncompliance, or interventions necessitating temporary treatment withdrawal) appear to have varying effects on patient outcomes. 6 Previous studies assessing premature cessation of antiplatelet therapy focused primarily on more stable clinical settings and clopidogrel rather than novel, potent P2Y 12 ‐inhibitors, and they often did not account for the temporal relation between treatment cessation and subsequent outcomes. 9, 10 While STEMI is characterized by elevated ischemic risk compared with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and is an independent predictor of stent thrombosis, 11 there are limited data on the adherence to guideline‐recommended antiplatelet treatment following primary PCI. Moreover, although certain aspects of prasugrel treatment might adversely affect long‐term compliance, including greater treatment cost or accentuated risk of bleeding, little is known about adherence to prasugrel in patients with STEMI. Against this background, we sought to address the incidence, underlying reasons, and clinical impact of early prasugrel cessation in a sizable, contemporary cohort of patients with STEMI treated by current standards (ie, primary PCI with predominantly new‐generation drug‐eluting stents [DES]).

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) initial P2Y12 inhibitor selection for patients not requiring an oral anticoagulant specifies that for PCI (non–ST-segment elevation ACS [NSTE-ACS] or ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]): aspirin + ticagrelor or prasugrel (Class 1), with clopidogrel when ticagrelor or prasugrel are not available, cannot be tolerated or contraindicated; for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG): aspirin + ticagrelor or clopidogrel (Class 1) and continue aspirin during CABG and start P2Y12 inhibitor when safe postoperatively; for no planned invasive evaluation: aspirin + ticagrelor (Class 1), with clopidogrel when ticagrelor is not available, cannot be tolerated or contraindicated; and for fibrinolytic therapy in STEMI: aspirin + clopidogrel (Class 1), with an alternate P2Y12 inhibitor can be considered at PCI (if applicable).

St-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) P2Y12 inhibitor efficacy and pretreatment — In TRITON-TIMI 38 STEMI subgroup (n = 3534), prasugrel significantly reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) by 21% and stent thrombosis by 42% at 15 months, and in PLATO STEMI primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (n = 7544), ticagrelor was associated with a significant reduction in stent thrombosis and an 18% reduction in all-cause death compared with clopidogrel. In a randomized trial of prehospital versus in-hospital ticagrelor before PPCI for STEMI, allocation did not improve the primary endpoint of coronary reperfusion prior to PCI, although upstream ticagrelor was associated with a reduction in stent thrombosis with similar bleeding. Registry data have not shown clear clinical benefit for preloading a P2Y12 inhibitor in STEMI, while a meta-analysis showed clopidogrel pretreatment was associated with lower MACE without increased bleeding. Clopidogrel is effective for prevention of stent thrombosis and early recurrent ischemic events, but in STEMI undergoing PPCI, prasugrel and ticagrelor reduce recurrent MACE compared with clopidogrel.

### Achieved platelet aggregation inhibition after different antiplatelet regimens during percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^116SveeJ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the extent of platelet aggregation inhibition in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), treated with different antiplatelet agents and dosages.

Background

The extent of platelet aggregation inhibition is an independent predictor of major cardiac events after elective PCI. In STEMI patients undergoing PCI, routine dose of antiplatelet agents may be associated with less effective platelet aggregation inhibition.

Methods

Patients were treated with clopidogrel before angiography and randomized to abciximab, tirofiban, high-dose tirofiban, or no glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitor; GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor bolus, followed by maintenance infusion, was administered after angiography, but before PCI. Platelet aggregation inhibition was assessed before angiography, immediately after PCI, and 1 and 6 h afterwards.

Results

The total study population consisted of 112 patients. Platelet aggregation inhibition was variable for individuals and suboptimal for all agents, particularly in the periprocedural period. Only with high-dose tirofiban, mean periprocedural platelet aggregation inhibition exceeded 80%. Angiographic parameters after PCI were not different between the groups. No relationship was found between the level of platelet aggregation and parameters of PCI success (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction frame count and myocardial blush grade), after combining the data from all four groups studied.

Conclusions

Platelet aggregation inhibition in STEMI patients undergoing PCI, treated with antiplatelet agents, is variable and suboptimal for all agents and dosages studied. Only with high-dose tirofiban, mean periprocedural platelet aggregation inhibition exceeded 80%. However, no relationship of platelet aggregation inhibition and angiographic outcome was found in this patient cohort.

2 CHALLENGES FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH NSTEMI

2.1 Patient characteristics

Patients with NSTEMI present with more heterogeneous characteristics than patients with STEMI, with a wide variation in ischemic risk and comorbid conditions, making NSTEMI more challenging to diagnose and treat in these patients. 34 Whereas patients with STEMI typically have complete occlusion of a large epicardial coronary artery, patients with NSTEMI are often affected by multiple variable factors; including varying degrees of reduction of coronary flow, atherosclerotic changes in the vessel wall, calcification, plaque rupture, and subsequent nonocclusive intracoronary thrombus formation. 35 Indeed, in a study of patients hospitalized with MI who underwent coronary angiography in Alberta, Canada, of the 2092 patients with MI with nonobstructive coronary arteries, 1542 (73.7%) received a diagnosis of NSTEMI, and 550 (26.3%) a diagnosis of STEMI. 36

There is also heterogeneity in the demographics of NSTEMI patient populations across the world, as indicated by the variety of patient demographic data across different countries. 37, 38, 39 This heterogeneity could partly explain the variation in mortality of patients with cardiovascular disease between countries. 37, 38, 40

Furthermore, patients with NSTEMI are more likely to be older in age and have a higher rate of comorbidities, such as diabetes, impaired renal function, and lung disease, than patients with STEMI. 41, 42 These comorbidities contribute to a greater burden of coronary artery disease and an increased risk of cardiovascular events for patients with NSTEMI, and therefore lead to increased long‐term mortality. 5, 15

The wide variation in risk in patients with NSTEMI affects treatment decisions. Some patients are considered at too low risk of recurrent cardiovascular events to warrant an invasive strategy, whereas others are regarded as "too sick" to undergo coronary angiography and/or subsequent revascularization because of advanced age or severe comorbidities. 43 Figure 1 shows the benefit of invasive management vs. medical management on the survival of patients with NSTEMI.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)–treated ACS antiplatelet strategies — Results from several randomized trials have consistently shown that aspirin withdrawal followed by ticagrelor monotherapy after 1 to 3 months of ticagrelor-based DAPT results in less bleeding without clear excess in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), as compared with continued DAPT among patients with ACS undergoing PCI; although data with clopidogrel have been mixed, concerns have been raised that clopidogrel monotherapy started 1 to 2 months after PCI may increase risk of MACE, and it remains unknown whether this may be explained by excess thrombotic risk in patients displaying inadequate platelet inhibition to clopidogrel, observed in 30% to 40% of patients after PCI; additionally, a randomized trial showed that P2Y12 inhibitor discontinuation followed by aspirin alone after 6 months of DAPT resulted in excess thrombotic risk among ACS patients undergoing PCI (n = 2712; 38% ST-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]) with similar findings after earlier discontinuation 3 months after PCI; the safety of prasugrel monotherapy has not been established in patients ≥ 1 month post ACS, and low-dose prasugrel monotherapy (3.75 mg daily) very early after PCI with ACS or at high bleeding risk may increase 30-day MACE compared with DAPT.

### Prasugrel versus clopidogrel in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction according to timing of percutaneous coronary intervention: a TRITON-TIMI 38 subgroup analysis (trial to assess improvement in therapeutic outcomes by optimizing platelet inhibition with prasugrel-thrombolysis in myocardial infarction 38) [^116tiJiT]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to evaluate the efficacy of prasugrel versus clopidogrel in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) by the timing of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Background

Treatment strategies and outcomes for patients with STEMI may differ when treated with primary compared with secondary PCI.

Methods

STEMI patients in the TRITON-TIMI 38 (Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition with Prasugrel-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 38) were randomized to prasugrel or clopidogrel on presentation if primary PCI was intended or later during secondary PCI. Primary PCI was defined as within 12 h of symptom onset. The primary endpoint was cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke. Because periprocedural MI is difficult to assess in the setting of STEMI, we performed analyses excluding these events.

Results

Reductions in the primary endpoint with prasugrel versus clopidogrel (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65 to 0.97; p = 0.022) were consistent between primary and secondary PCI patients at 15 months (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.69 to 1.13 vs. HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.46 to 0.93; p interaction = 0.15). However, a tendency toward a difference in treatment effect at 30 days (HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.54 to 0.87; p = 0.002) was observed between primary and secondary PCI patients (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.60 to 1.09 vs. HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.76; p interaction = 0.06). When periprocedural MI was excluded, the efficacy of prasugrel remained consistent among primary and secondary PCI patients at 30 days (HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.81 vs. HR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.88; p interaction = 0.68) and 15 months (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.56 to 1.03 vs. HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.46 to 1.21; p interaction = 0.96).

Conclusions

The efficacy of prasugrel versus clopidogrel was consistent irrespective of the timing of PCI, particularly in preventing nonprocedural events.
