## Question

Second line cat bite treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about second-line antibiotic options for cat bites, including when to use them, which regimens to choose, dosing, duration, and special situations like pregnancy, severe infection, and penicillin allergy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why cat bites are high risk. Then, I should verify what constitutes first-line therapy and the rationale. Next, I will identify valid second-line oral and IV alternatives with correct dosing and duration. After that, I need to check special populations and scenarios, including pregnancy, severe infection, and immunocompromise. Finally, I will integrate wound care, tetanus, and rabies considerations and close with a concise, practical summary algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk profile. Cat bites are puncture wounds with a high infection risk, often polymicrobial, and Pasteurella multocida is classically isolated; Capnocytophaga and anaerobes are also common, and the hand is a frequent site where deep structures and joints are at risk, so I need to ensure antibiotic choices cover these pathogens and that we do not under-treat [^116TuMqa] [^111uLr8V] [^113veX8X].

> I should confirm first-line therapy before discussing second-line options. Amoxicillin–clavulanate is the recommended first-line agent for prophylaxis and treatment of cat bites because it provides reliable coverage of Pasteurella, streptococci, staphylococci, and anaerobes; typical adult dosing is 875/125 mg orally twice daily for 3–7 days, with pediatric dosing at 22.5 mg/kg twice daily for 3–7 days, and this is supported by IDSA and contemporary primary care guidance [^112TNn17] [^111uLr8V] [^1162UJWa] [^112WtvQo] [^113iLkpN].

> Now, I will examine second-line oral options for patients who cannot take amoxicillin–clavulanate, especially due to beta-lactam allergy. Wait, let me verify the preferred alternative. Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily is a reasonable second-line choice because it covers Pasteurella and many aerobes, though it lacks reliable anaerobic coverage; therefore, if anaerobes are a concern, I should pair doxycycline with metronidazole 500 mg orally every 8 hours, and I need to ensure I state that clearly to avoid undertreatment of anaerobes [^111uLr8V] [^114UcFAC] [^112TNn17].

> Hold on, I should verify another commonly cited second-line regimen. Ciprofloxacin 500–750 mg orally twice daily plus metronidazole 500 mg orally every 8 hours is an accepted alternative that provides gram-negative and Pasteurella coverage plus anaerobic coverage; I initially thought ciprofloxacin monotherapy might suffice, but wait, that would miss anaerobes, so I should correct that and keep the combination with metronidazole unless there is a compelling reason otherwise [^111uLr8V] [^114gfxEA] [^112TNn17].

> Let me consider additional oral options and their limitations. Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole double-strength twice daily can be used for aerobes including MRSA risk, but it has poor anaerobic activity, so I should add metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours when anaerobes are suspected; clindamycin 300 mg orally three times daily has good anaerobic and staphylococcal coverage but misses Pasteurella, so it should not be used alone for cat bites; macrolides like azithromycin have variable Pasteurella activity and are not preferred empirically for cat bites, though they are first-line for cat-scratch disease, which is a different entity, so I should not conflate these indications [^111uLr8V] [^114gfxEA] [^112TNn17] [^111sf6kj].

> Next, I should review intravenous options for severe infection, systemic toxicity, or when oral therapy is not feasible. Ampicillin–sulbactam, ceftriaxone plus metronidazole, or piperacillin–tazobactam are appropriate broad-spectrum choices that cover Pasteurella, streptococci, staphylococci, and anaerobes; selection should be individualized to local resistance patterns, renal function, and severity, and I need to ensure I note that IV therapy should be stepped down to oral when clinically stable [^111uLr8V] [^114gfxEA] [^112TNn17].

> I should double-check duration and when to extend therapy. For uncomplicated cat bites without deep structure involvement, 3–5 days is typical; extend to 7–10 days for slow response, deep infection, hand involvement, immunocompromise, or delayed presentation; for established infection, 10–14 days is reasonable, with longer courses for osteomyelitis or joint involvement, and I should align this with IDSA and primary care guidance [^111uLr8V] [^114gfxEA] [^11243jjZ].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant. I need to ensure teratogen avoidance. Tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones are generally contraindicated in pregnancy, so amoxicillin–clavulanate remains preferred if not allergic; if penicillins are contraindicated, azithromycin can be considered for prophylaxis or treatment in select scenarios, recognizing it does not provide anaerobic coverage, and I should document shared decision-making regarding risks and benefits [^111uLr8V] [^115eKUwo].

> I will now examine special scenarios that change management. If there is concern for MRSA, I should add doxycycline, TMP-SMX, or minocycline to the regimen depending on the backbone; if there is established abscess or purulence, source control with drainage is essential and antibiotics alone are insufficient; if there are systemic signs or immunocompromise, I should favor IV therapy and broader coverage initially with step-down as cultures and clinical response guide therapy [^111uLr8V] [^114gfxEA] [^112TNn17].

> Next, I should review non-antibiotic management that meaningfully reduces infection risk. Copious irrigation with saline, careful exploration for foreign bodies or tendon/bone involvement, judicious debridement, and decisions about closure are foundational; primary closure is generally avoided except for facial wounds, and hand wounds or puncture wounds should heal by secondary intention; tetanus prophylaxis should be updated per CDC guidance, and rabies risk should be assessed in coordination with public health authorities [^111uNx3y] [^111smVvu] [^113G6uSZ] [^111b3yDd].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. If amoxicillin–clavulanate is not an option, I should choose doxycycline 100 mg twice daily plus metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours for 5–7 days, or ciprofloxacin 500–750 mg twice daily plus metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours for 5–7 days; for severe infection or systemic toxicity, use IV ampicillin–sulbactam, ceftriaxone plus metronidazole, or piperacillin–tazobactam with step-down to oral therapy when stable; tailor duration to response and depth of involvement, and always pair antibiotics with meticulous wound care and appropriate tetanus and rabies decisions [^111uLr8V] [^114gfxEA] [^112TNn17] [^112mVfHi].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and red flags. Re-evaluation within 24–48 hours is prudent for cat bites, especially to the hand, with escalation if there is progression, fever, lymphangitis, or concern for deep space infection; I need to ensure patients understand signs of worsening and the importance of adherence, and I should document the rationale for choosing a second-line regimen and any deviations from standard durations [^111uLr8V] [^112mVfHi].

For cat bites, **amoxicillin-clavulanate is first-line** [^111uLr8V]; if unavailable or contraindicated, **doxycycline plus metronidazole** is a recommended second-line regimen [^111uLr8V] that covers Pasteurella, anaerobes, and common aerobes. Ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole is an alternative when doxycycline is unsuitable, but avoid fluoroquinolones in children and pregnant patients. Treat for 5–7 days, extending to 10–14 days if infection is severe or slow to resolve. Always combine antibiotics with thorough irrigation, debridement, and assessment for tetanus and rabies prophylaxis [^112mVfHi] [^111b3yDd].

---

## Indications for second-line therapy

Second-line therapy is indicated when:

- **First-line therapy contraindicated**: Amoxicillin-clavulanate is unsuitable due to allergy or intolerance.
- **Allergy considerations**: Beta-lactam allergy necessitates alternative agents.
- **Treatment failure**: Infection persists or progresses despite first-line therapy.

---

## Recommended second-line antibiotic regimens

| **Antibiotic regimen** | **Dosage** | **Duration** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Doxycycline + Metronidazole | Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID + Metronidazole 500 mg PO TID | 5–7 days | - Beta-lactam allergy <br/> - Covers Pasteurella, anaerobes, and common aerobes |
| Ciprofloxacin + Metronidazole | Ciprofloxacin 500–750 mg PO BID + Metronidazole 500 mg PO TID | 5–7 days | - Alternative when doxycycline is unsuitable <br/> - Avoid in children and pregnancy |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole + Clindamycin | TMP-SMX 1–2 DS tablets PO BID + Clindamycin 300 mg PO TID | 5–7 days | - MRSA risk or failure of first-line therapy |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting second-line regimens

Doxycycline plus metronidazole is supported by IDSA for its **coverage of Pasteurella, anaerobes, and common aerobes** [^111uLr8V]. Ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole is an alternative when doxycycline is unsuitable, but avoid in children and pregnant patients due to safety concerns. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus clindamycin is considered when MRSA is suspected or first-line therapy fails.

---

## Duration of therapy

Standard duration is **5–7 days** for uncomplicated infections; extend to 10–14 days for severe infection, immunocompromised hosts, or slow clinical response.

---

## Adjunctive wound management

- **Irrigation and debridement**: Essential to reduce infection risk [^113Xs2eU].
- **Tetanus prophylaxis**: Update vaccination status as indicated [^113G6uSZ].
- **Rabies prophylaxis**: Assess and administer if indicated [^111b3yDd].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Avoid doxycycline and fluoroquinolones; consider azithromycin or erythromycin.
- **Pediatric patients**: Avoid fluoroquinolones; prefer doxycycline plus metronidazole or TMP-SMX plus clindamycin.
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Consider broader-spectrum agents or intravenous therapy.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Re-evaluate within **24–48 hours** to assess response and adjust therapy if there is no improvement or if deterioration occurs. Second-line therapy for cat bites should be tailored to patient-specific factors, including allergies, comorbidities, and infection severity, with close follow-up to ensure clinical response.

### Infectious complications of bite injuries [^116TuMqa]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Animal and human bite injuries are a public health burden. Dog bites outnumber cat bites, but cat bites pose the greatest risk for infection. Skin and soft tissue infections are the most frequent infectious manifestations resulting from bite injury, although invasive infection may occur through direct inoculation or dissemination through the bloodstream. Although contemporary, well-designed trials are needed to inform clinical practice, preemptive antibiotic therapy after a bite injury is warranted for injuries posing high risk for infection and for patients at risk of developing severe infection; antibiotics should target aerobic and anaerobic microbes that comprise the oral and skin flora.

Question 3: What treatment would be most appropriate for this patient?
A. Rifampin and isoniazid for 6 months
B. Cephalexin for 10 days
C. Fluconazole for 6 weeks
D. Azithromycin and doxycycline for 4 months
E. Ciprofloxacin for 2 weeks

Answers:
A. Rifampin and isoniazid for 6 months – Incorrect. Rifampin and isoniazid are more appropriate for the treatment of latent tuberculosis. While rifampin does have activity against some atypical mycobacterium, M chelonae is unlikely to respond well to this antibiotic combination.
B. Cephalexin for 10 days – Incorrect. Cephalexin is a first-generation cephalosporin with limited activity against atypical mycobacterium. It is more often used to target staphylococcal or streptococcal infections.
C. Fluconazole for 6 weeks – Incorrect. Fluconazole is an antifungal agent that is not effective against mycobacterium species.
D. Azithromycin and doxycycline for 4 months – Correct. Combination therapy with a macrolide antibiotic and tetracycline for a long-term period (at least 3 months) are appropriate to target M chelonae. Ideally, antibiotic treatment is based on specific susceptibilities if available. The use of doxycycline over other tetracyclines such as minocycline minimizes the risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions.
E. Ciprofloxacin for 2 weeks – Incorrect. Fluoroquinolones alone are inappropriate for the treatment of this atypical mycobacterium and would need to be combined with a macrolide or tetracycline to account for resistance.

Dog or cat bites — Preemptive antibiotics are recommended for high-risk patients and rabies postexposure prophylaxis may be needed. Preemptive early antimicrobial therapy for 3–5 days is recommended for patients who are immunocompromised, asplenic, have advanced liver disease, have preexisting or resultant edema of the affected area, have moderate to severe injuries (especially to the hand or face), or have injuries that may have penetrated the periosteum or joint capsule (strong, low). Postexposure prophylaxis for rabies may be indicated; consultation with local health officials is recommended to determine if vaccination should be initiated (strong, low).

### Bites (mammalian) [^1112RfdJ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mammalian bites are usually caused by dogs, cats, or humans, and are more prevalent in children (especially boys) than in adults. Animal bites are usually caused by the person's pet and, in children, frequently involve the face. Human bites tend to occur in children as a result of playing or fighting, while in adults they are usually the result of physical or sexual abuse. Mixed aerobe and anaerobe infection is the most common type of infection, and can occur in up to half of human bites.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent complications of mammalian bites? What are the effects of treatments for infected mammalian bites? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found five systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotic prophylaxis (human bites, non-human bites), antibiotics, debridement, decontamination, irrigation, primary wound closure, and tetanus vaccination (after mammalian bites).

### Dog and cat bites [^111CjnYD]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Animal bites account for 1% of all emergency department visits in the United States and more than $50 million in health care costs per year. Most animal bites are from a dog, usually one known to the victim. Most dog bite victims are children. Bite wounds should be cleaned, copiously irrigated with normal saline using a 20-mL or larger syringe or a 20-gauge catheter attached to the syringe. The wound should be explored for tendon or bone involvement and possible foreign bodies. Wounds may be closed if cosmetically favorable, such as wounds on the face or gaping wounds. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered, especially if there is a high risk of infection, such as with cat bites, with puncture wounds, with wounds to the hand, and in persons who are immunosuppressed. Amoxicillin/clavulanate is the first-line prophylactic antibiotic. The need for rabies prophylaxis should be addressed with any animal bite because even domestic animals are often unvaccinated. Postexposure rabies prophylaxis consists of immune globulin at presentation and vaccination on days 0, 3, 7, and 14. Counseling patients and families about animal safety may help decrease animal bites. In most states, physicians are required by law to report animal bites.

### Dog and cat bites: rapid evidence review [^112mVfHi]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Animal bites are a significant burden to health care systems worldwide. In the United States, dog bites account for an average of 337,000 emergency visits and generate medical costs of up to $2 billion per year. Most animal bites in adults and children are from a dog, and most bite patients are children who have been bitten by animals known to them. Dog bites may cause crush and soft-tissue avulsion, whereas cat bites usually cause deeper puncture-type wounds. Children most often present with dog bites on the head and neck, and adolescents and adults usually present with dog bites on the extremities and hands. Bite wounds should be examined, cleaned, and irrigated with warm water or normal saline solution, and any foreign bodies and devitalized tissue should be removed. Neurovascular function (e.g., pulses, sensation) and range and movement of adjacent joints should be examined and documented. Antibiotic prophylaxis, with amoxicillin/clavulanate as the first-line choice, should be considered for all bites, particularly for those at increased risk of infection. Imaging and laboratory studies are usually not required unless there is suspicion of a retained foreign body, damage to underlying structures, infection, or extensive injury. Primary closure of bite wounds may be performed if there is low risk of infection. The need for tetanus vaccination and rabies postexposure prophylaxis should be evaluated for each patient; bites that do not break the skin generally do not require rabies postexposure prophylaxis.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111uLr8V]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Infected animal bite–related wounds — treatment recommendations and options: An antimicrobial agent or agents active against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria such as amoxicillin-clavulanate (Table 5) should be used (strong, moderate). Purulent bite wounds and abscesses are more likely to be polymicrobial, whereas nonpurulent wounds commonly yield staphylococci and streptococci, and Pasteurella species are commonly isolated from both nonpurulent wounds with or without lymphangitis and from abscesses; nonpurulent wound infections may also be polymicrobial. Based on this bacteriology, amoxicillin-clavulanate is appropriate oral therapy that covers the most likely aerobes and anaerobes found in bite wounds. Alternative therapies could include second-generation cephalosporins (intravenously [IV] or by mouth [po]) (eg, cefuroxime), other second- or third-generation cephalosporins, plus anaerobic coverage (clindamycin or metronidazole) if required; a carbapenem, moxifloxacin, or doxycycline is also appropriate. If SMX-TMP or levofloxacin is used, anaerobic coverage with either clindamycin or metronidazole should be added. Unless no alternative agents are available, macrolides should be avoided due to variable activity against Pasteurella multocida and fusobacteria. Pregnancy is a relative contraindication for use of tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones, whereas SMX-TMP may be safely prescribed except in the third trimester of pregnancy.

### Family practice international… [^11243jjZ]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Management of Bite Wounds Even apparently minor bite wounds should be thoroughly investigated, because external features may not reliably indicate the extent of internal damage. High-pressure irrigation is recommended to clean bite wounds and ensure removal of contaminants. This may be achieved using a 30- to 35-mL syringe equipped with an 18- to 20-gauge plastic catheter or needle. The tip of the syringe should be placed approximately 2 cm above the wound. At least 200 mL of saline is required to irrigate small bite wounds. Goggles and protective shields should be used by physicians to avoid self-contamination from splashing debris. Devitalized tissue should be excised; however, blunt probing of wounds is discouraged because this can damage tissue and increase the risk of infection.

Rabies and tetanus prophylaxis should be considered on an individual basis, depending on the type of animal involved, local risk factors and patient status. Secondary closure may reduce the risk of infection and provide better long-term cosmetic results than primary closure in most patients. Primary closure is most frequently used in recent, low-risk, uninfected wounds. The use of prophylactic antibiotics depends on the extent of tissue damage and the circumstances of the bite. Dog and cat bites are most likely to cause infection by a mixture of organisms, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is the antibiotic of choice. Bite wounds should be evaluated within 48 hours to assess for signs of infection and to reevaluate wounds that were initially left open. Good evidence supports restricting saturated fat to less than 10 percent of caloric intake.

Depending on comorbidities and complications, patients may also benefit from advice to lower their intake of salt and cholesterol, and to increase consumption of dietary fiber and specific micronutrients, such as magnesium and antioxidants, that may be significant in preventing microvascular and other complications. The condition has spontaneous remissions and relapses for several years, but eventually resolves. The differential diagnosis includes several serious conditions such as infection with human immunodeficiency virus or cytomegalovirus, states of vitamin deficiency and inflammatory bowel diseases. Treatment of recurrent aphthous stomatitis is often unsatisfactory, but patients may benefit from the use of antiseptic mouthwashes and scrupulous oral/dental hygiene, tetracycline mouth rinses, topical steroids and topical anesthetics. Systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants are occasionally indicated.

Special considerations

Contamination

When choosing an antibiotic regimen, one must take into account special circumstances regarding the type of contamination involved such as salt water/freshwater, clostridial species, or pet/human bites. Water contamination requires coverage for Vibrio, Aeromonas, Pseudomonas, and other species. Trauma involving salt water should be treated with doxycycline and ceftazidime, or a fluoroquinolone. Freshwater wounds should be managed with ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or a third-generation or fourth-generation cephalosporin. Potential clostridial contamination, such as farm-related injuries, requires high-dose penicillin irrespective of the fracture type.

A full review of the treatment of bite injuries is beyond the scope of this document, but wounds caused by human, cat, and dog bites (the most common bite wounds encountered) are often treated with antibiotics due to the high load of more variable pathogens found in the oral cavity and the wound mechanism, with punctures that make both natural movement of the bacteria and adequate irrigation difficult. A course of 3–5 days of amoxicillin-clavulanate is a suggested regimen, with clindamycin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole two times per day as an alternative for patients with a penicillin allergy. While there is increasing question in the literature about the benefit of treating bite injuries with empiric antibiotics, there seems to be general consensus that injuries in high-risk locations (specifically hands, and over cartilage) and in high-risk patients should be treated. Rabies treatment should also be considered and addressed with any mammalian bite wounds (table 1).

### Antibiotic therapy and prophylaxis for snake-bitten patients [^112KYRtc]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

To improve management, empiric antibiotics should be directed toward patients at particular risk or suspected of snakebite-related infection. Houcke et al. demonstrated that tissue necrosis, rhabdomyolysis, and thrombocytopenia can predict secondary infection after snakebite. Local envenoming signs should not be confused with infectious manifestations. However, snakebite-related infection can be suspected in the case of frank local inflammatory symptoms, and this presentation justifies empiric antibiotic prescription. A definite diagnosis of infection can only be made and targeted treatment provided when the responsible microorganism is isolated.

International consortiums recommend amoxicillin–clavulanate (AMC) to prevent infection after an animal bite. These recommendations are based on studies involving dog, cat, and human bites, but not snakes. Indeed, snake oral microbiota differ from those of other animals, making AMC ineffective against the involved bacteria most of the time. Studies on the oral microbiota of snakesand causal bacteria of snakebite-related infection, including the new report from Bonilla-Aldana et al.show that isolated microorganisms are mostly Enterobacteriaceae, mainly Morganella morganii, nonfermentative bacteria such as Pseudomonas spp. and Aeromonas hydrophila, or Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. These bacteria usually originate from the snakes' mouth, contaminated by the fecal flora of prey, which may defecate while being ingested, or from the environment (e.g. A. hydrophila, especially in wet areas). In most cases, the pathogenic bacteria are naturally resistant to AMC. In addition, in a well-designed study by Sachet et al.in the Amazon region, AMC showed poor efficacy in preventing secondary infection from snakebites. Accordingly, first-line AMC is not an appropriate option to treat snake-bitten patients, except when guided by microbiological results. Unfortunately, prophylactic AMC is still largely prescribed in this context.

### Best evidence topic report. are antibiotics indicated following human bites? [^115uMrnS]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether antibiotics are indicated for human bites. Eighty nine papers were found using the reported search, of which two represent the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results, and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. Prophylactic antibiotics should be given to all patients with human bites to the hands, feet, and skin overlying joints or cartilaginous structures, and to all patients with bites that penetrate deeper than the epidermal layer.

If the epidermis is not intact, general broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Consider tetanus vaccination.
Consider rabies vaccination if travel history or risk area is positive.
Contact the poison control center in case of venomous snakebite and obtain antidote if necessary.
Medical wound check via general practitioner.

If the bite wound is infected:

Early surgical treatment of hand or foot phlegmons.
Thorough surgical debridement.
Second-look surgery for severe findings.
Cast immobilization.
Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics and later adjustment to the resistogram.
Laboratory tests need not be abnormal.
Daily medical check-ups until infection-free, conducted by hospital doctors or general practitioners.
Occupational therapy and physiotherapy for hand phlegmon after the infection has subsided.

What is the appropriate treatment of infections developing in damaged skin (burn wounds, animal and human bites, and pressure ulcers)?

Irrigation of the wound and debridement of necrotic tissue are the most important factors in the prevention of infection and can substantially decrease the incidence of invasive wound infection. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not generally recommended (recommendation 1C).

For patients with systemic signs of infection, compromised immune status, severe comorbidities, associated severe cellulitis, severe and deep wounds, a broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against aerobic, and anaerobic organisms is always required (recommendation 1C).

Infections developing in damaged skin are a heterogeneous group that includes bite wounds (animal and human bites), burn wounds, and pressure ulcers. If managed incorrectly, these infections can develop into more complicated soft-tissue infections.

Soft-tissue infection is the most common complication of animal and human bites. The risk of infection depends on the type of bite, the site of injury, the time elapsed from the bite until presentation, host factors, and the management of the wound. In general, 10–20% of bite wounds become infected, including 30–50% of cat bites, 5–25% of dog bites, and 20–25% of human bites, respectively.

The predominant pathogens in these wounds are part of the normal oral flora of the biting animal, along with human skin organisms and occasional secondary invaders (e.g. S. aureus and GAS). Along with Staphylococcus ssp. (including MRSA) and Streptococcus ssp. (including S. pyogenes), the commonly isolated pathogens include Pasteurella spp. (Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella canis, Pasteurella dagmatis), Capnocytophagia canimorsus, anaerobes (Fusobacterium spp. Prevotella spp. Bacteroides spp. Porphyromonas spp.), and others. Streptococci can be isolated from 50% of human bite wounds, S. aureus from 40%, and Eikenella corrodens (a Gram-negative facultative anaerobic bacillus) from 30%. Human bites can transmit HBV, HCV, and HIV and post-exposure prophylaxis should be considered in every case.

Question 3: Which of the following is true regarding this condition?
A. A combination of 2 antibiotics is the first-line treatment of choice.
B. In patients with advanced HIV infection, treatment can be suspended after 2 months if their CD4 cell count is greater than 100/μL.
C. Transmission can occur through tick or flea bites.
D. Cases have also been reported in solid organ transplant recipients but not in healthy individuals.
E. Both pathogenic species of the causal microorganism have the potential to infect the liver.

Answers:
A. A combination of 2 antibiotics is the first-line treatment of choice – Incorrect. Current clinical practice for the treatment of Bartonella infections relies mostly on personal experience, expert opinion, and microbiological susceptibility data. Erythromycin or oral tetracyclines in monotherapy are considered first-line treatment. A combination of doxycycline and rifampicin can be used in cases of relapse or severe disease.
B. In patients with advanced HIV infection, treatment can be suspended after 2 months if their CD4 cell count is greater than 100/μL – Incorrect. Although there are no available clinical guidelines, most investigators agree that treatment should be maintained for at least 3 months, with a CD4 cell count greater than 200/μL before suspension.
C. Transmission can occur through tick or flea bites – Correct. Bartonella infection is classically associated with exposure to cats, but transmission can also occur through arthropod vectors. Our patient did not present a history of contact with cats; however, he faced overcrowded sleeping conditions that might have increased his exposure to ticks and fleas.
D. Cases have also been reported in solid organ transplant recipients but not in healthy individuals – Incorrect. BA has also been described less frequently in healthy individuals. Most patients present some kind of immunodeficiency, including solid organ transplant recipients and individuals with underlying visceral neoplasms.
E. Both pathogenic species of the causal microorganism of this condition have the potential to infect the liver – Incorrect. Hepatic peliosis has been exclusively documented in cases of Bartonella henselae infection. No cases of liver infection by Bartonella quintana have been reported yet.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for basic wound management in the austere environment: 2014 update [^1117wTGV]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Wilderness wound infection prophylaxis and prevention — whether or not prophylactic antibiotics are given, wounds should be monitored closely because complications can develop rapidly or in an indolent manner. With the exception of certain specific wound categories, there is scant evidence to support the routine use of systemic antibiotics for prophylaxis against wound infection, with a notable exception of an open fracture in which acute antibiotic administration significantly lowers the rate of infection. Virtually all open wounds are colonized with microorganisms, but this is usually without clinical consequences, and the presence of colonizing bacteria does not constitute infection. A systematic review of mammalian bites showed a statistically significant reduction in infection with prophylactic antibiotics after bites by humans but not after bites by cats or dogs, except bites of the hand; there was also a statistically significant reduction in infection after mammalian bites to the hand. Although dated, there is evidence to support the use of topical antibiotics to promote wound healing and decrease infection.

Discussion

The tools from this decision analytical model improve upon an existing national rabies risk assessment toolby adding animal categories, accounting for geographic differences in rabies epidemiology, and providing quantitative estimates of risk with uncertainty. The estimates from our analysis could aid health care practitioners and public health officials in risk communication efforts across the spectrum of potential RABV exposure scenarios. For example, they could bolster the argument for PEP among people with high-risk exposures who are hesitant about treatment due to cost, fear of needlesor vaccines, lack of paid sick time, and so forth. Additionally, the estimates could persuade individuals with very low-risk exposures who insist on PEP that treatment may not be necessary. Approximately one-fourth of the exposures examined in this study overlapped with the estimated risk threshold. PEP should be carefully considered for these situations and may be recommended out of an abundance of caution.

Our modeling framework could be generalized to other countries with robust passive surveillance systems in place. However, the tools should not be used in other countries due to differences in rabies epidemiology. Unlike the US, most rabies deaths globally are caused by domestic dogs. Our tools would not be appropriate for countries with mostly rabid dog cases because the model relies on the animal species involved in exposures.

The most common mammals involved in bite events in the US are dogs, cats, and small rodents. These species, when healthy and provoked into biting, represent some of the lowest risk exposures evaluated in this model (of the scenarios strictly below the risk threshold, more than half were exposures to dogs or cats). PEP is not reportable in all statesand is not considered nationally notifiable to CDC. This means there are no data to understand the distribution of PEP administration by species of biting animal. However, our tools could potentially be used to assess more than 300 000 emergency department bite events each year, leading to better informed decisions on the need to initiate the vaccination series.

Additionally, PEP recommendations could be improved if clinicians used health department rabies consultation services more frequently. In 2020, Steinberg et alfound patients in Cook County, Illinois who received PEP were 87% less likely to have received inappropriate treatment if their health care practitioner consulted a health department (adjusted odds ratio, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.08–0.22). They also found differences in inappropriate PEP administration by animal species, which could be due to Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices guidelines being more complicated for domestic vs wild animals.

Infections developing in damaged skin

Infections developing in damaged skin are a heterogeneous group including bite wounds (animal and human bites), pressure ulcers and burn wounds.

Bite wounds (animal and human bites)

Human bite microbiology generally includes Streptococcus spp, S. aureus, Peptostreptococcus spp, Fusobacterium spp and Eikinella spp.

Dog bite microbiology generally includes Pasteurella canis, Pasteurella multocida, Bacteroides spp, Fusobacterium spp, Capnocytophaga canimorsus and S. aureus.

Cat bite microbiology generally includes Pasteurella spp, Capnocytophaga spp, Bartonella henselae (Cat-scratch diseases should be treated with azithromycin 500 mg day 1, 250 mg/day for the next 4 days), S. aureus, Bacteroides spp and Fusobacterium spp.

If managed incorrectly, these infections can develop into more complicated SSTIs.

Treatment
Irrigation of the wound and debridement of necrotic tissue
Antibiotic prophylaxis as principle is not recommended. It is recommended in selected patients.
Antibiotic therapy in selected patients for 5 days. You may extend therapy up to 7–10 days if lack of symptom resolution at 5 days.
Tetanus prophylaxis in bite wounds

Irrigation of the wound and debridement of necrotic tissue are the most important factors in preventing infection and can substantially decrease the incidence of invasive wound infection. Primary wound closure is not recommended for wounds, with the exception of those to the face, which should be managed with copious irrigation, cautious debridement, and pre-emptive antibiotics.

The comprehensive meta-analyses of Medeiros et al. in the Cochrane Database demonstrated no evidential basis for reducing the infection rate by prophylactic antibiotics, except for selected cases. Despite the poor state of the evidence wounds that are moderate to severe, have associated crush injury, have associated edema (either preexisting or subsequent), that are on the hands or in proximity to a bone or a joint, or that are in compromised hosts should receive 3–5 days of antibiotic therapy.

A broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against aerobic and anaerobic organisms is required, if systemic signs of infection or severe cellulitis arise.

Human bites that have broken the skin and drawn blood can theoretically transmit hepatitis B, C, and HIV. A patient who has sustained a bite should always confirm that their tetanus booster is up to date.

### Infection control: avoiding the inevitable [^1178v1SN]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Infection, while a major cause of morbidity, should not be considered an inevitable consequence of injury. Good aseptic technique, compulsive attention to detail, and thorough understanding of the points addressed in the following list of critical points are the best guarantee that infection will not add avoidable morbidity to misfortune. Critical points regarding infectious problems in care of the injured child: 1. Polymicrobial infection is the rule with 50% of isolates being mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. 2. It is a misnomer to consider antibiotic use in a pediatric trauma victim as prophylactic. Antimicrobials used in this setting are best considered adjunctive. 3. The major indication for anti-infective therapy in pediatric trauma is an injury with a high probability of infection. 4. Antibiotics do not sterilize the wound or body cavity; they limit bacterial proliferation, thereby supplementing effective immune control. 5. Available studies suggest that 24 hours is as efficacious as a longer treatment duration in a purely adjunctive mode. 6. In bites inflicted by dogs and cats, Pasturella species are frequent. 7. Human bites may result in infection by Eikenella corrodens. 8. Based on this bacteriology, adjunctive intravenous ampicillin sulbactam or oral amoxicillin clavulanate are recommended for human and animal bites. 9. Tetanus prophylaxis is indicated in all significant soft tissue injuries. 10. Risk of osteomyelitis correlates directly with the extent of the associated soft tissue injury and vascular compromise. 11. The majority of infectious complications in the injured child are not a consequence of the injury itself, but rather in the treatment thereof. 12. In the injured child the most common nosocomial infection is lower respiratory followed by primary blood stream and the urinary tract. 13. The management of nosocomial pneumonia in the injured child is based on the time of diagnoses. Early evidence of pulmonary infection requires treatment with a third generation cephalosporin with or without an antistaphylococcal penicillin. Late pneumonia is treated with an aminoglycoside with or without an antipseudomonal added. 14. Catheter related infection is, in the injured child, overwhelmingly gram positive with coagulase negative staphlococcal species accounting for 30–60% of isolates. Staphlococcus aureus is responsible for an additional 15–20%. 15. The role of antibiotics in the prevention of catheter related meningitis is controversial. Recent adult studies suggest no advantage to their routine use. If utilized, they should only be employed prophylactically and not continued throughout the monitoring period. 16. Lack of response to treatment of sepsis may represent an inappropriate antimicrobial agent, improper dosage, inability to achieve adequate levels at the site of infection. (eg, CSF) fungal pathogen, and/or ongoing contamination or undrained purulent focus.

### ​ primary closure versus delayed or no closure for traumatic wounds due to mammalian bite [^112aCv71]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Mammalian bites are a common presentation in emergency and primary healthcare facilities across the world. The World Health Organization recommends postponing the suturing of a bite wound but this has not been evaluated through a systematic review.

Objectives

To assess the effects of primary closure compared with delayed closure or no closure for mammalian bite wounds.

Search Methods

In July 2019 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials which compared primary closure with delayed or no closure for traumatic wounds due to mammalian bite.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full-text publications, applied the inclusion criteria, and extracted data. We pooled data using a random-effects model, as appropriate. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We found three trials (878 participants) that compared primary closure with no closure for dog bites and one trial (120 participants) that compared primary closure with delayed closure. No other mammalian bite studies were identified. The trials were from the UK (one trial), Greece (one trial) and China (two trials). Overall, participants from both sexes and all age groups were represented. We are uncertain whether primary closure improves the proportion of wounds which are infection-free compared with no closure, as the certainty of evidence for this outcome was judged to be very low (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.05; 2 studies, 782 participants; I² = 0%). We downgraded the evidence by one level for high risk of bias and two levels for imprecision. There is no clinically important difference in cosmesis (acceptable physical/cosmetic appearance) of dog bite wounds when primary closure is compared with no closure (mean difference (MD) -1.31, 95% CI -2.03 to -0.59; 1 study, 182 participants). The certainty of evidence for this outcome was judged to be moderate (we downgraded our assessment by one level for imprecision). We are uncertain whether primary closure improves the proportion of dog bite wounds that are infection-free compared with delayed closure, as the evidence for this outcome was judged to be very low (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.07; 1 study, 120 participants; I² = 0%). We downgraded the evidence by one level for high risk of bias and two levels for imprecision. None of the four trials reported any adverse outcomes such as death or rabies but they were, in any case, unlikely to have been large enough to have satisfactory power to provide precise estimates for these. Important outcomes like time to complete wound healing, proportion of wounds healed, and length of hospital stay were not evaluated.

Authors' Conclusions

All the studies we identified concerned dog bites. There is no high-certainty evidence to support or refute existing recommendations concerning primary closure for dog bites. The potential benefits and harms of primary closure compared with delayed or no closure for mammalian bites remain uncertain and more robust trials are needed.

Animal and human bite wounds — preemptive antimicrobial therapy and rabies prophylaxis: Preemptive early antimicrobial therapy for 3–5 days is recommended for patients who (a) are immunocompromised, (b) are asplenic, (c) have advanced liver disease, (d) have preexisting or resultant edema of the affected area, (e) have moderate to severe injuries, especially to the hand or face, or (f) have injuries that may have penetrated the periosteum or joint capsule (strong, low). Postexposure prophylaxis for rabies may be indicated; consultation with local health officials is recommended to determine if rabies prophylaxis should be initiated (strong, low). Numerous studies have failed to definitively determine who should receive early, preemptive therapy, so the decision to give "prophylactic" antibiotics should be based on wound severity and host immune competence. Prophylactic or early preemptive therapy seems to provide marginal benefit for patients with dog bites who present within 12–24 hours after injury, particularly in low-risk wounds. A meta-analysis of 8 randomized trials of dog bite wounds found a cumulative incidence of infection of 16%, with a relative risk of infection in patients treated with antibiotics compared with controls to be 0.56. Amoxicillin-clavulanate administered in one study to patients with full-thickness animal bites presenting > 9 hours after the bite resulted in a lower infection rate. A Cochrane review supported limiting prophylactic antibiotics in mammalian bites to hand injuries and human bites, but the 8 studies had limitations including small numbers (range, 12–190), failure to perform intention-to-treat analysis (4 of 8 studies), and unspecified method of randomization (4 of 8 studies).

### Prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by Pasteurella dagmatis, Germany [^113hiry2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

We continued to administer antibiogram-appropriate penicillin G therapy for a total of 6 weeks after the initial negative blood culture results. We administered levofloxacin, which we selected over an aminoglycoside antibiotic because of its superior abscess penetration, for the first 20 days as a combined therapy. The patient was discharged from the intensive care unit on the 21st day after surgery, exhibiting full consciousness and only mild focal neurologic deficits (dysphagia). He was discharged from the hospital shortly afterward and began rehabilitation treatment.

The choice of treatment in this case was complicated by the paucity of evidence regarding IE caused by P. dagmatis. Gump and Holden reported IE caused by a new species of Pasteurella bacteria in 1972. In 1994, Sorbello et al. reported another case, complicated by vertebral osteomyelitis. In 2001, Rosenbach et al. reported prosthetic valve IE caused by P. dagmatis. A more recent case was reported in 2012 by Strahm et al. (Appendix Table). Four of the 5 reported cases (including the case we describe) resulted from domestic cat bites, and all definitive therapies included either penicillin G or ceftriaxone. All patients survived infection. Antimicrobial therapy for P. multocida infection is similar to the course we describe, and penicillin has been recommended in all specimens that tested susceptible to it.

Empiric antibiotic therapy for animal wounds varies by severity (ranging from amoxicillin/clavulanate to piperacillin/tazobactam) and also needs to target other potential pathogens. Cat bites can be easily underestimated and justify careful therapy and follow-up. Animal contact could have been missed in this case because the wound had healed fully before the first symptoms of IE. Obtaining the patient's history greatly helped in the diagnosis.

Bite-Associated Infections — Wound infections after cat and dog bites are caused by multiple microorganisms, including S. aureus, α-, β-, and γ-hemolytic streptococci, several genera of gram-negative organisms, and several anaerobes. Pasteurella multocida infection classically occurs after cat bites but can also occur after dog bites, with lesions that develop quickly and are often painful. Patients lacking spleens are at particular risk for severe cellulitis and sepsis due to Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection after dog bites. Management of cat and dog bites includes consideration of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis, as well as tetanus immunization and antibiotic treatment, and avoid primary closure of dog bites to the hand or puncture wounds anywhere on the body. Monkey bite management includes wound care, tetanus immunization, rabies post-exposure prophylaxis, and consideration of antimicrobial prophylaxis; bites and scratches from Old World macaque monkeys have been associated with fatal encephalomyelitis due to B virus infection in humans, and valacyclovir is the recommended post-exposure prophylaxis after high-risk macaque exposure.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for mammalian bites [^1145Cuy8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Bites by mammals are a common problem and they account for up to 1% of all visits to hospital emergency rooms. Dog and cat bites are the most common and people are usually bitten by their own pets or by an animal known to them. School-age children make up almost a half of those bitten. Prevention of tetanus, rabies and wound infection are the priorities for staff in emergency rooms. The use of antibiotics may be useful to reduce the risk of developing a wound infection.

Objectives

To determine if the use of prophylactic antibiotics in mammalian bites is effective in preventing bite wound infection.

Search Strategy

Relevant RCTs were identified by electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register databases in November 2000.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials which studied patients with bites from all mammals. Comparisons were made between antibiotics and placebo or no intervention. The outcome of interest was the number of infections at the site of bite.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers extracted the data independently. All analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat method.

Main Results

Eight studies were included. The use of prophylactic antibiotics was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the rate of infection after bites by humans. Prophylactic antibiotics did not appear to reduce the rate of infection after bites by cats or dogs. Wound type, e.g. laceration or puncture, did not appear to influence the effectiveness of the prophylactic antibiotic. Prophylactic antibiotics were associated with a statistically significant reduction in the rate of infection in hand bites (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.86; NNT = 4, 95% CI 2 to 50).

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is evidence from one trial that prophylactic antibiotics reduces the risk of infection after human bites but confirmatory research is required. There is no evidence that the use of prophylactic antibiotics is effective for cat or dog bites. There is evidence that the use of antibiotic prophylactic after bites of the hand reduces infection but confirmatory research is required.

### The management of bite wounds in children – a retrospective analysis at a level I trauma centre [^112dxrPz]. Injury (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Animal bite wounds are a significant problem, which have caused several preventable child deaths in clinical practice in the past. The majority of bite wounds is caused by dogs and cats, and also humans have to be considered to lead to those extreme complicated diagnosis in the paediatric patient population. Early estimation of infection risk, adequate antibiotic therapy and, if indicated, surgical treatment, are cornerstones of successful cures of bite wounds. However, antibiotic prophylaxis and wound management are discussed controversially in the current literature. In our study, we retrospectively investigated the bite source, infection risk and treatment options of paediatric bite wounds.

Methods

A total of 1592 paediatric trauma patients were analysed over a period of 19 years in this retrospective study at a level I trauma centre, Department of Trauma Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Austria. Data for this study were obtained from our electronic patient records and follow-up visits. In our database, all paediatric patients triaged to our major urban trauma centre have been entered retrospectively.

Results

During the 19-year study period, 1592 paediatric trauma patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 7.7 years (range 0–18.9), 878 (55.2%) were males and 714 (44.8%) were females. In our study population, a total of 698 dog bites (43.8%), 694 human bites (43.6%), 138 other bites (8.7%) and 62 cat bites (3.9%) have been observed. A total of 171 wounds (10.7%) have been infected. Surgical intervention was done in 27 wounds (1.7%).

Conclusion

Gender-related incidence in bite wounds for dog and cat could be detected. Second, our findings for originator of bite wounds reflect the findings in the published literature. Total infection rate reached 10.7%, primary antibiotic therapy was administered in 221 cases (13.9%) and secondary antibiotic therapy in 20 (1.3%) cases. Observed infection rate of punctured wounds and wounds greater than 3 cm was 3 times higher than for all other wounds. Our findings need to be proven in further prospective clinical trials.

Bite-associated infections in travelers — pathogens, risk groups, and management are described as follows: Wound infections after cat and dog bites are caused by a variety of microorganisms. This includes S. aureus, α-, β-, and γ-hemolytic streptococci, several genera of gram-negative organisms, and several anaerobes. Pasteurella multocida infection classically occurs after cat bites but can also occur after dog bites; lesions caused by this organism develop quickly and are often painful. Patients lacking spleens are at particular risk for severe cellulitis and sepsis due to Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection after dog bites. Management of cat and dog bites includes consideration of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis, as well as tetanus immunization and antibiotic treatment. Avoid primary closure of dog bites to the hand or puncture wounds anywhere on the body.

### Surgical management of pediatric dog bites: a systematic review and treatment guideline [^115sd8Wd]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dog bites are a unique and unusual injury in children, associated with atypical bacterial species, high infection rates, and controversial surgical treatment. Expert recommendations currently guide management and no surgical evidence-based guidelines exist. We conducted a systematic review to answer three management questions: (1) What are the best practices for wound management? (2) In what circumstances should prophylactic antibiotics be administered? (3) In what circumstances should rabies prophylaxis be given?

Methods

A structured review was performed using a keyword search querying "pediatric" "dog bite" "management". Results were reported according to the PRISMA methodology. The quality of nonrandomized studies was evaluated according to Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS). Qualitative analysis was performed.

Results

A total of 803 studies were identified and 53 studies were included in the final analysis. Current literature suggests that primary closure of bites which are well irrigated and sharply debrided within 8 h of injury, is not associated with increased infection. While dog bites are associated with an overall high rate of infection (6–25%), routine antibiotic prophylaxis in low-risk wounds does not lower that risk. Postexposure prophylaxis for rabies is indicated for all dog bites where the rabies status of the dog cannot be determined, or the animal cannot be quarantined for 10 days.

Conclusion

High-quality evidence regarding the surgical management of pediatric dog bites is limited. Trial data have demonstrated improved outcomes in wound healing and infection rates with a focus on copious irrigation and diligent wound debridement, although independent validation is needed.

Although catfish are found worldwide and commonly consumed in the southern United States, fatal infections from catfish are rare. Edwardsiella tarda is a bacterium known to cause gastrointestinal distress most commonly, but extraintestinal infections are a rarely considered danger for those acquiring, preparing, and consuming aquatic animals. Susceptible to all gram-negative active antibiotics, it is easily treated except in immunocompromised hosts, such as those with malignancy, diabetes, and hepatic dysfunction.

### Antibiotic therapy and prophylaxis for snake-bitten patients [^115AnqCf]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

Considering the frequently isolated bacteria in snakebite-related infection, piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, or a third-generation cephalosporin are the most appropriate antibiotics for empiric therapy. After identification of the causal bacteria, antibiotics must be changed to narrower spectrum drugs based on the microbiological results. Little information is available to guide the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy or the value of combination drug therapy. Available data report antibiotic use for 7 to 10 days with several proposed therapeutic regimens without documented advantages of one strategy over another.

In conclusion, the study by Bonilla-Aldana et al.accurately shows the prevalence and microbiological patterns of snakebite-related infections. On the basis of the international literature, there is no evidence for the effectiveness of routinely administered prophylactic treatment. Nevertheless, empiric antibiotics can be used in targeted cases with high suspicion of infection, mainly those with necrosis or local signs suggestive of cellulitis. The most appropriate empiric antibiotics are piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, or a third-generation cephalosporin. First-line AMC should no longer be considered because it is ineffective against most bacteria involved in snakebite-related infection. Once the microbiological results are available, deescalation is necessary to provide the narrowest spectrum drug active against the responsible microorganism. Finally, efficiently managing snakebite envenoming requires not only safe and effective antivenom but also appropriate antibiotics, both of which are, unfortunately, often unavailable in poor and disadvantaged regions.

### Managing parrot bite injuries to the hand: not just another animal bite [^115hFpWJ]. Hand (2015). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Bites and scratches are common injuries, frequently sustained from humans, dogs and cats. Exotic pet-related harm however is an important and increasingly emerging class of injury. Whilst the principles of prompt and thorough medical assessment, antibiotics and potential surgical washout and debridement apply, exotic pet wounds require further consideration. Standard antibiotic prophylaxis with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (also known as co-amoxiclav) is not sufficient for the pathogens transmitted by parrot bites. We illustrate the importance of adequate consideration of microbiological pathogens with a case report of an open finger fracture resulting from a parrot bite. We intend this to be a valuable resource for healthcare professionals in their effective management of such injuries.

Lyme disease chemoprophylaxis after a high-risk Ixodes spp. bite — For high-risk Ixodes spp. bites in all age groups, we recommend the administration of a single dose of oral doxycycline within 72 hours of tick removal over observation (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Doxycycline is given as a single oral dose, 200 mg for adults and 4.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 200 mg) for children. Evidence summarized from four placebo-controlled trials in endemic areas found that among 1082 randomized subjects the placebo-group risk was 3.0% and that antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced risk versus placebo (risk ratio [RR]: 0.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] (.10, .75)); absolute risk: 22 fewer per 1000, 95% CI (7 to 27 fewer per 1000). No serious adverse effects were reported, though drug rashes and gastrointestinal side effects occurred. The guideline notes insufficient evidence to recommend topical antibiotics and calls for additional research to evaluate whether brief courses of amoxicillin or other antibiotics are comparable to doxycycline for prophylaxis.

In the United States, nearly 56% of households owned a pet in 2011 according to the 2012 U.S. Pet Ownership &amp; Demographics Sourcebook by the American Veterinary Medical Association. The survey also reports that approximately 70 million dogs and 74 million cats lived in households in the United States during the same year. (1)Human and animal bites are a frequent cause of primary care and emergency department visits for children. It is estimated that 250,000 human bites, 400,000 cat bites, and 4.5 million dog bites occur in the United States each year in both adults and children. (2) In the United States, approximately 10% of all human bites will become infected in a child with a bite wound. The infection rate of dog bites in children is 20%. Cat bite infection rates in children vary but can be up to 50%. Each type of bite wound has a predisposition for sex and/or age. Infected bite wounds manifest with swelling, erythema, and tenderness with or without drainage of the affected site and can lead to serious complications. Most animal bite wounds are polymicrobial in nature. Pasteurella species (spp.) is the most common organism isolated from both cat and dog bites. The microbiology of human bites consists of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Basic medical management of bite wounds includes thorough cleansing and debridement. Irrigation, closure, and need to obtain culture depend on the type of bite wound, the appearance of the wound, the and timing of medical evaluation after the initial injury. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is the antibiotic of choice for prophylaxis and empirical therapy for children who are not allergic to penicillin. With most animal bites being preventable injuries, healthcare providers caring for children have an important role discussing pet safety with the child and the family.

### CAT BITE antibiotic prophylaxis for the hand / forearm (CATBITE… [^113veX8X]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

CAT BITE Antibiotic Prophylaxis for the Hand/Forearm ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Cat bites have been reported as the second most common domestic animal bite in the United States, ranging from 5%-15% of all bites. The hand is the most common site of bite injuries. Cat bites are puncture wounds that have the potential to seed bacteria deep within the joint capsule, periosteum and bone. The average cat bite wound culture yields five types of bacterial isolates. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria are observed in 60% of cases. Pasteurella multocida is the is the most common organism isolated from the mouths of cats that can cause infections after a bite. Pasteurella species are isolated from 75% of cat bite wounds, and the incubation period for Pasteurella infection is one to three days.

Adding a beta-lactamase inhibitor significantly increases the effectiveness of these antibiotics, and amoxicillin-clavulanate is the oral antibiotic of choice for human, dog, and cat bites. Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend antibiotic prophylaxis with amoxicillin-clavulanate 875-125mg twice daily for 3–5 days or ciprofloxacin 500-750mg BID + clindamycin 300-450mg three times daily if a participant has a penicillin allergy. However, only one randomized controlled clinical trial has been performed to date to assess the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotics following cat bites. Adult participants with uninfected full-thickness wounds presenting within 24 hours of injury to the emergency department were considered. Participants were randomly assigned to receive oxacillin 500mg four times daily for five days or identically appearing placebo.

Four of six participants receiving placebo, but none of the five participants receiving oxacillin, developed a wound infection. The investigators' hypothesis is that administration of 5 days of prophylactic antibiotics will not reduce the incidence of infection in participants evaluated and treated within 24 hours of cat bite injury, who do not exhibit signs of an active infection.

### Primary closure and prophylactic antibiotics for treatment of traumatic wounds caused by mammals, a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111LNzNE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic injury caused by mammals is a common and significant public health issue around the world, especially injury caused by stray/domestic dogs and cats account for approximately 95% of this kind of injury. Nearly 100 million people worldwide are bitten by dogs every year. In China, there are 40 million cases of traumatic injury caused by mammals per year, among which more than 10 million cases present to hospitals to receive postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) and treatment. It is estimated that 4.5–4.7 million mammalian bites occur annually in USA, accounting for 2% of all visits to emergency room (ER), furthermore 20% of these cases need PEP and treatment. The standardized PEP and treatment include surgical management of wounds, and prophylaxis method of rabies/tetanus. The surgical management of wounds is a vital part of the whole process of PEP and treatment, which includes wounds irrigation, disinfection, anesthesia (if necessary), debridement, tissue repair (if necessary), wounds closure, drainage and prophylactic use of antibiotics. Most cases of traumatic injury caused by mammals can be treated at outpatient, some severe cases require admission in hospital, such as injury of important tissues (vessels, nerve, bone and tendon, etc.), severe tissue defect or infection. Sometimes wounds may need to be performed plastic surgery to achieve better cosmesis effect.

Abstract

Background

Bite injuries are a common occurrence and may result in significant morbidity. The aim of the study was to investigate bite injuries, their treatment, and consequences in the urban milieu of a European industrialized nation.

Methods

A retrospective, monocentric analysis was conducted on data of bite injuries during the study period from 2010 to 2020. Factors such as age, sex, vaccination status, injury pattern, injury location, the duration of treatment in outpatient, inpatient, or intensive care settings were investigated together with radiological, laboratory, and microbiological parameters, as well as the therapies employed.

Results

The majority of the included 442 patients were between the ages of 20 and 50, with a mean age of 37.2 ± 18.4 years (0.7–91). The female sex was more frequently affected (59%). Most bite injuries were caused by dogs (49.9%), followed by cats (36.1%) and humans (9.8%) and were often caused by domestic animals (78%). The hand was the most common site of bites (n = 251), followed by the forearms (n = 75) and lower legs (n = 43). In children under the age of 10, the head was the most common site of bites. In only 5% of patients, injuries extended to deeper structures. Wound infection was observed in 14.7% of the bite wounds. The mean number of treatment days for patients with infected bite wounds was significantly higher than that for patients with non-infected wounds, regardless of whether they were outpatients, inpatients, or intensive care patients (p = 0.001, p < 0.001, and p = 0.003, respectively).

Conclusions

In accordance with the severity of the injury, a prompt examination, imaging, laboratory diagnostics, and individualized therapy are required. The implementation of an early therapeutic regimen comprising debridement and irrigation, calculated antibiotic therapy, and immobilization can effectively mitigate the risk of developing a fulminant wound infection. Similarly, bite wounds caused by exotic species are to be treated with haste and precision.

Summary

Bite injuries are a prevalent form of injury globally, with the potential to result in a range of complications at the site of the wound. It is therefore essential that they receive time-critical and individualized care. Children are a high-risk demographic, with the head and neck region being particularly susceptible to injury. In addition to the common dog, cat, and human bites, there are regional differences in the species of domestic and wild animals that may inflict bites. Infection rates also exhibit regional variation, which is likely attributable to differences in the rates of presentation or injury severity.

### Flea-borne rickettsioses and rickettsiae [^114qGXjb]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for all rickettsioses. Fever usually abates within 48–72 hours after initiation. A 7-day course is the usual duration of treatment. Chloramphenicol is an alternative drug but is likely less effective. In the United States, the oral formulation of chloramphenicol is not available, and the intravenous formulation is extremely difficult to acquire. Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) are also alternatives, but as the case with chloramphenicol, they are associated with longer times to defervescence than doxycycline when used for murine typhus (4.23 days for ciprofloxacin, 4.00 days for chloramphenicol, 2.89 days for doxycycline).

Regarding medical management for chancroid, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, IUSTI 2017 guidelines recommend to administer any of the following regimens as second-line therapy in patients with confirmed chancroid:

- ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO BID for 3 days

- erythromycin 500 mg PO QID for 7 days.

### Human rabies prevention – United States, 2008: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^115zL35i]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

Cost-effectiveness of rabies postexposure prophylaxis — CDC analyzed eight contact scenarios from a societal perspective, valuing outcomes as net cost per life saved (in 2004 dollars), assuming direct medical costs of 1 dose of HRIG ($326–$1,434), 5 doses of HDCV ($113–$679 each), hospital charges ($289–$624), physician charges ($295–$641), indirect costs ($161– $2,161), and human life valued at $1,109,920; rabies postexposure prophylaxis was assumed essentially 100% effective, it is "always cost saving" when a bite is from a rabid animal that tests positive or from a reservoir/vector species even if not testable, whereas for other situations the average net cost-effectiveness ratio is a net cost per life saved ranging from $2.9 million (untested cat bite) to $4 billion (lick from an untested dog).

### Head lice [^114bLNEQ]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Head lice — treatment principles. Never initiate treatment unless there is a clear diagnosis of active infestation with living lice; the ideal treatment of lice should be safe, free of toxic chemicals, readily available without a prescription, easy to use, effective, and inexpensive. Local patterns of resistance (if known), ease of use, and cost are considerations when choosing a treatment; published reviews of efficacy studies and comparative trials have used different inclusion criteria and reached different conclusions, and a Cochrane review concerning pediculicides has a substantial update under way because previous reviews were conducted before the development of drug resistances.

### Snakebite-associated infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113pcXiu]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The prevalence of snakebite-associated infections is high, primarily due to M. morganii, and should be taken into account when selecting the most adequate empirical therapy. Most patients presenting with snakebite infection require surgical intervention. Rational use of antimicrobials is recommended and should guide initial empirical treatment. In light of the present results, snakebites warrant further microbiological study for the isolation and identification of bacteria in all cases to confirm or rule out an associated infection. Finally, the importance of monitoring infection in snake-bitten patients is of note.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113G6uSZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Tetanus prophylaxis for animal bite wounds — Recommendation 43 — states that "Tetanus toxoid should be administered to patients without toxoid vaccination within 10 years. Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (TdaP) is preferred over Tetanus and diptheria (Td) if the former has not been previously given (strong, low)". The evidence summary emphasizes that "Tetanus is a severe and often fatal disease preventable through routine vaccination (ie, primary series and decennial boosters)".
