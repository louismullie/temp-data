## Question

I have a patient with familial obesity. Lifestyle modifications didn't work. What should be my assessment and plan

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to assess and plan care for a patient with familial obesity who has not responded to lifestyle modifications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and staging obesity-related complications. Then, I should verify the adequacy and fidelity of prior lifestyle interventions. Next, I will evaluate for secondary causes and genetic contributors, followed by a structured comorbidity assessment. After that, I need to consider pharmacotherapy and metabolic/bariatric surgery eligibility using shared decision-making. Finally, I will outline longitudinal monitoring, addressing social determinants, and transition planning, while continuously checking for internalized weight bias and aligning goals with patient values [^f1a4061a] [^e5d83fba].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and stage disease severity beyond BMI, because BMI alone is insufficient for individualized care in adiposity-based chronic disease; I should measure waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio, assess body composition when clinically indicated, and apply a complication-centric staging system to guide intensity of therapy, while also screening for internalized weight bias and psychosocial drivers that affect adherence and outcomes [^f1a4061a] [^e5d83fba] [^8d797078].

> Wait, let me verify the adequacy of prior lifestyle therapy before escalating; I need to check whether the patient received at least 26 hours of structured, multicomponent behavioral treatment over 3–12 months with dietary, physical activity, and behavior change components, and whether family involvement was optimized, because family-centered, intensive programs yield larger and more durable effects than isolated counseling, and underdosing of lifestyle therapy is a common reason for apparent "failure" [^b0e47b01] [^5b46ab36] [^69a0df5d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology; I should review the history and exam for features suggesting monogenic or syndromic obesity, especially early-onset severe obesity with hyperphagia, developmental delay, or a strong multigenerational pattern, and consider targeted genetic testing in those scenarios, recognizing that identifiable genetic variants account for a meaningful minority of severe pediatric obesity and may influence treatment selection and counseling, even though most patients still benefit from comprehensive lifestyle therapy [^13ce5597] [^eec3e561] [^d2361639].

> I need to ensure a thorough comorbidity assessment is completed, including cardiometabolic disease, obstructive sleep apnea, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, osteoarthritis, depression, and reproductive dysfunction, using labs such as fasting glucose or HbA1c, lipid panel, liver enzymes, TSH when indicated, and screening tools for sleep apnea and mood disorders, because complication severity directly informs treatment intensity and urgency [^fb8bc8c3] [^f6ecaa5b].

> Next, I should review social determinants and contextual barriers that could undermine adherence, including food insecurity, housing instability, caregiving demands, transportation, and weight stigma, and integrate trauma-informed, culturally sensitive approaches to build trust and align interventions with the patient's lived reality and readiness to change [^44a19515] [^079fc549].

> Let me consider pharmacotherapy now; for adults with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² with comorbidities, I should discuss anti-obesity medications as adjuncts to lifestyle therapy, using shared decision-making to weigh benefits, risks, and access, and I should plan for long-term therapy given relapse risk upon discontinuation, while also checking for contraindications and drug–drug interactions [^f1a4061a] [^9b341fa5].

> For adolescents, I should confirm that lifestyle therapy has been optimized and then consider pharmacotherapy in those with severe obesity or persistent comorbidities, recognizing that newer agents may be appropriate in selected cases and that treatment should be coordinated by clinicians experienced in pediatric obesity care, with explicit counseling on off-label status and monitoring plans [^e39f36c6] [^bfeabbd1].

> I will now examine surgical candidacy; for adults, referral to bariatric surgery is appropriate with BMI ≥ 40 kg/m² or ≥ 35 kg/m² with obesity-related complications after failure of lifestyle and pharmacotherapy, and for adolescents I should confirm pubertal maturity, severe obesity, and persistent comorbidities, ensure psychological stability and family support, and refer to experienced pediatric bariatric centers with long-term follow-up infrastructure [^f1a4061a] [^b2500a88] [^1e6a875e].

> But wait, what if the patient is not ready for escalation? I should double-check readiness and use motivational interviewing to revisit goals, barriers, and preferences, and if lifestyle therapy was underdosed, I should first intensify to a higher-intensity program or multidisciplinary care before adding medications, because stepping up intensity can salvage apparent nonresponse and improve outcomes [^a5f9775d] [^b0e47b01].

> Next, I should review longitudinal monitoring and follow-up; I need to ensure visits every 1–3 months initially to track weight, waist, blood pressure, labs reflecting comorbidity control, adherence, and psychosocial functioning, and then transition to quarterly or semiannual visits once stable, with annual reassessment of complications and continuous screening for weight stigma and mental health needs [^f1a4061a] [^e5d83fba].

> I should confirm that care is coordinated and team-based, integrating primary care, dietitians, behavioral health, physical therapy, and specialty services as indicated, and leveraging community resources and, when available, comprehensive obesity treatment programs to sustain engagement and outcomes over time [^a2b3b050] [^8d1b1ffb].

> Hold on, I should verify transition planning for adolescents and young adults, ensuring continuity of care, transfer of records, and linkage to adult providers who can continue evidence-based obesity management, including pharmacotherapy and longitudinal monitoring of complications and weight trajectory [^a2b3b050] [^33da47e8].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan remains dynamic; I should reassess every 3–6 months for treatment response, adherence, and evolving comorbidities, and be prepared to escalate intensity, switch modalities, or address new barriers promptly, because obesity is a chronic, relapsing condition that requires iterative, patient-centered adjustments to maintain health gains [^f1a4061a] [^e5d83fba].

---

For a patient with familial obesity who has failed lifestyle therapy, the next step is to **escalate to pharmacotherapy** (e.g. semaglutide or tirzepatide) if BMI is ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² with comorbidities, and to **refer for bariatric surgery** if BMI is ≥ 40 kg/m² or ≥ 35 kg/m² with comorbidities. Before escalation, confirm the diagnosis and reassess adherence, screen for secondary causes, and evaluate comorbidities. Use shared decision-making to align treatment with patient goals, and ensure close follow-up to monitor efficacy and safety [^f1a4061a] [^9b341fa5].

---

## Confirm diagnosis and reassess prior lifestyle interventions

- **Confirm diagnosis**: Ensure BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² (or ≥ 27 kg/m² with comorbidities) and that prior lifestyle therapy was comprehensive and sustained [^f1a4061a].

- **Reassess adherence**: Review dietary records, physical activity logs, and behavioral therapy participation to identify adherence barriers [^9af633d8].

- **Screen for secondary causes**: Evaluate for hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome, and medication-induced weight gain (e.g. antipsychotics, antidepressants) [^fb8bc8c3].

---

## Evaluate obesity-related comorbidities

Perform a **comprehensive assessment** of obesity-related complications, including:

| **Comorbidity** | **Screening tools** |
|-|-|
| Type 2 diabetes | Fasting glucose, HbA1c |
| Hypertension | Blood pressure measurement |
| Dyslipidemia | Lipid panel |
| Obstructive sleep apnea | STOP-BANG questionnaire, polysomnography if indicated |
| Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease | Liver enzymes, ultrasound if indicated |
| Depression/anxiety | PHQ-9, GAD-7 |
| Osteoarthritis | Clinical assessment |

---

## Pharmacotherapy

Pharmacotherapy is indicated for patients with **BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² with comorbidities** who have failed lifestyle therapy. Options include:

- **GLP-1 receptor agonists**: Semaglutide (weekly) or liraglutide (daily) are first-line due to significant weight loss and cardiometabolic benefits [^notfound].

- **Combination therapies**: Phentermine/topiramate or naltrexone/bupropion are alternatives if GLP-1 agents are contraindicated or not tolerated [^d65c2194].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and adverse effects (e.g. gastrointestinal symptoms, mood changes) [^notfound].

---

## Bariatric surgery

Bariatric surgery should be considered for patients with **BMI ≥ 40 kg/m² or ≥ 35 kg/m² with comorbidities** who have failed lifestyle and pharmacotherapy. Options include sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and adjustable gastric banding. Candidates should undergo psychological evaluation, nutritional counseling, and assessment of surgical risk. Expected outcomes include 20–35% excess weight loss and significant improvement or resolution of comorbidities, though lifelong nutritional supplementation and monitoring are required [^b2500a88].

---

## Shared decision-making and patient-centered care

Use **shared decision-making** to discuss risks, benefits, and patient preferences for pharmacotherapy versus surgery. Set realistic, individualized goals focused on improving health outcomes and quality of life rather than weight alone [^f1a4061a]. Address weight stigma, mental health, and social determinants of health to enhance adherence and outcomes [^079fc549].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Schedule **regular follow-up** (every 3–6 months) to monitor weight, comorbidities, adherence, and adverse effects. Adjust treatment as needed based on response and patient preferences. Provide ongoing behavioral support and connect patients with resources (e.g. dietitians, support groups) to sustain long-term weight management [^9af633d8].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Next steps** |
|-|-|-|
| Pharmacotherapy | BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² with comorbidities | - GLP-1 agonists (semaglutide, liraglutide) <br/> - Or combination therapies (phentermine/topiramate, naltrexone/bupropion) |
| Bariatric surgery | BMI ≥ 40 kg/m² or ≥ 35 kg/m² with comorbidities | - Refer to bariatric surgery center <br/> - Psychological evaluation <br/> - Nutritional counseling |
| Shared decision-making | All patients | - Discuss options <br/> - Set individualized goals <br/> - Address stigma and mental health |
| Follow-up | All patients | - Regular monitoring <br/> - Adjust treatment <br/> - Provide ongoing support |

---

For a patient with familial obesity who has failed lifestyle therapy, escalate to **pharmacotherapy** or **bariatric surgery** based on BMI and comorbidities, ensure thorough evaluation and shared decision-making, and maintain close follow-up to optimize outcomes.

### Assessment and lifestyle management of patients with obesity: clinical recommendations from systematic reviews [^f17473d6]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Even though one-third of US adults are obese, identification and treatment rates for obesity remain low. Clinician engagement is vital to provide guidance and assistance to patients who are overweight or obese to address the underlying cause of many chronic diseases.

Objectives

To describe current best practices for assessment and lifestyle management of obesity and to demonstrate how the updated Guidelines (2013) for Managing Overweight and Obesity in Adults based on a systematic evidence review sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) can be applied to an individual patient.

Evidence Review

Systematic evidence review conducted for the Guidelines (2013) for Managing Overweight and Obesity in Adults supports treatment recommendations in 5 areas (risk assessment, weight loss benefits, diets for weight loss, comprehensive lifestyle intervention approaches, and bariatric surgery); for areas outside this scope, recommendations are supported by other guidelines (for obesity, 1998 NHLBI-sponsored obesity guidelines and those from the National Center for Health and Clinical Excellence and Canadian and US professional societies such as the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American Society of Bariatric Physicians; for physical activity recommendations, the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans); a PubMed search identified recent systematic reviews covering depression and obesity, motivational interviewing for weight management, metabolic adaptation to weight loss, and obesity pharmacotherapy.

Findings

The first step in obesity management is to screen all adults for overweight and obesity. A medical history should be obtained assessing for the multiple determinants of obesity, including dietary and physical activity patterns, psychosocial factors, weight-gaining medications, and familial traits. Emphasis on the complications of obesity to identify patients who will benefit the most from treatment is more useful than using body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) alone for treatment decisions. The Guidelines (2013) recommend that clinicians offer patients who would benefit from weight loss (either BMI of ≥ 30 with or without comorbidities or ≥ 25 along with 1 comorbidity or risk factor) intensive, multicomponent behavioral intervention. Some clinicians do this within their primary care practices; others refer patients for these services. Weight loss is achieved by creating a negative energy balance through modification of food and physical activity behaviors. The Guidelines (2013) endorse comprehensive lifestyle treatment by intensive intervention. Treatment can be implemented either in a clinician's office or by referral to a registered dietitian or commercial weight loss program. Weight loss of 5% to 10% is the usual goal. It is not necessary for patients to attain a BMI of less than 25 to achieve a health benefit.

Conclusions and Relevance

Screening and assessment of patients for obesity followed by initiation or referral of treatment should be incorporated into primary care practice settings. If clinicians can identify appropriate patients for weight loss efforts and provide informed advice and assistance on how to achieve and sustain modest weight loss, they will be addressing the underlying driver of many comorbidities and can have a major influence on patients' health status.

### Prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline based on expert opinion [^d41e2770]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society pediatric obesity guideline — definitions and initial evaluation recommend defining overweight as body mass index (BMI) in at least the 85th percentile but < the 95th percentile and obesity as BMI in at least the 95th percentile, and against routine endocrine studies unless the height velocity is attenuated or inappropriate for the family background or stage of puberty. Additional steps include referring patients to a geneticist if there is evidence of a genetic syndrome, evaluating for obesity-associated comorbidities in children with BMI in at least the 85th percentile, and prescribing and supporting intensive lifestyle (dietary, physical activity, and behavioral) modification as the prerequisite for any treatment.

### Assessment and management of obesity in childhood and adolescence [^6af15682]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

The increased prevalence of obesity in childhood and adolescence highlights the need for effective treatment approaches. Initial assessments of these patients should include taking a careful history (investigating comorbidities, family history and potentially modifiable behaviors) and physical examination with BMI plotted on a BMI-for-age chart. The degree of investigation is dependent on the patient's age and severity of obesity, the findings on history and physical examination, and associated familial risk factors. There are several broad principles of conventional management: management of comorbidities; family involvement; taking a developmentally appropriate approach; the use of a range of behavior change techniques; long-term dietary change; increased physical activity; and decreased sedentary behaviors. Orlistat can be useful as an adjunct to lifestyle changes in severely obese adolescents and metformin can be used in older children and adolescents with clinical insulin resistance. Bariatric surgery should be considered in those who are severely obese, with recognition of the need for management in centers with multidisciplinary weight management teams and for surgery to be performed in tertiary institutions experienced in bariatric surgery. Finally, given the high prevalence and chronic nature of obesity, coordinated models of care for health-service delivery for the management of pediatric obesity are needed.

### Obesity: assessment and management in primary care… [^09780c5a]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Lifestyle patterns are influenced by an overabundance of energy-dense food choices and decreased opportunities and motivation for physical activity. Physicians need to emphasize the important influence of the patient's family in any treatment program. 2, 3 Families of at-risk children must be educated about the medical complications and long-term risks of obesity and must actively participate in the treatment program. Consideration must be given to the patient's and family's readiness to participate in a weight management program and their combined motivation to adopt permanent lifestyle changes. As a primary goal, interventions should focus on achieving healthy eating and physical activity habits rather than attainment of an ideal body weight. 2 After completing an initial weight management program, the child and family must continue to work to maintain a desired weight as the child develops.

Successful treatment requires long-term follow-up, with frequent physician visits, continual monitoring and reinforcement. Throughout these encounters, physicians must remain sensitive, compassionate and supportive of the patient and family to foster necessary improvements and lifestyle changes. Some physicians may be reluctant to become more actively involved in the evaluation and treatment of obese patients because of the barriers indicated in Table 7. 4, 22,
23. 1–4, 7–9 If treatment is indicated, physicians can help patients develop weight loss or management plans tailored to individual needs; this includes setting reasonable weight loss goals; selecting appropriate weight loss programs; referring patients to ancillary personnel when appropriate; and providing monitoring, support and encouragement.

1–4, 7, 24 In determining the appropriateness of any weight loss program, it is essential for physicians and patients to realize that the goal of treatment is not necessarily weight loss alone, but weight management to achieve the best possible weight for improved health. 4 Physicians engaging in weight loss counseling also should consider their own weight and set an example for their patients by demonstrating healthy weight management. 25 The American Medical Association recommends that any person considering a weight loss program first consult a physician for a physical examination and an objective evaluation of the proposed weight loss program as it relates to the individual's physical condition. In children and adolescents, tailored messages should emphasize the importance of regular physical activity accompanied by a properly balanced diet so that growth is not impaired.

In adults, effective measures for achieving a desired weight include promoting healthy diets of lower energy density, regular physical activity and behavioral change, with emphasis on long-term weight management rather than short-term, extreme weight reduction. To maintain a healthy weight, good dietary habits must be coupled with increasing physical activity, and these must become permanent lifestyle changes.

### Expert committee recommendations regarding the prevention, assessment, and treatment of child and adolescent overweight and obesity: summary report [^274cc799]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

To revise 1998 recommendations on childhood obesity, an Expert Committee, comprised of representatives from 15 professional organizations, appointed experienced scientists and clinicians to 3 writing groups to review the literature and recommend approaches to prevention, assessment, and treatment. Because effective strategies remain poorly defined, the writing groups used both available evidence and expert opinion to develop the recommendations. Primary care providers should universally assess children for obesity risk to improve early identification of elevated BMI, medical risks, and unhealthy eating and physical activity habits. Providers can provide obesity prevention messages for most children and suggest weight control interventions for those with excess weight. The writing groups also recommend changing office systems so that they support efforts to address the problem. BMI should be calculated and plotted at least annually, and the classification should be integrated with other information such as growth pattern, familial obesity, and medical risks to assess the child's obesity risk. For prevention, the recommendations include both specific eating and physical activity behaviors, which are likely to promote maintenance of healthy weight, but also the use of patient-centered counseling techniques such as motivational interviewing, which helps families identify their own motivation for making change. For assessment, the recommendations include methods to screen for current medical conditions and for future risks, and methods to assess diet and physical activity behaviors. For treatment, the recommendations propose 4 stages of obesity care; the first is brief counseling that can be delivered in a health care office, and subsequent stages require more time and resources. The appropriateness of higher stages is influenced by a patient's age and degree of excess weight. These recommendations recognize the importance of social and environmental change to reduce the obesity epidemic but also identify ways healthcare providers and health care systems can be part of broader efforts.

G. Self-management — chronic disease context and individualized challenges: Obesity is a complex chronic disease with biologic, environmental, and other causative factors that are systemic and operate at the local, regional, and global level, and as with all chronic disease, the patient and family have to manage the demands of the disease and evidence-based treatment in the context of these factors, meaning that individual patients and their families will have unique challenges to overcome based on the severity of their disease and the adversity of their environments.

### Obesity: assessment and management in primary care [^6361fbfe]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Obesity is a complex, multifactorial condition in which excess body fat may put a person at health risk. National data indicate that the prevalence of obesity in the United States is increasing in children and adults. Reversing these trends requires changes in individual behavior and the elimination of societal barriers to healthy lifestyle choices. Basic treatment of overweight and obese patients requires a comprehensive approach involving diet and nutrition, regular physical activity, and behavioral change, with an emphasis on long-term weight management rather than short-term extreme weight reduction. Physicians and other health professionals have an important role in promoting preventive measures and encouraging positive lifestyle behaviors, as well as identifying and treating obesity-related comorbidities. Health professionals also have a role in counseling patients about safe and effective weight loss and weight maintenance programs. Recent evidence-based guidelines from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, as well as recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology, American Obesity Association, U.S. Clinical Preventive Services Task Force, Institute of Medicine, and World Health Organization can be consulted for information and guidance on the identification and management of overweight and obese patients.

Management of Childhood Obesity

Clinical Management

In terms of clinical practice, a child with obesity seeks a physician's help to answer multiple questions (Fig. 2). Often, such children want to know why they have gained so much weight despite seeing so many other children eat large quantities of food and still not putting on weight. They often ask the treating doctor to provide medications for obesity as they would have already tried lifestyle modifications on several occasions. Sometimes, the aim of these children is to achieve significant weight loss before a landmark celebration, festival or family event. The treating physician often needs to explain to the child and their parents that there is a need to manage obesity as a chronic disease that requires a structured approach with long-term follow-up (Fig. 3). It is important that the physician emphasise that short-stop solutions only work in the short term. Elements of a structured approach to managing obesity include formal dietary advice, physical activity recommendations, reduction in screen time, cognitive behavioural therapy, management of co-existing comorbidities, health habit monitoring, pharmacotherapy, bariatric surgery and genetic testing and gene-targeted therapy (see following sections for a detailed description).

Formal Dietary Advice

Formal dietary advice can be easily implemented as a three-step approach. In the first step, the nutritionist should inquire about the family's ongoing eating practices based on the culture of the family member, as well as their beliefs and work patterns. Based on this information, in the second step, changes in the diet, starting with just a change in proportions, should be encouraged, with the suggestion to gradually introduce more significant changes. It is essential to maintain a long-term follow-up with these patients to help with any roadblocks. Step 3 involves a long-term follow-up, which is often required for the person to lose weight and maintain weight loss. This step also requires striking a delicate balance between optimising growth without compromising essential nutrients and simultaneously avoiding any excess food consumption that may contribute to further weight gain. Micronutrients should also be optimised in addition to macronutrient balance.

### Pediatric obesity-assessment, treatment, and prevention: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^33da47e8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Cosponsoring Associations

The European Society of Endocrinology and the Pediatric Endocrine Society. This guideline was funded by the Endocrine Society.

Objective

To formulate clinical practice guidelines for the assessment, treatment, and prevention of pediatric obesity.

Participants

The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed Task Force of 6 experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The Task Force commissioned 2 systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Endocrine Society committees and members and co-sponsoring organizations reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of this guideline.

Conclusion

Pediatric obesity remains an ongoing serious international health concern affecting ∼17% of US children and adolescents, threatening their adult health and longevity. Pediatric obesity has its basis in genetic susceptibilities influenced by a permissive environment starting in utero and extending through childhood and adolescence. Endocrine etiologies for obesity are rare and usually are accompanied by attenuated growth patterns. Pediatric comorbidities are common and long-term health complications often result; screening for comorbidities of obesity should be applied in a hierarchal, logical manner for early identification before more serious complications result. Genetic screening for rare syndromes is indicated only in the presence of specific historical or physical features. The psychological toll of pediatric obesity on the individual and family necessitates screening for mental health issues and counseling as indicated. The prevention of pediatric obesity by promoting healthful diet, activity, and environment should be a primary goal, as achieving effective, long-lasting results with lifestyle modification once obesity occurs is difficult. Although some behavioral and pharmacotherapy studies report modest success, additional research into accessible and effective methods for preventing and treating pediatric obesity is needed. The use of weight loss medications during childhood and adolescence should be restricted to clinical trials. Increasing evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in the most seriously affected mature teenagers who have failed lifestyle modification, but the use of surgery requires experienced teams with resources for long-term follow-up. Adolescents undergoing lifestyle therapy, medication regimens, or bariatric surgery for obesity will need cohesive planning to help them effectively transition to adult care, with continued necessary monitoring, support, and intervention. Transition programs for obesity are an uncharted area requiring further research for efficacy. Despite a significant increase in research on pediatric obesity since the initial publication of these guidelines 8 years ago, further study is needed of the genetic and biological factors that increase the risk of weight gain and influence the response to therapeutic interventions. Also needed are more studies to better understand the genetic and biological factors that cause an obese individual to manifest one comorbidity vs another or to be free of comorbidities. Furthermore, continued investigation into the most effective methods of preventing and treating obesity and into methods for changing environmental and economic factors that will lead to worldwide cultural changes in diet and activity should be priorities. Particular attention to determining ways to effect systemic changes in food environments and total daily mobility, as well as methods for sustaining healthy body mass index changes, is of importance.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^e1a98c97]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Communication of body mass index (BMI) and weight status — clinical tool and stigma — emphasizes that despite its limitations, BMI is currently the most appropriate clinical tool to screen for excess adiposity and make the clinical diagnosis of overweight or obesity, and thus, the BMI must be communicated to the patient and family, as it guides next steps for comprehensive evaluation and treatment of obesity and related comorbidities. Weight-related discussions can be uncomfortable for clinicians who want to avoid stigmatizing children because of their shape or size; avoiding this discussion may, however, cause delays or barriers to patients receiving evidence-based care, and obesity stigma can result in patient avoidance of health care and disruption of clinician-patient relationships; there is evidence that having conversations about obesity can facilitate effective treatment.

### Obesity prevention and treatment in primary care [^14f6a003]. Academic Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Despite extensive public health and clinical interventions, obesity rates remain high, and evidence-based preventive strategies are elusive. Many consensus guidelines suggest that providers should screen all children after age 2 years for obesity by measuring height and weight, calculating body mass index (BMI), and sensitively communicating weight status in the context of health to the family at each visit. However, preventive counseling should begin in infancy and focus on healthy feeding, activity, and family lifestyle behaviors. For children with overweight or obesity, the American Academy of Pediatrics outlines 4 stages of treatment: 1) Primary care providers should offer "prevention plus", the use of motivational interviewing to achieve healthy lifestyle modifications in family behaviors or environments; 2) children requiring the next level of obesity treatment, structured weight management, need additional support beyond the primary care provider (such as a dietitian, physical therapist, or mental health counselor) and more structured goal setting with the team, including providers adept at weight management counseling; 3) children with severe obesity and motivated families may benefit from referral to a comprehensive multidisciplinary intervention, such as an obesity treatment clinic; and 4) tertiary care interventions are provided in a multidisciplinary pediatric obesity treatment clinic with standard clinical protocols for evaluation of interventions, including medications and surgery. Although it is certainly a challenge for providers to fit in all the desired prevention and treatment counseling during preventive health visits, by beginning to provide anticipatory guidance at birth, providers can respond to parents' questions, add to parents' knowledge base, and partner with parents and children and adolescents to help them grow up healthy. This is especially important in an increasingly toxic food environment with numerous incentives and messages to eat unhealthfully, barriers to appropriate physical activity, and concomitant stigma about obesity. Focusing on key nutrition and physical activity habits and establishing these healthy behaviors at an early age will allow children to develop a healthy growth trajectory. However, much more work is needed to determine the best evidence-based practices for providers to counsel families on improving target behaviors, environmental modifications, and parenting skills and to decrease abundant disparities in obesity prevalence and treatment.

### A review of the prevention and medical management of childhood obesity [^567b7d33]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Prevention and management of childhood obesity remains a public health priority and necessitates an integrated chronic care approach. Obesity prevention efforts should focus on healthy family-based lifestyle modifications. The United States Prevention Services Task Force recommends children older than age 6 of years be screened for obesity and, if clinically indicated, be referred for moderate to high intensity comprehensive behavioral interventions. Childhood obesity and its comorbidities affect most medical specialties. A shared understanding of prevention strategies, lifestyle recommendations, screening guidelines for comorbidities, and stages of treatment will allow for more integrated and collaborative care.

### How to provide a structured clinical assessment of a patient with overweight or obesity [^28f8b1b2]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

With the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity worldwide, there is a reciprocal increase in the global economic burden and ill-health from obesity-related chronic diseases. Primary healthcare services have a role to play in ensuring early detection of weight issues and in directing patients towards evidence-based care to slow this progression. Research shows that many people with obesity are motivated to lose weight and want their clinician to initiate a conversation about weight management and treatment options. However, this conversation rarely occurs and there is a significant delay in treatment, resulting in an increased burden on the individual, healthcare system and society. In this paper, the components and rationale for the clinical assessment of adult patients with overweight or obesity, including anthropometric measurements and pathology tests, are described. Recommendations to ascertain the potential factors influencing the development of obesity in the patient, such as lifestyle factors (diet and physical activity) and mental health, are also provided. The potential sequelae of obesity that may be present and the necessary assessments for diagnosis are also addressed. These assessments are vital to ensure the patient is referred to the appropriate allied health services and/or specialists.

Clinical encounter with the patient who is overweight or obese — there are a number of steps a clinician should take in the clinical encounter, including annual and symptom-based screening for major chronic conditions associated with obesity in all adult patients with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or above, with conditions including T2DM, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, osteoarthritis, and major depression. Additional steps include timely adherence to national cancer screening guidelines, identification of contributing factors, identification of and appropriate screening for secondary causes of obesity that need not be automatically screened for unless the history and/or physical examination suggests the diagnosis or suspicion of the diagnosis, adherence to the AHA/ACC/TOS Guideline for the Management of Overweight and Obesity in Adults which was updated in 2013 and includes recommendations for assessment and treatment with diet and exercise as well as bariatric surgery for appropriate candidates, identification of medications that contribute to weight gain with prescribing of drugs that are weight neutral or that promote weight loss when possible, and formulation of a treatment plan based on diet, exercise, and behavior modifications.

### Pediatric obesity-assessment, treatment, and prevention: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^5b46ab36]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Pediatric obesity — family-based lifestyle interventions demonstrate benefit: A Task Force–commissioned meta-analysis of randomized pediatric trials of combined lifestyle interventions showed an effect equivalent to a decrease in BMI of 1.5 kg/m2; P < 0.00001 when interventions targeted family involvement, whereas when parents were not specifically included, the effect on weight loss was not significant. An additional meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of lifestyle interventions (without an analysis of family involvement) found moderate positive effects compared with no treatment or information-only controls, and these effects persisted for an average follow-up period of 15 months. These results suggest involving the family when delivering combined lifestyle interventions, and the Task Force placed a high value on promoting healthy, safe pediatric lifestyle modification that included family involvement, with potential wide-reaching benefits.

Obesity guidelines

Guidelines have been issued for obesity management by several organisations. In particular, the 'European practical and patient-centred guidelines for adult obesity management in primary care', the 'Obesity in adults: practical clinical practice guideline' from the Canadian Medical Association and the National Institutes of Health's 'The practical guide identification, evaluation, and treatment of overweight and obesity in adults'. These guidelines suggest simple interventions for physicians to use when assessing and treating overweight and obesity. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association has not released new guidelines since 2013. Current guidelines suggest three steps to implement in the interaction between physicians and patients.

The first step is to recognise the condition. During this step, the physician should ask the patient for permission to discuss their weight. Asking permission shows compassion and empathy and builds patient-provider trust.

Step 2 is the assessment of the patient's medical history. This step helps physicians assess the patient's medical history, lifestyle, behaviours and goals to create an individualised and effective weight loss strategy. The Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EOSS) is a suggested tool to use to assess the patient's risk factors for developing obesity and weight-related comorbidities. The EOSS is comprised five stages, each assessing a patient's medical, mental and functional risk factors for developing weight-related comorbidities, beyond their weight. Stage 0 indicates that the patient demonstrates no clinical risk factors while stage 4 indicates that the patient demonstrates severe clinical risk factors for weight-related problems. While clinical guidelines suggest that BMI is a valuable screening tool for obesity, they also acknowledge its limitations. One limitation of BMI is that it does not take into account body composition.BMI determines weight classification based on a patient's height but does not distinguish between lean body mass (LBM) and adipose tissue. Excess levels of adipose tissue have been associated with detrimental health outcomes whereas LBM, which includes skeletal muscle, may provide some benefits. Therefore, measuring the amount of LBM versus adipose tissue in obese patients could be useful to determine potential health outcomes and treatments. To date, there are limited ways for physicians to quickly determine LBM in large patient populations. BMI and waist circumference remain the best ways to determine obesity despite their limitations.

### Pediatric obesity-assessment, treatment, and prevention: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^83b551c4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society pediatric obesity guideline — objective, participants, and evidence methods are described as follows: Objective is to formulate clinical practice guidelines for the assessment, treatment, and prevention of pediatric obesity, participants include an Endocrine Society–appointed Task Force of 6 experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer, and this evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. The Task Force commissioned 2 systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies. One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Pediatric obesity remains an ongoing serious international health concern affecting ∼17% of US children and adolescents, threatening their adult health and longevity. Endocrine etiologies for obesity are rare and usually are accompanied by attenuated growth patterns. Screening for comorbidities should be applied in a hierarchal, logical manner for early identification before more serious complications result, genetic screening for rare syndromes is indicated only in the presence of specific historical or physical features, and the psychological toll of pediatric obesity on the individual and family necessitates screening for mental health issues and counseling as indicated. The prevention of pediatric obesity by promoting healthful diet, activity, and environment should be a primary goal, as achieving effective, long-lasting results with lifestyle modification once obesity occurs is difficult. The use of weight loss medications during childhood and adolescence should be restricted to clinical trials.

Principles of person-centered and complication-centric management of obesity/adiposity-based chronic disease (ABCD) include the following guiding directives: Emphasize whole-person health and de-emphasize BMI and weight-centric approaches in the treatment of individuals with obesity/ABCD. People with obesity/ABCD should be evaluated by an empathetic trained health care professional to include both the anthropometric and clinical components of the diagnosis and should be followed long-term by a health care professional who will manage weight loss and assure that treatment goals for optimizing health are achieved. For the anthropometric component of the diagnosis, obesity is evaluated using BMI with clinical confirmation of excess adiposity, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, and assessment of body composition when clinically needed. For the clinical component of the diagnosis and disease staging of ABCD, assess the risk, presence, and severity of ORCD. Include internalized weight bias and impact of stigmatization as part of clinical staging. Involve the individual in shared decision-making to determine personalized health goals while targeting sufficient weight loss to achieve clinical treatment goals for health. Develop treatment plans involving lifestyle, pharmacologic, and surgical options using an individualized approach that considers complications and their severity, patient preferences, social determinants of health, psychological disorders, and access to care. The goals of therapy are to improve health and the quality of life by preventing or treating ORCD, not solely defined by the loss of a specific amount of weight. Therapy, beyond behavioral/lifestyle alone, should be considered at all stages of ABCD (stages 1, 2, or 3) when needed to improve the health of patients. Implement a plan for long-term follow-up with each patient to monitor maintenance of healthy goals, clinical outcomes, and treatment modifications as needed. Abbreviations: ABCD, adiposity-based chronic disease; BMI, body mass index; ORCD, obesity-related complications and diseases.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^fceb55b4]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric obesity — history and risk context emphasizes structured history taking to guide evaluation and management. The history of the present illness provides a more comprehensive picture of the trajectory of overweight and obesity, starting with maternal pregnancy factors and then childhood and adolescent factors that predispose to obesity, and information about the onset of excess weight gain and consistency of weight status over time (including a review of the growth curve and previous weight control attempts) can clarify what weight status represents for the patient and offer clues to root causes, necessary diagnostic evaluation, and potential therapeutic targets. The family history focuses on obesity-related comorbidities and potential genetic causes of obesity, which may influence both evaluation and treatment, and can provide a clue to genetic susceptibility to obesity — especially if the family history includes severe obesity resulting in metabolic and bariatric surgery or severe obesity present in multiple family members and generations. The medication history should be complete and should include medications associated with weight gain, such as antipsychotics, especially atypical antipsychotics; antidepressants including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors;

Lifestyle treatment for pediatric obesity — Endocrine Society recommendation 4.1 states: We recommend clinicians prescribe and support intensive, age-appropriate, culturally sensitive, family-centered lifestyle modifications (dietary, physical activity, behavioral) to promote a decrease in BMI. (1|⊕⊕⊕⊖). Supporting evidence notes that change in body mass index (BMI) was associated with improvements in triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, and systolic blood pressure, and other studies also showed associations between weight change and other metabolic outcomes. Additional data show that successful weight management through lifestyle interventions delays the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in adults and improves cardiovascular fitness, and many pediatric programs have found improved body composition and metabolic parameters. For maintenance, the odds for weight regain are twofold greater in those who are sedentary, and in a 10-year study in the National Weight Control Registry, > 87% of participants maintained at least 10% weight loss for 5 to 10 years. There is sufficient evidence that intensive lifestyle modification programs can be effective tools for pediatric weight control in the short term.

Therapeutic approach in pediatric lipid abnormalities — In children and adolescents with lipid abnormalities and obesity, lifestyle-modification therapy should be intensified over and above usual therapy for childhood obesity and should include moderate caloric restriction and sufficient physical activity (e.g., 30–60 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity on most days). Lifestyle-modification interventions in childhood and adolescence show short- and long-term benefits to lipid levels and subclinical atherosclerosis measures in RCTs, and no adverse effects on growth or maturation have been demonstrated. Statins and nonstatins lower TC and LDL-C in children and adolescents with FH, evidence demonstrates low short- and medium-term adverse event rates with statin use, and these data support the use of statins in children and adolescents at ages ≥ 10 years who have FH and have not responded to 3 to 6 months of lifestyle therapy; statins may be considered at age 8 years in the presence of concerning family history, extremely elevated LDL-C level, or elevated Lp(a), in the context of informed shared decision-making and counseling with the patient and family.

SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS

1.0 The problem with obesity

The objective of interventions in overweight and obese children and adolescents is the prevention or amelioration of obesity-related comorbidities, e.g. glucose intolerance and T2DM, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.

2.0 Diagnosis of overweight and obesity

2.1 We recommend the use of the BMI (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), with CDC-derived normative percentiles, as the preferred method for the diagnosis of the overweight or obese child (1 ⊕⊕○○).

2.2 We recommend that a child be diagnosed as overweight if the BMI is in at least the 85th percentile but < the 95th percentile for age and sex, and as obese if the BMI is in at least the 95th percentile for age and sex (1 ⊕○○○).

2.3 We recommend against a routine laboratory evaluation for endocrine causes of obesity in obese children or early to midpubertal obese adolescents unless the child's height velocity, assessed in relation to stage of puberty and family background, is attenuated (1 ⊕⊕○○).

2.4.a We recommend referral to a geneticist for children whose obesity has a syndromic etiology, especially in the presence of neurodevelopmental abnormalities (1 ⊕○○○).

2.4.b We suggest that parents of children who have inexorably gained weight from early infancy and have risen above the 97th percentile for weight by 3 yr of age be informed of the availability of MC4R genetic testing. However, the test is positive in only 2–4% of such patients who are above the 97th percentile for weight and currently will not alter treatment (2 ⊕○○○).

2.5 We recommend that children with a BMI in at least the 85th percentile be evaluated for associated comorbidities and complications (see Table 1 and Fig. 1) (1 ⊕○○○).

3.0 Treatment of obesity

3.1 Lifestyle recommendations

3.1.0 We recommend that clinicians prescribe and support intensive lifestyle (dietary, physical activity, and behavioral) modification for the entire family and the patient in an age-appropriate manner and as the prerequisite for all overweight and obesity treatments for children and adolescents (1 ⊕○○○).

### NIH working group report-using genomic information to guide weight management: from universal to precision treatment [^38db1c9e]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Two trials in the field of T2D have assessed weight change in response to genetic testing. In the Genetic Counseling and Lifestyle Change for Diabetes Prevention Study, 177 patients with metabolic syndrome were randomized to receive genetic testing for T2D susceptibility based on 36 T2D-associated SNPs plus brief genetic counseling versus no genetic testing. Diabetes risk for genotyped participants was summarized with a risk score categorizing their genetic risk as low, average, or high. All patients were then enrolled in a 12-week lifestyle medication program modeled on the evidence-based DPP. The lifestyle intervention was effective: the group overall lost a mean of 8.5 ± 10.1 pounds, with 31% losing at least 5% of their body weight. Communicating genetic risk did not change this effectiveness, however. The genotyped and control arms did not differ with respect to weight loss, attendance at the 12 DPP sessions, or motivation or confidence to make health behavior changes. In a second randomized trial, 601 patients with obesity or overweight received T2D risk estimates based on family history, BMI, and fasting plasma glucose, followed by either T2D genetic susceptibility results from four T2D-associated SNPs or eye disease counseling as a control. All participants received brief lifestyle counseling but were not otherwise enrolled in a weight loss program. Although the group receiving genetic risk information reported lower calorie and fat intake after 3 months, the two groups did not differ in these behaviors or in physical activity, weight loss, insulin resistance, or perceived risk after 6 months.

Personalizing genetic risk information is only one component of a genotype-informed approach to weight loss. A clear deficit of the trials to date is that the genetic risk information provided to participants was not connected to personalized weight loss strategies but, rather, to uniform interventions, be they simple advice or an intensive 12-week program. To advance the field of precision weight loss, the combination of an individual's genotype, along with the unique underlying pathophysiology it suggests, should be used to develop dietary and physical activity recommendations that target the metabolic derangements specific to each person.

### How to approach endocrine assessment in severe obesity? [^cde22061]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

The increasing numbers of severely obese patients (body mass index BMI > 40 kg/m(2)) represent a significant management challenge. These patients are at risk of obesity-related complications that may be driven by changes in endocrine function. Their care may potentially be complex at times, and therefore, an appropriate assessment strategy will be relevant to timely diagnosis and management. In this article, we discuss an approach to the endocrine assessment of the severely obese patient. We consider the clinical question in three categories that may also represent different complexities in terms of subsequent management: (i) obesity as a consequence of structural lesions at the hypothalamic-pituitary region; (ii) obesity as a consequence of inherited and genetic syndromes; and (iii) functional neuroendocrine hormone abnormalities relating to obesity. The first two categories are associated with hypothalamic dysfunction, of which hypothalamic obesity is a consequence. Additionally, the implications and difficulties associated with imaging severely obese patients are discussed from an endocrinological perspective and we provide practical guidance on which to base practice.

Genetic obesity syndromes — testing and clinical evaluation: We suggest genetic testing in patients with extreme early onset obesity (before 5 years of age) who have clinical features of genetic obesity syndromes and/or a family history of extreme obesity (2|⊕⊕○○). Approximately 7% of patients with extreme pediatric obesity may have rare chromosomal abnormalities and/or highly penetrant genetic mutations that drive their obesity. When assessing children and adolescents with extreme obesity, clinicians should consider potentially treatable causes and genetic conditions, and clinicians should obtain a careful family history to guide the appropriate use of diagnostic tests.

### Management of the pediatric patient with asthma and obesity [^6351a0c1]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Asthma and obesity are 2 of the most significant chronic diseases of childhood. Both are major public health problems that have been increasing in prevalence. Obesity increases the risk of developing asthma in children, and in children with asthma, obesity increases asthma severity and morbidity. The nature of this relationship is complex and not fully understood, but some pediatric patients with "obesity-related asthma" may represent a phenotype that differs from the more classical, atopic pediatric asthma. In this review, we investigate and discuss some of the currently available literature regarding treatment for asthma complicated by obesity in the pediatric population. We cover the importance of healthy lifestyle modifications, management of obesity-related comorbidities, and the potential role of nutritional supplementation or modification. We then review recent literature, mostly in adults, investigating the potential role of obesity or diabetes medications in the management of patients with asthma who have obesity. Finally, we discuss some of the necessary next steps before these potential new treatments can be considered as part of the standard clinical management of asthma.

Affirmed concepts — adiposity-based chronic disease (ABCD) clinical framing emphasizes that obesity is a complex disease with multifaceted pathophysiology associated with interrelated weight bias and stigma, that while obesity is not a lifestyle choice lifestyle modifications are the critical foundations of treating ABCD and its complications requiring alterations in diet and physical activity, education, behavioral therapy, and supportive care, that a BMI-centric diagnosis of obesity is not appropriate on its own for individual patient care and should be considered within a clinical examination plus further diagnostic evaluation for complications as necessary for patient-centered care, and that a complication-centric staging of ABCD can provide personalized interventions that match disease severity and therapy intensity.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity… [^b0e47b01]. publications.aap.org (2023). Medium credibility.

The greater the number of ACEs a child or adolescent experiences, the greater the risk for obesity. 70 The most commonly cited mechanisms linking ACEs to obesity are social disruption, negative health behaviors, and chronic stress response.
71. Understanding the underlying genetic, biological, environmental, and social determinants that pose risk for obesity is the bedrock of all evaluation and intervention. Allowing the family to have a safe space to understand and process the complexity of obesity and its chronicity requires tact, empathy, and humility. Achieving this goal enables the patient and family to gain the knowledge and understanding needed to recognize risk factors in their environment and behaviors, to honor cultural preferences, and to institute changes independently as well as under the guidance of a trusted and well-trained advocate — such as pediatricians and other PHCPs.

Providing intensive, longitudinal treatment in the medical home Evaluating and monitoring child or adolescent for obesity-related medical and psychological comorbidities Identifying and addressing social drivers of health Using nonstigmatizing approaches to clinical treatment that honor unique individual qualities of each child and family Using motivational interviewing that addresses nutrition, physical activity, and health behavior change using evidence-based targets for weight reduction and health promotion. Setting collaborative treatment goals not limited to BMI stabilization or reduction; including goals which reflect improvement or resolution of comorbidities, quality of life, self-image, and other goals related to holistic care Integrating weight management components and strategies across appropriate disciplines, which can include intensive health behavior and lifestyle treatment, with pharmacotherapy and metabolic and bariatric surgery if indicated.

Tailoring treatment to the ongoing and changing needs of the individual child or adolescent, and the family and community context Comprehensive patient history: A comprehensive patient history includes a review of systems; family history; history of present illness; and appropriate nutritional, physical activity, and psychosocial history. Family-based treatment: Family-based treatment centers on the role of family at each stage of child development, includes consideration of the family's critical role in supporting child health, and understands the unique contextual elements that affect the patient and family and influence treatment. Intensive health behavior and lifestyle treatment: IHBLT educates and supports families in nutrition and physical activity changes that improve weight status and comorbidities and promote long-term health.

IHBLT is most often effective when it occurs face-to-face, engages the whole family, and delivers at least 26 hours of nutrition, physical activity, and behavior change lessons over 3 to 12 months.

### Prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline based on expert opinion [^7695d711]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Objective: Our objective was to formulate practice guidelines for the treatment and prevention of pediatric obesity.

Conclusions: We recommend defining overweight as body mass index (BMI) in at least the 85th percentile but < the 95th percentile and obesity as BMI in at least the 95th percentile against routine endocrine studies unless the height velocity is attenuated or inappropriate for the family background or stage of puberty; referring patients to a geneticist if there is evidence of a genetic syndrome; evaluating for obesity-associated comorbidities in children with BMI in at least the 85th percentile; and prescribing and supporting intensive lifestyle (dietary, physical activity, and behavioral) modification as the prerequisite for any treatment. We suggest that pharmacotherapy (in combination with lifestyle modification) be considered in: 1) obese children only after failure of a formal program of intensive lifestyle modification; and 2) overweight children only if severe comorbidities persist despite intensive lifestyle modification, particularly in children with a strong family history of type 2 diabetes or premature cardiovascular disease. Pharmacotherapy should be provided only by clinicians who are experienced in the use of antiobesity agents and aware of the potential for adverse reactions. We suggest bariatric surgery for adolescents with BMI above 50 kg/m 2, or BMI above 40 kg/m 2 with severe comorbidities in whom lifestyle modifications and/or pharmacotherapy have failed. Candidates for surgery and their families must be psychologically stable and capable of adhering to lifestyle modifications. Access to experienced surgeons and sophisticated multidisciplinary teams who assess the benefits and risks of surgery is obligatory. We emphasize the prevention of obesity by recommending breast-feeding of infants for at least 6 months and advocating that schools provide for 60 min of moderate to vigorous daily exercise in all grades. We suggest that clinicians educate children and parents through anticipatory guidance about healthy dietary and activity habits, and we advocate for restricting the availability of unhealthy food choices in schools, policies to ban advertising unhealthy food choices to children, and community redesign to maximize opportunities for safe walking and bike riding to school, athletic activities, and neighborhood shopping.

### Genetic contributors to obesity [^eec3e561]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Genetic forms of obesity contribute to ∼7% of severe obesity in children and adolescents. The exact global prevalence of monogenic and syndromic forms of obesity is not well established, most likely due to missed or delayed diagnosis. The challenge in determining the prevalence can be attributed to the lack of consensus on identifying and evaluating symptoms of genetic defects in a timely manner and hence a vastly undertested patient population. Further large-scale and long-term studies are needed to advance the understanding of this unique phenotype of obesity and effective treatment options".

### Weight history in clinical practice: the state of the science and future directions [^f59aac0a]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Eliciting a weight history can provide clinically important information to aid in treatment decision-making. This view is consistent with the life course perspective of obesity and the aim of patient-centered care, one of six domains of health care quality. However, thus far, the value and practicality of including a weight history in the clinical assessment and treatment of patients with obesity have not been systematically explored. For these reasons, the Clinical Committee of The Obesity Society established a task force to review and assess the available evidence to address five key questions. It is concluded that weight history is an essential component of the medical history for patients presenting with overweight or obesity, and there are strong and emerging data that demonstrate the importance of life stage, duration of exposure to obesity, maximum BMI, and group-based trajectory modeling in predicting risk for increased morbidity and mortality. Consideration of these and other patient-specific factors may improve risk stratification and clinical decision-making for screening, counseling, and management. Recommendations are provided for the key elements that should be included in a weight history, and several needs for future clinical research are outlined.

Childhood obesity — genetic screening, clinical features, and key considerations are outlined as follows: Genetic screening is described as useful and can assess "Up to 79 different mutations", with collection "by buccal swab, blood, or saliva" and availability "free to the patient", plus "two sessions of genetic counseling". Clinical features that may suggest genetic syndromes or variants include "Early onset obesity (< 5 years of age)" along with severe hyperphagia and food preoccupation; importantly, "Patients with genetic syndromes and variants associated with obesity may respond to lifestyle management, and/or anti-obesity medication", and "Clinical improvement… does not rule out a genetic cause". Key takeaways note that "Genetic factors are estimated to account for 40–70% of the obesity predisposition of an individual", and list monogenetic causes including "POMC deficiency, PCSK1 deficiency, MC4R deficiency, leptin receptor deficiency, and leptin deficiency".

### Review on the update in obesity management: epidemiology [^9b341fa5]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Waist circumference is a good representation of the amount of visceral fat in an individual's abdomen. Together, the EOSS, BMI and waist circumference can provide a clear idea of a patient's risk of obesity and weight-related complications.

The final step includes treating the patient's condition. Particularly, physicians should advise the patient on how to manage their weight. Therapies include nutrition therapy such as personalised counselling by a registered dietitian, focusing on healthy food choices and evidence-based nutrition therapy. 30–60 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity on most days is recommended for overweight and obese patients. In addition to nutrition and exercise, step 3 also involves an assessment of psychological counselling, pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery. For psychological interventions, they suggest a cognitive approach to behaviour change, including managing sleep, time and stress, and additional psychotherapy if appropriate. The guidelines suggest that in some situations, antiobesity medications may be useful for weight loss and maintenance of weight loss. Finally, bariatric surgery is an appropriate intervention for severely obese patients and should be discussed between the patient and the bariatric surgeon.

Guidelines suggest that at each annual check-up, a patient's weight, height, waist circumference and BMI be measured. If a patient is overweight, meaning they have a BMI between 25 and 29.9 kg/m², they should be assessed for cardiovascular disease and their weight and BMI should be assessed annually. If the patient is obese, meaning they have a BMI > 30 kg/m², they should be asked about their willingness to lose weight. Intensive lifestyle changes should be suggested if they are willing to lose weight. Pharmacotherapy should be explored as an immediate treatment option if the patient has a BMI of > 30 kg/m² or 27 kg/m² and one weight-related comorbidity. Patients who have a BMI > 40 kg/m² or a BMI of > 35 kg/m² and at least one weight-related comorbidity are eligible for a bariatric surgery consultation. Finally, if the patient is not meeting their weight loss goals after 3 months, intensive behavioural counselling and reevaluation should take place.

3.2 Family‐centered care

Many of the root causes of obesity, such as sociocultural practices and beliefs, are strongly influenced by family and social structure.

Family‐centered care is recognized to be associated with better health outcomes in the pediatric population and there is some evidence that weight optimization interventions can be more effective when couples are engaged in a program together rather than individually. There is currently insufficient evidence to assess family‐centered approaches to perinatal health optimization.

3.3 Healthcare provider education

Many health professionals are poorly prepared to address obesity. There is often little training available in behavior‐changing strategies and little experience available in working with the interprofessional teams involved in dedicated programs for patients with obesity.

Obesity assessment and health optimization strategies should be incorporated into training programs for all health professionals, including obesity awareness and health optimization components.

3.4 Emerging technologies

There is increasing evidence that emerging technologies can be used effectively for health optimization. These include web‐based programs, applications for mobile devices, and wearable tracking devices. Further research on the potential applications of this technology for pregnancy and perinatal health optimization is needed.

3.5 Addressing the root causes of obesity and barriers to treatment

There are barriers to our ability to track and follow up patients with adverse pregnancy outcomes after delivery and to enable them to access health optimization care. Pregnancy offers a window of opportunity for understanding and managing future health risks. Compartmentalization of care and lack of collaboration among healthcare providers are important barriers in women's long‐term health management.

Solutions will need to be culturally and health‐system specific. In high‐income countries obesity is related to lower education and socioeconomic disadvantage. National strategies to address obesity must address social inequity. Public health programs in low‐ and middle‐income countries are often focused on the prevention of undernutrition and face unique challenges in managing obesity and its disease burden. There is a lack of evidence on how to manage obesity in those with stunted growth and malnourishment. Research specifically targeting malnourishment and obesity is needed.

### Weight loss strategies for treatment of obesity [^0b0cdec5]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Obesity is one of the most serious and prevalent non-communicable diseases of the 21st century. It is also a patient-centered condition in which affected individuals seek treatment through a variety of commercial, medical and surgical approaches. Considering obesity as a chronic medical disease state helps to frame the concept of using a three-stepped intensification of care approach to weight management. As a foundation, all patients should be counseled on evidence-based lifestyle approaches that include diet, physical activity and behavior change therapies. At the second tier, two new pharmacological agents, phentermine-topiramate and lorcaserin, were approved in 2012 as adjuncts to lifestyle modification. The third step, bariatric surgery, has been demonstrated to be the most effective and long-term treatment for individuals with severe obesity or moderate obesity complicated by comorbid conditions that is not responsive to non-surgical approaches. By using a medical model, clinicians can provide more proactive and effective treatments in assisting their patients with weight loss.

### A comprehensive multidisciplinary metabolic center to treat patients with obesity in the allegheny health network [^27dea314]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

While chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease are treated with a multidisciplinary approach, obesity treatment remains largely siloed and inefficient. There is an unmet clinical and financial need for comprehensive, multidisciplinary weight management centers to decrease inefficiency in spending and improve health care for patients with obesity. The goals of a specialty metabolic center should include establishing excellence in clinical care, serving as a resource to primary care, conducting research into innovative and efficient treatment, and providing continuing education.

The Allegheny Health Network established a metabolic center and developed an obesity treatment algorithm to address this unmet need. A pilot program was initiated prior to the development of the full metabolic center. A small team of specialists demonstrated proof of concept, and the program demonstrated financial viability. In the pilot, 25% of patients initially opposed to bariatric surgery eventually converted to surgery after other treatment modalities (18% of patients did not respond well to medication), generating enough income from bariatric surgery and other treatments to provide financial stability. Generally, patients who eventually converted to bariatric surgery were older and had a higher body mass index (BMI), suggesting that this population has a particular need to be seen at a specialty metabolic center.

Management of obesity at the Allegheny Health Network metabolic center is focused on the four pillars of obesity treatment: nutrition, physical activity, behavioral modification, and medical management. A team of specialists is established to effectively address this broad range of topics. Within this multidisciplinary team, a "care path" is established and followed using tools built into the medical records software Epic to support patients in reaching their goals (Fig. 1). First, a weight management specialist evaluates the patient, reviewing family history, medications, and lifestyle factors; identifies and assesses the severity of co-occurring conditions; excludes common causes of weight gain (e.g. thyroid dysfunction, diabetes, metabolic syndrome); and discusses all available treatment options (medical and surgical). Patients are then recommended to classes in small groups focused on addressing their specific needs (e.g. nutrition, physical activity, and behavior modification). Throughout the care path, integration of medical records and laboratory results enables efficient coordination of care among the various health care specialists participating in each patient's care.

3.1.0 Values and preferences

In making this recommendation (and other recommendations associated with specific lifestyle choices), the Task Force placed a relatively higher value on promoting lifestyle choices with their potential wide-reaching benefits and safety, and it placed a relatively lower value on avoiding the costs of implementation of lifestyle interventions with their potentially limited impact.

Although physicians generally strive to cure the great majority of their patients and may view a long-term success rate of 25% with despair, we should not retreat into a state of therapeutic nihilism. We are at a stage where we must treat overweight and obese patients, accept that perhaps only 25% may respond, but refine our techniques so that lifestyle modification will be effective in an increasing percentage of patients.

3.1.0 Remarks

Weight loss should be encouraged in patients with severe obesity and significant comorbidities. In this regard, a decrease in BMI of 1.5 kg/m 2, as reported in the meta-analysis commissioned by the Task Force, may seem trivial, but if it is maintained over a longer term, overweight or minimally obese growing children and adolescents without comorbidities may benefit by simply maintaining weight; BMI will decline as linear growth proceeds, and lifestyle modification may reduce fat mass, increase lean body mass, and improve cardiovascular fitness. In the more severely obese or in physically mature patients, moderate weight loss of only 7% was associated with a decrease in the incidence of T2DM. This may be a more realistic goal for the severely obese (see 3.1.0 Evidence). Well-designed, randomized controlled studies of large numbers of patients, employing intensive lifestyle intervention and follow-up maintenance programs, are clearly needed to develop improved techniques. Some of the factors that should be addressed in such studies are described.

Successful lifestyle intervention and preventive measures are labor intensive, and even more so if there is a posttreatment maintenance program. The time spent in delivering intensive lifestyle interventions — direct contact with the patient and family (we cannot overemphasize the importance of family involvement) at least once a month for the first 3 months and comprising dietary and nutritional education, a physical activity prescription, and behavioral therapy — is poorly reimbursed, and thus there may be a disincentive to provide these services (Ref. pp 221–227).

### How to manage weight loss in women with obesity and PCOS seeking fertility? [^4369f801]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

This should be examined in more robust interventional studies especially in women with PCOS rather than obesity only. The discrepancy between improving ovulation and pregnancy or live birth rates is likely due to the need of more than improving ovulation to achieve these outcomes, such as improvements in the quality of the oocytes and implantation and this might require more than modest weight loss.

Several factors need to be considered when assessing the different weight management options in women with PCOS and subfertility. A shared decision‐making process that is supportive to the patient and takes into account that most patients have likely faced obesity stigma in their lives and from within the health care system is essential.

While lifestyle behavioural modifications are generally accepted as first‐line treatment, the time available for the patient to achieve pregnancy or receive assisted conception treatments, the likelihood of success of the treatment option, the baseline BMI, other personal factors such as treatment availability and affordability as well as the amount that the patient needs to lose to pursue IVF should be considered to personalize the treatment plan. The treating clinicians should avoid treatment inertia and escalate the treatment to the next step if the achieved weight loss plateaued at a level below the treatment target. This can be apparent within 3–6 months following starting LBIs. In addition, in patients who already tried LBIs previously and are still above the target weight, it is reasonable to proceed to pharmacotherapy or consideration of surgery as best suits the patient's circumstances and clinical scenario. The time factor is particularly relevant to BMS, as women are advised not to get pregnant for at least 12–18 months postsurgerywith a minimum interval of 12 months due to risk of nutritional deficiencies and rapidity of weight loss with careful consideration of further reduction in this time interval in select cases after assessing potential risks. However, it must be noted that there is uncertainty as to the benefit of this delay between surgery and pregnancy.

In conclusion, weight loss is important in women with obesity, PCOS and subfertility. There is still need for better studies methodologically and RCTs to understand the impact of different treatments modalities on achieving live births and further studies on how to personalize treatment approaches. This will also need to consider the rapidly changing landscape of weight loss pharmacotherapy with more effective treatments underdevelopment.

3.2 Pharmacotherapy recommendations

3.2.a We suggest that pharmacotherapy (in combination with lifestyle modification) be considered if a formal program of intensive lifestyle modification has failed to limit weight gain or to mollify comorbidities in obese children. Overweight children should not be treated with pharmacotherapeutic agents unless significant, severe comorbidities persist despite intensive lifestyle modification. In these children, a strong family history of T2DM or cardiovascular risk factors strengthens the case for pharmacotherapy (2 ⊕○○○).

3.2.b We suggest that pharmacotherapy be offered only by clinicians who are experienced in the use of antiobesity agents and are aware of the potential for adverse reactions (2 ⊕○○○).

3.3 Bariatric surgery recommendations

3.3.a We suggest that bariatric surgery be considered only under the following conditions:

1. The child has attained Tanner 4 or 5 pubertal development and final or near-final adult height.

2. The child has a BMI > 50 kg/m 2 or has BMI above 40 kg/m 2 and significant, severe comorbidities.

3. Severe obesity and comorbidities persist despite a formal program of lifestyle modification, with or without a trial of pharmacotherapy.

4. Psychological evaluation confirms the stability and competence of the family unit.

5. There is access to an experienced surgeon in a medical center employing a team capable of long-term follow-up of the metabolic and psychosocial needs of the patient and family, and the institution is either participating in a study of the outcome of bariatric surgery or sharing data.

6. The patient demonstrates the ability to adhere to the principles of healthy dietary and activity habits (2 ⊕⊕○○).

3.3.b We recommend against bariatric surgery for preadolescent children, for pregnant or breast-feeding adolescents, and for those planning to become pregnant within 2 yr of surgery; for any patient who has not mastered the principles of healthy dietary and activity habits; for any patient with an unresolved eating disorder, untreated psychiatric disorder, or Prader-Willi syndrome (1 ⊕⊕○○).

### Weight-neutral interventions for people with obesity and the perspective of patients, carers and healthcare professionals: a mixed methods review [^68a0f5ca]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Current management options for obesity in adults

The mainstay of medical management of obesity traditionally includes programs related to lifestyle changes aimed at weight loss, which usually involve a combination of modifications in behaviour, diet and physical activity. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of these programs in achieving their goal of long‐term and sustained weight loss has been disappointing. A recent systematic review and meta‐analysis indicated that the mean change in weight at 24 months or more was only −1.8 kg (95% confidence interval (CI) −2.8 to −0.8 kg). Despite their limited effects, recommendations to make lifestyle changes to achieve weight loss are incorporated into several guidelines, such as the one from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK, where programmes are recommended to achieve weight loss of at least 3%, estimating that 30% of participants lose at least 5% of their weight.

Alternative interventions for the weight management of obesity include the use of drugs and bariatric surgery. Newer drugs such as semaglutide show early promising results on hard outcomes such as cardiovascular events in adults; however, issues related to long‐term safety and weight maintenance need to be further clarified. Moreover, the costs, accessibility, and sustainability of these high‐cost treatments likely raise equity issues in low‐resource settings. Furthermore, surgery, while promising, is an irreversible procedure and reserved for a selection of participants with very high weight.

In the last few years, some initiatives have focused on 'staging' and risk stratification for planning the management of obesity, alongside additional measures to reduce weight bias in healthcare. For instance, the Canadian Guidelines on obesity in adults suggest the '5 As' approach to people with high weight: ASK for permission to discuss weight and explore readiness, ASSESS obesity‐related risks and 'root causes' of obesity, ADVISE on health risks and treatment options, AGREE on health outcomes and behavioural goals, ASSIST in accessing appropriate resources and providers. An update on the guidelines for children is planned with the same philosophy. This Framework provides a progressive approach to starting discussions with people with high weight and planning tailored activities focused on patient‐centred outcomes. Mexican, Argentinean and European guidelines have followed a similar approach, but they still mention weight loss as one of the main outcomes of health‐behaviour interventions. Moreover, there is no information on their implementation and a change may require additional (re‐)training of medical professionals.

### Prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline based on expert opinion [^eec41d85]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

2.4 Recommendations

2.4.a We recommend referral to a geneticist for children whose obesity has a syndromic etiology, especially in the presence of neurodevelopmental abnormalities (1 ⊕○○○).

2.4.b We suggest that parents of children who have inexorably gained weight from early infancy and have risen above the 97th percentile for weight by 3 yr of age be informed of the availability of MC4R genetic testing. However, the test is positive in only 2%–4% of such patients who are above the 97th percentile for weight and currently will not alter treatment (2 ⊕○○○).

2.4 Evidence

The more common genetic syndromes associated with obesity are also associated with neurodevelopmental abnormalities (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, available at:). Children with the various forms of Turner syndrome or SHOX deletions, however, are most often developmentally normal and may have few, if any, stigmata. Although it is attractive to postulate that human obesity is attributable to a single mutation or group of mutations in candidate genes with prominent roles in the appetite and fuel metabolic pathways, it is likely that most obesity is caused by the accumulation of polymorphisms in multiple genes with relatively small effects on weight gain or quantitative trait loci. This concept is supported by a genome-wide scan in participants in the Framingham Heart Study demonstrating that a common polymorphism in a cholesterol-regulating gene is associated with obesity.

2.4 Values and preferences

In making the recommendation for referral to a geneticist, the Task Force placed a higher value on the identification of genetic disorders that will provide an explanation of the individual's overweight problem, offer prognostic implications, and spare the family from feelings of guilt that often occur when traditional weight loss interventions are unsuccessful. We also placed a lower value on avoiding the downsides of genetic consultation, namely cost, labeling, and false-positive results of testing, when this referral is carefully limited to individuals with a syndromic etiology of obesity.

2.5 Recommendation

We recommend that children with a BMI in at least the 85th percentile be evaluated for associated comorbidities and complications (Table 1 and Fig. 1) (1 ⊕○○○).

Pediatricians and other PHCPs are advised to provide early anticipatory guidance, close monitoring, and early intervention when weight trajectory increases, and the CPG authors recommend pediatricians and other pediatric health care providers perform initial and longitudinal assessment of individual, structural, and contextual risk factors to tailor treatment for the child or adolescent with overweight or obesity.

### The science of obesity management: an endocrine society scientific statement [^ee65b24d]. Endocrine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

The prevalence of obesity, measured by body mass index, has risen to unacceptable levels in both men and women in the United States and worldwide with resultant hazardous health implications. Genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors influence the development of obesity, and both the general public and health professionals stigmatize those who suffer from the disease. Obesity is associated with and contributes to a shortened life span, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, some cancers, kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea, gout, osteoarthritis, and hepatobiliary disease, among others. Weight loss reduces all of these diseases in a dose-related manner-the more weight lost, the better the outcome. The phenotype of "medically healthy obesity" appears to be a transient state that progresses over time to an unhealthy phenotype, especially in children and adolescents. Weight loss is best achieved by reducing energy intake and increasing energy expenditure. Programs that are effective for weight loss include peer-reviewed and approved lifestyle modification programs, diets, commercial weight-loss programs, exercise programs, medications, and surgery. Over-the-counter herbal preparations that some patients use to treat obesity have limited, if any, data documenting their efficacy or safety, and there are few regulatory requirements. Weight regain is expected in all patients, especially when treatment is discontinued. When making treatment decisions, clinicians should consider body fat distribution and individual health risks in addition to body mass index.

### Office-based strategies for the management of obesity [^d4e00b11]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Roughly two thirds of U.S. adults are overweight or obese. Obesity increases the risk of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, heart disease, pulmonary disease, hepatobiliary disease, cancer, and a number of psychosocial complications. Physicians often feel unprepared to handle this important problem. Practical office-based strategies include: (1) making recommendations for assisted self-management, including guidance on popular diets, (2) advising patients about commercial weight-loss programs, (3) advising patients about and prescribing medications, (4) recommending bariatric surgery, and (5) supplementing these strategies with counseling about lifestyle changes using a systematic approach. Family physicians should provide basic information about the effectiveness and safety of popular diets and commercial weight-loss programs, and refer patients to appropriate information sources. Sibutramine and orlistat, the only medications currently approved for the long-term treatment of obesity, should only be prescribed in combination with lifestyle changes. Bariatric surgery is an option for adults with a body mass index of 40 kg per m2 or higher, or for those with a body mass index of 35 kg per m2 or higher who have obesity-related comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes. The five A's behavioral counseling paradigm (ask, advise, assess, assist, and arrange) can be used as the basis for a systematic, practical approach to the management of obesity that incorporates evidence for managing common obesity-related behaviors.

Child and adolescent obesity — care strategies when IHBLT is not available and physical activity goals: When an IHBLT is not available, pediatricians and other PHCPs can increase the intensity of weight management support through collaboration and by connecting families with community resources; pediatricians and other PHCPs should familiarize themselves with resources and actively collaborate with other specialists and community programs, and pediatricians and other PHCPs should assess the availability and pediatric expertise of local dietitians and offer referrals to patients where possible. Exercise specialists can provide counseling and training to engage children and families in noncompetitive, cooperative, fun, aerobic and nonaerobic activities. Behavior goals related to physical activity include aiming for the physical activity guidelines of 60 minutes perday of moderate to vigorous physical activity and reducing time spent in sedentary behavior, and physical activity limitations should be considered with a stepped care plan for a gradual increase in physical activity. Several successful studies have been conducted in the primary care setting, with less than 5 hours of treatment and using individual visits rather than group visits.

### Review on obesity management: diet, exercise and pharmacotherapy [^d9d0bdc6]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Conclusion

Obesity is a complex, multifactorial and chronic disease. The rise of obesity is in part related to the consumption of agricultural subsidies, the increasing availability of energy-dense foods and the reduction of physical activity. To mitigate the spread of this disease, physicians should assess the presence of overweight and obesity at every patient encounter. Recommendations include using BMI and waist circumference to diagnose overweight and obesity. Healthcare workers should be aware that a BMI > 25 kg/m 2 is associated with an increased risk of comorbidities including diabetes and CVD. In addition, BMI > 30 kg/m 2 is associated with an increase in the rate of weight-related comorbidities, CVD and mortality. Clinical management of overweight and obesity should involve lifestyle intervention for 6 months including referral to a dietitian as well as increased physical activity. Pharmacotherapy should be considered as an adjunct to diet and exercise if the patient has a BMI > 30 kg/m 2 or > 27 kg/m 2 with comorbidities.

### Recommendations for treatment of child and adolescent overweight and obesity [^8e47c74f]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

In this article, we review evidence about the treatment of obesity that may have applications in primary care, community, and tertiary care settings. We examine current information about eating behaviors, physical activity behaviors, and sedentary behaviors that may affect weight in children and adolescents. We also review studies of multidisciplinary behavior-based obesity treatment programs and information about more aggressive forms of treatment. The writing group has drawn from the available evidence to propose a comprehensive 4-step or staged-care approach for weight management that includes the following stages: (1) Prevention Plus; (2) structured weight management; (3) comprehensive multidisciplinary intervention; and (4) tertiary care intervention. We suggest that providers encourage healthy behaviors while using techniques to motivate patients and families, and interventions should be tailored to the individual child and family. Although more intense treatment stages will generally occur outside the typical office setting, offices can implement less intense intervention strategies. We not ony address specific patient behavior goals but also encourage practices to modify office systems to streamline office-based care and to prepare to coordinate with professionals and programs outside the office for more intensive interventions.

### Lifestyle modification for the management of obesity [^e588db8e]. Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Several expert panels have recommended that obese individuals attempt to lose 10% of their initial body weight through a combination of diet, physical activity, and behavior therapy (frequently referred to as lifestyle modification). This article reviews the short-and long-term results of lifestyle modification and methods to improve them. Randomized controlled trials were examined that compared different diet and activity interventions for inducing and maintaining weight loss. Studies that compared different methods of providing lifestyle modification, including on-site vs. Internet-based delivery, also were examined. A comprehensive lifestyle modification program was found to induce a loss of approximately 10% of initial weight in 16 to 26 weeks of group or individual treatment, delivered on-site. Comprehensive Internet-based programs induced a loss of approximately half this size. Patients' consumption of portion-controlled diets, including liquid meal replacements, was associated with significantly greater short-term weight loss than was the consumption of isocaloric diets comprised of conventional foods. Factors associated with long-term weight control included continued patient-practitioner contact (whether on-site or by e-mail), high levels of physical activity, and the long-term use of pharmacotherapy combined with lifestyle modification. In summary, lifestyle modification induces clinically significant weight loss that is associated with the prevention or amelioration of cardiovascular risk factors.

### Update on treatment strategies for obesity [^71473077]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Obesity is a disease that is defined as the accumulation of excessive amounts of body fat and is associated with increased risk of serious illness, disability, and death. In clinical practice, obesity is best assessed by calculating body mass index and measuring waist circumference. Treatment options are determined based on the body mass index, waist circumference, and adverse health consequences the patient is experiencing or is at an increased risk for facing in the future. Today, overweight and obesity impacts the majority of patients we treat in our clinical practices. Although endocrinologists are uniquely positioned to treat one of the major consequences of our current obesity epidemic, type 2 diabetes, we also need to be positioned and prepared to effectively treat one of its major causes-obesity. Type 2 diabetes and obesity are very much intertwined. Treatment of each disease affects the other. For these reasons, endocrinologists need to be experts in the treatment of obesity as well as diabetes. They should keep up with advances in obesity treatment including lifestyle, pharmaceutical, and surgical strategies. These strategies offer opportunities for improving the overall treatment for our obese patients today and will continue to improve and expand over the next decade.

### Lifestyle modification approaches for the treatment of obesity in adults [^9af633d8]. The American Psychologist (2020). Medium credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has recommended that primary care clinicians screen all adults for obesity and provide those affected intensive multicomponent behavioral interventions. Approximately 95 million U.S. adults qualify for such care, also referred to as lifestyle modification. Using the Guidelines (2013) for Managing Overweight and Obesity in Adults (hereafter, Obesity Guidelines) as a framework, this article reviews the principal components of comprehensive lifestyle modification, which include diet, physical activity, and behavior therapy. To lose weight, the Obesity Guidelines recommend participation for 6 months in high-intensity programs that provide 14 or more counseling sessions with a trained interventionist. When provided face-to-face individual or group treatment, participants lose up to 8 kg (8% of weight) in 6 months and experience improvements in cardiovascular disease risk factors and quality of life. To prevent weight regain, the Obesity Guidelines recommend participation for 1 year in weight-loss-maintenance programs that provide at least monthly counseling. High levels of physical activity, frequent monitoring of body weight, and consumption of a reduced-calorie diet are associated with long-term weight loss. Investigators currently are seeking to increase the availability of lifestyle modification by delivering it in community-based programs, as well as on digital platforms (e.g. Internet and Smartphone). Digitally delivered programs lower costs and expand treatment reach; their efficacy is likely to improve further with the addition of new technologies for monitoring food intake, activity, and weight. Ultimately, to improve long-term weight management, individual lifestyle counseling must be joined with collective and institutional efforts to improve the nation's eating and activity environments.

The data suggest that treatment and prevention must be comprehensive and operative over the life cycle. Primordial prevention involves the entire population and is needed because we live in an obesogenic environment. Some individuals will be at increased risk of obesity because of the inheritance of susceptibility genes and interactions involving lifestyle preferences and environmental determinants. These individuals require primary prevention that targets these specific risk factors to prevent the emergence of disease. Many individuals do ultimately develop obesity under the influence of these risk factors. In the absence of complications, clinicians are in a secondary treatment mode, and the goal is to prevent the emergence of complications and further weight gain. Important among these complications is the exacerbation of cardiometabolic disease leading to the end‐stage manifestations of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Once these complications occur, tertiary treatment is required to prevent further disease deterioration and to achieve weight loss, and to identify other therapies sufficient to ameliorate the complications.

Although these centers emphasized mechanistic studies, the data also point to important aspects of prevention and treatment. Understanding whether there is a role for time‐restricted eating and how to incorporate this and other lifestyle modifications into lasting interventions at a population level remains to be seen. The importance of metabolic health in the mother during pregnancy points to the importance of a healthy body before conception to avoid adverse effects on the cardiometabolic health in the offspring extending into adulthood. However, lifestyle changes may not permanently alter the pathophysiological underpinnings of obesity, for example, inflammation, insulin resistance, and abnormal regulation of caloric intake by satiety factors. For this reason, medications that pharmacologically reverse these abnormalities may be needed. Importantly, there is a great need for further research. Because of the complexity and multisystem involvement in obesity and metabolic disease, we are far from being able to identify a rational and broad‐based strategy for disease prevention and management that could involve personalized care.

Through this SFRN on Obesity, innovative and serendipitous collaborations and partnerships were stimulated, and essential bridges linking basic, clinical, and population level research were born and are being cemented. Through the highly successful training program built from this SFRN, both through the fellows directly funded by the SFRN on Obesity and the many other fellows and trainees who were attracted to the programs, the future for obesity research and solutions is highly promising. This team of SFRN researchers looks forward to seeing the many next steps and achievements as they unfold.

Social history and social determinants — A thorough social history is helpful in the evaluation of the child or adolescent with overweight and obesity, including understanding family living arrangements and eating routines/environments as important elements in assessing contributors to and potential treatment targets for excess weight gain; social history can heighten an awareness of, and provide insight into, patients who are most exposed to negative SDoHs, and assessment of SDoHs is important to contextualize the patient's and family's treatment challenges, with standardized primary care tools including the Safe Environment for Every Kid model and the Accountable Health Communities Health-Related Social Needs Screening Tool; being alert to and recognizing SDoHs are the initial steps in trauma-informed care (TIC), and ACEs can have a profound impact on health over a lifetime, including stressors such as harsh parenting, food insecurity, and parental incarceration that can trigger physiologic abnormalities increasing risk for obesity and other diseases, with TIC characterized by screening and recognition of ACEs, responding to them, and working to prevent reexposure to trauma.

2 Anti‐Obesity Medication in the Spectrum of Treatment Options for Children and Adolescents With Syndromic/Monogenic and Common Obesity

Due to the chronic nature of the disease, sustainable, long‐term and patient‐centred care is necessary, irrespective of treatment strategy. In January 2023, the American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP) released its first clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity. The guideline recommends baseline and longitudinal assessment of individual, structural and contextual risk factors to offer individualized and tailored treatment of the child/adolescent with overweight/obesity, with consideration for multiple domains including the child, family, community and society. Further, in line with other earlier recommendations, the importance of initiating treatment immediately after the diagnosis of obesity, and, delivering therapy as intensively as possible is highlighted. Rather than viewing treatment as a stepwise process, the guideline emphasizes utilizing the full spectrum of treatment options as appropriate, including motivational interviewing, psychological support where required, 'health behaviour and lifestyle treatment' (HBLT), pharmacotherapy and metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS). HBLT is recommended as first‐line and basic treatment, showing a good safety profile but limited effects on BMI‐reduction (−1.18 kg/m 2 (95% confidence interval, CI: −1.67 to −0.69], from baseline to longest point of follow‐up) MBS, especially results from non‐randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies, is known to be highly effective regarding BMI(z)‐reduction (e.g. −13.09 kg/m 2 [95% CI: −11.75 to −14.43] for sleeve gastrectomy), while evidence from RCTs is limited. Nevertheless, long‐term safety aspects after MBS need to be carefully considered before admitting adolescents to such interventions in this crucial phase of life. Despite these limitations, the AAP guideline recommends that adolescents aged 13 years or older with severe obesity should be offered referral for MBS. New‐generation AOM, recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) for non‐syndromic and common obesity, might fill this gap between HBLT and MBS.

2 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

2.1 The Duke Children's Healthy Lifestyles program

The Duke Children's Healthy Lifestyles programme (HLP) provides comprehensive clinical care for children and adolescents with overweight and obesity and represents the current standard of clinical care for paediatric obesity treatment. Treatment in the HLP uses motivational interviewing to modify dietary and activity behaviours in order to reduce the severity of overweight or obesity and obesity‐related comorbidities. At the initial visit to the HLP (1 h), the medical provider meets with the family to review a comprehensive lifestyle, birth, medical, family and social history; conduct a physical examination focussed on obesity‐related conditions; and screen for psychological and disordered eating concerns. The provider discusses the meaning of the patient's BMI (weight‐for‐length if the patient is < 2 years old) as a function of age and sex and assesses the patient's risk for disease in the context of the described behaviours, the laboratory studies and the family history. In addition, the medical provider provides medical management of obesity‐associated comorbidities, as necessary. Patients also meet with a registered dietician and paediatric physical therapist to complete a nutrition and fitness assessment, and recommendations are tailored to the individual family needs. Nutritional guidance follows standard recommendations as provided by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Families are encouraged to follow‐up with the Healthy Lifestyles team monthly for 1 year. The medical provider provides ongoing management of obesity‐associated comorbidities and lifestyle modification (30 min), and the patient meets with a registered dietician for medical nutritional therapy (30 min). The focus of these visits is patient‐centred goal setting around evidence‐based lifestyle habits known to influence obesity such as reducing sugar‐sweetened beverages and screen time, and increasing fruit and vegetable consumption and physical activity. Families in Healthy Lifestyles are also invited to activity sessions and cooking classes at a community recreation centre. These sessions are adapted for children with obesity and aim to provide hands‐on experience preparing healthy foods and at least 45 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity. Sessions are offered 6 days per week, and families are encouraged to attend at least 2 sessions per week.

### Review of family-based approaches to improve postoperative outcomes among bariatric surgery patients [^f0bf8851]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Bariatric surgery must be partnered with postoperative lifestyle modifications for enduring weight loss and related health effects to be fully appreciated. Little is known about how these lifestyle modifications may be affected by the involvement of other family members living in the household; therefore, this review describes current family-based approaches to improving postoperative outcomes in bariatric surgery patients and their families.

Methods

A MEDLINE search of publications from 1999 to 2014 was conducted in January 2014. Retrieved titles and abstracts were assessed by 2 authors to determine relevance to the topic surrounding family-based approaches to improve postbariatric surgery outcomes. All study designs except case studies were considered if they included some aspect of family as a predictor in relation to improved health outcomes after surgery.

Results

Initial searches yielded 650 publications (bariatric surgery+family, n = 193; bariatric surgery+child, n = 338; bariatric surgery+spouse, n = 4; bariatric surgery+social support, n = 115). Two studies met criteria for a family-based approach to improving metabolic outcomes in bariatric patients. Seven studies discussed the impact of bariatric surgery on families. All other studies were excluded for not discussing family-based approaches.

Conclusion

Despite limited documentation of family-based approaches on improving health outcomes in patients who underwent bariatric surgery, evidence suggests that such an approach may be advantageous if planned a priori to occur before, during, and after bariatric surgery. Future studies could test the combination of bariatric surgery and a family-based approach for improved metabolic outcomes in both the patient and involved family member(s).

### Approach the patient with obstructive sleep apnea and obesity [^f6ecaa5b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Family History

First-degree relatives of people with OSA are more likely to have OSA independent of age, obesity, and sex. The heritability estimates for the severity of OSA based on AHI is 40%, and for insomnia and EDS are 25% to 45% and 70%, respectively.

Examination and laboratory investigations:

The risk and severity of OSA increases with increasing obesity. BMI does not account for the effects of fat distribution. A waist circumference of greater than 95 cm in females or 100 cm in males or neck circumference exceeding 42 cm in males or 39 cm in females are better associated with risk. Nevertheless, obesity alone, unless very severe, has a low positive predictive value for OSA, and approximately 25% of the adult population with OSA have a normal BMI. Nasal obstruction, tonsillar hypertrophy, and midfacial structural factors such as retrognathia, micrognathia, maxillary hypoplasia, and high arched palate should be looked for. Further examination, tailored by sex and age of the individual, should focus on the OSA-associated comorbidities previously listed.

We advocate an approach to investigation and management of a patient with obesity and OSA that considers the commonly associated comorbidities. Accordingly, we recommend that initial laboratory investigations include a full blood count to access for polycythemia, liver function tests (LFTs) to screen for fatty liver disease, HbA1c to screen for T2D or assess glycemic control in those with comorbid T2D, thyroid function to assess for hypothyroidism, and renal function and fasting urine albumin creatinine ratio in the setting comorbid T2D or hypertension. Other investigations should be dictated by the clinical presentation.

Pediatric obesity care delivery — team-based and medical home: Obesity treatment should be delivered by pediatricians and other PHCPs and their teams in collaboration with (where available) community partners, allied health professionals, pediatric obesity specialists, and metabolic and bariatric surgery teams. The medical home model is the preferred standard of care for children who have chronic conditions; this care coordination should also be accompanied by advocacy for the patient and the family support for the patient's transition to adult care. Families should be active and core partners in decision-making in all levels of care, and parents/caregivers play a crucial role; medium- to high-intensity parental involvement is associated with weight-related measures of treatment effectiveness.

Advisory panels encourage persons with obesity to lose 5% to 10% of body weight, which can be achieved with dietary change, increased physical activity, and behavioral therapy. Patients participate in weekly individual or group treatment sessions delivered in-person or by telephone. Large-scale trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach, with resulting improvement in cardiovascular disease risk factors. Weight regain is common. Several strategies improve weight loss maintenance, including monthly or more frequent follow-up with an interventionist. Digitally-delivered approaches are promising because they have the potential to reach more individuals.
