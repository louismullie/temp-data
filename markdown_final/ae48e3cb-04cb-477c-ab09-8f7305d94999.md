## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about IgG4-related disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease definition and core pathophysiology. Then, I should verify epidemiology and clinical phenotypes. Next, I will examine diagnostic criteria and the role of serum IgG4, including pitfalls and thresholds. After that, I need to review histopathology and biopsy strategy. Then, I will consider ancillary biomarkers and imaging. I should also map the differential diagnosis and red flags. Finally, I will outline treatment principles, monitoring, and special populations, and close with a concise diagnostic algorithm and key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct and pathophysiology. IgG4-related disease is a systemic, immune-mediated fibroinflammatory condition unified by tumefactive lesions, a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate rich in IgG4-positive plasma cells, storiform fibrosis, and obliterative phlebitis, with a Th2-skewed milieu and prominent B-cell/plasmablast activation that explains responsiveness to B-cell depletion and glucocorticoids [^113d1Juy] [^115jupqq] [^114V4Uzx].

> I need to check epidemiology and demographics. The incidence is approximately 0.78–1.39 per 100,000 person-years in the US, with a mean age around 60 years and a male predominance, though organ-specific phenotypes vary by region and ancestry, and Asian cohorts often show higher serum IgG4 levels and different organ distributions than Western cohorts [^113d1Juy] [^115a7cbj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical phenotypes without anchoring to organ systems. The most frequently involved sites include the pancreas (type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis), biliary tree (IgG4-sclerosing cholangitis), salivary/lacrimal glands (Mikulicz disease), retroperitoneum/aorta (retroperitoneal fibrosis, periaortitis), kidneys (tubulointerstitial nephritis), lungs (nodular, ground-glass opacities, bronchiectasis), orbit (pseudotumor), lymph nodes, skin, and, less commonly, CNS and peripheral nerves, with presentations ranging from mass-forming lesions to obstructive jaundice, dry mouth/eyes, and renal failure [^113d1Juy] [^1134eoHr] [^112D5rK7] [^115i2swC] [^114dhVr1].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic framework before discussing serum testing. Diagnosis is integrative: clinical suspicion plus supportive serology, imaging, and, when feasible, histopathology, with the 2019 ACR/EULAR classification providing a weighted, multi-domain score that achieves high specificity and moderate sensitivity, and with the 2012 international consensus emphasizing characteristic histology, elevated serum IgG4, other organ involvement, and steroid responsiveness as complementary pillars [^115tWDEB] [^112cjfJV] [^1134eoHr].

> I should double-check the role and limits of serum IgG4. Sensitivity and specificity vary by cutoff and population. At 1.35 g/L, sensitivity is about 83–97% but specificity only 60–85%, whereas a threshold of 2.8 g/L improves specificity to 96.2% at the cost of sensitivity, and levels > 5× ULN carry a PPV around 75% for IgG4-RD, yet 20–30% of biopsy-proven cases have normal serum IgG4, so a normal value does not exclude disease and marked elevations are not pathognomonic [^115a7cbj] [^113ivodx] [^1159bHRd] [^117DProJ].

> Let me consider analytic pitfalls that could mislead us. Immunonephelometry platforms differ by roughly 50% at the ULN, the hook effect can artifactually lower very high IgG4 readings, and IgG4 can interfere with IgG1/IgG2 measurements. Mass spectrometry circumvents these issues, and method-specific reference intervals must be used to avoid misclassification [^113Z8jee].

> Next, I should review histopathology, the diagnostic cornerstone. The triad includes a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with > 10–50 IgG4+ plasma cells per high-power field depending on the organ, an IgG4/IgG plasma cell ratio > 40%, storiform fibrosis, and obliterative phlebitis. Small biopsies often miss storiform fibrosis or phlebitis, so an elevated IgG4/IgG ratio may be the most sensitive feature in limited samples, and bone marrow or lymph node are suboptimal sites because they may lack the classic triad [^112cjfJV] [^11525B4m] [^114twGKB].

> I will now examine ancillary biomarkers and imaging. Circulating CD19+CD24−CD38hi plasmablasts correlate with disease activity and may aid diagnosis when available, eosinophilia and elevated IgE are common and IgE > 380–480 kU/L supports diagnosis and predicts relapse in some cohorts, and 18F-FDG PET/CT can delineate multi-organ activity when standard imaging is equivocal, though it is not specific and should be interpreted in context [^115a7cbj] [^114qkvjF] [^114kMumz].

> But wait, what if the presentation mimics malignancy or vasculitis. The differential is broad and includes lymphoma, multicentric Castleman disease, sarcoidosis, Erdheim-Chester and Rosai-Dorfman, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and pancreatic cancer. Distinguishing features include age, systemic inflammatory signs, IL-6 levels, CRP/IgA patterns, and, critically, histology, and red flags that should prompt referral include organ swelling, pancreatobiliary involvement, markedly elevated IgG4, tissue IgG4+ plasma cell infiltration, and obliterative phlebitis [^111aStdb] [^1178vcJi] [^1144fsbv].

> Hold on, I should verify treatment principles and monitoring. Glucocorticoids are first-line for remission induction with dramatic responses in most patients, but relapse is common during taper, so many require maintenance with steroid-sparing agents such as azathioprine, mycophenolate, methotrexate, or rituximab; rituximab is particularly effective for induction and relapse, and emerging B-cell/plasmablast-targeted therapies are under study, while the IgG4-RD Responder Index tracks activity and complements imaging and serology for follow-up [^117PRK8a] [^116EnUxz] [^114V4Uzx] [^115jupqq].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and nuances. Pediatric IgG4-RD lacks the male predominance seen in adults and more often involves surface organs like the orbits; in suspected IgG4-sclerosing cholangitis, modest IgG4 elevations occur in a subset of PSC patients, so IgG4 alone cannot distinguish entities and cholangiographic/imaging patterns plus histology are decisive; in the elderly, steroid toxicity is common, favoring early steroid-sparing strategies [^111T1yNy] [^113xt4bF] [^114V4Uzx].

> Let me reconsider the diagnostic algorithm to avoid overreliance on any single test. In a patient with compatible organ swelling or dysfunction, obtain serum IgG4 with awareness of assay variability, pursue cross-sectional imaging to define disease distribution, and, when safe, biopsy an involved organ other than lymph node or bone marrow to seek the histopathologic triad and IgG4/IgG ratio. Integrate clinical, serologic, radiologic, and pathologic data, apply ACR/EULAR scoring when helpful, and remember that a steroid trial can support the diagnosis but does not replace tissue confirmation [^115tWDEB] [^114twGKB] [^1134eoHr].

> In summary, I should confirm the key messages. IgG4-RD is a treatable multisystem fibroinflammatory disease best identified by integrating clinical suspicion with characteristic histology and supportive serology. Serum IgG4 is sensitive but not specific, very high levels carry greater diagnostic weight yet remain imperfect, and early recognition with biopsy confirmation prevents irreversible fibrosis and guides targeted therapy including glucocorticoids and B-cell depletion [^113d1Juy] [^113ivodx] [^1159bHRd] [^114V4Uzx].

---

IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a chronic, immune-mediated fibroinflammatory disorder characterized by **tumor-like swellings** in multiple organs, **elevated serum IgG4**, and **IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltrates** with storiform fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis on histology [^114YRdgr] [^1153H5HH]. It is a **great mimicker** of malignancy and other inflammatory diseases, so diagnosis requires integration of clinical, serologic, radiologic, and histopathologic data, with biopsy as the gold standard [^1134eoHr] [^1167q4Qw]. Glucocorticoids are first-line therapy and induce remission in most patients, but relapses are common and long-term immunosuppression may be needed [^1134eoHr] [^117PRK8a]. Early recognition and treatment are essential to prevent irreversible organ damage from fibrosis [^114TP7PN].

---

## Pathophysiology

- **Immune dysregulation**: IgG4-RD is driven by dysregulated T and B cell responses, with a prominent Th2 cytokine milieu (IL-4, IL-10, IL-13) and increased T follicular helper cells promoting IgG4 class switching and plasmablast expansion [^115jupqq].

- **Fibrosis**: Activated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts drive collagen deposition, leading to storiform fibrosis and organ dysfunction [^113qSBBo] [^114YRdgr].

- **IgG4 antibodies**: IgG4 undergoes Fab-arm exchange, reducing immune complex formation and complement activation, suggesting a regulatory role, though their pathogenicity remains debated [^11665VMq] [^115Etxfx].

---

## Clinical manifestations

IgG4-RD can affect virtually any organ, with **common sites** including:

| **Organ system** | **Common manifestations** |
|-|-|
| Pancreatobiliary | - Autoimmune pancreatitis (type 1) [^113d1Juy] <br/> - IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis [^112D5rK7] |
| Salivary/lacrimal glands | - Mikulicz disease (dacryoadenitis/sialadenitis) [^111Mzn85] |
| Retroperitoneum | - Retroperitoneal fibrosis [^113qSBBo] |
| Kidneys | - Tubulointerstitial nephritis [^111xmVRZ] |
| Lungs | - Nodules <br/> - Interstitial pneumonia [^117DAsCV] |
| Orbit | - Orbital pseudotumor [^113qSBBo] |
| Lymph nodes | - Generalized lymphadenopathy [^115AJZWM] |

---

Clinical features are **highly variable**, often presenting with subacute organ swelling or mass lesions that mimic malignancy [^1134eoHr].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and biomarkers

Diagnosis requires a **multidisciplinary approach** integrating clinical, serologic, radiologic, and histopathologic findings [^115tWDEB]:

- **Serum IgG4**: Elevated in ~70% of patients but nonspecific; can be elevated in other conditions (e.g. multicentric Castleman disease, sarcoidosis, malignancies) [^113qSBBo] [^113ivodx].

- **Histopathology**: Dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, > 10–50 IgG4+ plasma cells/HPF (organ-specific), IgG4/IgG ratio > 40%, storiform fibrosis, and obliterative phlebitis [^113qSBBo] [^115i2swC].

- **Imaging**: PET-CT can identify active inflammatory lesions and guide biopsy [^114kMumz].

- **ACR/EULAR criteria**: Integrate clinical, serologic, radiologic, and histopathologic domains for classification (score ≥ 20 suggests IgG4-RD) [^115tWDEB].

---

## Treatment strategies

Glucocorticoids are **first-line** therapy (prednisone 30–40 mg/day), inducing remission in ~90% of patients [^117PRK8a]. Immunomodulators such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or methotrexate are used as steroid-sparing agents or for maintenance [^114QAzGq]. Rituximab is effective for refractory disease or steroid intolerance, targeting B cells and plasmablasts [^115marAT]. Emerging therapies under investigation include anti-CD19 agents (inebilizumab) and cytokine inhibitors [^113wo7n4].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is **generally favorable** with treatment, but relapses are common (~40–50%) and fibrosis may cause irreversible organ damage if therapy is delayed [^113bgd35] [^114TP7PN]. Complications include organ failure (pancreatic insufficiency, renal failure), vascular involvement (periaortitis, aneurysms), and an increased malignancy risk (lymphoma, pancreatic/biliary cancers) [^1115bxz2] [^112VDEbx].

---

## Current research and future directions

Current research focuses on **biomarker discovery** to identify specific markers for diagnosis and monitoring, and on elucidating pathogenic mechanisms, including the roles of T follicular helper cells, plasmablasts, and fibroblasts [^115guCUj] [^115jupqq] [^117DProJ]. Clinical trials are evaluating novel agents, including anti-CD19 antibodies, cytokine inhibitors, and combination regimens [^112D5rK7] [^113wo7n4].

---

IgG4-RD is a systemic fibroinflammatory disease with diverse organ involvement; **early diagnosis and treatment are critical** to prevent irreversible fibrosis. Management centers on glucocorticoids with immunomodulators or rituximab for refractory cases, and ongoing research aims to refine biomarkers and targeted therapies [^1134eoHr].

### Blood biomarkers recommended for diagnosing and monitoring IgG4-related disease. considerations from the ERN ReCONNET and collaborating partners [^115guCUj]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a chronic, clinically heterogenous fibroinflammatory condition, characterised by an accumulation of IgG4 secreting plasma cells in affected tissues and associated with increased serum IgG4 concentrations. Despite a growing recognition of the disease among clinicians from different specialties worldwide, its indolent nature, lack of a single diagnostic test and ability to mimic other malignant, infective and inflammatory conditions, makes the diagnosis challenging. As treatment options evolve, biomarkers correlating with disease activity, predicting prognosis and response to treatment are deemed required. A multidisciplinary panel of experts from the European Reference Network for Rare and Complex Connective tissue diseases (ERN ReCONNET) and affiliated international partners have performed a narrative literature search and reviewed the current evidence of biomarkers in IgG4-RD, including immunoglobulins, cytokines, chemokines and other soluble immune mediators, and cellular components of the immune system. The aim of this paper is to provide useful information for clinicians as to the utility of biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring IgG4-RD in clinical routine and sets out recommendations for clinical decision making.

### Hyper-IgG4 disease: report and characterisation of a new disease [^113Lg18L]. BMC Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We believe that hyper-IgG4 disease is an important condition to recognise as the diagnosis can be verified by histology and simple blood tests, and the outcome with treatment during the acute phase is very good. A raised IgG concentration in the absence of hypergammaglobulinaemia is typical, but ideally IgG4 should also be measured. Even when pathology appears localised, as with RPF, constitutional symptoms can be present with evidence of an acute phase response. Rarely a systemic form of the disease will present with severe constitutional symptoms, and hyper-IgG4 disease can be added to list of unusual causes of FUO. Although the role and relevance of IgG4 is unknown, the dense fibrosis that accompanies healing would appear to be a typical example of Th2-mediated pathology.

### Serum immunoglobulin G4 and immunoglobulin G1 for distinguishing immunoglobulin G4-associated cholangitis from primary sclerosing cholangitis [^115HsgYW]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

IgG4 is one of the four known subtypes of IgG molecules. Apart from being the least abundant IgG in healthy people (typically forming < 5% of total serum IgG), IgG4 has unique biochemical properties, of which the ability to exchange its half molecules, thus yielding antibodies (Abs) with dual antigen affinities, is the most intriguing. Unusually high IgG4 serum levels were first reported in patients with autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) and have since been associated also with other organ manifestations of IgG4-RD, including IAC. A gold standard for diagnosing AIP and IAC is still lacking. Therefore, use of one of the currently accepted sets of diagnostic criteria has become common practice, of which the HISORt criteria for diagnosing AIP arguably are the most widely appliedand which were adapted for use in suspected IAC patients.

Because IgG4-RD can be adequately controlled in the vast majority of cases by immunosuppressive medication, it is crucial to discriminate IAC cases from PSC patients. IAC becomes symptomatic, on average, in men of an older age (60–80 years). Upon careful history taking, IAC patients often have other organ manifestations of IgG4-RD, when compared to those with PSC. An elevated IgG4 serum level is still the pivotal finding that leads to the diagnosis, and elevated IgG4 levels are thus firmly anchored in the current diagnostic criteria of IAC. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases practice guideline on the diagnosis and management of PSC published recently in this journal suggested measuring specific Ig (sIg)G4 in all patients with possible PSC, to exclude IAC. However, elevated levels of IgG4 have also been shown in 9%-27% of clear-cut PSC patients.–Therefore, it is currently unclear how to interpret an elevated sIgG4 level in a patient with alleged PSC. Furthermore, no data exist currently regarding levels of other IgG subclasses in these patients. Given that specific IgG4-positive plasma/B-cell clones seem to play a central role in the pathogenesis of IAC, we hypothesized that IgG4 may be specifically increased in IAC, whereas a nonspecific increase in IgG of different IgG subclasses could be expected in other immune-mediated disorders, such as PSC. Therefore, in search of a reliable algorithm, we determined total IgG and IgG subclasses in serum samples of two large independent PSC and IAC cohorts as well as in serum samples of a disease control group with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).

### IgG4-related lung disease mimicking COPD: case report and review [^117DAsCV]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is an immune-mediated fibroinflammatory condition capable of affecting multiple organs. First recognized as a systemic disease in 2001, IgG4-RD can manifest in various organs, including but not limited to the pancreas, biliary system, salivary glands, and kidneys. IgG4-RD can manifest in the lungs with a variety of presentations, often mimicking other conditions such as lung cancer, pneumonia, interstitial lung disease (ILD), and sarcoidosis. Recognizing these diverse manifestations is crucial for accurate diagnosis and management. Multiple studies have reported that asthma and pulmonary emphysema with pleural involvement can be common manifestations that are eventually diagnosed as IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD).

In this case, the initial suspicion of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on the basis of the patient's history and physical examination highlights the diagnostic challenges in IgG4-RD. Many of the clinical manifestations of IgG4-RD mimic other more common conditions. A comprehensive medical workup, including computed tomography (CT), is crucial for identifying the features that lead to the correct diagnosis. The literature describes seven patterns of thoracic involvement, from which this patient exhibited a nodular pattern alongside peribronchovascular involvement, accompanied by mediastinal, hilar, and axillary lymph node involvement. Elevated immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) levels serve as a predictive indicator for this disease. Studies report an average specificity ranging from 70 to 80% for elevated IgG4 in diagnosing this condition. A serum IgG4 level exceeding 1500 mg/dL is considered highly specific for confirming a definitive diagnosis of the disease. The application of the 2019 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria provided a structured approach to confirming the diagnosis. The scoring system, which considers lymphocytic infiltration, the serum IgG4 concentration, lacrimal gland involvement, and peribronchovascular thickening, demonstrates how diverse manifestations are integrated into a single diagnostic assessment. The patient's total score of 31, well above the threshold of 20, provides strong support for the IgG4-RD diagnosis (Table 1). However, according to the 2020 revised comprehensive diagnostic (RCD) criteria for IgG4-RD, this patient has two items except for the third item, which includes dense lymphocyte infiltration and a ratio of IgG4-positive plasma cells/IgG-positive cells greater than 40% in this case. We found that ratio was 25%, which we found due to the limitation in the biopsy sample, which was inadequate to obtain an accurate diagnosis.

### IgG4-related disease: evidence from six recent cohorts [^113bgd35]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a rare autoimmune fibrosing disorder. In this review we aim to describe and compare the characteristics of the six largest IgG4-RD cohorts, since the new 2012 consensus diagnostic criteria were released. These observational studies were published between 2012 and 2015. Patients were included using the comprehensive diagnostic criteria or the 2012 consensus criteria. Results were reviewed and summarized. Most patients were middle aged men. Fibro-inflammatory masses developed in virtually all organs except the brain, with an unexplained preference for salivary glands, lymph nodes and pancreas. Corticosteroids were the treatment of choice but up to 40% of patients relapsed within the first year. Standardized response assessment tools, biomarkers and the validation of new treatments are still in development. In conclusion, the features of IgG4-RD are similar across the globe. At the moment, corticosteroids are the only validated treatment but rituximab seems to be promising.

### A clinical overview of IgG4-related systemic disease [^1153H5HH]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize the existing knowledge of various clinical presentations of IgG4-related systemic disease (IgG4-RSD) and to review the evolving list of organs affected by IgG4-RSD.

Recent Findings

The term IgG4-RSD encompasses a variety of clinical entities once regarded as being entirely separate diseases. The list of organs associated with this condition is growing steadily. Tissue biopsies reveal striking histopathological similarity, regardless of which organ is involved, although subtle differences across organs exist. Diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, presence of abundant IgG4-positive plasma cells and extensive fibrosis are the hallmark pathology findings. Tumorous swelling, eosinophilia, and obliterative phlebitis are other frequently observed features. Polyclonal elevations of serum IgG4 are found in most but not all patients.

Summary

IgG4-RSD is an underrecognized condition about which knowledge is now growing rapidly. Yet there remain many unknowns with regard to its cause, pathogenesis, various clinical presentations, approach to treatment, disease monitoring, and long-term outcomes. A wide variety of organs can be involved in IgG4-RSD. Clinicians should be aware of this entity and consider the diagnosis in the appropriate settings.

### Characteristics of autoimmune pancreatitis based on serum IgG4 level [^117VmsFW]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Autoimmune pancreatitis is categorized as an IgG4-related autoimmune disease, mostly associated with serological alterations, however characteristics of autoimmune pancreatitis based on serum markers have not been fully evaluated.

Methods

We evaluated demographics, symptoms, imaging and therapeutic outcome in 27 cases of autoimmune pancreatitis stratified by serum IgG4 level.

Results

Twenty patients (74%) had elevated serum IgG4 and 7 (26%) had normal IgG4 levels. Compared to patients with normal serum IgG4 levels, patients with elevated IgG4 had higher incidence of jaundice at onset (14.3% vs. 80%, respectively; P = 0.002), more frequent diffuse pancreatic enlargement at imaging (14.3% vs. 60%, respectively; P = 0.04), significantly higher 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake of pancreatic lesions (SUV max: 4.0 vs. 5.7, respectively; P = 0.02), more frequent extrapancreatic lesions (42.9% vs. 85%, respectively; P = 0.03). Response to steroids was recognized regardless of serum IgG4 level, however maintenance therapy was required more frequently amongst patients with elevated compared to normal IgG4 (85.7% vs. 33.3%, respectively; P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Clinical features of autoimmune pancreatitis are different based on level of serum IgG4. Further studies are needed to clarify if normal serum IgG4 cases are a precursor of active type 1 or type 2 autoimmune pancreatitis.

### Characterizing IgG4-related disease with ¹ ⁸ F-FDG PET / CT: a prospective cohort study [^114kMumz]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Many questions about IgG4-RD, an emerging clinical entity most probably mediated by immune reaction, remain unresolved. First of all, the diagnosis of IgG4-RD remains a challenge in clinical practice. In 2011, comprehensive diagnostic criteria for IgG4-RD were proposed, in which an abundant IgG4 positive cell infiltration (> 40% of IgG positive plasma cells being IgG4 positive and > 10 IgG4 positive cells per high power field) in biopsy sample and an elevated serum IgG4 level over 135 mg/ml were emphasized. These statements represent a major progress in the diagnosis of IgG4-RD. However, biopsy specimens are sometimes difficult to obtain and not always adequate for diagnosis; serum IgG4 levels may also be normal in some patients with IgG4-RD, whereas an elevated serum IgG4 level can be encountered in a wide array of disorders, including allergic diseases, Castleman's disease, and lymphoma.

In addition to the histopathological diagnosis and serological findings, IgG4-RD is also characterized by multi-organ involvements with special manifestations. The disease has been recognized as a systemic immune-mediated inflammatory condition since 2003, when extrapancreatic lesions were identified with infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells in patients with AIP. Since then, IgG4-RD has been found in almost every organ. Therefore, we believe non-invasive imaging characteristics should also serve as an important tool in the diagnosis of IgG4-RD, and a systematic, comprehensive understanding of the distribution information of IgG4-RD is vital for its diagnosis, staging, and treatment. However, conventional imaging methods, such as ultrasonography, CT, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have a limited value in the provision of a comprehensive evaluation of the disease, although some characteristics of diffuse and focal infiltration are considered specific in some organs, such as the pancreas. Whereas 18 F-FDG PET/CT, which holds an advantage in providing metabolic information of the whole body in one scan, may be a valuable tool to evaluate the systemic inflammatory disease and reflect the involvements in each organ and the activity in each lesion, as well.

### The clinical spectrum of IgG4-related disease [^1136shvS]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is an emerging immune-mediated disease with the capability of involving essentially any organ. The epidemiology of this disease has not been explored in detail. A majority of patients reported in the literature to date are from Japan, but the condition has been described all across the world and there is no strong evidence to suggest a predilection for Asian populations. The mean age at diagnosis is approximately 60 years and there is a decided male predominance for many clinical features, with an overall male:female ratio of 8:3. A cardinal feature of IgG4-RD is single or multiple organ swelling that often raises concern for malignancy. IgG4-RD should be suspected in patients presenting with unexplained enlargement or swelling of one or more organs. Presenting features vary substantially according to the specialty to which patients present first; in addition, the disease can be diagnosed unexpectedly in pathological specimens or identified incidentally on radiology studies. Involvement of major organs is common and IgG4-RD may lead to organ failure, particularly in the pancreas, liver and biliary tree, kidneys, thyroid gland, lungs, and aorta. The diagnosis of IgG4-RD relies on the coexistence of various clinical, laboratory and histopathological findings, although none is pathognomonic by itself.

### IgG4-related diseases: state of the art on clinical practice guidelines [^111HAASi]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

IgG4-RD is a relatively new defined clinical entity. Therefore, formal disease classification and guidelines for diagnosis and treatment are still widely lacking. Given the rarity and heterogeneity of this disease, RCT may only be accomplished in international multicentre trials with support of pharmaceutical companies. The current development of disease classification criteria by the EULAR and ACR task force will be the first step to harmonise terminology and to provide the basis for further collaborative studies on diagnostic recommendations and treatment guidelines, which need to be endorsed by scientific international societies (ie, EULAR, ACR). In the absence of RCTs, the implementation of non-randomised pilot studies will help to increase the level of evidence of therapeutic guidelines.

### IgG4-related disease: lessons from the first 20 years [^114TP7PN]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a systemic immune-mediated fibroinflammatory disease that is believed but not confirmed to have an autoimmune origin. Since its discovery nearly two decades ago, our understanding of its pathophysiology and clinical manifestations has grown substantially. Early diagnosis and treatment of this elusive disease can prevent substantial organ damage from end-stage fibrosis. This underscores the importance of prompt recognition, full characterization, and astute management. The American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism Classification Criteria provide a framework for approaching the diagnosis of IgG4-RD even though they were not intended for diagnostic purposes. The approach to diagnosis involves recognizing the typical disease manifestations and incorporating clinical, radiological, serological, and histopathological information. The exclusion of disease mimickers, particularly malignancy and other inflammatory conditions, is essential. Both glucocorticoids and B cell depletion are effective at inducing remission in IgG4-RD in most patients. The optimal approach to the use of these agents is now being defined in clinical trials.

### Serum immunoglobulin G4 level is a poor predictor of immunoglobulin G4-related disease [^116bjqFS]. Pancreas (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is characterized by elevation in serum IgG4 levels, typical multiorgan involvement and dramatic response to steroid therapy. We determined the predictive value of an elevated serum IgG4 for the diagnosis of IgG4-RD. We also sought to identify novel conditions, which have characteristic features of IgG4-RD.

Methods

We identified all Mayo Clinic Rochester patients with serum IgG4 levels measured between January 2008 and December 2011 (n = 6014). Those with elevated serum IgG4 levels (reference range, 121–140 mg/dL) were included in the analysis and were classified as "definite", "probable", or "no" IgG4-RD.

Results

Serum IgG4 levels were elevated in 390 subjects (6.5%) of whom only 39 (10%) had IgG4-RD (29 "definite", 10 "probable"). The positive predictive value of an elevated serum IgG4 for IgG4-RD was poor (10%). Subjects with IgG4-RD differed from those without IgG4-RD in mean age (59.6 ± 15.2 vs 54.4 ± 18.3 years, P < 0.05), % males (90% vs 58%, P < 0.05), mean serum IgG4 level (437 ± 471 vs 223 ± 194 mg/dL, P < 0.05), and presence of chronic rhinosinusitis (7/39 vs 29/351, P = 0.05).

Conclusions

Elevated serum IgG4 levels are not specific for IgG4-RD and are likely to be a false-positive. Chronic rhinosinusitis is likely an as yet underrecognized manifestation of IgG4-RD.

### IgG4-related disease: a reminder for practicing pathologists [^115uAWZp]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a systemic autoimmune fibroinflammatory disease that produces sclerotic, tumefactive masses containing dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates rich in immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 + plasma cells. Initially characterized as a form of autoimmune pancreatitis, the distinctive histopathology of IgG4-RD has now been described in almost every organ system. However, because the clinical manifestations of IgG4-RD are diverse and nonspecific, the disease may go unsuspected until a biopsy or resection specimen is obtained to diagnose a presumed malignancy. Pathologists thus play a key role in the diagnosis of IgG4-RD, and familiarity with its histopathologic features is essential to preventing the irreversible comorbidities associated with this treatable disease. This brief review outlines the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and histopathology of IgG4-RD, with the aim of furthering pathologists' awareness of and ability to diagnose this disorder.

Purpose Of Review

Provide an update of the developments in IgG4 related disease within the last year in terms of nomenclature, diagnostic criteria and clinical features.

Recent Findings

The number of diseases associated with IgG4 related disease continues to grow. The entities of idiopathic orbital inflammation, idiopathic cervical fibrosis, eosinophilic angiocentric fibrosis, reactive nodular fibrous pseudotumor, sclerosing mesenteritis, and membranous glomerulonephritis should all be added to the list of diseases associated with the IgG4 related disease spectrum. The issues of nomenclature and diagnostic criteria for IgG4 related disease have important recent developments as well.

Summary

The diagnosis of IgG4 related disease continues to be challenging. Increasing recognition of IgG4 related disease has led to a large body of literature on organ sites of involvement. Understanding how the disease manifests itself is critical to diagnosis and ultimately treatment.

Case continued

The patient was suspected to have IgG4-RD, so serum IgG subclasses were analyzed. His serum IgG4 level was markedly elevated at 11.6 g/L (normal values < 1.35). The tissue blocks from his previous nephrectomy were retrieved and pathology review showed a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, moderate tissue eosinophilia and interstitial fibrosis and atrophy. Staining for IgG4 and IgG revealed abundant IgG4 + plasma cells with > 40 IgG4 + plasma cells per high power field and an IgG4/IgG ratio > 40%. Computed tomography scans of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed multiple pulmonary nodules, carinal lymphadenopathy and a soft tissue density encasing the main coronary arteries, previous right nephrectomy and pancreatic atrophy. His IgG4-RD Responder Index activity score was 12.

Discussion and conclusions

IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is an emerging immune-mediated disease that can affect any body organ. In 1961, Sarles et al. first reported a case of pancreatitis with hypergammaglobulinemia, suggestive of an underlying autoimmune process. In 2001, Hamano et al. first established the association between sclerosing pancreatitis and elevated serum concentrations of IgG4. Subsequently, in 2003, Kamisawa et al. found that this autoimmune process is not limited to the pancreas and is actually a systemic disease. The authors introduced the term "IgG4-related autoimmune disease". The term IgG4-RD was finally proposed in 2012 by an international multidisciplinary study group, and a consensus was reached about its pathology. The first management and treatment guidelines for IgG4-RG were published in 2015.

The widespread incomplete understanding of IgG4-RD has led to misdiagnosis of the disease. Because IgG4-RD can be controlled well by glucocorticoids, it is important to study its characteristics for correct diagnosis. In 2012, IgG4-RD study groups in Japan published the first comprehensive clinical diagnostic criteria. The criteria emphasize diffuse/localized swellings or masses in single or multiple organs and elevated serum IgG4 concentrations (135 mg/dl), with marked lymphocyte and plasmacyte infiltration and fibrosis, infiltration of IgG4+ plasma cells, an IgG4+/IgG+ cell ratio of > 40%, and > 10 IgG4+ plasma cells/HPF in histopathological examination. In 2015, an international panel of experts further pointed out that the diagnosis of IgG4-RD should be based on comprehensive criteria, including a full clinical history, physical examination, selected laboratory investigations, and appropriate radiological studies. Furthermore, biopsy is strongly recommended for the exclusion of malignancies and other IgG4-RD mimics. In this case report, the serum IgG4 level was substantially increased, and the mucosal biopsy specimen showed infiltration of IgG4+ plasma cells, an IgG4+/IgG+ cell ratio of > 40%, and > 10 IgG4+ plasma cells/HPF. The patient was responsive to glucocorticoid treatment. Furthermore, his symptoms, physical examination, laboratory tests, and biopsy excluded malignancy and other diseases involving IgG4+ plasma cell infiltration, including sarcoidosis, Wegener's granulomatosis, Churg–Strauss syndrome, and multicentric Castleman's disease. Therefore, the patient's diagnosis of IgG4-RD was confirmed by comprehensive clinical information.

### Increases in IgE, eosinophils, and mast cells can be used in diagnosis and to predict relapse of IgG4-related disease [^114HeGYN]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

IgG subclass 4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is characterized by increased serum levels of IgG4 and infiltration of biliary, pancreatic, and other tissues by IgG4-positive plasma cells. We assessed the prevalence of allergy and/or atopy, serum, and tissue IgE antibodies, and blood and tissue eosinophils in patients with IgG4-RD. We investigated the association between serum IgE and diagnosis and relapse of this disease.

Methods

We performed a prospective study of 48 patients with IgG4-RD, 42 patients with an increased serum level of IgG4 with other inflammatory and autoimmune conditions (disease control subjects), and 51 healthy individuals (healthy control subjects) recruited from Oxford, United Kingdom from March 2010 through March 2014, and followed for a median of 41 months (range, 3–73 months). Serum levels of immunoglobulin were measured at diagnosis, during steroid treatment, and at disease relapse for patients with IgG4-RD; levels at diagnosis were compared with baseline levels of control subjects. Allergen-specific IgEs were measured using the IgE ImmunoCAP. Levels and distribution of IgG4 and IgE antibodies in lymphoid, biliary, and pancreatic tissues from patients with IgG4-RD and disease control subjects were measured by immunohistochemistry. We analyzed data using the Spearman rank correlation and receiver operating characteristic curves.

Results

Serum levels of IgG4 increased to 1.4 g/L or more, and IgE increased to 125 kIU/L or more, in 81% and 54% of patients with IgG4-RD, respectively, compared with 6% and 16% of healthy control subjects (P < .0001). Peripheral blood eosinophilia was detected in 38% of patients with IgG4-RD versus 9% of healthy control subjects (P = 0.004). Of patients with IgG4-RD, 63% had a history of allergy and 40% had a history of atopy with an IgE-specific response; these values were 60% and 53% in patients with increased serum levels of IgE (P < .05). Level of IgE at diagnosis > 480 kIU/L distinguished patients with IgG4-RD from disease control subjects with 86% specificity, 36% sensitivity, and a likelihood ratio of 3.2. Level of IgE at diagnosis > 380 kIU/L identified patients with disease relapse with 88% specificity, 64% sensitivity, and a likelihood ratio of 5.4. IgE-positive mast cells and eosinophilia were observed in lymphoid, biliary, and pancreatic tissue samples from 50% and 86% of patients with IgG4-RD, respectively.

Conclusions

In a prospective study, we associated IgG4-RD with allergy, atopy, eosinophilia, increased serum levels of IgE, and IgE-positive mast cells in lymphoid, biliary, and pancreatic tissue. An IgE-mediated allergic response therefore seems to develop in most patients with IgG4-RD; levels of IgE might be used in diagnosis and predicting relapse.

### Clinical diagnostic criteria of IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis 2012 [^116hrjvY]. Journal of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Clinical diagnostic criteria of IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis" for IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis.

The clinical diagnostic criteria of IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC) is a diagnostic tool designed to identify and classify patients with this specific form of cholangitis. The target patient population includes individuals presenting with symptoms of cholangitis, such as jaundice, abdominal pain, and pruritus, who may also have concurrent autoimmune conditions.

The primary components of this diagnostic criteria include both clinical and laboratory findings. Clinically, the patient may present with diffuse or segmental narrowing of the intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic bile duct associated with thickening of the bile duct wall on biliary tract imaging. Laboratory findings include elevated serum IgG4 levels (≥ 135 mg/dL), marked lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltration and fibrosis, infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells (> 10 IgG4-positive plasma cells/hpf), and storiform fibrosis or obliterative phlebitis. The coexistence of autoimmune pancreatitis, IgG4-related dacryoadenitis/sialadenitis, or IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis is also considered. The effectiveness of corticosteroid therapy is another component of the criteria.

The diagnosis of definite IgG4-SC is determined by the presence of specific combinations of these components. For instance, a patient meets the criteria for definite IgG4-SC if they have diffuse or segmental narrowing of the bile ducts on imaging and coexisting autoimmune conditions. Alternatively, a patient can be diagnosed with definite IgG4-SC if they have elevated serum IgG4 levels, marked lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltration and fibrosis, and infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells. Other combinations of these components can also lead to a diagnosis of definite IgG4-SC.

The criteria also allow for the classification of probable and possible IgG4-SC. For example, a patient meets the criteria for probable IgG4-SC if they have diffuse or segmental narrowing of the bile ducts on imaging, elevated serum IgG4 levels, and a positive response to corticosteroid therapy. A patient meets the criteria for possible IgG4-SC if they have diffuse or segmental narrowing of the bile ducts on imaging and elevated serum IgG4 levels. If the patient does not meet any of these combinations, the criteria for IgG4-SC are not met.

The system determines the classification of IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC) using specific clinical diagnostic criteria. The calculation is based on the presence or absence of a set of clinical, serological, and pathological findings indicative of IgG4-SC. These findings are:

1. Diffuse or segmental narrowing of the intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic bile duct associated with thickening of the bile duct wall on biliary tract imaging
2. Elevated serum IgG4 levels (≥ 135 mg/dL)
3. Coexistence of autoimmune pancreatitis, IgG4-related dacryoadenitis/sialadenitis, or IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis
4. Marked lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltration and fibrosis
5. Infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells (> 10 IgG4-positive plasma cells/hpf)
6. Storiform fibrosis
7. Obliterative phlebitis
8. Effectiveness of corticosteroid therapy

The system evaluates the combinations of these inputs to classify the diagnosis as definite, probable, or possible IgG4-SC, or as criteria not met. The decision is based on specific input combinations:

- **Definite IgG4-SC**:
- Presence of criteria 1 and 3
- Presence of criteria 1, 2, 4, and 5
- Presence of criteria 4, 5, and 6
- Presence of criteria 4, 5, and 7

- **Probable IgG4-SC**:
- Presence of criteria 1, 2, and 8

- **Possible IgG4-SC**:
- Presence of criteria 1 and 2

Unmet needs

Clinicians' unmet needs

The following unmet needs have been identified and discussed by the DCs and DRs:

Lack of shared classification criteria

There is no international consensus on classification criteria for IgG4-RD. Therefore, development of validated classification criteria should be the first step to guide clinicians in stratifying patients and to provide the basis for further collaborative and comparative research studies in the field. In this sense, the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) are currently jointly supporting a Task Force for the development of classification criteria for IgG4-RD that will hopefully be available in the near future.

No formal guidelines for diagnosis available

Diagnosis of IgG4-RD is challenging, given the heterogeneity of clinical symptoms and laboratory results. The prevalence of IgG4-RD is probably underestimated, especially in Europe and North America, where the awareness of its existence may be lower than in Asian countries, where the disease was initially described. Although serum IgG4 concentrations may be helpful, they have certainly lost importance in the diagnosis. Histology is still the gold standard for diagnosis, but evidence-based criteria in this field are scarce. In the last years, several studies have been published on possible diagnostic markers and predictive factors. For example, assessment of plasmablast levels by flow cytometry has recently emerged as a promising new diagnostic modality. However, more evidence in this field is necessary to provide the basis for standardised algorithms in the diagnostic process. Further studies are required that need to be performed in an international collaborative setting, including all involved disease specialists, that is, rheumatology, gastroenterology, vascular medicine, surgery, radiology, pathology and clinical immunology.

Indices for disease activity and damage are lacking

Similar to other inflammatory rheumatic diseases, IgG4-RD presents with relapsing–remitting courses that may eventually result in tissue damage. Therefore, standardised indices for disease activity and damage need to be developed and validated. In addition, the place and relevance of imaging techniques (eg, ultrasound, CT, MRI and PET scans) in diagnosis and follow-up of the disease should be evaluated.

Sclerosing mesenteritis laboratory markers and IgG4-related disease — Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein may be elevated, but not in all cases, and there is scant literature on these biomarkers with uncertain roles in management or follow-up; rarely, patients with SM have IgG4-related disease with CT appearances that can mimic malignancy, only half have elevated serum IgG4 levels to suggest the diagnosis, and a surgical biopsy with IgG4 staining may be required if the IgG4 level is normal and the imaging is not diagnostic for SM.

### Increases in IgE, eosinophils, and mast cells can be used in diagnosis and to predict relapse of IgG4-related disease [^114qkvjF]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the original landmark study of elevated serum IgG4 in patients with AIP in Japan, there was no difference reported in IgE levels between AIP and HC. Subsequent retrospective studies reported an elevated IgE in 34%–86% of patients with AIP. In our prospective study of IgG4-RD, an elevated IgE was found in 57% at diagnosis, and a positive correlation was shown between IgE and both IgG4 and eosinophils count. We report a frequent clinical history of allergy (63%) and atopy (40%) in IgG4-RD, supported by retrospective data in Japanese patients with AIP, but not by other groups. Peripheral eosinophilia and elevated IgE have also been described in subsets of IgG4-RD patients without atopy. The main discrepancy lies in the definition of atopy; symptoms plus an IgE-specific protein response, which has not been characterized in other studies. We also show a higher IgE level in those individuals with allergy/atopy, supported by studies showing IgG4-RD patients with atopy express up-regulated Th2 cytokines in peripheral blood. We have also reported polyclonal elevations of IgG4 to multiple food allergens in IgG4-RD patients.

Our results support the utility of serum IgE in diagnosis of IgG4-RD, with a level of > 480 KU/L differentiating IgG4-RD from DC with an elevated serum IgG4 (specificity 86%, sensitivity 36%). This 2-dimensional diagnostic approach (ie, IgE combined with IgG4) was supported by the observation that patients with a normal serum IgG4 did not have an elevated IgE. There were no DCs with malignancy in this dataset; however, serum IgE levels may be used to distinguish organ-specific IgG4-RD from malignant lesions, potentially minimizing unnecessary surgical intervention. This approach requires further validation. An elevated IgE at diagnosis > 380 KU/L was also a marker of disease relapse (specificity 88%, sensitivity 64%), defining a subgroup requiring careful follow-up. This is supported by findings in a recent retrospective cohort study of predictors of disease relapse in IgG4-RD after rituximab therapy; in 21 (37%) patients experiencing disease relapse, baseline serum IgG4, IgE, and circulating eosinophils predicted relapse.

### Deciphering the biology of IgG4-related disease: specific antigens and disease? [^115Etxfx]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The causal relationship between the observed immunoglobulin response and pathology remains another hole in our knowledge. Hubers demonstrates that IgG4 from sera of patients diminishes IgG1 binding to Annexin A11. The authors speculate that IgG4 may act to dampen the IgG1-mediated pathogenesis in response to Annexin A11 binding — supporting an anti-inflammatory role for IgG4 in IgG4-RD. This follows published work in 2016, where the investigators demonstrated the pathogenicity of circulating IgG in patients with IgG4-RD by the passive transfer IgG1 and IgG4 into neonatal mice by subcutaneous injection. Both IgG1 and IgG4 bound to murine pancreas and salivary glands and led to subsequent damage, yet the effect was more pronounced in mice injected with patient IgG1. However, the potent pathogenic effects of patient IgG1 were significantly blunted by simultaneous injection of patient IgG4. It seems as though IgG4, though pathogenic, can competitively bind to target organs in preference to IgG1 and dampen its exaggerated effects.

### Proliferative features of IgG4-related disease [^117CKMMU]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

IgG4-related disease is an immune-mediated disease that can lead to substantial morbidity and organ damage. Capable of affecting nearly any organ system or anatomic site, and showing considerable overlap in clinical presentation with various other diseases, IgG4-related disease often poses a diagnostic challenge for clinicians. Furthermore, there are no diagnostic biomarkers with high specificity for IgG4-related disease, and histopathological examination is nuanced and requires clinical correlation for accurate diagnosis. Therefore, it is crucial for clinicians to recognise the clinical phenotypes of IgG4-related disease. The disease is generally considered to have predominantly fibrotic and proliferative (or inflammatory) manifestations, with distinct clinical, serological and histopathological findings associated with each manifestation. However, the fibrotic and proliferative manifestations of this disease frequently occur together, thereby blurring this dichotomous distinction. In this Series paper, we provide a detailed overview of the clinical manifestations typical of the proliferative features of IgG4-related disease, with an emphasis on the diagnostic evaluation and differential diagnosis of each proliferative disease manifestation. In addition, we summarise the immune mechanisms underlying IgG4-related disease, suggest a framework for how to approach management and monitoring after the diagnosis is established, and highlight current unmet needs for patient care surrounding this disease.

### Distinct features distinguishing IgG4-related disease from multicentric Castleman's disease [^117UjjMH]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is an immune-mediated, fibroinflammatory, multisystem disease characterised by tumour-like swelling of involved organs, elevation of serum IgG4 levels and histopathological features of lymphoplasmacytic infiltration rich in IgG4+ plasma cells. IgG4-RD diagnosis is based on the comprehensive diagnostic criteria proposed in 2011; however, many other diseases can present with features of IgG4-RD and differentiating among them could be challenging.

Castleman's disease (CD), a rare polyclonal lymphoproliferative disorder, is sometimes confused with IgG4-RD. Despite the distinct differences in pathogenesis, treatment and prognosis between the two diseases, multicentric CD (MCD) involving multiple lymphoid lesions and other various organsis sometimes accompanied by the elevation of serum IgG4 levels and infiltration of IgG4+ plasma cells in the affected organs, which could fulfil the diagnostic criteria for IgG4-RD. Therefore, the diagnostic criteria for IgG4-RD and the international consensus guidance statement on the management and treatment of IgG4-RD have recommended careful differentiation from MCD in diagnosing IgG4-RD. It is known that the levels of serum interleukin (IL) 6, playing a central role in the pathogenesis of MCD, are significantly different between the two diseases; however, more clinically applicable methods to differentiate between the two diseases are essential in practice.

The aim of this study is to clarify the differences in clinical characteristics, including distribution of organ involvements and laboratory findings between patients with IgG4-RD and MCD, and to propose an approach of distinguishing between the two diseases.

### Advances in the diagnosis and management of IgG4 related disease [^1134eoHr]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

IgG4 related disease was recognized as a unified disease entity only 15 years ago. Awareness of IgG4 related disease has increased worldwide since then, and specialists are now familiar with most of its clinical manifestations. Involvement of the pancreato-biliary tract, retroperitoneum/aorta, head and neck, and salivary glands are the most frequently observed disease phenotypes, differing in epidemiological features, serological findings, and prognostic outcomes. In view of this multifaceted presentation, IgG4 related disease represents a great mimicker of many neoplastic, inflammatory, and infectious conditions. Histopathology remains key to diagnosis because reliable biomarkers are lacking. Recently released classification criteria will be invaluable in improving early recognition of the disease. IgG4 related disease is highly treatable and responds promptly to glucocorticoids, but it can lead to end stage organ failure and even death if unrecognized. Prolonged courses of corticosteroids are often needed to maintain remission because the disease relapses in most patients. Rapid advancement in our understanding of the pathophysiology of IgG4 related disease is leading to the identification of novel therapeutic targets and possible personalized approaches to treatment.

### IgG4-related disease: a systematic review of this unrecognized disease in pediatrics [^112TSyXR]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

IgG4-RD is a systemic fibro-inflammatory disease affecting different parts of the body. The disease is characterized by tumour-like infiltrations of IgG4 positive plasma cells in the tissues, mostly with fibrotic abnormalities and often elevated serum IgG4 levels. The underlying pathophysiological mechanism of IgG4-RD is still unclear, but when untreated, the disease can lead to irreversible organ damage because of the fibrosis. Early recognition and therapy is therefore critical. In recent time there has been a lot of attention to IgG4-RD in adult care leading to evolving knowledge about pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of this disease. However, further studies are required to provide more insight into this disease, in particular, the underlying pathogenesis has yet to be clarified. The average age at which IgG4-RD can occur, is estimated to be older than 50 years. Although case reports are available on IgG4-RD in children, no pediatric studies or reviews about this disease have been published yet. Knowledge and awareness of this disease is essential to prevent missing the diagnosis and subsequent delay of treatment, especially in children.

We performed a systematic literature search in order to make an overview of all the case reports that have been published regarding IgG4-RD in children. The main purpose of this study was to create awareness of IgG4-RD in pediatrics and to emphasize the broad clinical presentation of this disease. Furthermore, with the current knowledge about the disease we wanted to provide an overview on epidemiology, pathogenesis and treatment of this disease for the pediatricians.

### Management of IgG4-related disease [^114V4Uzx]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

IgG4-related disease was unrecognised as a unified disease entity until this century, yet in a short period of time the disease has been appreciated to have a worldwide distribution, and its clinical, pathological, and radiological features have been described in considerable detail. The disease has strong organ predilections, and many of the clinical presentations of disease are increasingly familiar to both generalists and specialists. Early recognition of IgG4-related disease is crucial because although the disease is highly treatable, it can lead to serious organ damage and even death if undiagnosed until advanced stages. Its indolent nature often makes diagnosis challenging, and IgG4-related disease is one of the great mimickers of other diseases in the current era. Glucocorticoids are an effective treatment for IgG4-related disease, but their long-term use is problematic in a disease that frequently affects middle-aged to elderly individuals and often leads to pancreatic dysfunction. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease is surprisingly advanced given the relatively recent recognition of this condition. Insights into disease pathophysiology offer the possibility of a variety of targeted treatment approaches. Looking ahead, biological therapies could profoundly alter the way in which IgG4-related disease is managed, permitting the use of specific therapies that are tailored to patients' clinical phenotypes.

### IgG4-related disease: what a hematologist needs to know [^113Z8jee]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Most centers use immunonephelometry to measure IgG subclasses, which can cause some challenges with interpretation. The two most common immunonephelometric methods (Siemens and Binding Site) correlate well with regard to IgG4, but the absolute IgG4 values differ by approximately 50% at the upper limit of normal. IgG4 levels may also be markedly under-reported in cases of extreme IgG4 elevations due to the hook effect. The hook effect, or prozone phenomenon, occurs when an excessive amount of analyte prevents binding of the capture antibody in a sandwich assay, yielding a falsely low or normal result. Erroneously low measurements of serum IgG4 reported in the literature reflect this error. Furthermore, IgG4 itself interferes with the nephelometric measurement of IgG1 and IgG2, in particular, which can obscure the immunoglobulin profile that would otherwise highlight the disproportionate elevation of serum IgG4. Because of the traditional errors in immunonephelometry, some have mistakenly reported increased serum IgG2 levels as a marker of IgG4-RD. – Our group has recently demonstrated that mass spectrometry is an alternative that eliminates these analytical errors and is more cost-effective than immunonephelometry.

- elevated serum IgG4 levels

- effective response to corticosteroid therapy

There is also an increased recognition of IgG4‐RD in the younger patient cohort. Notably, paediatric IgG4‐RD exhibits characteristics that differ from the adult form, particularly in terms of sex distribution and involved organs. Unlike adult cases, paediatric IgG4‐RD lacks a clear male predominance, with surface organ involvement, such as ophthalmic diseases, being more frequently affected.

IgG4‐RD is generally a chronic condition with a slow and indolent progression. Symptom duration varies widely depending on the affected organs and the stage of the disease at diagnosis. Symptoms can be intermittent or persist for months to years before diagnosis, and patients often present with organ enlargement or tumour‐like masses. As some patients may remain asymptomatic for extended periods, there may be a delay in diagnosis, and lesions may lead to progressive organ damage. Additionally, due to tumefactive lesions in affected organs, IgG4‐RD can resemble other infiltrative diseases and malignancies. Hence, the difficulty of diagnosis and the potential for misdiagnosis of IgG4‐RD are serious concerns. Furthermore, while an elevated serum IgG4 is associated with IgG4‐RD, IgG4 levels can vary among the different extents of organ involvements and thus cannot serve as a reliable and specific single diagnostic marker. Glucocorticoids are the mainstay treatment for IgG4‐RD and are the cornerstone for inducing remission. Tapering regimens are successful, with glucocorticoid‐based first‐line regimens showing a 97% response rate. However, the urgent need to develop an approved therapy for IgG4‐RD remains, as glucocorticoids are not FDA‐approved specifically for the disease. Relapse rates and corticosteroid toxicity are also causes for concern, particularly as patients are often older with underlying comorbidities at diagnosis. Recently developed B cell depletion therapies, such as inebilizumab, have shown marked reduction of serum IgG4 and disease flare risk, as well as overall clinical improvement, and have been recently approved by the FDA. For disease maintenance, combination with conventional synthetic disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDS), such as azathioprine, methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil, is often used for maintaining remission and reducing chronic corticosteroid burden and associated toxicity. IgG4‐RD places a substantial burden not only on patients and their families but also on the healthcare sector at large. Healthcare costs are substantially higher for IgG4‐RD patients due to frequent comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, infections and steroid‐related toxicities. Additionally, due to concerns of infiltrative diseases, multiple biopsies and imaging may be required, further amplifying healthcare costs and leading to high emotional stress for the patients. Recurrence rates of IgG4‐RD post‐remission therapy are approximately 40%, increasing hospital readmission rates and rehabilitation costs. Patients experience fear of worsening symptom flare‐ups and distress due to the general lack of awareness within the medical community.

### Radiology domain in the diagnosis of IgG4-RD according to the 2019 American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism classification [^115tWDEB]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In clinical practice, diagnosing Immunoglobulin G4-related disease necessitates a comprehensive approach that integrates clinical, serological, radiological, and histopathological findings. The distinctive histopathologic features, including lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, fibrosis, and obliterative phlebitis, play a pivotal role in the diagnosis of IgG4-RD. However, obtaining tissue biopsies from specific organs can be challenging. Moreover, the variation in serum IgG4 levels and the presence of nonspecific radiological findings add to the complexities in diagnosing IgG4-RD. Rigorous clinical-pathological correlation is imperative due to the the disease's diverse clinical manifestations, which can resemble both malignant and inflammatory conditions. Multiple diagnostic criteria have been formulated by various research groups to facilitate a precise diagnosis of IgG4-RD, incorporating imaging, histologic and serologic findings, extrapancreatic involvement, and response to corticosteroid therapy.

In 2019, the American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism (ACR-EULAR) released classification criteria to improve the recognition of IgG4-RD and to distinguish this uncommon condition from disease mimickers. The ACR-EULAR investigators reported excellent specificity of 97.8% and moderately high sensitivity of 82.0% of the classification algorithm when applied to an international validation cohort. Other groups have evaluated the criteria in real-world settings and confirmed its high specificity.

ACR/EULAR has proposed a three-step classification process comprising: (a) clinical, radiological or pathological criteria required to enter the classification algorithm; (b) a set of exclusion criteria eliminating the patient from further IgG4-RD classification; and (c) a set of numerically weighted inclusion criteria that include clinical, serological, radiological, and pathological findings. The patient is classified as IgG4-RD if the cumulative score of these inclusion criteria equals 20 points or more.

C, Immunohistochemical staining for IgG4, which was detected in more than 10 plasma cells per high-power field. -RD is characterized by tumorlike swelling of involved organs, with a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate that is rich in IgG4-positive plasma cells that are organized in a storiform pattern of fibrosis. 1 It is associated with obliterative phlebitis and a mild to moderate eosinophil infiltrate. 1, 4, 5 Most patients with IgG4-RD have an elevated IgG4 serum concentration. The number of IgG4-positive plasma cells per high-power field is regarded as a sufficient criterion; however, this number varies among tissues.

Overall, the minimum number of cells for establishing the diagnosis for most tissues ranges from 30 to 50 IgG4-positive cells per HPF. However, in some organs or tissues, including the kidney, as few as 10 IgG4-positive plasma cells per HPF may be sufficient. Two lumbar punctures were performed 3 days apart. The CSF analysis revealed a normal complete blood cell count, a normal total protein level in the first CSF specimen, and an elevated total protein level in the second specimen. The glucose levels in the 2 CSF specimens were normal, no oligoclonal bands were detected, and the cell subset analysis by fluorescence-activated cell sorting revealed 90% T cells with a normal CD4:CD8 ratio of 7:1. The lymphocytic infiltrates were mainly perivascular, with most being composed of T cells and a few consisting of B cells.

Plasma cells constituted more than 10% of the immune cell population, and most were stained for IgG4. Infectious agents were not detected by periodic acid–Schiff, Ziehl-Neelsen, and immunohistochemical stains to cytomegalovirus and the herpes simplex virus.

### Multivisceral IgG4-related disease presenting as recurrent massive gastrointestinal bleeding: a case report and literature review [^1128yZNz]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

IgG4-RD was first described in patients with sclerosing cholangitis, known as autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) type I. Subsequently, IgG4-RD was found to affect other organs. At present IgG4-RD is believed to be a systemic disease and diagnostic criteria for IgG4-RD include: (1) single or multiple organs with diffuse or localized swelling, masses, nodules and/or hypertrophic lesions; (2) elevated serum IgG4 levels (≥ 135 mg/dL); and (3) histopathologic features that include marked lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltration and fibrosis, with IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltration (IgG4/IgG positive cell ratio of 40% and IgG4-positive plasma cells exceeding 10/HPF). Diagnosis of IgG4-related is confirmed when all of the following are fulfilled: (1), (2) and (3). Diagnosis is likely if criteria (1) + (3) are fulfilled, possible if (1) + (2) are fulfilled and unlikely if only (1) presents.

### The dual role of IgG4 in immunity: bridging pathophysiology and therapeutic applications [^115htVHG]. Gut (2025). Medium credibility.

Future directions

The field of IgG4 research is set to tackle several unanswered questions that could significantly impact our understanding of immune regulation and therapeutic innovation. Among the most intriguing aspects of IgG4 biology is its association with type 2 immune environments. In certain cancers, these environments appear to drive IgG4 class-switching. However, the precise role of type 2 immunity in cancer remains controversial. While type 2 cytokines have been traditionally attributed with pro-tumourigenic effects, emerging evidence suggests that type 2 immunity may also exert antitumour effects under specific conditions. Therefore, type 2 environments in cancer appear highly context-dependent: acute type 2 responses may boost antitumour immunity, whereas chronic environments may promote immune suppression. This dichotomy raises important questions about IgG4's role and why not all cancers exhibit an IgG4 association. A key area for future investigation is the sequence of events leading to IgG4 production in the TME: Does IgG4 primarily arise in chronic type 2 environments, contributing to cancer immunosuppression, or could it also develop in acute, antitumourigenic type 2 settings? Understanding these mechanisms requires detailed studies of cytokine milieus, local immune cell interactions and temporal dynamics, and could ultimately clarify why some cancers are associated with elevated IgG4 levels, while others are not.

Beyond cancer, a broader understanding of IgG4 regulation is essential. Identifying biomarkers predicting IgG4 responses, understanding its dual role in tolerance and pathology, and elucidating the specific environments favouring IgG4 production remain key research challenges. Addressing these gaps will not only advance basic immunology, but also inform the rational design of next-generation IgG4-targeted and IgG4-based therapies. One major limitation in current IgG4 research is the reliance on experimental systems that poorly mimic human IgG4 biology. Rodent IgG subclasses differ significantly from their human counterparts, and existing mouse models involve either genetic IgG4 overexpression or systemic administration of human IgG4, both failing to recapitulate the complexity of human IgG4 responses. Technological advances in genome engineering could enable the development of better humanised mouse models, incorporating human IgG4 and other relevant human immune components, allowing us to investigate IgG4's functional roles in specific contexts in vivo.

### IgG4-related disease: what a hematologist needs to know [^112VDEbx]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

IgG4-RD is an important condition for hematologists to recognize, both because of its common hematologic manifestations of lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, as well as its overlap with other hematologic inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. When IgG4-RD is suspected, measurement of serum IgG subclasses is a simple, non-invasive screening test; levels > 5 g/L (normal < 1.35 g/L) are highly suspicious for IgG4-RD. Regardless of serum IgG4 level, the definitive diagnosis requires histology, preferably in an affected organ other than lymph node or bone marrow, to confirm IgG4-RD and to exclude its many mimics. Early recognition and treatment with steroids, rituximab, or other immunosuppressive therapies, is essential to prevent complications such as fibrosis, periaortitis, and renal failure.

Important mimickers of IgG4-related disease

The diagnostic challenge of IgG4-RD for hematologists is heightened by overlap of clinical and laboratory features with those of a number of other hematologic diseases including lymphoma, plasma cell neoplasms, and histiocyte disorders (Table 2). In addition to the diseases discussed in this section and presented in Table 2, there are numerous non-hematologic mimickers reviewed in detail elsewhere. Careful review of histological specimens and correlation with clinical, laboratory and radiological findings are crucial for solidifying the correct diagnosis. Multicentric Castleman disease and IgG4-RD show considerable overlap given the high frequency of lymphadenopathy, IgG4 + plasma cell-enriched tissue infiltrates and elevated serum IgG4 levels seen in both diseases. However, IgG4-RD typically affects older patients, rarely exhibits the "hyper-interleukin-6" systemic inflammatory features of multicentric Castleman disease such as fever and elevated C-reactive protein, and the histological features are distinct. The histiocytic disorders Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes disease and Erdheim-Chester disease both cause inflammatory mass lesions that can mimic IgG4-RD. Histopathological evaluation of Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes disease can show enrichment of IgG4 + plasma cells, but typically in the context of CD68 + S100 + histiocytes, often associated with emperipolesis. The most recent classification of the histiocyte disorders recommends evaluating suspected cases of Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes disease for increased IgG4 + plasma cells, but in the absence of other evidence for a common pathophysiological link, Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes disease is not considered part of the spectrum of IgG4-RD or vice versa. One third of patients with Erdheim-Chester disease have retroperitoneal fibrosis, which may raise the suspicion of IgG4-RD; however, more than 95% of patients with Erdheim-Chester disease have skeletal involvement, which, aside from rare cases of IgG4-related angiocentric eosinophilic fibrosis (midline destructive lesions of the head and neck), is generally not seen in IgG4-RD. The histology of Erdheim-Chester disease shows a CD68 + S100 − CD1a − histiocyte infiltration often with "foamy histiocytes". Extra-pulmonary sarcoidosis may share clinical features similar to those of IgG4-RD, including polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, lymphadenopathy, pulmonary nodules, sclerosing mesenteritis and pachymeningitis. The association between IgG4-RD and malignant lymphoma has been studied extensively. In Asian patients, mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, particularly of ophthalmological tissues has been described, whereas in western populations a variety of histologies (diffuse large B-cell, follicular, lymphoplasmacytic, and MALT) have been reported. There are also case reports of IgG4-RD concomitant with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome.

### The association of different serum IgG4 levels with distinct clinical characteristics and treatment efficacy in patients with IgG4-related disease [^1123cwU3]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectivse

To explore the clinical characteristics and treatment efficacy of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) patients with different levels of serum IgG4.

Methods

A total of 299 patients newly diagnosed with IgG4-RD were enrolled in this study. Patients were classified into four groups according to baseline serum IgG4 levels: Group A: normal concentration; Group B: > normal but < 2× the upper reference limit (URL); Group C: between 2× and 5× the URL; Group D: > 5× the URL. All patients were followed up for 12 months. The patients' clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, plasmablasts/plasma cells and treatment efficacy were analysed.

Results

IgG4-RD patients with higher serum IgG4 levels had higher percentages of dacryoadenitis, sialadenitis, and autoimmune pancreatitis and a higher prevalence of allergy history, whereas patients with retroperitoneum and mediastinum lesions usually had lower serum IgG4 levels. In addition, the serum IgG4 re-elevation rate in Group D (19.4%) was higher than those in Group B (4.9%) and Group C (7.7%) (p = 0.003 and p = 0.020, respectively). Patients suffered fewer clinical relapses with a serum IgG4 reduction ≥ 50% of baseline serum IgG4 in Group B and ≥ 40% of baseline serum IgG4 in Group D (p = 0.019 and p = 0.043, respectively). In addition, the rate of clinical relapse in patients who received combination therapy with glucocorticoids and mycophenolate mofetil was 18.75% in Group D, which was higher than the rates in Groups B and C (0) (p = 0.027).

Conclusions

IgG4-RD patients with different levels of serum IgG4 exhibit different clinical characteristics and treatment responses.

IgG4-associated cholangitis — diagnostic considerations and treatment signals in PSC include that a subset of patients with PSC have modest elevations of IgG4 levels (> 140 mg/dl); corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are generally used in patients with IgG4 cholangitis, whereas they do not have a role in PSC; measurement of IgG4 levels is reasonable in patients with PSC and consideration should be given to imaging for autoimmune pancreatitis and the presence of IgG4-associated cholangitis among those with markedly elevated IgG4 levels; and liver biopsy should be considered to identify the classical lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate and consideration of immunosuppressive therapy may be useful in such patients, especially if they have higher-than-expected elevations of serum aminotransferase levels.

### IgG4-related diseases of the digestive tract [^112D5rK7]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

IgG4-related conditions affecting the digestive tract are part of a multi-organ fibro-inflammatory disorder termed IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), with autoimmune pancreatitis and IgG4-related cholangitis being the most prominent manifestations. Gastrointestinal symptoms include jaundice, weight loss, abdominal pain, biliary strictures, and pancreatic and hepatic masses that mimic malignant diseases. IgG4-RD manifestations occur less frequently elsewhere in the digestive tract, namely in the oesophagus, retroperitoneum or intestine. Evidence-based European guidelines frame the current state-of-the-art in the diagnosis and management of IgG4-related digestive tract disease. Diagnosis is based on histology (if available), imaging, serology, other organ involvement and response to therapy (HISORt criteria). Few biomarkers beyond serum IgG4 concentrations are reliable. The first-line therapy (glucocorticoids) is swiftly effective but disease flares are common at low doses or after tapering. Second-line therapy might consist of other immunosuppressive drugs such as thiopurines or rituximab. Further trials, for example, of anti-CD19 drugs, are ongoing. Although an association between IgG4-RD and the development of malignancies has been postulated, the true nature of this relationship remains uncertain at this time.

Serum protein studies

Approximately 70% of patients with IgG4-RD have an elevated serum IgG4 level. Serum IgG subclasses should be investigated in conjunction with serum protein electrophoresis to exclude a monoclonal paraprotein (Figure 3). Serum IgG4 level has a diagnostic sensitivity ranging from 83–97% and specificity from 60–85% with a general cut-off of "above the upper limit of normal". – Typically, 1.35 g/L is used as the biomarker cut-off for IgG4-RD (which corresponds to the upper limit of normal for one common commercial method but not another) without specifying the methodology. While mildly elevated serum IgG4 can be seen in many conditions, markedly elevated serum IgG4 (> 5 g/L) is approximately 90% specific for IgG4-RD. Aside from methodological differences, serum IgG4 levels in IgG4-RD can vary greatly depending on ethnicity and degree of organ involvement. In the Boston cohort of patients (76% White), only 53 of 103 patients had elevated serum IgG4 levels. In contrast, in a cohort of 334 Japanese patients, more than 95% had elevated serum IgG4. In our multi-ethnic cohort, we found that Asians have a higher serum IgG4 than non-Asians (median 11.2 g/L versus 2.9 g/L, P = 0.0094), and elevated serum IgG4 had a sensitivity of 96% in Asians compared to 67% in non-Asians. Patients with multi-organ involvement or of Asian ethnicity typically have elevated serum IgG4, sometimes markedly so, such as the patient in this illustrative case. The serum IgG4/IgG ratio is typically > 0.2 in patients with IgG4-RD, although the ratio does not increase the diagnostic specificity of serum IgG4 alone. Flow cytometric detection of plasmablasts may offer a more sensitive modality for diagnosing IgG4-RD, with a reported sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 82% using a cut-off of 900/mL. However, the flow cytometry method used to detect plasmablasts is not widely available.

### Serum immunoglobulin G4 and immunoglobulin G1 for distinguishing immunoglobulin G4-associated cholangitis from primary sclerosing cholangitis [^115MtpDy]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis can be demonstrated on liver needle biopsy and BD biopsy. Affected BDs characteristically show diffuse thickening with transmural sclerosing inflammation composed of a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate and storiform pattern of fibrosis. IgG4 immunostaining of infiltrating plasmacytes may be observed diffusely. However, disease may be patchy and can be missed on a regular biopsy specimen, and histology should never be considered in isolation. The absolute IgG4 plasma count in a specimen cannot be used in isolation and must form part of an assessment considering the clinical picture, histological morphology, and the addition of an immunohistochemical (IHC) IgG4/IgG ratio (suggested at > 40% to define IgG4-RD), as suggested by the consensus statement on the pathology of IgG4-RD. We feel that liver biopsy combined with cross-sectional imaging for other organ manifestations, particularly pancreatic disease, is important diagnostically in a subgroup with PSC and elevated IgG4, particularly because they seem to constitute a high-risk group. Histology is a crucial component to making an accurate diagnosis of IgG4-RD. Furthermore, whereas a biopsy carries a risk of complications in 5:1,000 people, steroids can also cause many serious adverse effects. Therefore, we feel that in patients with sclerosing cholangitis with equivocal results upon IgG spectrum measurement according to the proposed algorithm, liver histology should precede a trial of steroids.

In accord with previous studies, 23% of PSC patients in our study had hypergammaglobulinemia. Hypergammaglobulinemia may include elevation of different IgG subtypes and may mirror continuous nonspecific activation of the immune system. Whether elevated sIgG4 levels, in this context, are a cause or consequence of the severity of PSC remains elusive.

IAC patients showed, on average, an isolated elevation of IgG4, whereas, in PSC patients with an elevated IgG4, IgG1 was generally elevated as well, resulting in a lower IgG4/IgG1 ratio in PSC patients. Elevated sIgG4 levels in PSC have been associated with cirrhosis and a more severe disease course, but contamination of some PSC cohorts with undiagnosed IAC patients cannot be excluded — in one study several of the PSC patients with elevated IgG4 had a clinical profile suggestive of IgG4-RD, such as pancreatic involvement. Notably, cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is associated with elevated sIgG4, especially in association with PSC, and patients can have elevated sIgG4 levels, typically between 1× and 4× ULN. Data analyzing other IgG subclasses in CCA are not available.

### Identification of red flags for IgG4-related disease: an international European reference network for rare connective tissue diseases framework [^1144fsbv]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

IgG4-related disease is a rare fibroinflammatory condition. Prompt recognition is fundamental to initiate treatment and to prevent organ damage. Diagnostic and classification criteria are primarily intended for use by clinicians with established expertise in IgG4-related disease. Absence of disease awareness among primary care physicians and specialists without expertise in IgG4-related disease remains the main cause of diagnostic delay. We aimed to identify red flags that might increase the suspicion of IgG4-related disease in primary and secondary care settings. A task force of experts in IgG4-related disease from the European Reference Network for Rare Connective Tissue Diseases (ERN-ReCONNET), patient representatives, and primary care physicians derived potential red flags for IgG4-related disease through a systematic literature search and a level of agreement exercise. Five red flags reached 100% agreement among experts: swelling in one or more organ system; pancreatic and biliary tree involvement; increased serum IgG4; IgG4 + plasma cell tissue infiltration; and obliterative phlebitis. Red flags for IgG4-related disease are intended for use in primary and secondary care to improve referral to centres of expertise and prompt early diagnosis.

### Distinct features distinguishing IgG4-related disease from multicentric Castleman's disease [^114zcHgY]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study clarified the similarities and differences between IgG4-RD and MCD characteristics demonstrating that the IgG4 levels are not a reliable distinguishing diagnostic feature for the two diseases; however, organ involvement distribution, atopic history and CRP and IgA levels were quite distinctive. The study also demonstrated that differentiation of IgG4-RD and MCD diagnosis based on the combination of those distinctive features was a useful approach.

With growing recognition of IgG4-RD, it has been found that misdiagnosis of IgG4-RD with MCD and vice versa is not so rare, especially in cases lacking the unique symptoms of MCD, such as fever. All our MCD cases measuring serum IgG4 showed IgG4 elevation above the cut-off criterion of the comprehensive diagnostic criteria, resulting in 'possible diagnosis'. Moreover, a study with 9 IgG4-RD cases and 28 MCD cases from Japan reported the difficulty of differentiating between the two diseases by using abundant IgG4+ plasma cell invasion in the organ tissues and serum IgG4 levels. However, the rarity of both diseases has prevented a solid comparison of the distinctive clinical and laboratory features between the two diseases. In the present study, we compared clinical and laboratory features in 45 IgG4-RD cases and 33 MCD cases, and proposed a distinctive combination of features for the two diseases. While pathological findings are the most important factors in the diagnosis of the diseases, tissue specimens of organs involved in IgG4-RD and MCD are sometimes difficult to acquire. We believe that our approach, composed of past atopic history, distribution of organ involvement and laboratory findings, is helpful in daily clinical practice, and that it can help in establishing classification criteria for the two diseases.

### IgG4-related chronic sclerosing dacryoadenitis… [^111Mzn85]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. W. RICHARDGREENMD Recent evidence suggests that Mikulicz disease is distinct from Sjögren syndrome and is an IgG4-related systemic disease. 1 Herein we report 4 cases of Mikulicz disease in which the serum IgG4 concentrations were elevated and infiltration of IgG4-stained plasma cells with sclerosing fibrosis was pathologically observed in the lacrimal gland. In all of the patients, the serum IgG4 concentration and the ratio of IgG4 to IgG were elevated. All of the patients underwent partial resection of the mass including the lacrimal gland. Based on these findings, we diagnosed these cases as chronic sclerosing dacryoadenitis, consistent with Mikulicz disease related to IgG4. No patients manifested evidence for IgG4-related sclerosing disease in other organs except salivary glands.

Oral prednisolone was administered to all but patient 2, who required the control of diabetes mellitus and had no further symptoms with the residual lacrimal glands. The serum level of IgG4 is elevated in patients with Mikulicz disease and prominent infiltration of IgG4-stained plasmacytes is observed pathologically, which are features not seen in Sjögren syndrome. 1 Moreover, it has been proposed that Mikulicz disease belongs to the clinical entity IgG4. -plasmacytic endocrinopathy, which includes IgG4-related sclerosing diseases such as autoimmune pancreatitis, sclerosing cholangitis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, and chronic sclerosing sialadenitis. 4, 5 These diseases are characterized by histopathological features that include dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration intermixed with fibrosis, obliterative phlebitis, and prominent infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells.

In conclusion, the 4 cases of Mikulicz disease reported here had chronic sclerosing inflammation of the lacrimal gland with IgG4-stained plasma cell infiltration. These findings support the theory that Mikulicz disease is within the clinical spectrum of IgG4-related sclerosing diseases.

### The changing faces of IgG4-related disease: clinical manifestations and pathogenesis [^115cdgeS]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Since the earliest reports in 2001, immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related disease has been defined as an autoimmune systemic disease characterized by the lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of affected tissues leading to fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis along with elevated serum IgG4 levels. Prior to this unifying hypothesis, a plethora of clinical manifestations were considered as separate entities despite the similar laboratory profile. The pathology can be observed in virtually all organs and may thus be a challenging diagnosis, especially when the adequate clinical suspicion is not present or when obtaining a tissue biopsy is not feasible. Nonetheless, the most frequently involved organs are the pancreas and exocrine glands but these may be spared. Immunosuppressants lead to a prompt clinical response in virtually all cases and prevent histological sequelae and, as a consequence, an early differential diagnosis from other conditions, particularly infections and cancer, as well as an early treatment should be pursued. We describe herein two cases in which atypical disease manifestations were observed, i.e., one with recurrent neck lymph node enlargement and proptosis, and one with jaundice. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of IgG4-related disease is largely incomplete but data support a significant role for Th2 cytokines with the contribution of innate immunity factors such as Toll-like receptors, macrophages and basophils. Further, macrophages activated by IL4 overexpress B cell activating factors and contribute to chronic inflammation and the development of fibrosis. We cannot rule out the possibility that the largely variable disease phenotypes reflect different pathogenetic mechanisms and the tissue microenvironment may then contribute to the organ involvement.

### An update on IgG4-related disease [^113HRfNo]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a recently described fibroinflammatory condition that can affect nearly any organ. Our knowledge of this condition — its manifestations, diagnosis, pathogenesis and treatment — is expanding rapidly.

Recent Findings

This review highlights the most recent developments in the field. Particular highlights include new manifestations of the disease, studies on the test characteristics of serum IgG4 concentrations in the diagnosis of IgG4-RD, descriptions of the lack of specificity of IgG4+ plasma cells in histopathological samples and preliminary research on unique B and T lymphocyte populations in the disease.

Summary

Future studies might focus on identifying biomarkers to assist with noninvasive diagnosis of IgG4-RD and conducting trials of novel treatments that might supplant glucocorticoids as the treatment of choice.

### The histological diagnosis of IgG4-related disease on small biopsies: challenges and pitfalls [^11525B4m]. Histopathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

The pathological diagnosis of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) relies on histology, IgG4-positive cells, and an increased IgG4/IgG ratio. Small biopsies from patients with a presumptive diagnosis of IgG4-RD often fail to meet consensus histological criteria. The aims of this study were to evaluate consecutive small biopsies from patients with a presumptive diagnosis of IgG4-RD, and to assess the significance of the pathological findings.

Methods and Results

We evaluated 55 small biopsies from patients with a presumptive diagnosis of IgG4-RD. The retrospective cohort comprised 71 patients with IgG4-RD and 57 mimics. We performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in-situ hybridisation (ISH) for IgG4 and IgG. Twenty-six patients from the prospective cohort met the histological criteria for IgG4-RD (definite); 29 patients lacked one or more pathological features (borderline). Twenty biopsies (36%) lacked both storiform fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis, and nine (16%) lacked an increase in the number of IgG4-positive plasma cells. Ninety-three per cent of patients showed an IgG4/total IgG ratio of > 40% (> 30% by ISH). There were no differences in the incidence of multiorgan disease (P = 0.9), serum IgG4 levels (P = 0.6) and response to therapy between the definite and borderline groups. A strong correlation (Pearson 0.77) between the IHC and ISH platforms was noted with regard to the IgG4/total IgG ratio.

Conclusion

Patients with a presumptive diagnosis of IgG4-RD but lacking the characteristic pathological features of this disease appear to be clinically similar to those who meet the current pathological criteria. An elevated IgG4/total IgG ratio is the most sensitive pathological feature, and ISH provides a robust quantification platform. We recommend evaluating tumefactive lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates with an increased IgG4/IgG ratio, regardless of histological features, for IgG4-RD.

### IgG4-related diseases: state of the art on clinical practice guidelines [^112Puv6r]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Immunoglobulin G4-related diseases (IgG4-RD) are a group of chronic relapsing–remitting inflammatory conditions, characterised by tissue infiltration with lymphocytes and IgG4-secreting plasma cells, fibrosis and a usually favourable response to steroids.

In this narrative review, we summarise the results of a systematic literature research, which was performed as part of the European Reference Network ReCONNET, aimed at evaluating existing clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and recommendations in IgG4-RD. From 167 publications initially obtained from a systematic literature search, only one was identified as a systematic multispecialist, evidence-based, consensus guidance statement on diagnosis and treatment of IgG4-RD, which may be recommended for use as CPG in IgG4-RD.

With the recognition of a limited evidence based in this increasingly recognised disease, the group discussion has identified the following unmet needs: lack of shared classification criteria, absence of formal guidelines on diagnosis, no evidence-based therapeutic recommendations and lack of activity and damage indices. Areas of unmet needs include the difficulties in diagnosis, management and monitoring and the scarcity of expert centres.

State of the art on CPGs

Identification of existing CPGs

The systematic literature search initially identified a total of 165 citations by the ERN ReCONNET central team (figure 1). After performing title and abstract evaluation by disease representatives, eight papers were selected for further review. After full-text review by the disease coordinators, four CPGs were finally selected for further evaluation using full-text assessment, which were subsequently endorsed by the disease representatives.

Figure 1
Stepwise search strategy for selection and evaluation of published clinical practice guidelines for IgG4-RD.

CPG characteristics

The general characteristics of the four CPGs are summarised in table 1. Of the four preselected publications, only one was identified as a systematic multispecialist, evidence-based, consensus guidance statement on diagnosis and treatment of IgG4-RD, which may be recommended for use as CPG. This publication was an International Consensus Guidance Statement on the management and treatment of IgG4-RD, resulting from an expert panel of 42 IgG4-RD experts from eight medical specialties (18 gastroenterologists, 13 rheumatologists and 11 other specialists and subspecialists). Although these guidelines are relevant for clinical practice, the evidence level reported in the paper varies between IIb and IV, given the lack of solid and endorsed classification criteria and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in this field. As a result, there was broad consensus that

Table 1
Summary of the evaluation of existing guidelines

The most accurate assessment of IgG4-RD is based on a full clinical history, physical examination, selected laboratory investigations and appropriate radiology studies.
Diagnostic confirmation by biopsy is strongly recommended for the exclusion of malignancies and other IgG4-RD mimics.
All patients with symptomatic, active IgG4-RD and a subset of patients with asymptomatic disease require treatment, some urgently.
Glucocorticoids are the first-line agent for remission induction unless contraindications are present.
Some but not all patients require the combination of glucocorticoids and a steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agent from the start of treatment.
Following a successful course of induction therapy, certain patients benefit from maintenance therapy.
Re-treatment with glucocorticoids is indicated in patients who relapse off of treatment following successful remission induction. Following relapse, the introduction of a steroid-sparing agent for continuation in the remission maintenance period should be considered.

The remaining three selected GPGs were only reviews or consensus statements on existing data for terminology, pathology and immunopathology of IgG4-RD. They lack accepted methods for systematic review and represent rather expert consensus than real guidelines or recommendation with suboptimal clinical practice use, which may not be recommended as a guideline for use (table 1).

All patients with suspected euthyroid Graves' orbitopathy in whom TSH receptor autoantibodies are not present have to be evaluated for IgG4-related orbitopathy. Once IgG4-related orbitopathy is proven, other manifestations of IgG4-rd have to be searched for; lifelong follow up is required. Immunoglobulin G4-related disease is an increasingly recognized syndrome of unknown etiology. IgG4-rd could affect many organs and tumor-like swelling of the involved organs is common. Several of the manifestations typically occur in the same patient. The diagnosis of IgG4-rd is based upon biopsy findings (IgG4 positive lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and tissue fibrosis). Serum IgG4 level should be measured, and isolated elevated levels support the diagnosis, although it is not fully diagnostic without histological examination. Due to various manifestations of this new entity, a multidisciplinary approach is warranted.

### Radiology domain in the diagnosis of IgG4-RD according to the 2019 American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism classification [^116bx5RA]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

The 2019 ACR-EULAR classification criteria allow patients to be classified accurately even without biopsy or elevated serum IgG4 level, potentially overcoming some of the diagnostic challenges encountered in routine clinical practice. As there is no single defining feature of IgG4-RD, accurate classification integrates evidence across clinical, serological, histopathological, and radiology domains. Of note, radiology findings account for 5 out of 8 scoring domains in the 2019 ACR-EULAR classification criteria. Ren et al. have provided a review on imaging interpretation per classification criteria in clinical practice but, to our knowledge, there has yet to be published studies evaluating the diagnostic performance of the radiology domain.

We sought to investigate the diagnostic performance of radiology inclusion criteria proposed by ACR-EULAR in a real-world cohort of patients referred to our tertiary care centre with a suspected diagnosis of IgG4-RD.

### Pancreaticobiliary versus head and neck presentation of immunoglobulin G4-related disease: different sides of the same coin? [^116sJp84]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Although a studyreported an association between atopic phenotypes and HN manifestation of IgG4 -RD, our study did not show any differences in the prevalence of a history of atopy. Nevertheless, the eosinophil count was elevated in 21.7% of the PB group and 35.7% of the HN group. In both groups, more than half of those with elevated eosinophil counts did not have a clear history of atopy similar to a previous study, suggesting peripheral blood eosinophilia might reflect processes inherent to the disease itself rather than an association with atopy.

Serum IgG4 levels can be a helpful marker and have been included in many IgG4 RD diagnostic criteriaalthough it is not specific in the diagnosis of IgG4-RD. Previous studiesreported higher concentrations of serum IgG4 in the HN presentations compared with other presentations although this has not been the case in the present study as higher serum levels of IgG4 were seen in the PB group compared with the HN group. This was seen when comparing the degree of IgG4 elevation as multiples of the ULN. Mohapatra et al reported similar results although it was not statistically significant in their study group. The higher levels of serum IgG4 might be related to the number of organs involved with the disease.and this is supported by the fact that 68% of the patients in the PB group had more than one organ involvement compared with only 33% in the HN group. An analysis of two cross-sectional studiessuggested that there might be an association between higher IgG4 concentrations and more extensive disease and in those advanced imaging should be considered.

### Elevated IgG4 serum levels among primary Sjögren's syndrome patients: do they unmask underlying IgG4-related disease? [^1171sk3x]. Arthritis Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine IgG4 levels in a cohort of consecutive patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS) and other autoimmune diseases and explore whether they associate with distinct clinical, serologic, and histopathologic features.

Methods

Serum IgG4 levels were measured in 133 primary SS patients and 49 healthy donors (HDs). Seventy-four lupus and 54 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients served as disease controls. Immunohistochemical IgG4 analysis was performed in paraffin-embedded minor salivary gland (MSG) tissues.

Results

Raised IgG4 serum levels (> 135 mg/dl) were detected in 10 (7.5%) of 133 primary SS patients (high-IgG4 group), in 8 (10.8%) of 74 lupus patients, in 7 (12.9%) of 54 RA patients, and in 1 (2%) of 49 HDs. Compared to the normal-IgG4 (< 135 mg/dl) primary SS group, high-IgG4 patients exhibited increased prevalence of IgG4-related features (autoimmune cholangitis, autoimmune pancreatitis, and interstitial nephritis), lower rates of antinuclear antibody positivity, and higher IgG2 and IgE levels. Positive staining for IgG4+ plasma cells with an IgG4:IgG ratio ≥ 40% was detected in 3 of 6 available MSG tissues in the high-IgG4 group. Criteria of possible or definite IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) were fulfilled by 10 (7.5%) of 133 of our primary SS cohort.

Conclusion

Raised IgG4 serum levels were detected in 7.5% of primary SS patients in association with IgG4RD-reminiscent clinical, serologic, and histopathologic features. Whether this high-IgG4 primary SS group represents a misclassified IgG4-RD group or a distinct primary SS subtype remains to be further explored in future studies.

### IgG4-related disease with emphasis on its gastrointestinal manifestation [^114n8RwA]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

IgG4-related disease is an immune-mediated fibroinflammatory condition with a diverse spectrum of organ involvement, commonly in the pancreas and bile ducts among other organs such as salivary and lacrimal glands. Classic histopathologic findings are the gold standard for confirmation of diagnosis, although diagnosis remains challenging, as biomarkers to date are neither sufficient nor necessary. Glucocorticoids are the most effective initial treatment, generally having a dramatic response, although limited clinical evidence exists regarding effective maintenance therapy. This review summarizes key GI manifestations of this condition for the practicing gastroenterologist and addresses the pathology, disease mechanism, and current therapeutic recommendations.

### IgG4-related disease and other fibro-inflammatory conditions [^113wo7n4]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a fibro-inflammatory disorder usually characterized by multi-organ involvement. Its pathogenesis is complex and involves genetic and environmental factors, while immune responses usually mediate organ damage and promote fibrosis, which is a key feature of the disease. IgG4 responses, however, are not exclusive to IgG4-RD and can be encountered in other diseases with phenotypes that partially overlap that of IgG4-RD. Although IgG4-RD has clinical and histological hallmarks, the lack of validated diagnostic criteria often makes the diagnosis challenging, requiring a multi-dimensional approach that integrates clinical, radiological and serological data. The present Review covers recent advances in the understanding of disease drivers and its clinical phenotypes, mainly focusing on the differential diagnosis with potential IgG4-RD mimickers, namely histiocytoses, lymphoproliferative disorders, systemic vasculitides and other immune-mediated conditions. The Review also provides a schematic approach to IgG4-RD treatment, including a brief overview of glucocorticoid-sparing agents and emerging therapies, from B cell-depleting monoclonal antibodies to cytokine-targeting drugs, the majority of which are currently under investigation in randomized clinical trials.

### IgG4-related disease as a rare cause of gastric outlet obstruction: a case report and literature review [^116Medwm]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Serum IgG4 levels were initially thought to be a key diagnostic feature of IgG4-RD, but recent evidence has de-emphasized the value of elevated serum IgG4 levels. The key to diagnosis is immunohistochemical demonstration of tissue infiltration by IgG4-bearing plasma cells with morphological evidence of lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, storiform fibrosis, and obliterative phlebitis. Higher serum IgG4 levels might be helpful in diagnosis of IgG4-RD, however, a low positive predictive value has been reported. Many other conditions can lead to serum IgG4 elevation. In addition, a completely normal level of IgG4 does not exclude a diagnosis of related disease, although a higher level increases the diagnostic yield.

IgG4 disease-like features can be found adjacent to malignant tumors. Therefore, a biopsy diagnosis of IgG4 related disease cannot rule out malignancy entirely. However, in cases presenting with mass lesions albeit with biopsy results showing increased IgG4 plasma cells and fibrosis, present a clinical dilemma. The question remains if one should treat it as IgG4-related disease or repeat biopsy or proceed with surgery. The pathogenesis of IgG4-related disease is still vague and immature. There are two prevailing theories underlying observed pathology. One is the induction of a polarized CD4 + T cell that activates innate immune cells responsible for the development of fibrosis. The other hypothesis is a negative feedback process involving generation of IgG4 secreting plasmablasts, plasma cells, and IgG4 antibodies to prevent autoimmune response. Autoimmunity has been hypothesized to be a potential initial immunologic stimulus for the Th2-cell response in IgG4 related disease. Therefore, in patients with autoimmune conditions presented with biopsy negative mass lesion, IgG4 -related disease should always be included in the differential diagnosis.

Our case presented with gastric outlet obstruction, an extremely rare complication of IgG4-RD. To our knowledge, there are 10 reported case in the literature to present with gastrointestinal luminal obstruction. Among the 10 cases yielded in our literature search, intestinal obstruction was secondary to sclerosing mesenteritis in 3 cases. Obstruction secondary to intestinal IgG4- RD was reported 5 times in the literature; 1 involving the colon, 2 in the small bowel, and 2 involving both the large and small intestine, including the ileocecal valve, one of which involved the appendix as well. Among these 10 cases, there is only one case of gastric outlet obstruction as a complication of IgG4-RD. However, this was secondary to pancreatitis, not from direct involvement of stomach. Therefore, our case is the first one to report as isolated gastric/duodenal IgG4-RD resulted in gastric outlet obstruction.

### Increases in IgE, eosinophils, and mast cells can be used in diagnosis and to predict relapse of IgG4-related disease [^114Yts7h]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

IgG subclass 4–related disease (IgG4-RD) is characterized by increased serum levels of IgG4 and infiltration of biliary, pancreatic, and other tissues by IgG4-positive plasma cells. We assessed the prevalence of allergy and/or atopy, serum, and tissue IgE antibodies, and blood and tissue eosinophils in patients with IgG4-RD. We investigated the association between serum IgE and diagnosis and relapse of this disease.

Methods

We performed a prospective study of 48 patients with IgG4-RD, 42 patients with an increased serum level of IgG4 with other inflammatory and autoimmune conditions (disease control subjects), and 51 healthy individuals (healthy control subjects) recruited from Oxford, United Kingdom from March 2010 through March 2014, and followed for a median of 41 months (range, 3–73 months). Serum levels of immunoglobulin were measured at diagnosis, during steroid treatment, and at disease relapse for patients with IgG4-RD; levels at diagnosis were compared with baseline levels of control subjects. Allergen-specific IgEs were measured using the IgE ImmunoCAP. Levels and distribution of IgG4 and IgE antibodies in lymphoid, biliary, and pancreatic tissues from patients with IgG4-RD and disease control subjects were measured by immunohistochemistry. We analyzed data using the Spearman rank correlation and receiver operating characteristic curves.

Results

Serum levels of IgG4 increased to 1.4 g/L or more, and IgE increased to 125 kIU/L or more, in 81% and 54% of patients with IgG4-RD, respectively, compared with 6% and 16% of healthy control subjects (P < .0001). Peripheral blood eosinophilia was detected in 38% of patients with IgG4-RD versus 9% of healthy control subjects (P = 0.004). Of patients with IgG4-RD, 63% had a history of allergy and 40% had a history of atopy with an IgE-specific response; these values were 60% and 53% in patients with increased serum levels of IgE (P < .05). Level of IgE at diagnosis > 480 kIU/L distinguished patients with IgG4-RD from disease control subjects with 86% specificity, 36% sensitivity, and a likelihood ratio of 3.2. Level of IgE at diagnosis > 380 kIU/L identified patients with disease relapse with 88% specificity, 64% sensitivity, and a likelihood ratio of 5.4. IgE-positive mast cells and eosinophilia were observed in lymphoid, biliary, and pancreatic tissue samples from 50% and 86% of patients with IgG4-RD, respectively.

Conclusions

In a prospective study, we associated IgG4-RD with allergy, atopy, eosinophilia, increased serum levels of IgE, and IgE-positive mast cells in lymphoid, biliary, and pancreatic tissue. An IgE-mediated allergic response therefore seems to develop in most patients with IgG4-RD; levels of IgE might be used in diagnosis and predicting relapse.

### IgG4-related disease: retrospective analysis of one hundred sixty-six patients [^1115bxz2]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate clinical and pathologic aspects of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) in non-Asian populations.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of the medical records of patients with IgG4-RD who presented to an academic medical center from January 1994 to September 2012.

Results

Among 166 patients identified, the median age at diagnosis was 61 years (interquartile range [IQR] 49–70 years), 75% were male, and 80% were white. The median number of organs involved was 2 (IQR 2–3). When organs were grouped according to anatomic system, the hepatopancreaticobiliary system was most commonly involved (77%). The median highest serum IgG4 level during the clinical course was 215 mg/dl (IQR 122–466). Forty-three patients (26%) had a normal serum IgG4 level. Seventy-nine pathology specimens were available for immunostaining. The median number of IgG4+ cells was 37 (IQR 25–82) per high-power field, with an IgG4+:IgG+ ratio of 0.50 (IQR 0.32–0.68). Among 151 patients who received medical therapy, 72 (48%) received steroid-sparing agents because of relapse, recurrence, or corticosteroid intolerance. Of the 66 patients who were newly diagnosed, started on corticosteroid monotherapy as the initial treatment, and followed up at our institution, 30 (45%) experienced relapse or recurrence despite an initial favorable response. The number of organs involved had a significant impact on time to relapse or recurrence, with a hazard ratio of 1.48 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.12–1.93) (P < 0.01) in multivariate analysis. The standardized incidence ratio of malignancy was 4.5 (95% CI 1.5–7.5).

Conclusion

IgG4-RD is a multisystem disorder that commonly affects older men and has a propensity for relapse, recurrence, and malignancy.

2 Conclusion

While significant strides have been made in the diagnosis, treatment and general understanding of IgG4‐RD, this review underscores the profound molecular complexity and remaining challenges in disease management. Despite progress in identifying key immune cell populations and the development of targeted therapies, the precise aetiology, heterogeneous clinical presentations and detailed pathogenic mechanisms of IgG4‐RD require further in‐depth investigation. Ultimately, gaining a deeper understanding of IgG4‐RD pathophysiology will be essential to developing more effective and personalised therapeutic strategies, thereby significantly improving patient outcomes and reducing the substantial burden of this increasingly recognised fibroinflammatory disorder.

### What is IgG4? A review of the biology of a unique immunoglobulin subtype [^11665VMq]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent descriptions of the group of clinical disorders collectively defined as IgG4-related systemic disease (IgG4-RSD) have prompted this review of the unique biology of the IgG4 antibody. This article will discuss IgG4 structure and function, the unique phenomenon of half-antibody exchange, and the implications of IgG4 biology for its proposed role in immunologic diseases.

Recent Findings

IgG4 antibodies have unique structural and functional properties and undergo 'half-antibody exchange' in vivo, resulting in recombined antibodies composed of two different binding specificities. The production of IgG4 antibodies appears to be driven in part by T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines that mediate allergic responses and IgE production. Although serum IgG4 levels in healthy individuals vary significantly, data from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients suggest tight regulation of individual IgG4 levels over time. IgG4-RSD represents a diverse group of clinical disorders unified by elevated IgG4 levels and specific histopathologic findings. A key unanswered question is whether IgG4, a relatively weak activator of effector cells, is pathogenic in these disorders.

Summary

IgG4 is a unique antibody biologically and structurally. Increased understanding of its precise role in the clinical syndromes that comprise IgG4-RSD may ultimately elucidate the underlying pathogenesis.

Therapy is not evidence based

Although IgG4-RD frequently represents an indolent condition, treatment is usually required to reduce chronic inflammation and to prevent progressive tissue fibrosis. Furthermore, untreated IgG4-RD with elevated inflammatory markers may lead to secondary AA amyloidosis. Therefore, symptoms and risk of irreversible organ damage due to fibrosis and also modulation of the underlying chronic inflammatory condition should be taken into account for treatment decisions. Single-centre observations suggest favourable responses to glucocorticoids, which are regarded as first-line therapy, but relapses are frequently observed during steroid tapering. Disease-modifying drugs (DMARDs) have proven efficacy in some cases, but large RCTs investigating the outcome of various DMARDs are lacking. A recent nationwide retrospective study showed that rituximab is effective for both induction therapy and relapse treatment in IgG4-RD. Hence, RCTs are urgently required in the field, but difficult to conduct given the rarity and heterogeneity of the disease. Alternatively, evidence from non-randomised or uncontrolled studies may also be used for further developments. In addition, validated tools for treatment response are lacking and no treat-to-target criteria are available. Recently, an IgG4-RD responder indexhas been developed and an international validation study is ongoing. To date, this index is the only available instrument to assess IgG4-RD and its use needs to be encouraged in clinical practice.

Patient unmet needs

IgG4-RD represents a relatively new disease entity and awareness of the disease among healthcare providers is still inadequate and limited to few disease experts. Subsequently, the lag time from symptom onset to diagnosis is still unacceptably high and may be associated with accrual of irreversible organ damage before specific treatments are provided.

Each patient is different in relation to their symptoms as well as the approach of their care. Most care is also not evidence based, which may be an additional burden for the patient as some healthcare systems only support evidence-based care. Therefore, patients with IgG4-RD require special attention, especially with respect to interdisciplinary dialogue with treating physicians, individual support from patient representatives as well as guidance to address the psychosocial impact of the disease.

Centres of expertise for IgG4-RD are currently limited and not easy to identify by patients. In addition, the patient support system is still insufficient, as there are almost no disease-specific patient organisations established at the moment on national and international level.

In conclusion, much effort is needed at multiple levels to meet the specific demands of patients suffering from IgG4-RD in providing optimised patient care, which may hopefully be accomplished in the framework of the ERN ReCONNET.

### IgG4-related disease: can non-classical histopathological features or the examination of clinically uninvolved tissues be helpful in the diagnosis? [^117ChrcY]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is an increasingly recognised inflammatory and fibrosing condition that commonly shows multisystem involvement. The disease may mimic malignancy and other inflammatory or immune-mediated disorders, but usually has a good response to corticosteroid therapy, underlining the requirement for recognition of the condition. Accurate diagnosis requires careful interpretation of varying combinations of serum IgG4 levels, radiological features and characteristic histopathological appearances within an appropriate clinical setting. The presence of 'classical' histopathological features together with an elevated tissue IgG4+ plasma cell count and IgG4 to IgG ratio is often diagnostic and at the very least can strongly support a clinicopathological diagnosis of IgG4-RD. The authors describe the most recent diagnostic criteria for IgG4-RD, especially the histopathological features. The authors then discuss the merits of examining tissues that may be more easily obtainable than those that commonly show the 'classical' histopathological features, but within which not all of these 'diagnostic' features may be present. The authors conclude that while a combination of 'classical' histopathological features and an elevated tissue IgG4+ plasma cell count is the gold standard for diagnosis, examination of tissues that show some but not all of these features can, in the appropriate context, provide useful supporting evidence for a clinicopathological diagnosis of IgG4-RD.

### IgG4-related disease [^113d1Juy]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on IgG4-related diseases:

- **Definition**: IgG4-related diseases are a group of immune-mediated conditions characterized by an inflammatory reaction rich in IgG4-positive plasma cells and can affect almost any organ system.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of IgG4-related diseases is not fully understood. It involves a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate and storiform fibrosis, with a high percentage of plasma cells within lesions staining positively for IgG4.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of IgG4-related diseases in the US is estimated to be around 0.78–1.39 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for IgG4-related diseases are not well defined. However, it has been observed that the disease is more common in middle-aged to elderly individuals and appears to have a slight male predominance.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of IgG4-related diseases is variable and can involve almost every organ system. Common manifestations include Type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis, IgG4-related ophthalmic disease, IgG4-related sialadenitis, and IgG4-related kidney disease, among others.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of IgG4-related diseases is generally favorable with treatment, but the disease can be chronic and may lead to irreversible organ damage if not promptly treated.

### Idiopathic multicentric castleman disease and associated autoimmune and autoinflammatory conditions: practical guidance for diagnosis [^1178vcJi]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

IgG4-related disease

Another differential diagnosis of iMCD, especially of the plasma cell type, is IgG4-RD, which is a systemic inflammatory disorder characterized by sclerosing inflammation rich in IgG4-expressing plasma cells. This disease frequently affects the pancreas, salivary glands and lymph nodes, but it can involve almost any tissue. Misdiagnosis may be due to the fact that iMCD patients may have an elevated serum IgG4 level, while some cases of IgG4-RD may show Castleman-like histopathology. Besides, both conditions present with systemic lymphadenopathy with extranodal involvement, and affected organs may overlap between the two conditions.

In general, patients with IgG4-RD tend to be older than patients with iMCD. Clinically, findings suggestive of iMCD are the presence of fever, high CRP, IL-6 and IgA levels and the absence of orbital, salivary gland and pancreatic involvement. Atopic manifestations history is observed in almost 70% of the IgG4-RD cases but in < 30% of patients with iMCD. Serum IgG4 levels or absolute number of IgG4-positive cells in tissue are not useful for differentiating between the two conditions; the serum IgG4/IgG ratio and the ratio of IgG4/IgG-positive cells in tissue are more reliable differentiators.

Histologically, both conditions may be rich in plasma cells, but the plasma cells are often arranged in sheets in iMCD, whereas in IG4-RD are more commonly mixed with lymphocytes.

The diagnosis of IgG4-RD is based on the combined presence of the characteristic histopathological features and increased numbers of IgG4+ plasma cells demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. The critical histopathological features are a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, a storiform pattern of fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis. In addition, circulating plasmablasts/plasma cells expressing CD19 + CD24 − CD38 hi phenotypic markers are significantly elevated in IgG4-RD. This cell population might be a potentially useful biomarker for IgG4-RD diagnosis in the future.

On the other hand, exclusion criteria for IgG4‐RD have been proposed and include clinical findings (continuously elevated serum level of CRP, elevated serum level of IgA and elevated serum level of IgM) and pathological findings (sheet‐like proliferation pattern of mature plasma cells, high degree of haemosiderin deposition and neutrophilic infiltration).

A summary of the main differences between IgG4-RD and iMCD is shown in Table 4.

Results

Prevalence of Serum IgG Subclass 4 and IgE Elevation

The serum IgG, IgG1, IgG4, and IgE levels at diagnosis were higher in IgG4-RD patients than in HC (P < .0001), as shown in Table 1 (Supplementary Figure 1 A and B). There was no difference in the IgE/IgG4 ratio between the 2 groups (Supplementary Figure 1 C). Elevated IgG4 concentrations were demonstrated in 81% (39 of 48), and elevated IgE in 54% (26 of 48) of the cases, both more prevalent compared with HC (P < .0001) (Table 1). There was a positive correlation between serum IgE and IgG4 (Spearman rank, 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.18–0.66; p = 0.001) (Figure 1 A), and serum IgE and IgG (Spearman rank, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.028–0.56; p = 0.028) (Supplementary Figure 2 A). However, there was no difference between serum IgE levels in IgG4-RD patients with a normal and high IgG level (P = 0.178) (Supplementary Figure 2 B). Serum IgE levels were increased in the high IgG4 compared with normal IgG4 group (P = 0.017) (Figure 1 B). In the 9 IgG4-RD patients with a normal serum IgG4 at diagnosis, only 1 had an elevated IgE.

### Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia: assessment, clinical interpretation, and management [^117V5GLa]. The Lancet: Haematology (2021). High credibility.

This Review outlines a practical approach to assessing and managing polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia in adults. Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia is most commonly caused by liver disease, immune dysregulation, or inflammation, but can also provide an important diagnostic clue of rare diseases such as histiocyte disorders, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, Castleman disease, and IgG4-related disease. Causes of polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia can be divided into eight categories: liver disease, autoimmune disease and vasculitis, infection and inflammation, non-haematological malignancy, haematological disorders, IgG4-related disease, immunodeficiency syndromes, and iatrogenic (from immunoglobulin therapy). Measuring serum concentrations of C-reactive protein and IgG subclasses are helpful in diagnosis. IL-6-mediated inflammation, associated with persistently elevated C-reactive protein concentrations (≥ 30 mg/L), is an important driver of polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia in some cases. Although the presence of markedly elevated serum IgG4 concentrations (> 5 g/L) is around 90% specific for diagnosing IgG4-related disease, mildly elevated serum IgG4 concentrations are seen in many conditions. In most cases, managing polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia simply involves treating the underlying condition. Rarely, however, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia can lead to hyperviscosity, requiring plasmapheresis.

### Elevated serum IgG4 levels in diagnosis, treatment response, organ involvement, and relapse in a prospective IgG4-related disease UK cohort [^113ivodx]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Elevated serum immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) levels have been associated with autoimmune pancreatitis and IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) for over a decade. However, an elevated serum IgG4 is not specific for the disease. There have been inconsistent reports of its use in diagnosis, as a marker of disease relapse, and its relationship to organ involvement in retrospective cohorts. The aims of this study were to ascertain conditions that are associated with an elevated serum IgG4 and to investigate the role of IgG4 in diagnosis, relapse, and organ involvement in a prospective cohort of patients with IgG4-RD.

Methods

We evaluated serum IgG4 measurements in the Oxford Immunology Laboratory over 6 years. Patients in whom serum IgG4 was requested to differentiate IgG4-RD from other diseases were recruited into a longitudinal follow-up study to determine final diagnosis. In a prospective cohort of IgG4-RD patients, organ involvement, response to therapy, and disease relapse were determined.

Results

Two thousand and sixty-seven samples from 1,510 patients had serum IgG4 measured. Of these, IgG4 was elevated (≥ 1.4gl⁻¹) in 243 (16.1%) patients. The main indication (85.6%) was to distinguish between IgG4-RD and non-IgG4-RD conditions. Only 5.1% of patients who had serum IgG4 measured for this purpose had a final diagnosis of IgG4-RD. Of those with an elevated serum IgG4, 22.4% met IgG4-RD diagnostic criteria. Serum IgG4 was elevated in 48 (82.8%) of IgG4-RD patients. An IgG4 cutoff of 1.4gl⁻¹ gave a sensitivity of 82.8% and specificity of 84.7% to diagnose IgG4-RD. Increasing this to 2.8gl⁻¹ increased specificity to 96.2% and negative predictive value to 97.7%, with a lower sensitivity of 56.9% and positive predictive value of 44.5%. Serum IgG4 levels fell with corticosteroid therapy, but this was not disease-specific. A serum IgG4 of ≥ 2.8gl⁻¹ at diagnosis was associated with multi-organ involvement and risk of relapse.

Conclusions

Serum IgG4 levels are elevated in multiple non-IgG4-RD inflammatory and malignant conditions, with less than one-quarter of those with an elevated IgG4 meeting IgG4-RD diagnostic criteria. A serum IgG4 of ≥ 2.8gl(-1) is useful in distinguishing between IgG4-RD and non-IgG4-RD diagnoses, predicting multiple-organ involvement and risk of relapse in IgG4-RD.

In conclusion, while COPD and IgG4-RD patients may present with similar symptoms, such as cough, dyspnea, and wheezing, their underlying mechanisms differ significantly. COPD is primarily caused by chronic airway inflammation and irreversible lung damage, whereas IgG4-RD involves immune-mediated fibroinflammatory processes that can mimic COPD symptoms. This case highlights the importance of advanced diagnostic techniques, including imaging studies and serum IgG4 levels, in differentiating IgG4-RD from more common pulmonary diseases such as COPD. Elevated IgG4 levels and characteristic histopathological findings are crucial for confirming the diagnosis; however, challenges such as limitations in biopsy sampling, particularly in patients with fibrosis and minimal inflammation, can complicate accurate diagnosis.

### IgG4-related disease: an update on pathophysiology and implications for clinical care [^115jupqq]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) has only existed as a unique disease entity since 2003, yet remarkable progress has already been achieved in describing the essential features of the disease. A framework for systematic clinical studies has been created by the development of a quantitative disease activity tool (the IgG4-RD Responder Index) and the validation of classification criteria, both of which were the products of international, multi-centre investigations. In addition, substantial strides have been made in understanding the pathophysiology of IgG4-RD. In particular, the central role of B cells in the disease has been demonstrated by both the robust clinical responsiveness of IgG4-RD to B cell depletion and by the identification of multiple self-antigens that promote B cell expansion. CD4 + T cells have also been investigated in detail; CD4 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (suspected of promoting disease) and a specific T follicular helper cell subset that contributes to IgG4 isotype switching have both been defined by multiple groups. The mechanisms by which these immune cells converge on target tissues, interact with fibroblasts and promote tissue remodelling are beginning to be understood and will be an important research focus in the coming years.

### IgG4-related kidney disease – an update [^111xmVRZ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Elevated serum IgG4 levels are the most important serological finding in IgG4-RKD. Although about 20–30% of patients with IgG4-RD have normal serum IgG4 levels, in two studies more than 90% of patients with IgG4-RKD had increased serum IgG4 levels. Serum levels of IgG4 dramatically decrease after successful corticosteroid therapy, but show re-elevation without apparent relapse in about half of the patients during maintenance steroid therapy.

Although neither proteinuria nor haematuria is usually detected in IgG4-TIN, many patients with coexistent glomerular lesions have proteinuria or haematuria, or both, and patients with membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) may show even nephrotic levels of proteinuria. In contrast to drug-induced acute TIN, IgG4-TIN is usually not accompanied by urinary excretion of many white blood cells (WBCs) or WBC casts. This finding probably mirrors a very mild tubulitis, a histopathological feature of IgG4-TIN.

Serum C-reactive protein levels are usually normal, with this being a useful marker to distinguish IgG4-RD from anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis or Castleman's disease.

### IgG4-related neuropathy: a case report… [^114dhVr1]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The newly recognized entity IgG4-related disease is characterized by tissue infiltration by IgG4-positive plasma cells, fibrosis, and elevated serum IgG4 concentrations. 1, 2 These abnormalities were first reported in patients with autoimmune pancreatitis in 2001. 3 Currently, IgG4. For the first time to our knowledge, we describe the clinical features of a case of IgG4-related neuropathy that exhibited sensory and motor disturbances in the extremities. Report of a case. Nerve conduction studies showed the existence of sensory-motor neuropathy. Motor conduction velocities in the median, ulnar, and tibial nerves were normal. The amplitudes of the compound muscle action potentials were preserved in the median and ulnar nerves but decreased in the tibial nerve. Additionally, the sensory conduction velocities were decreased in the median and ulnar nerves, whereas the sensory nerve action potentials were normal.

A sensory nerve action potential was not evoked in the sural nerve. A sural nerve biopsy revealed marked thickening with abundant collagen fibers and infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells in the epineurium. Although infiltration of inflammatory cells was abundant in the epineurial perivascular areas, findings suggestive of necrotizing vasculitis such as occlusion of blood vessels or fibrinoid necrosis were not found. There were no inflammatory cells in the endoneurium. Clusters of IgG4-positive plasma cells were observed in the perineural tissue. The number of IgG4-positive plasma cells was higher than 10 per high-power field. Moderate decreases in the densities of large and small fibers were observed. A few clusters of myelinated fibers, ie, potentially regenerating fibers, were observed. A teased-fiber study indicated axonal degeneration without evidence of segmental demyelination.

Amyloid deposition was not detected with Congo red staining. In conclusion, we describe the first case, to our knowledge, of IgG4-related neuropathy, which presented as sensory-motor neuropathy with pain and sclerosis of the skin in the extremities. The histopathological findings of a sural nerve biopsy indicated IgG4-RD, and oral prednisolone therapy was highly effective. The differential diagnosis for the mononeuritis multiplex type of neuropathy should include IgG4-RD.

### IgG4-related disease: clinical and laboratory features in one hundred twenty-five patients [^117DProJ]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is an immune-mediated fibroinflammatory condition that can affect nearly any organ. Prior studies have focused on individual cases of IgG4-RD or small case series. This study was undertaken to report detailed clinical and laboratory findings in a larger group of patients with IgG4-RD whose diagnosis was established by strict clinicopathologic correlation.

Methods

The baseline features of 125 patients with biopsy-proven IgG4-RD were reviewed. The diagnosis was confirmed by pathologists' review, based on consensus diagnostic criteria and correlation with clinicopathologic features. Disease activity and damage were assessed using the IgG4-RD Responder Index (RI). Flow cytometry was used to assess levels of circulating plasmablasts.

Results

Of the 125 patients, 107 had active disease and 86 were not receiving treatment for IgG4-RD. Only 51% of the patients with active disease had elevated serum IgG4 concentrations. However, patients with active disease and elevated serum IgG4 concentrations were older, had a higher IgG4-RD RI score, a greater number of organs involved, lower complement levels, higher absolute eosinophil counts, and higher IgE levels compared to those with active disease but normal serum IgG4 concentrations (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). The correlation between IgG4+ plasmablast levels and the IgG4-RD RI of disease activity (Spearman's ρ = 0.45, P = 0.003) was stronger than the correlation between total plasmablast levels and the IgG4-RD RI. Seventy-six (61%) of the patients were male, but no significant differences according to sex were observed with regard to disease severity, organ involvement, or serum IgG4 concentrations. Treatment with glucocorticoids failed to produce sustained remission in 77% of patients.

Conclusion

Nearly 50% of this patient cohort with biopsy-proven, clinically active IgG4-RD had normal serum IgG4 concentrations. Elevations in the serum IgG4 concentration appeared to identify a subset of patients with a more severe disease phenotype. In addition, the levels of IgG4+ plasmablasts correlated well with the extent of disease activity.

### Gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal manifestations of IgG4-related disease [^114YRdgr]. Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a chronic relapsing multi-organ fibro-inflammatory syndrome of presumed autoimmune etiology. It is characterized by increased serum levels of IgG4 and tissue infiltration by IgG4 + cells. Increased titers of autoantibodies against a spectrum of self-antigens and response to steroids have led to its characterization as an autoimmune disease. However, the pathognomonic antigens probably differ among manifestations, and different antigens or autoantibodies produce similar immune reactions in different organs. Little is known about the pathogenic effects, if any, of serum IgG4 or IgG4 + plasma cells in tissues. Despite several animal models of the disease, none truly recapitulates human IgG4-RD. Histologic analyses of tissues from patients with IgG4-RD reveal a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate rich in IgG4 + plasma cells, storiform fibrosis, and obliterative phlebitis, although these features vary among organs. Typical presentation and imaging findings include mass-forming synchronous or metachronous lesions in almost any organ, but most commonly in the pancreas, bile duct, retroperitoneum, kidneys, lungs, salivary and lacrimal glands, orbit, and lymph nodes. In all organs, inflammation can be reduced by corticosteroids and drugs that deplete B cells, such as rituximab. Patients with IgG4-RD have relapses that respond to primary therapy. Intense fibrosis accompanies the inflammatory response, leading to permanent organ damage and insufficiency. Death from IgG4-RD is rare. IgG4-RD is a multi-organ disease with predominant pancreatico-biliary involvement. Despite its relapsing-remitting course, patients have an excellent prognosis.

### IgG4-related diseases: state of the art on clinical practice guidelines [^115g8wLY]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Immunoglobulin G4-related diseases (IgG4-RD) are a group of chronic relapsing-remitting inflammatory conditions, characterised by tissue infiltration with lymphocytes and IgG4-secreting plasma cells, fibrosis and a usually favourable response to steroids. In this narrative review, we summarise the results of a systematic literature research, which was performed as part of the European Reference Network ReCONNET, aimed at evaluating existing clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and recommendations in IgG4-RD. From 167 publications initially obtained from a systematic literature search, only one was identified as a systematic multispecialist, evidence-based, consensus guidance statement on diagnosis and treatment of IgG4-RD, which may be recommended for use as CPG in IgG4-RD. With the recognition of a limited evidence based in this increasingly recognised disease, the group discussion has identified the following unmet needs: lack of shared classification criteria, absence of formal guidelines on diagnosis, no evidence-based therapeutic recommendations and lack of activity and damage indices. Areas of unmet needs include the difficulties in diagnosis, management and monitoring and the scarcity of expert centres.

### IgG4-related diseases including mikulicz's disease and sclerosing pancreatitis: diagnostic insights [^116CgbEA]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Since the first report of serum IgG4 elevation in sclerosing pancreatitis in 2001, various systemic disorders have been reported to elevate IgG4, and many names have been proposed from the perspective of the systemic condition. Despite similarities in the organs damaged in IgG4-related Mikulicz's disease and Sjögren's syndrome, there are marked clinical and pathological differences between the 2 entities. The majority of cases diagnosed with autoimmune pancreatitis in Japan are IgG4-related sclerosing pancreatitis, and it should be recognized that this is distinct from the Western type. Diagnosis of IgG4-related disease is defined by both elevated serum IgG4 (> 1.35 g/l) and histopathological features, including lymphocyte and IgG4+ plasma cell infiltration (IgG4+ plasma cells/IgG+ plasma cells > 50% on a highly magnified slide checked at 5 points). Differential diagnosis from other distinct disorders is necessary: these include sarcoidosis, Castleman's disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, lymphoma, cancer, and other existing conditions. The Japanese IgG4 research group has begun multicenter prospective studies to improve diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies.

### Clinical significance of serum IgE / IgG4 ratio in patients with IgG4-related disease [^114Zg5YV]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels are frequently elevated in patients with IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). This study aimed to evaluate the clinical relevance of serum IgE/IgG4 ratio in relation to disease activity and clinical outcomes in patients with IgG4-RD.

Methods

We retrospectively analysed 32 patients with newly diagnosed IgG4-RD who had data on both serum IgG4 and IgE levels. Disease activity was assessed using the IgG4-RD responder index (RI), and clinical outcome was assessed by remission status at 1 year, defined by an IgG4-RD RI score of 0. Spearman's correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the correlations between serum IgG4, IgE, and the IgE/IgG4 ratio with IgG4-RD RI. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between the IgE/IgG4 ratio and remission at 1 year.

Results

The median serum levels of IgG4, IgE, and the IgE/IgG4 ratio were 5090.0 (1985.0–14075.0) mg/L, 312.5 (93.9–791.8) kU/L, and 0.052 (0.015–0.104), respectively. Serum IgG4 levels significantly correlated with IgG4-RD RI (rho = 0.628, p < 0.001), whereas IgE levels (rho = 0.210, p = 0.249), and the IgE/IgG4 ratio (rho = -0.251, p = 0.165) did not. A higher IgE/IgG4 ratio was independently associated with remission at 1 year (adjusted odds ratio = 1.052, 95% confidence interval = 1.008–1.099, p = 0.021), while absolute IgG4 or IgE levels were not.

Conclusions

Although the serum IgE/IgG4 ratio did not correlate with baseline disease activity, it was independently associated with remission at 1 year. This finding suggests its role as a prognostic biomarker for remission in IgG4-RD, capturing immunologic features not reflected by absolute IgG4 or IgE levels.

### IgG4-related disease: what a hematologist needs to know [^113qSBBo]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Key points

IgG4-RD is an important cause of eosinophilia, lymphadenopathy and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Hematologists should include IgG4-RD in the differential diagnosis of these abnormalities.
Other common manifestations of IgG4-RD include autoimmune pancreatitis, obstructive jaundice, orbital pseudotumor, lacrimal and salivary gland swelling, retroperitoneal fibrosis, and tubulointerstitial nephritis.
Serum protein electrophoresis and IgG subclass evaluation should be performed in patients with suspected IgG4-RD. Serum IgG4 levels are elevated in approximately 70% of cases. Mildly increased serum IgG4 (1.5–5 g/L) is a non-specific finding, but a markedly elevated level (> 5 g/L) is 90% specific for IgG4-RD.
A firm diagnosis requires histological confirmation based on the International Consensus Criteria which include a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, storiform fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis. There must be an increased number of IgG4 + plasma cells with an IgG4:IgG plasma cell ratio > 40%.
Early recognition and diagnosis are essential because patients typically respond well to steroids or rituximab in the early stages of the disease, but fibrotic disease and late complications such as chronic pancreatitis are often irreversible.

### Value of serum IgG4 in the diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis and in distinguishing it from pancreatic cancer [^111u4Usr]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the sensitivity and specificity of elevated serum IgG4 level for the diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) and its ability to distinguish AIP from pancreatic cancer, its main differential diagnosis.

Methods

We measured serum IgG4 levels (normal 8–140 mg/dL) in 510 patients including 45 with AIP, 135 with pancreatic cancer, 62 with no pancreatic disease, and 268 with other pancreatic diseases.

Results

Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values for elevated serum IgG4 (> 140 mg/dL) for diagnosis of AIP were 76%, 93%, and 36%, respectively, and 53%, 99%, and 75%, respectively, for IgG4 of > 280 mg/dL. Among subjects with elevated IgG4, non-AIP subjects (N = 32) differed from AIP subjects (N = 34) in that they were more likely to be female (45%vs 9%, P < 0.001), less likely to have serum IgG4 > 280 mg/dL (13%vs 71%, P < 0.001), or elevation of total IgG (16%vs 56%, P < 0.001). Serum IgG4 levels were elevated in 13/135 (10%) pancreatic cancer patients; however, only 1% had IgG4 levels > 280 mg/dL compared with 53% of AIP. Compared with AIP, pancreatic cancer patients were more likely to have CA19–9 levels of > 100 U/mL (71%vs 9%, P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Elevated serum IgG4 levels are characteristic of AIP. However, mild (< 2-fold) elevations in serum IgG4 are seen in up to 10% of subjects without AIP including pancreatic cancer and cannot be used alone to distinguish AIP from pancreatic cancer. Because AIP is uncommon, IgG4 elevations in patients with low pretest probability of having AIP are likely to represent false positives.

### IgG4-related lung disease as a differential diagnosis of a lymphoproliferative disease: atypical presentation of an atypical disease [^115AJZWM]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

The presence of multiple adenopathies is frequent in IgG4-RD, being the first manifestation in some cases.

When lymphadenopathy is generalised, the differential diagnosis becomes more complex. In our patient, the initial diagnosis considered lymphoma, but other diseases such as Castleman disease and disseminated malignancy were also considered as differentials.

Our case fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for IgG4-RD, with an extensive involvement outside the lung, therefore, the diagnosis was made.

Learning points

Diagnosing IgG4-related lung disease (RLD) can be a challenge, since initial imaging changes tend to be nonspecific, leading to confounding interpretations, such as malignancy, infectious process or other pulmonary disorders
The patient's clinical history, culture results (if available), pathology and laboratory results (high serum levels of IgG4) can be helpful diagnostic tools
The spectrum of differential diagnosis of IgG4-related disease (RD) is wide, and it includes, among others, malignant primary or lymphoproliferative processes. Considering this, surgical biopsy is essential for a conclusive diagnosis
Glucocorticoids are the first line treatment for patients with IgG4-RD, and a positive response supports the potential diagnosis of IgG4-RLD. However, biopsy gives the definite diagnosis.

### The positive predictive value of a very high serum IgG4 concentration for the diagnosis of IgG4-related disease [^1159bHRd]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Serum IgG4 concentrations are used to evaluate a diagnosis of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), but the positive predictive value (PPV) of a very high IgG4 level is uncertain. This study evaluated the PPV of a very high IgG4 concentration for diagnosing IgG4-RD.

Methods

The data warehouses of 2 large academic healthcare systems were queried for IgG4 concentration test results. Cases with serum IgG4 concentrations > 5× the upper limit of normal (ULN) were included. Cases of IgG4-RD were determined using the American College of Rheumatology/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria. The PPV for IgG4-RD of an IgG4 concentration > 5× ULN was estimated. Other conditions associated with very high IgG4 concentrations and specific features of IgG4-RD cases were characterized.

Results

IgG4 concentrations were available in 32,206 cases. Of these, 3039 (9.4%) had elevated IgG4 concentrations, and a final cohort of 191 (0.6%) cases had IgG4 concentrations > 5× ULN (median age 66 yrs, 72% male). The PPV of an IgG4 concentration > 5× ULN for a diagnosis of IgG4-RD was 75.4% (95% CI 68.7–81.3). In the remaining cases, elevated IgG4 concentrations were observed among patients with malignancies, autoimmune diseases, and infections.

Conclusion

The majority of cases with serum IgG4 concentrations > 5× ULN in this study had IgG4-RD. These data support the high weight placed on very high serum IgG4 concentrations in the ACR/EULAR classification criteria. However, 25% of cases with very high IgG4 concentrations had an alternative diagnosis, underscoring the importance of considering the broad differential of etiologies associated with an elevated IgG4 concentration when evaluating a patient.

### Immunoglobulin-G4-related skin disease [^116K44Vk]. Clinics in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Immunoglobulin-G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is an autoimmune-mediated spectrum of diseases, characterized by infiltration of IgG4+ plasma cells into one or multiple organs, with the pancreas being the most commonly affected organ. The disease mostly affects middle-aged to elderly men. Diagnosis requires an integration of clinical, radiologic, pathologic, and serologic studies. Histologically, there is an increased infiltration of IgG4+ plasma cells, elevated ratio of IgG4+/IgG plasma cells of more than 40%, and a storiform pattern of fibrosis. There may be eosinophilia, along with elevated IgG4 levels. IgG4-RD can mimic several diseases and should be differentiated from inflammatory and neoplastic processes. Recently, there has been increased awareness of cutaneous involvement by IgG4-RD either as an isolated lesion or primary involvement or as a secondary involvement from a systemic disease. Clinically, cutaneous IgG4+-related disease presents as papules, plaques, and nodules involving the head and neck areas. We have provided a systematic review of the literature of this new and challenging entity of cutaneous IgG4-RD.

### The diagnostic significance of serum IgG4 levels in patients with autoimmune pancreatitis: a UK study [^114Y9FvB]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is recognised as an end organ manifestation of the systemic condition known as IgG4-sclerosing disease. One major characteristic of this disease, regardless of its location in the body, is the presence of high levels of circulating serum IgG, in particular IgG4 antibody. In the case of AIP, differential diagnosis from other conditions of the pancreas and biliary system, particularly cancers, can be difficult, but could result in avoiding invasive procedures and surgery. Earlier studies have evaluated the use of checking IgG4 levels in AIP diagnosis; these have produced variable results.

Objective

To further assess the diagnostic significance of serum IgG4 levels in AIP and investigate its value in differentiating from cancer of the gastroenterological system.

Methods

A retrospective study of 196 IgG4-requested samples from a 24-month period was examined. Samples were sorted into confirmed AIP, cancer or other pancreatic conditions including primary sclerosing cholangitis.

Results

Patients with AIP possessed a mean serum IgG level that was significantly higher compared with all other groups (mean serum IgG level = 19.0 g/l ± 2.5, P < 0.001). The mean serum IgG4 level of AIP patients was also significantly higher compared with all other conditions including cancer patients (mean IgG4 level = 3.7 g/l ± 0.5, P < 0.001).

Conclusion

This data lends support to circulating IgG4 levels only being used as an accompanying diagnostic marker to imaging, histology and clinical presentation. In particular, this may help in differentiating between AIP and pancreatic carcinoma.

### Biopsy-proven IgG4-related lung disease [^114Ntmh3]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Biopsy-proven IgG4-RLD is different in many ways from typical IgG4-RD. In biopsy-proven IgG4-RLD, a normal serum IgG4 concentration is commonly seen, while extrapulmonary involvement is infrequent. Alveolar consolidation with air bronchograms is an important imaging finding of IgG4-RLD, which has not been emphasized before.

### IgG4-related disease: what a hematologist needs to know [^114twGKB]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

IgG4-related disease is a fibro-inflammatory condition that can affect nearly any organ system. Common presentations include major salivary and lacrimal gland enlargement, orbital disease, autoimmune pancreatitis, retroperitoneal fibrosis and tubulointerstitial nephritis. This review focuses on the hematologic manifestations of IgG4-related disease, including lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. The disease can easily be missed by unsuspecting hematologists, as patients may present with clinical problems that mimic disorders such as multicentric Castleman disease, lymphoma, plasma cell neoplasms and hypereosinophilic syndromes. When IgG4-related disease is suspected, serum protein electrophoresis and IgG subclasses are helpful as initial tests but a firm histological diagnosis is essential both to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out mimickers. The central histopathological features are a dense, polyclonal, lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate enriched with IgG4-positive plasma cells (with an IgG4/IgG ratio > 40%), storiform fibrosis, and obliterative phlebitis. Importantly for hematologists, the latter two features are seen in all tissues except bone marrow and lymph nodes, making these two sites suboptimal for histological confirmation. Many patients follow an indolent course and respond well to treatment, but a significant proportion may have highly morbid or fatal complications such as periaortitis, severe retroperitoneal fibrosis or pachymeningitis. Corticosteroids are effective but cause new or worsening diabetes in about 40% of patients. Initial response rates to rituximab are high but durable remissions are rare. More intensive lymphoma chemotherapy regimens may be required in rare cases of severe, refractory disease, and targeted therapy against plasmablasts, IgE and other disease biomarkers warrant further exploration.

### LGI1 encephalitis and IgG4-related disease: rare conditions collide [^114F5oph]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

IgG4 antibodies evolve as an anti-inflammatory response to chronic antigenic stimulation and are normally the least common IgG subclass found within healthy individuals. Conversely, IgG4 neurologic disorders are characterized by the direct action of IgG4 antibodies on specific enzymatic or protein-protein interactions to disrupt their usual downstream signal transduction pathways. Unlike other autoimmune neurologic disorders, which primarily involve the IgG1 subclass, IgG4 antibodies are unable to activate complement-mediated immune responses and are less effective in crosslinking and internalizing their target antigen.

Encephalitis is not a typical feature of the distinct and broader disease entity, IgG4RD, which is characterized by mass-forming lesions containing IgG4+ plasma cell infiltrates that can cause permanent organ injury. IgG4RD can mimic neoplastic, infectious, and other inflammatory diseases in typical organ patterns affecting salivary glands and lymph nodes of the head and neck, the pancreas, biliary tree, kidneys, and retroperitoneum. It is recognized in our presented case that the absence of histopathologic confirmation does not allow a definitive diagnosis of IgG4RD; however, the typical pancreas appearances (with no other obvious pancreatitis cause) and elevated serum IgG4 concentration in the absence of any other causal neoplastic/inflammatory disease partly satisfy the diagnostic criteria. Pancreatic biopsy was not pursued given the potential risks involved and the need to treat LGI1 encephalitis with corticosteroids regardless. Treating and closely observing therapeutic response with surveillance imaging, therefore, seemed most appropriate.
