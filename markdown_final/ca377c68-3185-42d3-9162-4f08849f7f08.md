## Question

what kidney functoin cutoff for lovenox

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the specific renal function cutoff for Lovenox (enoxaparin) that triggers dose adjustment or avoidance, and what to do above and below that threshold. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA‑labeled cutoff and actions by indication. Then, I should verify pharmacokinetic justification for that cutoff. Next, I will review guideline nuances where avoidance rather than dose reduction is advised. After that, I need to check monitoring recommendations and how to calculate renal function for dosing. Finally, I will consider special populations such as dialysis and older adults before synthesizing a clear, actionable answer.

> Let me first confirm the FDA‑labeled threshold, because that should anchor the decision. The FDA labeling for enoxaparin clearly identifies creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min as the point at which dose reduction is required, whereas creatinine clearance 30 mL/min or higher does not require dose adjustment, which establishes 30 mL/min as the definitive cutoff for renal dosing action [^113uZiK1] [^112npfyq].

> Next, I should review the exact dosing changes by indication to avoid misstatements. For CrCl < 30 mL/min, the label directs reducing prophylaxis to 30 mg subcutaneously once daily and using once‑daily 1 mg/kg dosing for therapeutic indications, with a modified once‑daily regimen for STEMI that includes a 30 mg IV bolus followed by subcutaneous dosing rather than the usual every‑12‑hour schedule, whereas for CrCl ≥ 30 mL/min standard regimens such as 40 mg once daily for prophylaxis and 1 mg/kg every 12 hours for treatment apply without adjustment [^113uZiK1] [^1178n9SV].

> Wait, let me verify I'm not overgeneralizing above 30 mL/min. The FDA SPL explicitly states that for CrCl ≥ 30 mL/min no dose adjustment is required, with routine vigilance for bleeding, which supports continuing standard prophylactic and therapeutic dosing in this range unless other risk factors dictate otherwise [^112npfyq] [^1156zo7X].

> I need to check the pharmacokinetic rationale to ensure the cutoff is mechanistically sound. The FDA label documents that at steady state the AUC increases by about 65% in severe renal impairment with CrCl < 30 mL/min, and independent PK work shows anti‑Xa clearance decreases by around 39% after repeated dosing in this group, while creatinine clearance is the dominant determinant of exposure and anti‑Xa activity, with higher anti‑Xa levels when CrCl is reduced, all of which justify the 30 mL/min threshold to avoid accumulation and bleeding [^111kB7ft] [^114VNHHw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety; I should confirm clinical outcomes. A meta‑analysis across multiple LMWH studies found increased major bleeding in patients with CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min when standard, unadjusted dosing was used, which reinforces the need for dose reduction or alternative strategies below that threshold to mitigate bleeding risk [^114Z6eyh].

> Next, I should review guideline nuance where avoidance is preferred. The Western Trauma Association recommends UFH rather than enoxaparin in renal failure and states that enoxaparin should be avoided in patients with end‑stage renal disease or creatinine clearance < 30 mg/dL — hmm, wait a minute, that unit is wrong; I should correct that to mL/min, as this is clearly a typographical error — reflecting a more conservative stance in high‑risk trauma populations compared with the FDA's dose‑reduction approach [^111fzCPe].

> I will now examine monitoring recommendations, since dose‑adjusted use in renal impairment may still require lab guidance. The FDA allows for anti‑Factor Xa level monitoring in renal impairment to assess anticoagulant effect, and nephrology‑focused reviews recommend anti‑Xa monitoring in advanced CKD (stages 4–5) when LMWH is used, recognizing variability and accumulation risk in severe impairment [^112h2B4d] [^114VNHHw].

> I should confirm how to estimate renal function for dosing decisions because using the wrong equation can misclassify patients. Drug labeling and pivotal trials hinge dosing on creatinine clearance by Cockcroft‑Gault, not CKD‑EPI eGFR, so I need to ensure CrCl is calculated with Cockcroft‑Gault when deciding if the patient is above or below the 30 mL/min cutoff to avoid dosing errors [^1151GG34].

> Let me consider special populations carefully. For dialysis, enoxaparin is not FDA‑approved, and trauma guidance reiterates this, although observational data in dialysis patients receiving prophylactic enoxaparin did not show higher bleeding compared with UFH; if used off‑label in such settings, extreme caution and monitoring are prudent, particularly at therapeutic doses where accumulation is more likely and anti‑Xa may poorly reflect clinical effect in ESRD [^111fzCPe] [^115WbVEh] [^1113UWjo].

> I should double‑check the elderly, because age and renal function often intersect. The FDA label notes higher bleeding rates with therapeutic enoxaparin in older adults and advises caution when elimination may be delayed; in practice, that means being particularly vigilant about creatinine clearance trending toward the 30 mL/min threshold and reassessing dosing promptly if renal function worsens [^117VUb63].

> Synthesizing this, the action point is binary at CrCl 30 mL/min. For CrCl ≥ 30 mL/min, no adjustment is required and standard prophylactic and therapeutic regimens are appropriate with routine bleeding surveillance; for CrCl < 30 mL/min, reduce to 30 mg once daily for prophylaxis and to once‑daily 1 mg/kg for treatment, with the labeled STEMI adjustments, and in high‑risk contexts such as trauma or ESRD consider avoiding enoxaparin and using UFH instead, while employing anti‑Xa monitoring when LMWH must be used in advanced CKD to guide safety [^113uZiK1] [^112npfyq] [^1178n9SV] [^111fzCPe] [^116SU3zW] [^114Z6eyh].

The kidney function cutoff for Lovenox (enoxaparin) dose adjustment is **CrCl < 30 mL/min** [^113uZiK1]. For CrCl ≥ 30 mL/min, use **standard dosing** [^112npfyq]; for CrCl < 30 mL/min, **reduce to 1 mg/kg once daily** for treatment and 30 mg once daily for prophylaxis [^1178n9SV]. In dialysis or ESRD, avoid Lovenox if possible [^111fzCPe]; if used, monitor anti-Xa levels and bleeding risk [^11431JZh] [^112h2B4d].

---

## Pharmacokinetics of enoxaparin and renal impairment

Enoxaparin is **renally cleared** [^116n4KQJ]; impaired kidney function increases drug exposure and bleeding risk [^113q9Mzt]. Severe impairment (**CrCl < 30 mL/min**) increases anti-Xa exposure by ~65%, warranting dose reduction [^111kB7ft] [^116SU3zW].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting renal function cutoff

Evidence supports a **CrCl < 30 mL/min** threshold for dose adjustment [^114Z6eyh]. Pharmacokinetic studies show that severe impairment (CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min) increases anti-Xa exposure and bleeding risk, supporting dose reduction [^111kB7ft] [^116phEnm], and **clinical trials** demonstrate higher bleeding risk in patients with CrCl < 30 mL/min [^116YGH7f], reinforcing the need for dose adjustment [^114Z6eyh].

## Recommended dosing adjustments based on renal function

| **Renal function (CrCl)** | **Recommended dosing** |
|-|-|
| ≥ 30 mL/min | Standard dosing (no adjustment) [^112npfyq] |
| < 30 mL/min | Dose reduction required [^113uZiK1] [^1178n9SV] |
| Dialysis/ESRD | - Avoid if possible <br/> - Monitor anti-Xa if used [^11431JZh] [^111fzCPe] [^112uZF32] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines align on a **CrCl < 30 mL/min** threshold [^114VNHHw]. FDA labeling recommends **dose reduction for CrCl < 30 mL/min** and no adjustment for CrCl ≥ 30 mL/min [^113uZiK1] [^112npfyq], and **KDIGO 2024** advises tailoring anticoagulant dosing to renal function to limit complications [^116jPjpg].

---

## Risks associated with enoxaparin use in renal impairment

Renal impairment increases **bleeding risk** due to drug accumulation [^111kB7ft]; monitor closely and adjust dosing to mitigate harm [^114Z6eyh].

---

## Alternative anticoagulation strategies

Consider alternatives in severe impairment or dialysis. The preferred alternative is **unfractionated heparin (UFH)** because of its short half-life and reversibility [^114VNHHw] [^114pSvy2], whereas **direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)** require renal dose adjustment and should be avoided in severe impairment [^114Z4kzp] [^116tnMaY].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

Use anti-Xa monitoring and clinical assessment to guide therapy. In renal impairment, **anti-Xa monitoring** is recommended to guide dosing and limit bleeding [^112h2B4d] [^1175pNth], and vigilant **clinical monitoring** for bleeding with prompt dose adjustment is advised [^11431JZh].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **CrCl ≥ 30 mL/min**: Standard dosing; no adjustment [^112npfyq].
- **CrCl < 30 mL/min**: Reduce dose; monitor anti-Xa and bleeding [^113uZiK1] [^116SU3zW].
- **Dialysis/ESRD**: Avoid if possible; monitor anti-Xa if used [^11431JZh] [^111fzCPe].

---

The kidney function cutoff for Lovenox dose adjustment is **CrCl < 30 mL/min**; adjust dosing and monitor anti-Xa and bleeding, and consider UFH or DOACs in severe impairment or dialysis [^114VNHHw] [^114Z4kzp].

Quantifying the risk and benefit of the type and initial dose of pharmacologic prophylaxis for each patient is a challenge best determined by the trauma team at bedside. As noted, 40 mg of enoxaparin twice daily is the recommended initial pharmacologic prophylaxis for most trauma patients. Detailing every indication where an alternative therapeutic or dose may be indicated is outside the scope of these guidelines; several are described below.

- **Unfractionated heparin for renal failure**: In the presence of end-stage renal disease or a creatinine clearance of < 30 mg/dL, subcutaneous unfractionated heparin at 5000 U every 8 hours may be initiated. Because enoxaparin is excreted by the kidneys, its administration to patients with renal failure may lead to increased bleeding complications and should be avoided. Enoxaparin has not been FDA approved for use in dialysis patients. Providing lower enoxaparin doses in the setting of a creatinine clearance of < 30 mg/dL while closely monitoring anti-Xa levels may be possible in the future, but additional research is necessary before this recommendation can be made. In most other settings, enoxaparin is preferable to unfractionated heparin, as enoxaparin leads to lower VTE rates without increased bleeding complications.

- **Brain and spine trauma**: For TBI patients, enoxaparin is associated with less VTE and higher survival than unfractionated heparin, with no difference in the progression of brain lesions, regardless if the dose was delivered in less than 24 hours after admission, between 24 to 48 hours, or after 48 hours.

### Anticoagulation in chronic kidney disease: From guidelines to clinical practice [^1175pNth]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

**Monitoring the treatment with heparins**: Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based dose adjustment is still recommended for UFH to achieve an optimal therapeutic level (aPTT range 1.5–2.0). For LMWH, anti-Xa level monitoring calibrated specifically for each therapeutic agent is compulsory in CKD stages 4 and 5. The initial monitoring is performed 2 to 4 hours before and after the dose. Regular twice-weekly monitoring could be useful. Underdosage is defined as peak anti-Xa levels < 0.5 IU/mL, whereas optimal therapeutic levels are 0.1 to 0.3 IU/mL for prophylactic dosing and 0.4 to 1 IU/mL for therapeutic dosing. In the absence of clear guidelines and clinical trial-based indications, adapted local protocols could be useful. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is difficult to control in ESRD since fondaparinux is contraindicated. Another essential issue is the need to split the total LMWH dose into two equal doses in patients at high hemorrhage risk. This recommendation is derived from the Cochrane databases, showing that single-dose regimens are not more effective, rather more convenient for the patient.

### Meta-analysis: Low-molecular-weight heparin and bleeding in patients with severe renal insufficiency [^114Z6eyh]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Dose adjustment or laboratory monitoring of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is commonly recommended for patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min), but the basis for this recommendation is unclear.

- **Purpose**: To compare levels of anti-Xa heparin and risk for major bleeding in LMWH-treated patients with a creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less versus those with a creatinine clearance greater than 30 mL/min by using standard weight-adjusted therapeutic doses, empirically adjusted doses, or prophylactic doses of LMWH.

- **Data sources**: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library) searched to December 2005 with no language restrictions. The authors also searched reference lists and contacted experts.

- **Study selection**: Observational or subgroups of randomized studies that included non-dialysis-dependent patients with varying degrees of renal function who were treated with LMWH and reported creatinine clearance and anti-Xa levels or major bleeding.

- **Data extraction**: Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data on patient characteristics, renal function, LMWH treatment, anti-Xa levels, and major bleeding. The pooled odds ratio of major bleeding in patients with a creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less was calculated by using the Peto method.

- **Data synthesis**: Eighteen studies using three preparations of LMWH (15 studies using enoxaparin, 2 using tinzaparin, and 1 using dalteparin) were included. Peak anti-Xa levels measured 4 hours following a subcutaneous injection were statistically significant.

### Considerations for systemic anticoagulation in ESRD [^112uZF32]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

In the setting of end-stage kidney disease, the incidence and risk for thrombotic events are increased, and the use of anticoagulants is common. However, the incidence of bleeding is also a frequent issue, creating additional challenges in the management of anticoagulation therapy. Patients with end-stage renal disease are typically excluded from large clinical trials exploring the use of anticoagulants, which limits our knowledge of optimal management approaches. Furthermore, varying degrees of renal failure, in addition to conditions that alter the pharmacokinetics of various anticoagulants or pharmacodynamic response, may warrant alternative approaches to dosing.

This review explores systemic chronic anticoagulation therapy in the setting of chronic kidney disease where hemodialysis is required. Agents discussed include vitamin K antagonists, low-molecular-weight heparins, fondaparinux, oral factor Xa antagonists, and direct thrombin inhibitors. Clinical challenges, approaches to dosing regimens, and tools for measuring responses and reversal are covered.

### Influence of patient characteristics and renal function on factor Xa inhibition pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics after enoxaparin administration in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes [^113q9Mzt]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

The standard of care for patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (ACS) includes antithrombotic therapy with aspirin and heparin. Although emerging data suggest that low-molecular-weight preparations offer distinct advantages over unfractionated heparin, limited information on patient-related factors that may influence dosing, safety, and efficacy is available.

- **Purpose**: The purpose of our study was the determination of the impact of patient age, sex, body weight, and renal function on factor Xa inhibition pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics after enoxaparin administration in patients with ACS.

- **Methods and results**: Patients enrolled in the TIMI 11A trial received a full complement of antiischemic therapy, aspirin, and enoxaparin (30 mg intravenously, followed by weight-adjusted doses of either 1 mg/kg or 1.25 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours). Before and after the third and last doses, blood samples were obtained from 445 patients for measurement of anti-Xa activity. The mean apparent clearance, distribution volume, and plasma half-life were 0.733 L/h, 5.24 L, and 5 hours, respectively. Among a wide range of clinical and laboratory covariates, creatinine clearance emerged as the most influential factor on apparent clearance, area under the curve, and anti-Xa activity. Patients with marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 40 mL/min) had higher trough and peak anti-Xa activity compared with those with normal renal function and were more likely to have major hemorrhagic events.

### Xarelto [^116tnMaY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and reduction in the risk of recurrence of DVT and PE is crucial. In patients with CrCl < 30 mL/min, rivaroxaban exposure and pharmacodynamic effects are increased compared to patients with normal renal function. There are limited clinical data for patients with CrCl 15 to < 30 mL/min; therefore, it is essential to observe closely and promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss in these patients. There are no clinical data in patients with CrCl < 15 mL/min (including patients on dialysis); therefore, avoid the use of Xarelto in these patients. Discontinue Xarelto in patients who develop acute renal failure while on treatment.

- **Prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following hip or knee replacement surgery**: In patients with CrCl < 30 mL/min, rivaroxaban exposure and pharmacodynamic effects are increased compared to patients with normal renal function. Limited clinical data are available for patients with CrCl 15 to < 30 mL/min; therefore, observe closely and promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss in these patients. There are no clinical data in patients with CrCl < 15 mL/min (including patients on dialysis); therefore, avoid the use of Xarelto in these patients. Discontinue Xarelto in patients who develop acute renal failure while on treatment.

- **Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in acutely ill medical patients at risk for thromboembolic complications not at high risk of bleeding**: In patients with CrCl < 30 mL/min, rivaroxaban exposure and pharmacodynamic effects are increased compared to patients with normal renal function.

### Dosage of enoxaparin among obese and renal impairment patients [^116phEnm]. Thrombosis Research (2005). Low credibility.

Enoxaparin dosage for obese patients and patients with renal impairment remains controversial.

- **Objective**: To compare anti-factor Xa activity (anti-Xa) among obese and renal impairment patients to patients with healthy weight and adequate renal function.

- **Design**: Open, prospective, nonrandomized clinical trial.

- **Setting**: A major community teaching hospital.

- **Patients**: A total of 233 patients with a prescription of enoxaparin.

- **Interventions**: Enoxaparin 1.5 mg/kg once daily or 1 mg/kg twice daily, except those on dialysis, who received 75% of the dose.

- **Measurements**: Anti-Xa was measured 4 hours post-injection on day 2 or 3.

- **Results**: Mean (95% confidence interval (95% CI)) anti-Xa was equal to 1.14 IU/mL (1.07–1.21) and 1.14 IU/mL (1.08–1.20) among patients who received one (n = 92) and two injections (n = 122) per day, respectively. Anti-Xa increases with body mass index (BMI) (0.01 IU/mL for each kg/m²; 95% CI: 0.002–0.017), but the increase is insufficient to reach supratherapeutic anti-Xa. Anti-Xa decreases with higher creatinine clearance (CrCl) (-0.003 IU/mL for each mL/min; 95% CI: -0.006 to -0.001). On the twice-daily regimen, this is sufficient to reach supratherapeutic anti-Xa. The odd ratio (OR) (95% CI) of having a nontherapeutic anti-Xa is equal to 2.28 (1.25–4.16) when enoxaparin is administered twice daily and to 3.03 (1.16–7.86) among severe renal impairment patients (≤ 30 mL/min).

- **Conclusions**: Based on anti-Xa, no dosage adjustments are required in obese patients. In renally impaired patients, adjustments may be necessary when enoxaparin is administered.

### Lovenox [^116n4KQJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Distribution**: The volume of distribution of anti-Factor Xa activity is approximately 4.3 liters.

- **Elimination**: Following intravenous dosing, the total body clearance of enoxaparin is 26 mL/min. After intravenous dosing of enoxaparin labeled with the gamma-emitter, 99mTc, 40% of radioactivity and 8 to 20% of anti-Factor Xa activity were recovered in urine within 24 hours. The elimination half-life based on anti-Factor Xa activity was 4.5 hours following a single subcutaneous dose and extended to about 7 hours following repeated dosing. Significant anti-Factor Xa activity persists in plasma for about 12 hours following a 40 mg subcutaneous once-a-day dose. Following subcutaneous dosing, the apparent clearance (CL/F) of enoxaparin is approximately 15 mL/min.

- **Metabolism**: Enoxaparin sodium is primarily metabolized in the liver through desulfation and/or depolymerization to lower molecular weight species with much-reduced biological potency. Renal clearance of active fragments accounts for about 10% of the administered dose, while total renal excretion of active and non-active fragments comprises 40% of the dose.

### Eliquis [^111E1is5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Renal impairment**: Reduction of risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. The recommended dose is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with at least two of the following characteristics [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]: age greater than or equal to 80 years, body weight less than or equal to 60 kg, and serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL.

- **Patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis**: Clinical efficacy and safety studies with Eliquis did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, administration of Eliquis at the usually recommended dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] will result in concentrations of apixaban and pharmacodynamic activity similar to those observed in the ARISTOTLE study [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar stroke reduction and bleeding risk in patients with ESRD on dialysis as was seen in ARISTOTLE.

- **Prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following hip or knee replacement surgery, and treatment of DVT and PE and reduction in the risk of recurrence of DVT and PE**: No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment, including those with ESRD on dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Clinical efficacy and safety studies with Eliquis did not enroll patients with ESRD on dialysis or patients with a CrCl < 15 mL/min; therefore, dosing recommendations are based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (anti-FXa activity) data.

### The impact of renal dysfunction on outcomes in the ExTRACT-TIMI 25 trial [^116YGH7f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

The ExTRACT-TIMI 25 (Enoxaparin and Thrombolysis Reperfusion for Acute Myocardial Infarction Treatment-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 25) trial provided an opportunity to evaluate the impact of renal dysfunction on outcomes in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and compare enoxaparin (ENOX) and unfractionated heparin (UFH).

It remains unclear how renal dysfunction influences the balance between the benefit and risk of antithrombotic therapy. In the ExTRACT-TIMI 25 trial, 20,479 patients were randomized to receive UFH or ENOX. A reduced ENOX dose was administered to patients aged 75 years or older and those with an estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 60 ml/min, which constituted 79.1% of the study population. While major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage did not differ for patients with preserved renal function (CrCl > 90 ml/min), those with renal dysfunction experienced a progressively greater increase in the risk of major and minor bleeding with ENOX.

Enoxaparin was found to be superior to UFH for the majority of subjects.

### Lovenox [^112h2B4d]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Use the multiple-dose vial for intravenous injections and administer Lovenox through an intravenous line. Do not mix or co-administer Lovenox with other medications. To prevent mixing of drugs, flush the intravenous access device with a sufficient volume of saline or dextrose solution prior to and following the intravenous bolus administration of Lovenox. Lovenox is compatible with normal saline solution (0.9%) or 5% dextrose in water.

- **Monitoring for safety**: During therapy, monitor complete blood counts, including platelets and stool occult blood. Assess for signs and symptoms of bleeding. In patients with renal impairment, anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of Lovenox. If abnormal coagulation parameters or bleeding occur during Lovenox therapy, anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of Lovenox [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) are not adequate for monitoring the anticoagulant effects of Lovenox.

### SPL drug information for enoxaparin sodium [^1178n9SV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of enoxaparin sodium IV (also known as Lovenox) in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 30 mL/min: Reduce the dosage to 30 mg subcutaneous (SC) once daily for thromboprophylaxis. Administer a 30 mg IV bolus plus a 1 mg/kg SC dose followed by a 1 mg/kg SC once daily for ST-elevation myocardial infarction in patients aged < 75 years, and 1 mg/kg SC for other indications.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the prophylactic dose of enoxaparin once daily over 4 days in patients with renal impairment [^116SU3zW]. Thrombosis Research (2002). Low credibility.

The pharmacokinetics of the low-molecular-weight heparin enoxaparin were evaluated in 12 healthy volunteers and 36 patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment. Enoxaparin was administered once daily by subcutaneous injections at a dose of 40 mg for four days, and venous blood samples were taken over a five-day period to determine antifactor Xa and antifactor IIa activity and the activated partial thromboplastin time. Adverse events were also recorded.

The results for anti-Xa activity showed that the rate of absorption of enoxaparin was similar across the four groups of study participants. The elimination half-life increased with the degree of renal impairment, and this relationship was more evident after repeated dosing.

- **Anti-Xa exposure**: It was not significantly different between healthy volunteers and patients with mild or moderate renal impairment, but was significantly increased in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 30 ml/min). Anti-Xa clearance decreased with the degree of renal impairment after repeated dosing, but only the difference between patients with severe renal impairment and healthy volunteers was statistically significant, with the clearance on Day 4 being 39% lower in patients with severe renal impairment than in healthy volunteers [P = 0.0001].

- **Anti-IIa activity**: This activity was low in all study participants, and the activated partial thromboplastin time was not significantly different between the study groups.

In conclusion, the clearance of enoxaparin is reduced in patients with severe renal impairment. Dose adjustment of enoxaparin may need to be considered for this population.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^114Z4kzp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Phase III trials involving DOACs have excluded patients with severe renal dysfunction (CrCl 30 mL/min), reduced dose for CrCl 15 to 30 mL/min, and avoidance for CrCl < 15 mL/min. The 2018 AF guidelines recommend both warfarin and apixaban for patients with end-stage renal disease (CrCl < 15 mL/min or on dialysis). However, warfarin has little proven benefit and a large risk of harm in end-stage renal disease. There is growing evidence that apixaban in patients with AF and advanced CKD or end-stage renal disease may be associated with a lower risk of major bleeding compared with warfarin, or at the very least, similar rates of bleeding.

Rivaroxaban use in severe CKD, particularly in patients on dialysis, is quite contentious. The package labeling states that rivaroxaban can be used.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^116jPjpg]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

In specific circumstances concerning chronic kidney disease, particularly regarding patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), the KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend considering the risk of procedural bleeding, the particular non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (non-VKA OAC) prescribed, and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) level. These factors are crucial when determining the duration of non-VKA OAC discontinuation before elective procedures.

### Anticoagulation in chronic kidney disease: From guidelines to clinical practice [^114VNHHw]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

- **Heparin treatment**: Heparin, regardless of type, is administered according to classic rules depending on the associated disorder, such as acute coronary syndrome or venous thromboembolism (VTE). Dose adjustment is necessary in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is primarily based on guideline recommendations.

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is preferred due to its short half-life, allowing the anticoagulant effect to dissipate within 1 to 4 hours, even in patients with severe renal dysfunction at high hemorrhagic risk. Additionally, there is an antidote, protamine, available to rapidly reverse the effects of UFH. Guidelines recommend UFH in severe CKD without adjustment for impaired renal clearance and interpatient variability of accumulation. However, nephrology practice advises decreasing the initial standard dose by 33% and subsequently adjusting the dose based on activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). In the non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) guideline, indications are primarily based on dose adjustments. The primary concern is the high hemorrhagic risk inherent in severe CKD.

Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) are preferred for their pharmacokinetic predictability and ease of administration without the need for monitoring. Renal clearance is indirectly proportional to molecular weight, necessitating dose adjustments in CKD stages 4 and 5. For dosage adjustment purposes, it is recommended to monitor the activity of antifactor Xa.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^114pSvy2]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Platelet activation in the extracorporeal circuit accelerates thrombin generation via the intrinsic coagulation pathway, necessitating the use of anticoagulation to prevent thrombosis. Unfractionated heparin is widely used as the standard anticoagulant due to its proven efficacy, ease of use, and long safety record, unless contraindicated by conditions such as recent or active bleeding, thrombocytopenia, heparin allergy, or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

Heparin, with a mean half-life of 1.5 hours, is typically administered as a loading dose of 1000–2000 IU, followed by a continuous infusion of 500–1500 U/h. This infusion is discontinued approximately 30 minutes before the end of the dialysis session. Monitoring can be conducted by measuring the activated partial thromboplastin time ratio (aPTTr) or the whole-blood activated clotting time, aiming for around 150% of pre-dialysis or center normal values. However, in practice, the bolus dose, infusion rate, and stopping times are adjusted empirically based on clot formation in the dialysis circuit and the time it takes for needle sites to stop bleeding. The heparin dose may need to be increased with higher hematocrit or reduced/withdrawn in patients at risk of hemorrhage or those with thrombocytopenia or on long-term anticoagulation.

Alternatively, low molecular weight heparin, which has a longer half-life, may be administered as a single "arterial limb" bolus at the start of dialysis. Although monitoring can be performed using anti-Xa activity, this option is not always available, and laboratory testing has a less direct correlation with clinical effect.

### Lovenox [^111kB7ft]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Special populations**:

	- **Gender**: Apparent clearance and Amax derived from anti-factor Xa values following single subcutaneous dosing (40 mg and 60 mg) were slightly higher in males than in females. The source of the gender difference in these parameters has not been conclusively identified; however, body weight may be a contributing factor.

	- **Geriatric**: Apparent clearance and Amax derived from anti-factor Xa values following single and multiple subcutaneous dosing in geriatric subjects were close to those observed in young subjects. Following once-a-day subcutaneous dosing of 40 mg enoxaparin, the Day 10 mean area under anti-factor Xa activity versus time curve (AUC) was approximately 15% greater than the mean Day 1 AUC value [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

	- **Renal impairment**: A linear relationship between anti-factor Xa plasma clearance and creatinine clearance at steady state has been observed, which indicates decreased clearance of enoxaparin sodium in patients with reduced renal function. Anti-factor Xa exposure represented by AUC, at steady state, is marginally increased in patients with creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min and patients with creatinine clearance 30 to < 50 mL/min after repeated subcutaneous 40 mg once-daily doses. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min), the AUC at steady state is significantly increased on average by 65% after repeated subcutaneous 40 mg once-daily doses [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

### Lovenox [^1156zo7X]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The recommended dose of Lovenox for patients with unstable angina or non–Q-wave myocardial infarction is 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously every 12 hours in conjunction with oral aspirin therapy (100 to 325 mg once daily). Treatment with Lovenox should continue for a minimum of 2 days until clinical stabilization is achieved, with a usual duration of 2 to 8 days [see warnings and precautions (5.2) and clinical studies (14.5)].

- **Treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction**: The recommended initial dose of Lovenox is a single intravenous bolus of 30 mg, coupled with a 1 mg/kg subcutaneous dose, followed by 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously every 12 hours. For the first two doses only, the maximum is 100 mg, followed by 1 mg/kg dosing for the remaining doses. The dosage should be reduced for patients aged 75 years or older [see dosage and administration (2.4)].

	- Unless contraindicated, aspirin should be administered to all patients as soon as they are identified as having STEMI, with ongoing dosing of 75 to 325 mg once daily. When administered with a thrombolytic (fibrin-specific or non–fibrin specific), Lovenox should be given between 15 minutes before and 30 minutes after the start of fibrinolytic therapy. The usual duration of Lovenox therapy is 8 days or until hospital discharge.

- **For patients managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)**: If the last subcutaneous administration of Lovenox was given less than 8 hours before balloon inflation, no additional dosing is required.

### Creatinine clearance is not equal to glomerular filtration rate and Cockcroft-Gault equation is not equal to CKD-EPI collaboration equation [^1151GG34]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) may require dose reduction or avoidance when glomerular filtration rate is low. However, glomerular filtration rate is not usually measured in routine clinical practice. Instead, equations incorporating different variables use serum creatinine to estimate either creatinine clearance in mL/min or glomerular filtration rate in mL/min/1.73 m².

The Cockcroft-Gault equation estimates creatinine clearance and incorporates weight into the equation. In contrast, the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations estimate glomerular filtration rate and incorporate ethnicity but not weight. As a result, an individual patient may have very different renal function estimates depending on the equation used.

We now highlight these differences and discuss the impact on routine clinical care for anticoagulation to prevent embolization in atrial fibrillation. Pivotal DOAC clinical trials used creatinine clearance as a criterion for patient enrollment and dose adjustment, and Federal Drug Administration recommendations are based on creatinine clearance. However, clinical biochemistry laboratories provide CKD-EPI glomerular filtration rate estimations, resulting in discrepancies between clinical trial and routine use of the drugs.

### Prevalence of renal failure and use of antithrombotic prophylaxis among medical inpatients at increased risk of venous thromboembolic events [^114s3mZT]. Thrombosis Research (2008). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines recommend the use of antithrombotic prophylaxis in medical patients at risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are usually preferred over unfractionated heparin. However, when prophylactic doses of LMWH are administered, patients with renal failure (RF) are exposed to the risk of excessive accumulation, leading to an increased risk of bleeding. We aimed to assess the prevalence of RF among medical inpatients at increased risk of VTE and the use and dosage of antithrombotic prophylaxis in these patients.

In a cross-sectional study carried out at three different hospitals, information on all medical inpatients was collected. Patients were defined as being at increased risk of VTE according to the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines. Data on the proportion of patients with RF, the use and dosage of antithrombotic prophylaxis, and the presence of contraindications to antithrombotic therapy were ascertained.

A total of 439 hospital charts were examined. Of these, 158 patients (36.0%) were defined as being at increased risk of VTE and had no contraindications to antithrombotic treatment. Thromboprophylaxis was prescribed to 61.4% of these patients. Eighty (50.7%) of them also had moderate or severe RF. There was no difference in the rate of prescription nor in the doses of antithrombotic prophylaxis between patients with and without RF (p = 0.81 and p = 0.94, respectively).

RF is frequently present in medical patients at risk of VTE. A considerable proportion of these patients may not receive adequate prophylactic treatment.

### SPL drug information for enoxaparin sodium [^112wJ1oi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of enoxaparin sodium SC (also known as Lovenox):

- **Decreased platelet count**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as thrombocytopenia can occur with the use of enoxaparin.
- **Gasping syndrome**: Use caution in infants, as enoxaparin sodium vials contain benzyl alcohol preservative.
- **Hemorrhage**: Use caution in patients undergoing PCI. If manual compression is used at the puncture site after PCI, remove the sheath 6 hours after the last enoxaparin dose. Administer the next scheduled dose no sooner than 6–8 hours after sheath removal.
- **Hemorrhage**: Use caution in patients with bleeding disorder, uncontrolled hypertension, or a history of recent gastrointestinal ulceration, diabetic retinopathy, renal dysfunction, or hemorrhage.
- **Hemorrhage**: Use extreme caution in patients at high risk of hemorrhage, including bacterial endocarditis, congenital or acquired bleeding disorders, active ulcerative or angiodysplastic gastrointestinal disease, hemorrhagic stroke, recent brain, spinal, or ophthalmologic surgery, or concomitant use of platelet inhibitors.
- **Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as enoxaparin may cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with or without thrombosis.
- **Prosthetic valve thrombosis**: Use caution in thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves, as the risk of thromboembolism is higher in this population. Obtain frequent monitoring of peak and trough anti-factor Xa levels and adjust dosage.

### Impact of renal function on outcomes with edoxaban in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^1166gxwU]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Edoxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor with 50% renal clearance, was noninferior to well-managed warfarin for stroke or systemic embolism (S/SE) prevention and reduced bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of edoxaban versus warfarin across the range of baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl) in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial (Effective Anticoagulation With Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Study 48) with a focus on the higher-dose edoxaban regimen (HDER) and the upper range of CrCl.

- **Methods**: A total of 14,071 patients with atrial fibrillation at moderate to high risk for stroke were randomized to warfarin or HDER (60 mg daily or a 50% dose reduction to 30 mg daily for CrCl 30–50 mL/min, body weight of ≤ 60 kg, or use of a potent phosphorylated glycoprotein inhibitor). CrCl 50 mL/min (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–1.04) was similar to that in patients with CrCl ≤ 50 mL/min.

### Kidney function influences warfarin responsiveness and hemorrhagic complications [^115G7Fof]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Although the management of warfarin is challenging for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), no prospective studies have compared the response to warfarin among patients with minimal, moderate, and severe CKD. This secondary analysis of a prospective cohort of 578 patients evaluated the influence of kidney function on warfarin dosage, anticoagulation control, and risk for hemorrhagic complications. We adjusted all multivariable regression and proportional hazard analyses for clinical and genetic factors.

Patients with severe CKD had an estimated GFR 4; P = 0.052 compared with patients with no, mild, or moderate CKD. Patients with severe CKD had a risk for major hemorrhage that was more than double that of patients with lesser degrees of renal dysfunction (hazard ratio 2.4, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 5.3). In conclusion, patients with reduced kidney function require lower dosages of warfarin, have poorer control of anticoagulation, and are at a higher risk for major hemorrhage. These observations suggest that warfarin may need to be initiated at a lower dosage and monitored more closely in patients with moderate or severe CKD compared with the general population. Diminished renal function may have implications for a larger proportion of warfarin users than previously estimated.

Lovenox (enoxaparin sodium) therapy appears to be safe and efficacious for pregnant women who are candidates for either prophylactic or therapeutic heparin. However, the use of enoxaparin and other low-molecular-weight heparins for therapeutic anticoagulation is not recommended for pregnant women with prosthetic heart valves. Additionally, enoxaparin should be used with caution or discontinued before the administration of an epidural for pain relief during labor.

There is a boxed warning regarding the use of enoxaparin sodium IV (also known as Lovenox) and the risk of epidural or spinal hematoma. Extreme caution is advised in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture, especially if risk factors for hemorrhage are present. These factors include an indwelling epidural catheter, concomitant use of drugs affecting hemostasis (such as NSAIDs, platelet inhibitors, or anticoagulants), a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures, or a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery. It is crucial to monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment.

### The relationship of renal function to outcome: A post hoc analysis from the Edoxaban versus warfarin in subjects undergoing cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (ENSURE-AF) study [^114KzkVh]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The ENSURE-AF study (NCT 02072434) of anticoagulation for electrical cardioversion in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) showed comparable low rates of bleeding and thromboembolism between the edoxaban and the enoxaparin-warfarin treatment arms. This post hoc analysis investigated the relationship between renal function and clinical outcomes.

- **Methods**: ENSURE-AF was a multicenter, PROBE evaluation trial of edoxaban 60 mg, or dose reduced to 30 mg/day for weight ≤ 60 kg, creatinine clearance (CrCl; Cockcroft-Gault) ≤ 50 mL/min, or concomitant P-glycoprotein inhibitors compared with therapeutically monitored enoxaparin-warfarin in 2,199 NVAF patients undergoing electrical cardioversion. Efficacy and safety outcomes and time in therapeutic range in the warfarin arm were analyzed in relation to CrCl in prespecified ranges ≥ 15 and ≤ 30, > 30 and ≤ 50, > 50 and 30 to ≤ 50 compared with 71.8% in those with CrCl ≥ 80. The odds ratios for the primary efficacy and safety endpoints were comparable for the different predefined renal function strata; given the small numbers, the 95% CI included 1.0. In the subset of those with CrCl ≥ 95, the odds ratios showed consistency with the other CrCl strata. When CrCl was assessed as a continuous variable, there was a nonsignificant trend toward a more favorable outcome.

### Severity of renal impairment in patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation: Implications for non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant dose adjustment [^11251YiG]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have varying degrees of renal elimination which may be challenging in patients with heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF). We examined the severity and variation in renal impairment, and the proportion of patients requiring NOAC cessation or dose reduction.

A retrospective analysis of patients with HF and AF in the Candesartan in Heart failure Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity programme was carried out. Trends in renal impairment over 26 months were defined using Cockcroft-Gault (CG), simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations. Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was worse at every time point in patients with AF compared with those without AF, the difference being ∼11 mL/min (CG), 9 mL/min (CKD-EPI), and 7 mL/min (MDRD). As renal function declined, CG classified a greater proportion of patients as having moderate or severe CKD and agreement with MDRD/CKD-EPI declined. At least moderate renal impairment was present in a quarter of patients with AF at baseline, a third by study completion, and approaching a half at least once during follow-up. The projected need for NOAC dose reduction was accordingly high, though it varied between individual NOACs due to different criteria for adjustment.

Renal impairment in patients with HF and AF is common, fluctuates, progresses, and frequently mandates NOAC dose reduction, though the need for cessation is rare.

### Consistency of safety profile of new oral anticoagulants in patients with renal failure [^1171Hpyc]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2014). Low credibility.

Use of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in patients with impaired renal function has raised major concerns, particularly regarding the possibility of an increased risk of bleeding due to accumulation. The aims of this work were to assess the safety of NOACs in patients with renal failure and describe the relationship between clinical events and the magnitude of drug renal excretion.

- **Methods**: All phase III trials comparing NOACs with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 50 mL min(-1) were eligible. The main safety and efficacy outcomes were major bleeding and thrombosis. A meta-regression was performed to estimate the correlation between the treatment effect estimate and the percentage of renal excretion.

- **Results**: Nine studies (12,272 patients) were included. A significantly greater relative reduction in major bleeding was seen for NOACs with renal excretion less than 50% (RR, 0.61; CI, 0.51–0.74) than for those with high renal excretion (RR, 0.96; CI, 0.85–1.07). An interaction test showed P < 0.0001. A linear relationship between the relative risk of major bleeding and the magnitude of renal excretion was found by meta-regression (R(2) = 0.66, P = 0.03). For thrombosis, a greater treatment effect of NOACs versus INR-adjusted VKAs was observed in patients with eGFR < 50 mL min(-1) (RR 0.78, CI 0.67–0.92), but no correlation between treatment effect and renal excretion was found.

- **Conclusions**: New oral anticoagulants were at least as effective as VKAs, with reduced risks of major bleeding and thrombosis in patients with eGFR < 50 mL min(-1).

### Anti-Xa activity after enoxaparin prophylaxis in hospitalized patients weighing less than fifty-five kilograms [^116eNkMo]. Thrombosis Research (2013). Low credibility.

Low-molecular-weight heparins are commonly used for the prophylaxis of thromboembolic disease. In contrast to therapeutic doses, recommended prophylactic doses are fixed (i.e. 40 mg/day enoxaparin). Dosing of patients with extreme body weights has not been well studied, especially dosing of low-weight patients.

- **Objectives**: To establish the anti-Xa activity that results from 40 mg/day enoxaparin in inpatients with a body weight of ≤ 55 kg.

- **Patients/methods**: A cross-sectional study including inpatients older than 18 years, with a body weight of ≤ 55 kg, and whose treating physician found indication for 40 mg/day enoxaparin. We excluded patients with renal failure and those using oral anticoagulants. Anti-Xa activity was measured 3 hours after the second dose of enoxaparin. Statistical analyses were conducted to determine the effect of body weight on anti-Xa levels.

- **Results**: The average age was 72.5 years (interquartile range, 30) and the median body weight was 49.7 kg (interquartile range, 7). Twenty-five percent of patients weighed ≤ 45 kg, 37.5% weighed 46–50 kg, and 37.5% weighed 51–55 kg. The mean anti-Xa activity was 0.54 ± 0.18 IU/ml, and 60% of the patients exhibited activity ≥ 0.5 IU/ml. Weight and anti-Xa activity inversely correlated (Spearman's rho = -0.428, p = 0.001). Patients weighing ≤ 45 kg exhibited higher anti-Xa activity (0.61 ± 0.18 IU/ml, p = 0.008) than heavier patients and had an odds ratio of 8 for an anti-Xa level ≥ 0.5 IU/ml (95% CI: 1.42–45.06).

- **Conclusions**: Anti-factor Xa activity rises significantly when body weight decreases. Patients of low weight, especially those w

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^115bGynt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Currently available non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are primarily renally excreted. Dabigatran is 80% renally excreted, while the renal excretion of factor Xa inhibitors ranges between 6% and 13% for betrixaban, and 50% for edoxaban. Clinical trials included patients with mild to moderate renal disease, who were typically assigned a lower study dose. Rivaroxaban at 15 mg once per day and edoxaban at 30 mg once per day were used in patients with creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL/min. The dose of apixaban was reduced to 2.5 mg twice daily in the presence of 2 of 3 factors: age over 80 years, weight under 60 kg, or creatinine 1.5 mg/dL or greater. The proportion of patients with moderate renal disease (creatinine clearance of 30–49 mL/min) enrolled in these trials ranged between 15% and 21%.

In a study of 14,264 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and creatinine clearance of 30 to 49 mL/min, rivaroxaban at 15 mg per day had similar efficacy and safety compared with dose-adjusted warfarin. A meta-analysis of 10 trials and 40,693 patients with creatinine clearance of 30 to 49 mL/min suggested that NOACs are noninferior to standard anticoagulation and are associated with less bleeding. However, clinical trials excluded patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min for dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban, and less than 25 mL/min for apixaban) and those on dialysis. There are limited data on the efficacy and safety of NOACs in these patient populations. Despite the dearth of data, there is a reported increase in the number of NOAC prescriptions.

### Incomplete reversal of enoxaparin toxicity by protamine: Implications of renal insufficiency, obesity, and low molecular weight heparin sulfate content [^115WGZn2]. Obesity Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is increasing throughout North America and Europe for several reasons: ease of use, predictable dose response, and reduced incidence of heparin-associated thrombocytopenia. However, in addition to increased costs, LMWH has significant potential drawbacks, including poor reversibility, tendency to accumulate in renal insufficiency, and limited experience in patient subsets such as those with morbid obesity.

We report a case of a postoperative morbidly obese patient who developed enoxaparin toxicity secondary to acute renal failure, which did not reverse with protamine sulfate infusion. We also review the use of LMWH in renal insufficiency, dosing in obese patients, and the importance of sulfate content in the efficacy of protamine sulfate as a reversing agent for LMWH.

### No difference in bleeding risk between subcutaneous enoxaparin and heparin for thromboprophylaxis in end-stage renal disease [^115WbVEh]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight form of heparin, is not approved for use in dialysis patients in the United States because it is eliminated through the kidneys and could therefore accumulate and cause inadvertent bleeding. Accordingly, it is unknown if enoxaparin is as safe to prescribe as subcutaneous heparin for thromboprophylaxis in patients with chronic renal failure. Here, we conducted a retrospective comparative effectiveness study in a large population of chronic maintenance dialysis patients initiated with subcutaneous injections of enoxaparin or heparin for thromboprophylaxis. The primary study endpoint was hospitalization or death related to bleeding, with a secondary endpoint of venous thromboembolism.

Among 7,721 dialysis patients started on subcutaneous enoxaparin or heparin at doses for thromboprophylaxis, the crude rate for bleeding requiring hospitalization or resulting in death was 15.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 12.7–18.2) events per 100 patient-years in the enoxaparin group, which did not differ from the heparin group, in which the crude rate was 16.2 (95% CI 14.0–18.7) events per 100 patient-years. In risk factor-adjusted Poisson models, enoxaparin was not associated with more bleeding in comparison to heparin (risk ratio, 0.98; 95% CI 0.78–1.23). The risk of venous thromboembolism was not associatively worse with enoxaparin (risk ratio, 0.77; 95% CI 0.49–1.22). Thus, in dialysis patients, daily enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis was not associated with increased serious bleeding or less effective compared to subcutaneous heparin.

### Evaluating residual anti-xa levels following discontinuation of treatment-dose enoxaparin in patients presenting for elective surgery: a prospective observational trial [^116RtQ1i]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Prior studies have demonstrated that patients presenting for elective surgery may have higher-than-expected residual anti-Xa level activity at or beyond 24 hours following their last treatment dose of enoxaparin. Given that 24 hours of abstinence is currently recommended by both European and American societies before the performance of neuraxial or deep anesthetic/analgesic procedures, determining the actual timeframe at which residual anti-Xa level activity reliably falls below 0.2 IU/mL, the lower limit of the target range for thromboprophylaxis, is critical.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective observational trial. Consenting patients on treatment-dose enoxaparin were randomized to either a 24-hour group (last dose at 07:00 the day prior to surgery) or a 36-hour group (last dose at 19:00 two days prior to surgery). On arrival for surgery, blood samples were obtained to assess residual anti-Xa level activity and renal function. The primary outcome was residual anti-Xa level activity following the last treatment dose of enoxaparin. Incorporating all patients, linear regression modeling was performed to predict the time point at which the level of anti-Xa activity reliably fell below 0.2 IU/mL.

- **Results**: A total of 103 patients were analyzed. The time from the last dose at which residual anti-Xa activity fell below 0.2 IU/mL, based on the upper bound of the 95% CI, was 31.5 hours. No correlation was found overall between age, renal function, or sex.

- **Conclusion**: Residual levels of anti-Xa activity do not reliably fall below 0.2 IU/mL 24 hours following discontinuation of treatment-dose enoxaparin.

### Use of enoxaparin in end-stage renal disease [^1113UWjo]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Enoxaparin has become the treatment of choice for various thromboembolic diseases. In most patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), prophylactic dosage of enoxaparin does not appear to be associated with an increased bleeding risk and can be used without the need for monitoring and adjustment of regimens. However, empirical dose adjustment and biological monitoring seem to be necessary when using therapeutic doses. Anti-factor Xa levels poorly predict the degree of anticoagulation in ESRD patients given enoxaparin.

Regarding the use of enoxaparin sodium SC (also known as Lovenox) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if clearly needed. Exercise caution for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves, as the risk of thromboembolism is higher in this population, with reported cases of prosthetic valve thrombosis in patients receiving enoxaparin. Obtain frequent monitoring of peak and trough anti-factor Xa levels and adjust the dosage as necessary.

The drug enoxaparin sodium SC (also known as Lovenox) is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### Safety and efficacy of low-dose fondaparinux (1.5 mg) for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in acutely ill medical patients with renal impairment: The FONDAIR study [^1151uhue]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2012). Low credibility.

Renal impairment is common, affecting around 40% of acutely ill medical patients, and is associated with an increased risk of both venous thromboembolism (VTE) and bleeding. The clinical benefit of effective thromboprophylactic strategies may be outweighed in these patients by an excessive rate of hemorrhage.

- **Objective**: To assess the safety and efficacy of lower prophylactic doses of fondaparinux in acutely ill medical patients with renal impairment.

- **Patients/Methods**: We carried out a multicenter, investigator-initiated, prospective cohort study. Patients at risk of VTE with a creatinine clearance between 20 and 50 mL min(-1) were treated with fondaparinux 1.5 mg qd for a minimum of 6 to a maximum of 15 days. The primary outcome was the incidence of major bleeding; secondary outcomes were clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) and symptomatic VTE.

- **Results**: We enrolled 206 patients with a mean age of 82 years, mean creatinine clearance of 33 mL min(-1), and a mean Charlson co-morbidity index of 8.2. One patient had major bleeding (0.49%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.03–3.10), eight had CRNMB (3.88%, 95% CI 1.81–7.78), and three developed symptomatic VTE (1.46%, 95% CI 0.38–4.55). Twenty-three patients (11.17%, 95% CI 7.36–16.48) died. No independent predictors of bleeding were found at univariate analysis.

- **Conclusions**: The addition of moderate to severe renal impairment to patients with traditional risk factors for VTE identified a population of very elderly acutely ill medical patients potentially at high risk of both VTE and bleeding complications.

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^112cLD57]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Another area of uncertainty is the use of NOACs in patients whose renal function fluctuates widely over time or who are at heightened risk for acute kidney injury, such as patients with advanced heart failure. Patients with AF and a ≥ 25% relative decrease in their estimated glomerular filtration rate had a 2-fold higher risk of ischemic stroke. Acute and chronic renal dysfunction is common among individuals requiring long-term anticoagulant therapy. Patients with impaired renal function represent a distinct high-risk group, and there are limited data on what the optimal strategy of anticoagulation should be.

### Warfarin dosing in patients with impaired kidney function [^1168boWk]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

In patients with kidney impairment, warfarin, a drug metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P-450 system, is initiated at similar doses and managed similarly as in the general medical population. Unfortunately, few data exist to guide dose adjustment in patients with decreased kidney function. Here, we determine the degree of warfarin dose reduction associated with kidney impairment and make recommendations for warfarin dosing.

- **Study design**: Cross-sectional analysis.

- **Setting & participants**: Long-term warfarin users followed up at anticoagulation clinics (n = 980), with 708 participants from the University of Alabama (UAB) and 272 participants from the University of Chicago (UIC).

- **Predictor**: No/mild (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), moderate (eGFR, 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m²), and severe (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) kidney impairment; CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype; age; race; sex; body mass; sociodemographic factors; smoking status; alcohol; vitamin K intake; comorbid conditions (e.g. congestive heart failure); and drug interactions (e.g. amiodarone and statins).

- **Outcome & measurement**: Warfarin dose (milligrams per day) was evaluated using linear regression after adjustment for clinical, demographic, and genetic factors.

- **Results**: Prevalences of moderate (31.8% and 27.6%) and severe kidney impairment (8.9% and 6.6%) were similar in the UAB and UIC cohorts. Warfarin dose requirements were significantly lower in patients with moderate and severe kidney impairment compared with those with no/mild kidney impairment in the UAB (P < 0.001).

### Higher doses of low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin) are needed to achieve target anti-xa concentrations in critically ill children [^117FSp8c]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The study aimed to demonstrate that low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin) can be used in critically ill pediatric patients to achieve target anti-factor Xa concentrations and to determine appropriate dosing corrected for age and illness severity.

This retrospective cohort study was conducted in a single tertiary level Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). The study included 192 children aged from 1 day to 18 years who were admitted to the PICU and underwent every 12-hour enoxaparin therapy with at least one anti-factor Xa concentration obtained. Patients who were receiving renal replacement therapy or infants with a corrected gestational age of less than 37 weeks were excluded from the study.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Measurements and main results**: Patient characteristics were collected, including age, weight, height/length, gender, corrected gestational age, illness severity markers, diagnosis, creatinine levels, enoxaparin dose and times of administration, anti-factor Xa concentrations, and collection times. Only 42% of critically ill children (80 of 192) and 29% of children (9 of 31) on inotropes achieved the recommended target range of anti-factor Xa concentrations on the initial recommended enoxaparin dosing (1.5 mg/kg/dose). However, 81% were ultimately within the target range with dose titration. An increased enoxaparin dose was required to reach target concentrations in younger patients and those with more severe illness, as evidenced by the use of inotropes, previous ICU admissions, mechanical ventilation, cardiac surgery, and increased risk of mortality defined by severity-of-illness scores.

In conclusion, enoxaparin can be used effectively in critically ill children with appropriate dose adjustments to achieve target anti-factor Xa concentrations.

### Nesina [^111tMKK2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: The recommended dosage in patients with normal renal function or mild renal impairment is 25 mg orally once daily. Nesina can be taken with or without food. Adjust the dosage if there is moderate or severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

- **Recommended dosage**: The recommended dosage of Nesina is 25 mg taken orally once daily. Do not split tablets. Nesina may be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Instruct patients that if a dose is missed, they should not double their next dose.

- **Patients with renal impairment**: Assess renal function prior to the initiation of Nesina and periodically thereafter [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. No dose adjustment of Nesina is necessary for patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] ≥ 60 mL/min). The dose of Nesina is 12.5 mg once daily for patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min). The dose of Nesina is 6.25 mg once daily for patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl ≥ 15 to < 30 mL/min) or with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (CrCl < 15 mL/min or requiring hemodialysis). Nesina may be administered without regard to the timing of dialysis. Nesina has not been studied in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Prophylactic anticoagulation with enoxaparin: Is the subcutaneous route appropriate in the critically ill [^112J2WnH]. Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Subcutaneously administered low-molecular-weight heparins are widely used for the prevention of venous thromboembolism, but the appropriateness of the subcutaneous route in critically ill patients has never been established.

- **Objective**: To determine anti-Xa activities in critically ill patients and in noncritically ill patients receiving prophylactic doses of subcutaneous enoxaparin.

- **Design**: Prospective, controlled, open-labeled study.

- **Setting**: Tertiary medical-cardiologic-postoperative intensive care unit and a general medical ward at a university hospital.

- **Patients**: A total of 16 intensive care unit patients (group 1; age, 61.1 ± 16 years; male/female ratio, 7/9; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, 20.9 ± 7; mechanical ventilation, n = 15; vasopressors, n = 13) and 13 noncritically ill medical patients (group 2; age, 61.7 ± 9 years; male/female ratio, 7/6) were studied. Body mass index (25.7 ± 5 vs. 24 ± 6 kg/m², p = not significant) was comparable, and serum creatinine levels (0.83 ± 0.25 vs. 1.07 ± 0.3 mg/dL, group 1 vs. 2) were within the normal range in both groups. Patients with impaired renal function, receiving hemofiltration, or requiring therapeutic anticoagulation were not eligible.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Measurements and main results**: Anti-Xa activities were determined at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 12 hours following a single daily subcutaneous dose of 40 mg enoxaparin on day 1 and at 3 hours after 40 mg of enoxaparin on days 2–5. Mean anti-Xa levels at 0 to 12 hours were consistently lower in group 1 compared with group 2 by analysis of variance.

### Creatinine clearance may predict goal enoxaparin dose in trauma [^112eVe48]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Guidelines for enoxaparin dosing after trauma recommend an initial dose of 40 mg twice daily for most patients, with adjustments based on anti-Xa levels. Previous studies have shown that higher enoxaparin doses are necessary in patients with higher levels of creatinine clearance (CrCl). This study aimed to determine if the goal enoxaparin dose correlates with admission CrCl, potentially reducing the need to measure anti-Xa levels.

- **Study design**: A retrospective review was conducted at an urban, academic Level 1 trauma center from April 2017 to February 2020. Patients who started on enoxaparin and reached goal anti-Xa trough levels were included, while patients who did not achieve these levels were excluded. Data collected included patient demographics, injury characteristics, admission CrCl, and final enoxaparin dose. CrCl was then correlated with the final enoxaparin dose.

- **Results**: Out of 421 patients included, the mean age was 46.6 years, and 73% were male. The median goal enoxaparin dose was 40 mg twice daily. The mean CrCl significantly increased with increasing twice-daily doses of enoxaparin (20 mg: 69.2 mL/min; 30 mg: 89 mL/min; 40 mg: 112.8 mL/min; 50 mg: 140.5 mL/min; 60 mg: 147.4 mL/min; and 70 mg: 140 mL/min; p < 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: Admission CrCl may predict the enoxaparin dose required to achieve adequate anti-Xa levels. Our data suggest that CrCls of approximately 70, 90, 110, 140, and 150 mL/min may predict the twice-daily enoxaparin doses of 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 mg, respectively. CrCl dosing guidance may reduce the time to reach goal anti-Xa levels and the frequency of adjustments needed.

### Acog committee opinion: safety of Lovenox in pregnancy [^113pDCmd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Lovenox (enoxaparin sodium) therapy appears to be safe and efficacious for pregnant women who are candidates for either prophylactic or therapeutic heparin. However, the use of enoxaparin and other low-molecular-weight heparins for therapeutic anticoagulation is not recommended for pregnant women with prosthetic heart valves. Additionally, enoxaparin should be used with caution or discontinued before the administration of an epidural for pain relief during labor.

### Lovenox [^117CY3Dj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Recommended dosage for geriatric patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction**: For the treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in geriatric patients aged 75 years and older, do not use an initial intravenous bolus. Initiate dosing with 0.75 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours (maximum 75 mg for the first two doses only, followed by 0.75 mg/kg dosing for the remaining doses). No dose adjustment is necessary for other indications in geriatric patients unless kidney function is impaired.

- **Administration**: Do not administer Lovenox by intramuscular injection. Administer Lovenox by intravenous or subcutaneous injection only. Lovenox is a clear, colorless to pale yellow sterile solution, and as with other parenteral drug products, it should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Use a tuberculin syringe or equivalent when using Lovenox multiple-dose vials to ensure withdrawal of the appropriate volume of drug. Patients may self-inject by the subcutaneous route of administration only after their physicians determine that it is appropriate, and with medical follow-up as necessary. Provide proper training in subcutaneous injection technique before allowing self-injection (with or without the assistance of an injection device).

### Anticoagulation in chronic kidney disease: from guidelines to clinical practice [^116h6rrP]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Heparin‐based anticoagulation presents challenges in patients undergoing dialysis, as poor anticoagulation can affect the quality of the dialysis session. Patients frequently receive oral anticoagulants (OACs) or platelet antiaggregants, making systemic anticoagulation a sensitive matter in long‐term hemodialysis. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is used according to a classic protocol, while low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) are administered as a bolus dose at the start of dialysis. Heparin‐like molecules are used in particular situations. The approach to LMWH use in hemodialysis patients varies. The FDA has not approved their use in the United States, while other local guidelines either recommend them or do not provide clear indications. According to several small‐scale studies and a meta‐analysis published in 2004, LMWHs appear to be safe and as effective as UFH. For these reasons, a protocol for the prospective monitoring and use of heparin‐based anticoagulation in hemodialysis patients with VTE was initiated in 2015 and is still ongoing.

Oral anticoagulation is necessary in severe CKD and ESRD, but evidence is inconsistent, often of unsatisfactory quality, and highlights the potentiation of hemorrhagic risks. While there is available data for warfarin, data for direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are entirely inconclusive. In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), existing guidelines diverge. The American guideline recommends warfarin even in dialysis patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 and an INR between 2 and 3 (class IIa, level of evidence B), and it does not allow the use of dabigatran and rivaroxaban.

### Arixtra [^1134jx4W]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Arixtra increases the risk of bleeding in adult patients who have impaired renal function due to reduced clearance. Clinical trials reporting the incidence of major bleeding by renal function status in adult patients receiving Arixtra for VTE surgical prophylaxis are summarized in Table 4. The following recommendations are made for these patient populations:

- **Renal function and bleeding risk**:
	- Do not use Arixtra for VTE prophylaxis and treatment in patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of less than 30 mL/min.
	- Arixtra may cause prolonged anticoagulation in patients with a CrCl of 30 mL/min to 50 mL/min.
	- Assess renal function periodically in patients receiving Arixtra. Discontinue the drug immediately in patients who develop severe renal impairment while on therapy. After discontinuation, the anticoagulant effects of Arixtra may persist for 2 to 4 days in patients with normal renal function (i.e. at least 3 to 5 half-lives); it may persist even longer in those with renal impairment.

- **Body weight and bleeding risk**:
	- Arixtra increases the risk for bleeding in adults who weigh less than 50 kg compared to those with higher weights.
	- In adults weighing less than 50 kg, do not administer Arixtra as prophylactic therapy for those undergoing hip fracture, hip replacement, or knee replacement surgery and abdominal surgery.

### Lovenox [^112eAoMP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with or without thrombosis**: Lovenox may cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITTS). HITTS may lead to organ infarction, limb ischemia, or death. Close monitoring of thrombocytopenia of any degree is essential. The use of Lovenox in patients with a history of immune-mediated HIT within the past 100 days, or in the presence of circulating antibodies, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. Circulating antibodies may persist for several years. Lovenox should only be used in patients with a history of HIT if more than 100 days have passed since the prior HIT episode and no circulating antibodies are present. Since HIT may still occur under these circumstances, using Lovenox must be contingent upon a careful benefit-risk assessment after considering non-heparin alternative treatments.

- **Thrombocytopenia**: Thrombocytopenia can occur with Lovenox administration. Moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet counts between 100,000/mm³ and 50,000/mm³) occurred at a rate of 1.3% for patients given Lovenox, compared to 1.2% for those given heparin, and 0.7% for those given a placebo in clinical trials. Platelet counts less than 50,000/mm³ occurred at a rate of 0.1% in patients given Lovenox, 0.2% in patients given heparin, and 0.4% in patients given placebo in the same trials. Close monitoring of thrombocytopenia of any degree is important. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm³, Lovenox should be discontinued.

### Individualized compared with conventional dosing of enoxaparin [^114TrbJR]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare an individualized dosing regimen for enoxaparin to conventional dosing. Patients in the individualized arm were initially dosed according to weight, with patients weighing fewer than 100 kg dosed based on total body weight and those weighing 100 kg or more using lean body weight. Doses were adjusted at 48 hours based on renal function. Patients in the conventional arm received enoxaparin according to standard practice.

Dose-individualized patients experienced fewer bleeding events (primary endpoint: relative risk (RR) = 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.01–0.89, P = 0.03) and composite bleeding and bruising events (secondary endpoint: RR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.12–0.71, P = 0.003) compared to those receiving conventional dosing. In both arms of the study, there were no thromboembolic events during treatment, and no deaths occurred at 30 days. Dose individualization of enoxaparin significantly reduces the prevalence of bleeding and bruising events without an apparent loss in effectiveness.

Elevations of serum aminotransferases

Asymptomatic increases in aspartate (AST [SGOT]) and alanine (ALT [SGPT]) aminotransferase levels greater than three times the upper limit of normal in the laboratory reference range have been reported in up to 6.1% and 5.9% of patients, respectively, during treatment with Lovenox.

Since aminotransferase determinations are important in the differential diagnosis of myocardial infarction, liver disease, and pulmonary emboli, elevations that might be caused by drugs like Lovenox should be interpreted with caution.

- **Local reactions**: Local irritation, pain, hematoma, ecchymosis, and erythema may follow subcutaneous injection of Lovenox.

- **Adverse reactions in patients receiving Lovenox for prophylaxis or treatment of DVT and PE**: Other adverse reactions that were thought to be possibly or probably related to treatment with Lovenox, heparin, or placebo in clinical trials with patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, abdominal or colorectal surgery, or treatment for DVT and that occurred at a rate of at least 2% in the Lovenox group are provided below (see Tables 8 to 11).

- **Adverse events in Lovenox-treated patients with unstable angina or non–Q-wave myocardial infarction**: Non-hemorrhagic clinical events reported to be related to Lovenox therapy occurred at an incidence of ≤ 1%.

Non-major hemorrhagic events, primarily injection site ecchymosis and hematomas, were more frequently reported in patients treated with subcutaneous Lovenox than in patients treated with intravenous heparin.

### Lovenox [^117VUb63]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In the context of geriatric use for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis in hip, knee, and abdominal surgery, as well as for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and prevention of ischemic complications of unstable angina and non–Q-wave myocardial infarction, more than 2800 patients aged 65 years and older have received Lovenox in clinical trials. The efficacy of Lovenox in the geriatric population (≥ 65 years) was comparable to that observed in younger patients (< 65 years).

The incidence of bleeding complications was similar between geriatric and younger patients when using Lovenox at doses of 30 mg every 12 hours or 40 mg once a day. However, the incidence was higher in geriatric patients compared to younger patients when Lovenox was administered at doses of 1.5 mg/kg once a day or 1 mg/kg every 12 hours. The risk of Lovenox-associated bleeding increased with age, and serious adverse events were also more frequent with increasing age among those receiving Lovenox.

Other clinical experiences, including postmarketing surveillance and literature reports, have not identified additional differences in the safety of Lovenox between geriatric and younger patients. Careful attention to dosing intervals and concomitant medications, particularly antiplatelet medications, is recommended. Lovenox should be used cautiously in geriatric patients who may have delayed elimination of enoxaparin. Monitoring should be considered for geriatric patients with low body weight (< 45 kg) and those predisposed to decreased renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Anticoagulation in patients with chronic kidney disease [^114DMw45]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

In the RE-COVER trial, VTE and VTE-related deaths decreased with declining kidney function: HR 0.75 (95% CI: 0.31–1.84) for patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30–50 mL/min versus > 80 mL/min. This reduction was predominantly seen in those randomized to receive dabigatran and was postulated to be related to the increase in drug exposure. However, in a post hoc analysis of the EINSTEIN-DVT and EINSTEIN-PE trials comparing rivaroxaban with warfarin, the recurrent VTE rates for both treatments combined increased with declining kidney function from 1.8% (CrCl ≥ 80 mL/min) to 2.8% (CrCl 50–79 mL/min) and 3.3% (CrCl 30–49 mL/min). In regard to bleeding event rates, they increased with declining kidney function in both treatment arms in the RE-COVER trial but only in the VKA arm in the EINSTEIN trials.

- **Principles of anticoagulation in VTE**: Anticoagulation treatment in VTE is divided into three phases: acute (5–10 days), chronic (≤ 3 months), and extended anticoagulation phase (> 3 months). The goal of the acute phase treatment is thrombus stabilization with the prevention of thrombotic extension and development of high risk or fatal pulmonary embolism. Conventionally, it involves parenteral anticoagulation with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux for at least 5 days. Dabigatran, edoxaban, and VKAs require parenteral anticoagulation in the acute phase, whereas apixaban and rivaroxaban can be initiated at higher doses (1 week for apixaban and 3 weeks for rivaroxaban), bypassing the need for parenteral anticoagulation. The purpose of the maintenance phase is to complete treatment.
