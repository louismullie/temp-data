## Question

21. A segment of constant length "slides" with its ends along two mutually perpendicular intersecting lines. What line does the midpoint of the segment describe?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what curve the midpoint of a constant-length segment traces as its endpoints slide along two mutually perpendicular intersecting lines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about setting up a coordinate system and parameterizing the endpoints. Then, I should derive the coordinates of the midpoint in terms of a single parameter. Next, I will eliminate the parameter to find the implicit equation of the locus. After that, I should verify the geometric interpretation and identify the curve. Finally, I will consider special cases and confirm the result with a quick sanity check.

> Let me first set up the geometry. I will place the two perpendicular lines along the x- and y-axes, intersecting at the origin, and let the segment have constant length L. The endpoints can be parameterized as A = (a, 0) on the x-axis and B = (0, b) on the y-axis, with the constraint that the distance AB equals L, so a² + b² = L². Wait, let me verify that constraint: yes, by the distance formula, √(a² + b²) = L implies a² + b² = L², which I will keep in mind as I proceed.

> Next, I should find the midpoint M. The midpoint coordinates are the average of the endpoints, so M = ((a + 0)/2, (0 + b)/2) = (a/2, b/2). Hold on, I should verify that calculation: yes, that's correct. Let me denote the midpoint coordinates as (x, y), so x = a/2 and y = b/2, which means a = 2x and b = 2y.

> Now I will substitute a and b into the length constraint to eliminate the parameters. Substituting a = 2x and b = 2y into a² + b² = L² gives (2x)² + (2y)² = L², which simplifies to 4x² + 4y² = L², and then to x² + y² = (L/2)². Wait, let me double-check the algebra: yes, dividing by 4 yields x² + y² = (L/2)², which is the equation of a circle centered at the origin with radius L/2.

> I should confirm the geometric interpretation. The equation x² + y² = (L/2)² describes a circle centered at the origin with radius L/2. That means the midpoint traces a circle whose diameter is exactly the constant length L of the segment. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify that this makes intuitive sense. When the segment is aligned along the x-axis, the midpoint is at (L/2, 0), and when aligned along the y-axis, it is at (0, L/2), both of which lie on this circle, which supports the result.

> But wait, what if the two perpendicular lines are not the axes? Let me consider the general case. If the perpendicular lines intersect at some point and are rotated, the midpoint will still trace a circle because the problem is invariant under translation and rotation of the coordinate system. The center will be at the intersection point and the radius will remain L/2, so the conclusion generalizes to any pair of perpendicular intersecting lines. I should confirm that this is consistent with the algebraic derivation: yes, translating and rotating the axes would preserve the distance constraint and thus the same circular locus would emerge relative to the new origin.

> Final answer: The midpoint of the constant-length segment describes a circle centered at the intersection of the two perpendicular lines with radius equal to half the length of the segment. I should double-check that I've stated the radius correctly: since x² + y² = (L/2)², the radius is indeed L/2, so the diameter is L, which matches the segment length, and that completes the derivation.

The midpoint of a segment of constant length sliding with its ends on two mutually perpendicular lines traces a **circle** centered at the intersection of the lines, with radius equal to half the segment length. This is a classic result in geometry, often derived using coordinate geometry or vector methods.

---

## Geometric setup

Let the two mutually perpendicular lines be the **x-axis and y-axis** of a Cartesian coordinate system, intersecting at the origin (O(0, 0)). Let the segment have constant length (L), with endpoints (A) and (B) sliding along the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. The coordinates of the endpoints are (A(a, 0)) and (B(0, b)), where (a) and (b) are real numbers that vary as the segment slides.

---

## Derivation of the midpoint locus

The midpoint (M) of the segment (AB) has coordinates:

M(a/2, b/2)

Since the length of the segment is constant, the distance between (A) and (B) is:

√(a² + b²) = L

Squaring both sides gives:

a² + b² = L²

Substituting (a = 2x) and (b = 2y), where ((x, y)) are the coordinates of the midpoint (M), yields:

(2x)² + (2y)² = L²

Simplifying this equation results in:

4x² + 4y² = L²

x² + y² = (L/2)²

This is the equation of a **circle** centered at the origin ((0, 0)) with radius (L/2).

---

## Geometric interpretation

The equation x² + y² = (L/2)² represents a **circle** centered at the intersection of the two perpendicular lines (the origin) with radius equal to half the length of the segment. As the segment slides, the midpoint continuously traces this circle.

---

## Alternative derivation using vectors

Alternatively, using vector notation, let the position vectors of the endpoints be (A = (a, 0)) and (B = (0, b)). The midpoint vector (M) is:

M = [(A + B)/2] = (a/2, b/2)

The constant length condition (|A − B| = L) implies:

√(a² + b²) = L

Substituting (a = 2x) and (b = 2y) again yields the same circle equation, confirming the result.

---

## Conclusion

The midpoint of a segment of constant length sliding with its ends on two mutually perpendicular lines traces a **circle** centered at the intersection of the lines, with radius equal to half the segment length. This result is a fundamental property of Euclidean geometry and has applications in various fields, including mechanical engineering and computer graphics.

### Is the middle between both halves? midpoint location and segment size estimation in neglect [^b7e5475a]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Line bisection errors in neglect are attributed to perceptual size distortions. In order to compare the two segments of the line to determine if they are equal, one might first estimate the location of a midpoint that defines the two line segments to be compared.

Objectives

The authors attempted to determine whether estimating a line's midpoint can be dissociated from comparing the two segments of this line, and if so, what the relative contribution of each of these tasks is to the perceptual bias in neglect.

Methods

The authors studied two patients with hemispatial neglect from right hemisphere lesions by asking them where bisection marks were placed on prebisected lines and whether the two adjacent line segments were equal.

Results

There was a stronger bias judging the position of the bisecting marks ("where" determination) than comparing the size of two adjacent line segments.

Conclusions

These results suggest that perceptual size distortion of line segments alone cannot explain the subjects' line bisection bias, but postperceptual deficits in "where" computations may better account for their errors locating the midpoint. "Where" determinations might require more attentional capacity, depend more heavily on viewer-centered allocation of attention, and be mediated by the right hemisphere's "where" dorsal stream. In contrast, comparing the length of two segments might be mediated by the left hemisphere's "what" ventral stream.

In our model, the position of the germ band corresponds to the position of the last particle in the curve on the semi-ellipse that represents the embryonic blastoderm. The extent of the germ band is given by, which is the projection of the germ band arc length onto the mid-axis of the embryo normalized by the embryo length. When, the tissue is free of stretching stress, but at any other, the blastoderm will be compressed. The preferred lengths of the individual springs are obtained by dividing the elliptical arc length intoequal segments. The length of each segment is given by. To find the initial lengths of the springs, we usedwhereand the anglecorresponds to the position of the blastoderm end.is obtained for a given value ofby. Here we obtained the initial lengths by dividing the compressed blastoderm intoequal segments. For any simulation, the value ofis constant (the blastoderm end is static in position). To model mitotic domains, we introduced new particles and springs on the midpoints between two particles in specific regions of length. The new springs were given the sameas the rest of the springs in the tissue. The blastoderm is confined by a rigid boundary in the shape of a semi-ellipse. Any particle that lands outside this boundary at any timestep was repositioned onto the rigid boundary. This new position was prescribed by taking the intersection point of the rigid boundary curve and the line segment that connects the position before this iteration (which was inside or on the vitelline envelope) and the position outside the vitelline envelope. Finally, we defined and counted a fold when we found that the distance of a particle from the rigid boundary is greater than a threshold value. To calculate this threshold, we measured the maximum distance that particles can achieve when the tissue is in a stress-free state. This threshold was calculated to be. The code for the model and the simulation data are available in the theory repository on Zenodo.

The residuals from these regressions revealed LC voxels that were remote from the straight line estimating the LC structure (Figure 3 shows these fit lines, revealing an idealized LC for all participants and Table S3 reports the angles of these lines relative to the y‐axis). The vast majority of LC voxels were close to these fit lines, for instance, on the left side 96.1% of voxels were within 1 voxel diameter of the fit line in the x‐dimension in the TSE version and 91.7% in the MT version. The proportion of outlier voxels was even lower in the y‐dimension (Table 4). The amount of error tended to be larger for LC voxels on the rostral and caudal ends (Sections 1 and 5) compared to the middle LC section (Section 3; see Table S4).

Noise-reduction in pairwise alignments for subsequent segmentation

Pairwise alignments are retrieved from minimap2 in. paf format, in which each alignment can be interpreted as a four-dimensional vector from start (query-start/target-start) to end (query-end/target-end) coordinates. To prepare subsequent compression steps, alignments are pre-processed in multiple ways: First, alignments are filtered by a minimum length threshold (l), removing very short alignments. Second, alignment breakpoint coordinates are rounded in x and y direction to the closest multiple of a rounding parameter (r). Finally, alignment vectors are shortened along the x or y axis in case they do not have a slope of exactly 1 or -1 until they do so. The choice of r and l directly influence the expected dimensionality and complexity of the segmented dotplot. To maximize information content while limiting the size of segmented dotplots, we set l and r to be stepwise functions of the sequence length:
l = r = 100 for sequences smaller than 50 kbp
l = r = 1.000 for sequences between 50 kbp and 500 kbp
l = r = 10.000 for sequences between 500 kbp and 5 Mbp
l = r = 20.000 for sequences larger or equal to 5 Mbp

Alignment segmentation and dotplot condensation

A custom algorithm converts the pairwise alignment returned by minimap2 into a segmented representation (NAHRwhals step 3) which facilitates downstream analysis and implicitly identifies repeat pairs required for subsequent steps. Following noise-reduction, borders, or 'gridlines', separating unique sequence blocks, are inferred in an iterative way (Fig. S3). In the first iteration, horizontal and vertical gridlines are drawn starting from each start- or endpoint of any alignment. In every subsequent step, overlaps between existing gridlines and alignments are determined, with the points of overlaps serving as a new source for spawning a new gridline in perpendicular direction. This process is repeated until no new gridlines can be spawned. In rare cases where the determined grid exceeds predefined maximum dimensions (default: n_rows + n_cols ≤ 250; n_alignments ≤ 150), the parameters for minimum alignment length (l) and rounding (r) are doubled until dimension requirements are met. Any sequence interval between two gridlines is then considered a segment, and any pairwise alignment can be expressed as a matrix of alignment of segments (x: Ref, y: Query) (Fig. S3B).

### Line versus representational bisections in unilateral spatial neglect [^f07646ab]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2000). Low credibility.

Objectives

To clarify the mechanisms of left unilateral spatial neglect found in the bisection of lines after cueing to the left end point and to determine whether neglect occurs for the mental representation of a line.

Methods

A new representational bisection task was developed to eliminate the influence of the right segment of the physical line that would attract attention. Eight patients with typical left unilateral spatial neglect underwent line and representational bisection tasks on a computer display with a touch panel. In the line bisection with cueing, they bisected a line after touching the left end point. In the representational bisection, the patients were presented with a line until they touched the left end point. On the blank display, they pointed to the subjective midpoint of the erased line. The performances of the two bisection tasks were compared when the length and position of stimulus lines were varied.

Results

The rightward errors in the representational bisection were greater than or equivalent to those in the line bisection with cueing. The effect of line length in which the errors became greater for the longer lines was equally found in the line bisection with cueing and the representational bisection. This was confirmed in the condition where the right end point was placed at a fixed position and the line length was varied.

Conclusions

After cueing to the left end point, rightward bisection errors of patients with neglect are not caused by overattention to the right segment of the physical line. Left neglect occurs mainly for the mental representation formed at the time of cueing or seeing the whole extent of a line.

### PinMyMetal: a hybrid learning system to accurately model transition metal binding sites in macromolecules [^22e37c4a]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Fig. 8
Schematic diagram of zinc ion coordinate prediction algorithm.

a C2 site. b C1H1 site. c H2 site. d Four-coordinated site. a1, b1, c1, d1 refer to the actual sites, while a2, b2, c2, d2 represent the transformed coordinates corresponding to these actual sites.

Fully coordinated sites have the maximum number of ligands, like four in tetrahedral or six in octahedral geometry, while incomplete sites have fewer ligands. The metal position is inferred using different methods depending on the number and type of ligands. Using zinc as an example, a total of seven strategies used to cover all scenarios are described in more detail below.
C2 sites: A segment a 2 b 2 is drawn between the two Sγ atoms with the coordinate of the midpoint marked as e2, which is also on a plane p2 perpendicular to the segment a2b2 (Fig. 8a). With a coordinating bond distance between the metal and atom of about 2.1 Å and an a-metal-b bond angle of ~109° in a tetrahedral site, the theoretical distance between zinc ion and e2 is 1.2 Å, based on isosceles triangle geometry (Supplementary Fig. 10). The optimal location of zinc ion is restricted on the plane p2 and has a theoretical distance of 1.2 Å from e2, resulting in a collection of points forming a circle. The two Sγ atoms coordinating the zinc ion should feature a Zn-Sγ-Cβ angle of 109° and be on the distal side of Cβ to dodge possible clash (Fig. 8a and Supplementary Fig. 12). In the actual coordinate system, the final Zn coordinate (f1*) is determined by summing the deviations of the angles between two sets of Zn-Sγ-Cβ (f1a1c1, f1b1d1) from the expected angle of 109°, selecting the position with the minimum score from the points on the circle (7).
C1H1 sites: After the original coordinates undergo transformation, the midpoint e2 between the two metal-coordinating atoms, C (a2) and H (b2), is set as the origin of the coordinate system. The midpoints of the lines connecting each atom to the Cα atom are designated as c2 and d2, with c2 located on the y-axis. The distance from the metal f2 to e2 is 1.48 Å (for an octahedral metal site, the a-metal-b bond angle is ~90°) (Supplementary Fig. 10). Using the coordinates of the midpoints in the coordinate system and their relationship to the axes, the angle α is derived geometrically, which then allows for the calculation of the f2 coordinates. (Fig. 8b).
H2 sites: The gravity centers G c1 and G c2 are calculated using the five atoms forming the corresponding five-member ring. All four atoms Cδ2, Nε2, Cε1, Nδ1 on the five-member ring of the histidine sidechain are considered as candidate coordinating atoms. Four rays G c1 -Cδ2, G c1 -Nε2, G c1 -Cε1, G c1 -Nδ1 are drawn for the first five-member ring, with 2.1 Å segments G c1 z 1, G c1 z 2, G c1 z 3, G c1 z 4 aligned with each ray, and z 1, z 2, z 3, z 4 being the candidate zinc location, respectively. The candidate zinc location for the second five-member ring is deduced using the same procedure and denoted as y 1, y 2, y 3, y 4. The distance between each candidate zinc location from z 1, z 2, z 3, z 4 and each candidate zinc location from y 1, y 2, y 3, y 4 are calculated to determine the closest pair of candidate zinc ions (Fig. 8c). The average coordinate of this pair is chosen as the optimal zinc location.
E2, D2, E1D1, E1H1 or D1H1 sites: These sites represent ligand combinations used for predicting six-coordinated metal sites, where the theoretical ligand-metal angles are 90° or 180°. If the distance between two ligand atoms is less than 4 Å, the angle is 90°; if greater than 4 Å, the angle is 180°. For 90°, the prediction follows method (b), but for glutamate (E) or aspartate (D), c2 is the midpoint between the metal binding atom (OE1/OE2 for E, OD1/OD2 for D) and the CG atom. For 180°, the midpoint of the two metal-binding atoms is used as the predicted metal coordinate.
CH3 sites: Three candidate zinc locations are deduced using the strategies a-c for CC, CH, and HH subgroups. A voting mechanism is implemented in this scenario since cysteine is more liable to adopt a conformation not suitable to coordinate metal when compared to histidine. Three distances are calculated from each pair of candidate zinc locations, with the shortest distance considered a major vote (2 out of 3). The average coordinate of these two candidate zinc locations is chosen as the optimal zinc location.
Other incomplete coordination sites: For a site with three or more ligands (e.g. EDH3, EDH4, EDH5 sites) but not fully occupied, generate all pairwise ligand combinations (e.g. ED2, ED1H1, H2), resulting in n(n-1)/2 pairs. Apply strategies c-d to deduce candidate zinc positions for each pair, generating coordinates. Average all candidate coordinates to obtain the final zinc position.
Fully coordinated sites: For four-coordinated sites, the center of the four metal-coordinating atoms is chosen as the optimal metal position (Fig. 8d). For six-coordinated sites, the center of the six coordinating atoms is used.

### How do patients with neglect see a horizontal line? Analysis of performances in coloured line bisection task [^e49789ca]. Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Twelve patients with left unilateral spatial neglect were examined with a newly devised "coloured line bisection task". They were presented with a horizontal line printed in blue on one side and in red on the other side; the proportions of the blue and red segments were varied. Immediately after placement of the subjective midpoint, the line was concealed and the patients were asked to name the colours of the right and left ends. Five patients who identified the left-end colour almost correctly had no visual field defect, while the other seven whose colour naming was impaired on the left side had left visual field defect. The rightward bisection errors were similarly distributed in the fair and poor colour-naming patients except for two patients from the latter group. The lesions of the fair colour-naming patients spared the lingual and fusiform gyri, which are known to be engaged in colour processing. Patients with neglect whose visual field is preserved may neglect the leftward extension of a line but not the colour in the neglected space. The poor colour-naming patients frequently failed to name the left-end colour that appeared to the left of their subjective midpoint, which indicates that they hardly searched leftward beyond that point. In such trials, they reported that the left end had the same colour as the right end. The results suggest that in patients with neglect and left visual field defect, both the leftward extent and the colour of a line may be represented on the basis of the information from the attended right segment.

### Conflation of short identity-by-descent segments bias their inferred length distribution [^04386a3f]. G3 (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

A number of population genetic analyses focus on the information provided by the IBD segment length distribution. So far, nearly all applications assume that each detected IBD segment is derived from a single common ancestor. However, the observed IBD length distribution is often biased, and extensive efforts are undertaken to empirically correct the observed distribution in order to ensure the validity of the downstream conclusions. In this manuscript, we studied this core assumption, and examined through simulations the phenomenon of conflation of shorter segments. Our characterization of this phenomenon shed light on one of the mechanisms by which the IBD length distribution is biased in practice.

We have shown that using simulated SNP array data, under a reasonable demography for western European humans, and irrespective of the choice of IBD-calling algorithm examined, an appreciable proportion of called IBD segments shorter than 2 cM are composed of conflations of shorter, more distantly related, subsegments. For instance, of segments > 1 cM inferred using Refined IBD, greater than 22% have the IBD segment length extended due to other short subsegments > 0.2 cM; most of these were extended by 0.2–0.5 cM. The rate of conflation is reduced to ∼6% for longer IBD segments (> 2 cM) (Figure 3A). In our simulations, chance conflations often arose between independent, shorter segments (e.g. two of sizes 0.5 cM); this creates more segments near the shorter end of our detection threshold (1 cM) than longer because the true segment length distribution is so strongly peaked near zero (Figure 5). Furthermore, we have shown that the conflation errors are unlike typical minor endpoint estimation errors, which would be improved by removing ends of the segments from downstream analysis (Figure 3B and). However, we note that the severity of the conflation problem may differ in real data, as other factors such as the marker density and the underlying, unobserved population demography could also be in play.

### Objective comparison of methods to decode anomalous diffusion [^739a85a9]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The AnDi challenge (T2) has led to the first concerted effort to develop methods able to classify individual trajectories among several mathematical models of diffusion. Machine-learning methods ranked top in the leader board and achieved an overall accuracy greater than 80% at detecting the ground-truth diffusion models. The comparison of F 1 -score and AUC/ROC (Supplementary Fig. 17, Supplementary Fig. 18, Supplementary Fig. 19, and Supplementary Fig. 20) shows that most of the methods are quite confident at providing the correct classification. However, a limitation of all these classification approaches is that they can only choose among the diffusion models provided in the training. To robustly extend model classification to actual experiments, it can be useful to further widen the palette of models (e.g. by using ad hoc models), include a none-of-the-above class, and/or to include some metric of the confidence of the estimation (e.g. by using an entropy measure calculated on the predictions of an ensemble of machine-learning models). Trajectory segmentation (T3 of the AnDi challenge) has been widely investigated when changes occur with respect to an estimator of the observable such as the mean or the variance. Determining changes of anomalous diffusion is a rather novel problem, triggered by recent experimental findings. We kept the challenge design rather simple, with trajectories of fixed length featuring exactly one changepoint. Even in this simple condition, the wide parameter space made the problem rather challenging, limiting the participation to T3 to only 4 teams. Yet, the submitted results showed an interesting asymmetry: The changepoint localization precision seems not only to depend on the relative length of the segments but also on the changepoint location (Fig. 4 a), producing a lower RMSE for changepoints located at the beginning of the trajectory. Similarly, the methods show the best performance in estimating α and diffusion model for the first segment (Fig. 4 b, c). We believe that this is at least partly a consequence of the inaccurate localization of the changepoint and the non-stationarity of some models. The inexact localization of the changepoint produces two spurious segments, altering the tail of the first segment and the initial point of the second by removing or adding spurious points. For non-stationary models, the initial point encloses information about the initiation of the physical process, thus improper segmentation impacts more severely the evaluation of the second segment.

### Characterization of an automated method to segment the human locus coeruleus [^1d854cb8]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

An important strength of the FT method is its ability to assess LC signal in up to five subsections along the full rostrocaudal extent of the LC. However, many of the tests performed here only assessed the middle LC section to better match the most commonly used manual approach (Clewett et al.). Therefore, we developed a test to validate the ability of the FT method to reconstruct an LC with a structure matching its known shape as a roughly linear, rod‐shaped structure (Fernandes et al.). The LC is a contiguous nucleus and it is expected that LC position on adjacent slices should be nearby and often overlapping. We found that the majority of LC voxels segmented by the FT method were nearby to a linear regression line. Those that were more distant from the line may have been due to errors in segmentation or at times due to the true structure of the LC deviating from linearity. This is likely to occur at times on the rostral and especially caudal ends of the LC where cell counting studies have shown higher scatter in LC cells (German et al.). Indeed, we observed that the error in linear fit tended to be higher on the ends of the LC.

### Left ventricular segmentation, warping, and myocardial registration for automated strain measurement [^0d4d2ec2]. Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

DTW Strain Method (Fig. 1)

Fig. 1
Steps of dynamic time warping (DTW) method of strain calculation. We used the OpenCV findContours program, the skeletonization method, the convex hull program, and the OpenCV fitEllipse program to identify key points including the septal and lateral annular endpoints and the LV apex (A). The calculated LV area defines the end-diastolic and end-systolic frames (B). Key points were used to resample the contour coordinates via interpolation, resulting in 193 epicardial and 193 endocardial coordinates, which were further matched by the DTW method (C). We ensure that the "proportional area" occupied by each block remains constant with respect to that of a corresponding serial number in the end-diastole. The midpoints of each block's border were connected into the centerline (D). The centerline length of the end-diastolic LV contour is, and the centerline length of frameis. The(E), and frame-by-frame strain values were represented (F)

Our DTW-based strain calculations include the following steps:

Converting Segmentation Border into Coordinates

We used the open-source computer vision library (OpenCV) findContours program to obtain binary coordinates of the LV border. We then used the skeletonization method to reduce the binary image into one pixel-wide representation as a central line with some branches. The convex hull (a program provided by scikit-image) was then used to remove branch points. Since the myocardial contour is U-shaped, if the midpoint of two adjacent coordinates on the convex hull is outside the myocardial contour, these two coordinates should be the septal and lateral endpoints. To identify the LV apical point, we used the OpenCV fitEllipse program to find the ellipse fit of the binary coordinates of the LV contour. We set the long axis of the found ellipse as the y '-axis, and the coordinates of the maximal y 's value were defined as the LV apical point (Fig. 1 A). We defined the end-diastolic and end-systolic frames based on changes in the LV area (Fig. 1 B).

The three key points were crucial in defining the septal, lateral, endocardial, and epicardial regions. Subsequently, interpolation was used to resample the endocardial and epicardial contours (Fig. 1 C), resulting in 193 points on both the endocardium and epicardium.

Left ventricular modeling in three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) — landmarks and segmentation are described as follows: "The landmarks used for this process are the mitral annulus and LV apex, which are used to initiate edge detection by semi-automated quantification software". "Other anatomic features of importance are the LV trabeculae and papillary muscles, which should be included within the LV cavity for the calculation of LV volumes". "The 17-segment model distinguishes six segments (inferoseptal, anteroseptal, anterior, lateral, inferolateral, inferior) in the base and six in the mid left ventricle, four segments (septal, anterior, lateral, inferior) in the apex, and the apical cap". In the transverse plane, "the segments comprise 60°, arcs, starting at the midpoint of the septum, which itself is defined by the anterior and posterior RV insertion points of the septum".

### Glass-cutting medical images via a mechanical image segmentation method based on crack propagation [^b06e7ef0]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Initial crack

In each partial model, we set an initial crack. The initial crack will grow along grooves under external load until reaching object boundaries. For the first local model, the initial crack needs to be specified. After completing crack propagation in the current region, the next local model can be determined according to the position and the orientation of the crack. The new area will partially overlap the old one so that it can contain the end portion of the crack in the previous area as the initial crack.

The initial crack in the first local model can be provided either manually or automatically (Fig. 10b). In the manual method (top half of Fig. 10b), one needs only to choose a short line a few pixels in length along the target boundary as the position of the initial crack in the mechanical model. This selection is simple and accurate because the target boundary is generally very clear in such a location and there is an obvious groove corresponding to the target boundary in the mechanical model. For the automatic method (bottom half of Fig. 10b), the initial crack can be generated by the following procedure: define the side length of square ABCD representing the local image to be 2 L. The target boundary intersects with the two parallel edges AD and BC. Draw a straight line starting from P M1, the midpoint of the side AB, and passing through P M2, the midpoint of the side DC, ending at the point O. The distance from P M1 to O is N times the length of AB (N > 1). Therefore, a triangle AOB is formed with angle at point O equal to φ = 2 arctan(1/(2 N)). Dividing φ by an integer m defines the angle increment, Δ φ = 2 arctan(1/(2 N))/ m. Starting at line OA, and sweeping toward line OB by incrementing the angle by Δ φ each iteration, the ray with angle φ i = i Δ φ (i = 0, 1, 2,…) will intersect the target boundary at the point P i in this local image area. Because the grayscale value of the pixels at the target boundary changes significantly, an edge-detection operator, such as the Canny edge detector, can easily identify the coordinates of the points P i. After detecting several boundary points, the initial crack of the first local model can be automatically formed by connecting these points to form a small line segment.

### Bending forces and nucleotide state jointly regulate F-actin structure [^fff2edfc]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Rise, twist and curvature measurements

Rise and twist were measured along deformed actin filament axes using custom Python scripts, implementing an approach similar to previously described helix deformations –. First, a central axis was defined using a 3D spline fit. To minimize edge effects, the model was extended by copying the model twice, aligning the terminal three subunits of one copy's barbed end with the terminal three subunits of the original model's pointed end and then aligning the terminal three subunits of the other copy's pointed end with the terminal three subunits of the original model's barbed end. The overlapping subunits from the copied models were deleted to generate a final, 42-protomer model. This was used to define the central spline while sufficiently minimizing edge effects.

To define the 3D spline for each filament's central axis, an iterative, orientation-independent approach was implemented using a set of waypoints. The initial 41 waypoints were defined as the set of 3D coordinates corresponding to the centroid of 2 consecutive subunits in a rolling window along the filament. A 3D cubic spline with a natural boundary condition was then fit through the set of waypoints to generate the initial filament axis. A set of line segments with a length equal to the filament's radius and one end positioned at each subunit's centroid was aligned to minimize the free end's distance from the spline. The waypoints were then updated to become the Euclidean average of two of these consecutive free ends. The process of updating the 3D cubic spline, defining new line segment extensions from the subunit centroids, and updating waypoints was repeated 500 times to obtain the final central axis spline.

### A software-based tool for video motion tracking in the surgical skills assessment landscape [^31c45776]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Camera distance

The videos were recorded with a laparoscopic camera during real laparoscopic procedures. During these procedures, an assistant operated the camera. Therefore, it was necessary to scale the (x, y) coordinate data using the (fixed, known) size of the surgical implement in the images. This was achieved by using the two perpendicular lines oriented along the second segment of the implement, from which, being of known length and angle within the image, an x- and y-scaling is calculated. This makes videos taken at different distances from the site of the operation easily comparable with each other. The coordinates were then adjusted using this scaling and converted to real-life distances based upon pixel width in the video ready for the calculation of statistics (Table 1). The limitation of this scaling is that the angle of the implement in the z-direction, may affect the result in a 2D video. This was overcome by using a pair of perpendicular lines for scaling.

Table 1
Criteria measured in the procedure and details their calculation

Missing data points

Occasionally, the instrument had moved out of the field of view of the camera, or tissue was covering it. The software was able to automatically relocate the point in the majority of cases. In the former case, it was more difficult to relocate the same point for tracking as before (causing the wrong pixel to be tracked going forward). The results in this study were generated by making a decision on a case-by-case basis whether to approximate the location of the point (if enough of the instrument was visible to locate it manually) or to not track that section of the video. If the section was not counted, mean movement was considered to have happened between the last tracked point and the newly found point.

Bias

Additionally, to assess the extent to which bias was a factor in this intervention, the statistics were calculated for a section of the videos of the surgical procedure where the instrument was always visible. Here, the algorithm was allowed to run completely automatically and the results compared with the semi-automatic procedure. These results were then compared with the overall results.

### Predicting progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease using longitudinal callosal atrophy [^291f241e]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2016). Low credibility.

2.4 CC thickness profile

The CC thickness profile is specified in terms of 99 nonzero thickness values at equally spaced intervals along the length of the CC (Fig. 1 B). Our method for finding these values is similar to those of Clarke et al.and Denenberg et al. Thickness values are lengths of line segments that connect pairs of points on the upper and lower boundaries of the CC. The line segments are chosen perpendicular to the medial axis of the CC and intersect the medial axis at equal intervals.

An additional six subjects, from the 138 with successful automatic CC segmentations, were excluded from further analysis because their CC thickness profiles were not produced correctly by our automated algorithm at baseline and/or follow-up, leaving 132 subjects to be analyzed. These excluded cases in CC segmentation and profiling can be remedied by minor manual interventions. However, we decided to exclude them from the statistical analysis to keep the processing completely automatic and consistent. More importantly, we can avoid possible bias/noise introduced from manual interventions by doing so.

### Allometry in the corpus callosum in neonates: sexual dimorphism [^a08fa08f]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

2.5 CC measurement

The CC was first defined on the MNI152 template (for another project [Lewis et al.]). The boundary and 25 divisions of the CC were identified on the midsagittal slice of the template. The CC was divided into 25 subregions in order to provide high‐resolution results while maintaining comparability with the five regions utilized by Clarke et al. This division into 25 subregions has been used previously with diffusion tractography to map the regions of the brain connected by different parts of the CC (Lewis et al.); this mapping is used here to assess the allometric relationship in the anterior and the posterior of the brain, separately (see section 2.6). The boundary and divisions of the CC were established using a semiautomated procedure based on Clarke's method (Clarke et al.). The procedure was as follows. The midsagittal slice of the template was extracted and upsampled to 0.1 mm × 0.1 mm. An intensity‐based flood‐fill was used to establish an initial boundary of the CC. An implementation of the active contour algorithm was then used to transform this initial estimate into a smoothed boundary at the centre of the gradient at the edge of the CC. Lines were then radiated from the geometric centroid of the CC at 1‐degree intervals, and for each line that crossed the CC, the point midway between the two points of intersection with the boundary was determined, and the shortest length line that crossed the CC through that point was determined. The curved line that passed through the midpoint of each of these lines and extended to the CC boundary on either end defined the midline. The midline was divided into 25 equal length segments. The shortest length lines that crossed the CC at the points defined by these midline segments defined the subregion boundaries. The subregions are identified as 1–25 from rostral to caudal as illustrated in Figure 1. The method is described in more detail in Lewis et al. and Lewis et al.

The MNI152 template was then linearly and nonlinearly registered to the neonate template via a series of intermediaries, that is, the 24, 12, and 6 month templates (Fonov et al.), using ANTs with mutual information (Avants et al.). These intermediary templates were used to minimize the issues related to intensity and morphological changes over development. The resulting transforms were concatenated in order to bring the CC from the MNI152 template to the neonate template. The neonate template was then linearly and nonlinearly registered to each of the neonate subjects in order to overlay the CC on each, and to measure the CC area in each, as depicted in Figure 2.

### Should the meniscal height be considered for preoperative sizing in meniscal transplantation? [^1c24a9c1]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Fig. 2
Measurement of the meniscal width and length in an axial slice. For the meniscal length, we identified the most anterior point of the anterior horn and the most posterior point of the posterior horn of the meniscus. A line traced between these points measured the meniscal length. In the picture below, the meniscal length is 30.6 mm (green A line). For the meniscal width, we traced a line between the most central points of the insertion sites of the anterior and posterior horns of the meniscus. In the midpoint of this line, we drew a perpendicular line up to the periphery of the outer contour of the body of the meniscus that was used to measure the meniscal width. In the picture below, the width is 21.9 mm (yellow B line)

To measure the meniscal heights, we performed a longitudinal measurement of each meniscal segment (anterior horn, body and posterior horn). The measurement of the height of the body was performed in a coronal slice, at the same level that the width of the meniscus was measured in the axial slice (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Height of the medial meniscal body, defined as the largest dimension in the longitudinal axis of the medial meniscus obtained in a coronal slice, at the same level in which the width of the medial meniscus was measured in an axial slice

The measurement of the heights of the anterior and posterior horns of each meniscus was performed in the sagittal slice at the same level that the meniscal length was measured in the axial slice (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4
Height of the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus, defined as the largest dimension in the longitudinal axis of the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus obtained in a sagittal slice, at the same level in which the length of the lateral meniscus was measured in an axial view

We were unable to find a reproducible way to measure the height of the anterior horn of the medial meniscus because it extends beyond the anterior margin of the tibial plateau (Fig. 5). Hence, for the lateral meniscus we measured the heights of the three segments, and for the medial meniscus we only measured its body and posterior horn.

### The impact of upper instrumented vertebra orientation on proximal junctional kyphosis: a novel and fixed parameter, fused spinopelvic angle [^20d4c0de]. Spine (2022). Medium credibility.

Relationship Between the FSPA and the Pelvis

The PI is the most commonly used anatomical pelvic parameter that is not influenced by the position. It is defined as the angle between the line perpendicular to the sacral plate and the line connecting the center of the sacral endplate to the midpoint of the bicoxofemoral axis. It determines the overall shape of the spine by establishing the orientation of the pelvis and the spine. Thus, individuals with a large PI show a large LL and TK curvatures with a greater SS. In patients with ASD, when long-segment fusion up to S1 is performed, the whole spine from the UIV to the pelvis is corrected as a single fixed curvature. Because the fused spinal segments from the UIV to the pelvis can only move within the hip joint, the FSPA, which is the angle between the lower endplate and the sacral endplate with reference to the hip joint, can be considered a fixed parameter, and is useful for analyzing the curvature of the fused segments from the UIV to the pelvis. Because the FSPA is not affected by position, it can better indicate the relationship between the pelvis and the UIV. Furthermore, just as PI and SS can affect LL, the FSPA can contribute to the PJA and TK.

### Radiographic landmark measurements for the femoral footprint of the medial patellofemoral complex may Be affected by visible femoral shaft length on lateral knee radiographs [^1c7bf9bd]. Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To assess the effect of visible femoral shaft length on the accuracy of radiographic landmarks of the medial patellofemoral complex (MPFC).

Methods

In 9 cadaveric knees, the MPFC footprint was exposed on the medial femur, and its proximal and distal boundaries were marked. Lateral fluoroscopic images of the knee were assessed in 1-cm length increments, beginning 1 cm proximal to the medial condyle and continuing proximally to 8 cm. The MPFC midpoint was described on each image relative to the posterior cortical line of the femur and a line perpendicular to this line through the proximal margin of the medial condyle. In addition, the MPFC midpoint was assessed relative to a line from the proximal posterior cortex to the midpoint of Blumensaat line.

Results

Using the posterior cortical line as a reference, the MPFC radiographic landmark moved anteriorly with decreasing visible femoral shaft on radiographs, particularly at 4 cm and less. However, no proximal-distal change was noted. Linear regression analysis demonstrated a relationship between visible femoral shaft and MPFC position on radiographs (R = 0.461, R 2 = 0.212, B = -0.636, P < .001). For every centimeter decrease in the visible femoral shaft, the radiographic MPFC footprint moved anteriorly by 0.636 mm. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that a minimum of 4 cm of femoral shaft on lateral radiographs is required for accurate MPFC footprint localization (area under the curve = 0.80; sensitivity = 76.7%; specificity = 69.0%; P < .001). In contrast, no anterior-posterior change was seen when referencing a line from the proximal posterior cortex to the midpoint of Blumensaat line.

Conclusions

When using the posterior cortical line to identify the midpoint of the MPFC, at least 4 cm of femoral shaft should be visible for accurate assessment. If less than 4 cm of shaft is visible, a line through the midpoint of Blumensaat line and the proximal posterior cortex can be used as an alternative method to estimate the position of the femoral footprint.

Clinical Relevance

As fluoroscopy is frequently used intraoperatively for MPFC reconstruction, our findings may serve as a guide when assessing femoral tunnel placement on fluoroscopy.

Hinge and fixed joint

A hinge connection is encountered when a rod is confined in a plane defined by another rod. Knee or elbow joints are intuitive examples, as shanks or forearms rotate with only one degree of freedom. In our simulations, a hinge joint (Fig. 5 e) is based on the spherical joint model with an additional constraint on the orientation of the end segmentsandof the connected filaments. The allowed rotational plane is then defined by the tangentand normalto the segment. To cancel the off-plane vector(that might arise during structure actuation) at the node, we apply a correcting torqueproportional to the hinge stiffness through the constant

A fixed joint is evolved from a hinge joint by further constraining the orientation ofto a fixed anglerelative to. A correcting torque is then similarly computed, this time through the off-position vectorwhereis the length, andis the binormal vector. To conform with our Cosserat model implementation (Eqs. (3) and (4)), all the torques are transformed into the local frame and stored in the external couple.

### Hydrogen can both move or pin dislocations in body-centered cubic metals [^76ff3e8e]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The above NEB calculations and analyses lend support for HBC-induced dislocation motion on relevant experimental timescales. To further understand the HBC-induced dislocation motion distances on experimentally relevant length scale, we carried out coarse-grained simulations by following simple rules: 1) H atoms diffuse in a random-walking manner; 2) a local dislocation segment migrates toward the potential valley with net mobilizing S2 H atoms counted within a cut-off distance; 3) if there is no S2 H atoms around, a local dislocation segment migrates to minimize the motion-direction-difference between itself and its neighbors (mimic line tension effects); and 4) kinks diffuse along free dislocation line in terms of random walk. In our simulation, we treat a long dislocation line as connected discrete units of 1 nm length. We first set a fixed number of H sources near surface (e.g. keeping a constant number of H atoms within the surface layers, usually a few nm) and then let H atoms naturally diffuse into bulk to create a H flux. During the H atoms diffusion process, once S2 H atoms are detected, we update the dislocation line morphology by rules 2) to 4), and then repeat such process until a certain maximum iteration is reached.

We tested two special cases to estimate a range of possible HBC-induced dislocation motion distances. In the first case, we assume H flux is normal to the dislocation line. To that end, a single H source near the surface was introduced to mimic a low concentration of H. A screw dislocation with a length of 500 nm was introduced 20 nm below the surface, for the sake of computational efficiency. When updating dislocation morphology, we chose a neighbor cut-off distance of 5 nm for counting S2 H atoms, and 10 nm for counting neighboring dislocation segments. For counting both S2 H atoms and dislocation segments, a linearly decaying weight factor was assigned to each neighbor, and the result is a weighted average over neighbors (see Supplementary Fig. 7 for a schematic illustration). Periodic boundary conditions were applied along dislocation line direction. With such a setup, we ran the simulation for a few hundreds of steps until there was no obvious evolution of dislocation morphology. It turns out, in such scenario, the dislocation motion distance is quite limited, usually on the order of a few nm (see Supplementary Video 5 for details).

### Geometric characteristics of bicuspid aortic valves [^0d823006]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

The following geometric parameters were measured:
A. The length of the raphe (Figure 1, A and B).
B. The absolute sinus surfaces (Figure 1, C and D) to evaluate the morphological trend of sinuses within the bicuspid asymmetry. This enabled us to determine the contribution of each sinus to the total aortic sinus surface and to assess their correlation with other parameters.
C. Relative sinus surface, which is the corresponding surface compared with a reference circle with a fixed radius and center E (Figure 1, E and F) and was given as a percentage of each sinus exceeding the reference circle. Three fixed points were placed at the level of maximum sinus dimensions (points J, G, and H). Then another series of three fixed points were placed on the created circle on the corresponding lines toward J, G, and H, respectively named I, K, and L. The distance |GK|, |HL|, and |IJ| were measured. The other 3 lines were drawn between I, K, and L and the center of the circle E (segments |IE|, |KE|, and |LE|), and the sections were measured. The left relative sinus was obtained as | HL|/HE. Similarly, the relative surfaces of the other sinuses were calculated as | GK|/GE and |IJ|/IE, for the right and noncoronary sinsues (NCS), respectively.
D. The coaptation angle α,: The angle between 2 lines drawn from nonfused commissures to the coaptation midpoint (Figure 2, A and B).
E. The angle β: The angle between 2 lines drawn from 1 nonfused commissure and the center point of the perfect circle created (Figure 2, C and D).
F. The angle γ: The angle between the raphe, and a line drawn between the commissures and the perfect midpoint (Figure 2, E and F). Angles γ 1 and γ 2 were comprised between each of the nonfused commissures and the raphe toward the coaptation midpoint.
G. Angles ε 1 and ε 2 (Figure 2, G and H): The angles between lines drawn from nonfused commissures on 1 hand and fused commissure on the other hand toward the perfect midpoint. Together with β, they were used to determine position consistency between commissures. To confirm the hypothesis of the fixed position of the commissures between the right and the left cusp, and the left and the noncoronary cusp, ε 2 should be a constant.
H. Aortic dimensions. Aortic annulus, aortic root, sinotubular junction, ascending aorta, and the aortic arch were measured. The aortic annulus was determined following the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography guidelines. Figure E2 shows the method used in the case of the BAV with only 2 sinuses.

### Retinoic acid promotes the endogenous repair of lung stem / progenitor cells in combined with simvastatin after acute lung injury: a stereological analysis [^50b5de14]. Respiratory Research (2015). Low credibility.

Stereological analysis of lung tissue and cells

Concerning the criteria of stereological parameters and study designs in the respiratory tract, the numerical density and surface density of alveolar cells and liner intercept (Lm) were determined on the sections with HE staining, while surface fraction of AT1 cells, numerical density of AT2, Clara, proliferating and apoptotic cells were given on the sections with immunohistochemistry or TUNEL staining.

Alveolar cell numerical density

Under the microscope with high magnification, the target fields of vision are located in the area of alveolar tissues with an interval of 1.5 mm both in horizontal and vertical axes. The selected visions are in accordance with the left-right and up-down snake-like sequence. Secondly, in the adobe Photoshop 7.0.1 procedure, the selected tissue pictures were overlaid with unbiased counting frames and cross line segments. The number of adopted intersections is counted as Q. The fraction of alveolar surface area = Q/144. the alveolar surface area (S) = area of unbiased counting frame (0.017 mm 2) × Q/144. Then, the number of adopted alveolar cells was counted as N AC. All the adopted cells are in the counting frames except those intersected with the forbidden lines. The numerical density of alveolar cells = N AC /S.

Alveolar cell surface density

Further, the selected tissue pictures were overlaid with unbiased counting frames and line segments. The area of unbiased counting frame, whose actual area is 0.017 mm 2, covers 50% of the total area in a tissue picture. The test macro includes 42 line segments and 84 points. A line segment with 23 μm in length includes midline, left and right endpoints, with blocking lines residing in the endpoints and extension lines on the two sides. The number of intersections between the line segments and the alveolar walls was counted as I. The total length of line segments in the counting frame was calculated as L1. Finally, alveolar cells surface density = 2I/L1.

Alveolar Lm

To evaluate the status of alveolar ectasia, we further counted the right endpoints of the line segments falling in the alveolar spaces in the counting frame as N RE. The total length of line segments falling in the lung tissues in the counting frame was calculated as L2. Lm = 2 L2 × N RE /I.

A, Plot of inner segment length as a function of retinal location along the horizontal meridian. B, Outer segment length as a function of retinal location along the horizontal meridian. The black line indicates normative data from 93 people, mean age, 25. 7 years. The shaded gray area is ± 2 SD. Thickness values were not calculated over visible lesion. Shown in Figure 1 is a horizontal line scan from a normal control and a corresponding longitudinal reflectivity profile, showing the identity of the bands analyzed. 35, 36 The innermost band corresponds to the external limiting membrane, the second band corresponds to the inner segment ellipsoid, 37 the third band corresponds to the outer segment/RPE interface, and the fourth band corresponds to the RPE.

The peak-to-peak distance between the external limiting membrane and inner segment ellipsoid is taken as the length of the inner segments, while the peak-to-peak distance between the inner segment ellipsoid and the outer segment/RPE interface is taken as the length of the outer segments. While these may not correspond precisely to the absolute IS or OS length, we used these same definitions in an extensive previously published normative data set. 36 We examined the IS and OS length across the horizontal line scan from each subject, sampling the scan at 0. 2-mm intervals. Intraframe distortions within the AOSLO retinal images were corrected as previously described. 30, 39 Registration of frames within a given image sequence was performed using a "strip" registration method, in which the images were registered by dividing the image of interest into strips, aligning each strip to the location in the reference frame that maximizes the normalized cross-correlation between them.

39 Once all the frames were registered, the 50 frames with the highest normalized cross-correlation to the reference frame were averaged to generate a final image with an increased signal to noise ratio. The AOSLO images from this same location focused in the inner retina revealed thin hyperreflective structures running perpendicular to the nerve fiber layer. The anatomical location and orientation are consistent with that of Henle fibers, and the diameter of these structures is consistent with previous histology reports.

### Architecture of a mammalian glomerular domain revealed by novel volume electroporation using nanoengineered microelectrodes [^1400d367]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Cell cluster analysis of MCLPNs

Upon completion of the transformation operation, the center-of-mass (or "common midpoint") was determined by calculating means of the three spatial coordinates. Euclidean distances from MCLPNs to the common midpoint were determined as well as distances in each of the three spatial dimensions, including mean values and SDs. The same distances were then calculated for each experiment and these individual MCL midpoints were separately and consequently compared to the common midpoint. Since MCLPNs were essentially localized on a plane parallel to the X – Z plane, the cellular density was assessed on a maximum Y projection, first counting the cell somata in bins of 20 × 20 µm along the X - and Z -axis. For smoothing, a 4 × 4 sliding frame average was performed calculating the mean of the centered bin.

After separation of MCs and dTCs (see below), the same calculations were performed for each of the two subsets separately. The only difference was that the binned cell count (bin size 50 × 50 µm) was not followed by a smoothing operation because of the low number of cells. Here, only discrete numbers were determined and plotted.

Morphologic reconstruction of cells

Manual and semi-automated tracing of cellular processes of MCs, dTCs, mTCs, and sTCs was achieved using the Filament Editor of the Amira software (Visage Imaging GmbH, Berlin, Germany). Detected nodes, vertices, segments and lines were exported to Matlab for further analysis. To ensure that lateral dendrites were indeed correctly identified in continuity and attributed to their respective somatic origin, we performed an independent second back-tracing from the periphery to the soma in 15 randomly chosen dendrites from 3 of our 5 experiments (i.e. 45 dendrites in total), in which complete agreement with the first tracing was achieved (Supplementary Fig. 14).

Image analysis

Image analysis was performed using FIJI/ImageJ, version 1.53t. For quantification of Ilp staining in the IPCs: Z-stacks were projected using the "sum" method. Each IPC cluster was manually segmented using the freehand drawing tool, and the fluorescence values within this region of interest were summed. The region of interest was moved to an adjacent non-stained region, and the fluorescence within this area was summed as a background value. This background was subtracted from the value obtained for the IPCs. For measuring CaLexA or Bursicon levels: Z-stacks were projected using the "sum" method. Each cell of interest was located using the tdTomato channel and highlighted as a region of interest. The fluorescence of the tdTomato and GFP or anti-HA (Bursicon) channels within this region was summed. The region of interest was offset to a nearby unstained region, and the background intensity was summed and subtracted from the value obtained for the stained region. For quantification of tGPH localization, locally flat regions of fat-body tissue were identified in each Z-stack. For each of several pairs of adjoining cells in this region, using the phalloidin and DAPI channels, a Z section was selected at the depth of the nuclei, where the cell membranes are completely perpendicular to the section. A line (with a width of 15 pixels, to reduce noise) was drawn from one nucleus to the other, placing the midpoint of the line at the membrane, and the fluorescence intensity in the GFP channel at each pixel along this line was recorded. The positions along the line were normalized to a length of 1.0. The fluorescence values from the middle 10% of the line (that is, 0.45 ≤ x ≤ 0.55) were averaged to create a "center" intensity, and the fluorescence values within a further 10% on each side of this interval (that is, from 0.35 ≤ x < 0.45 and from 0.55 < x ≤ 0.65) were averaged to produce a "surround" value. The center:surround ratio, reflecting the level of membrane enrichment, is reported in the figures.

These 3 lines defines the extension of the three sinuses (noncoronary [NC], right coronary [RC], and left coronary [LC]). Once the sinuses were defined, their surfaces were measured. E and F, Relative sinuses' surface. For these measurements, a circle was drawn passing through the position of the raphe A, the position of the non-fused commissure B, and the position of the nonfused commissure C, and its center E was identified. Three fixed points were placed at the level of maximum sinus dimensions (points J, G, and H, respectively). Then another series of 3 fixed points were placed on the created circle, respectively named I, K, and L. The distance |GK| was the difference (protrusion) between the midpoint of the RC sinus and its projection on the created circle. Similarly, the segment |HL| was the difference between the midpoint of the LC sinus and its projection on the created circle and the distance |IJ| was the difference between the midpoint of the NC sinus and its projection on the created circle. These distances were measured as the differences between the distances from single sinuses midpoints (G, H, and J for the RC, LC and NC, respectively) and the circle center E and the distances from single sinus midpoint projection on the circle (K, L, and I for the RC, LC, and NC, respectively). Finally, the amount of sinus protrusion was calculated as the ratio between these distances. For the RC it was: |GK|/(|GK| + |KE|) = |GK|/GE. Similarly, the protrusion of LC was calculated as: |HL|/(|HL| + |LE| = |HL|/HE and the protrusion of NC was calculated as: IJ|/(|IJ| + |JE|) = |IJ|/IE, for the LC and NC, respectively.

MRI was performed using the 3-Tesla Siemens MAGNETOM Tim Trio (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen Germany) scanner with a four-channel flexible coil. The participant was placed prone on the imaging table. The inferior border of the 51.2 cm × 22 cm coil was positioned caudally on the posterior superior iliac spines and placed in a cranial direction along the long axis of the spine. The participant was instructed to breathe shallowly during the scan. A total of 36 sagittal slices were acquired using a fast, low-angle shot sequence using the following parameters: field of view 192×173×119 mm, repetition time 13 ms, echo time 2 ms, slices 36, flip angle 10°, resolution 1.5×1.5 mm on the plane, 3 mm through the plane and no fat suppression. The scan took approximately 38 s. After obtaining images in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format, they were viewed on OsiriX (Pixmeo). A midsagittal plane view was used and the IVDs of interest (L2/L3, L3/L4 and L4/L5) were manually segmented from the two-dimensional T1-weighted structural scan images. Lines connecting the superior anterior and inferior anterior borders and the superior posterior and inferior posterior borders were drawn, representing the anterior and posterior height of the IVD. A horizontal line was drawn connecting the anterior and posterior lines. An additional horizontal line was drawn to mark the halfway point of the full IVD width. We then drew a line perpendicular to the vertebral body at the halfway mark of the IVD. An additional vertical line was drawn from the superior midpoint at IVD segment L2/L3 to the inferior midpoint at IVD segment L4/L5 to capture the multisegment distance that includes three IVDs (figure 3).

### The shared ancestry between the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion and intermediate-length alleles using haplotype sharing trees and HAPTK [^ded262e5]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

(C and D) Illustration of the construction of the left-side unidirectional HST (C) and (D) the bidirectional HST. The construction of the right-side tree is not shown here. ∗ The core haplotype is underlined in black, and the majority-based ancestral haplotype is underlined in red. When using unidirectional HSTs, the ancestral and core haplotypes from both sides need to be combined into a single core and a single ancestral haplotype.

(E and F) The unidirectional HST-derived ancestral haplotype segment lengths (E) and the (F) bidirectional HST-derived ancestral haplotype segment lengths. Segment lengths of the ancestral haplotype for each sample after selecting only the longer ancestral sequence sharing haplotypes. Recombination frequencies are drawn in black and seem to correspond to the sites of haplotype breaks. The vertical white line marks the HRE locus. For visualization purposes, the x axis is limited to positions where at least 40 samples are sharing the haplotype.

Unidirectional HSTs are constructed separately down- and upstream of the starting marker. The algorithm moves along the matrix marker by marker, and if any contradictory genotypes are found in a column of sample genotypes, the samples are branched into two nodes representing the different haplotypes. In contrast, the bidirectional HST is constructed by moving simultaneously in both directions, and when contradictory alleles are found on both sides, the samples are branched into two to four nodes. For both algorithms, the majority of samples are always assigned to the leftmost node. After assigning the new leaf nodes to the branches, the leaf nodes are then recursively processed again to find new contradictory genotypes until all leaf nodes have only a single sample left or the end of genotyping data is reached. The nodes contain information on the branching position and the indexes of the samples sharing the haplotype. Detailed stepwise outlines of the algorithms are found in the supplemental methods.

The HST algorithms only evaluate continuous haplotype sharing, and the HST is a data structure for storing this continuously shared haplotype data. If HSTs are constructed at a locus where an ancestral haplotype is not expected to exist, it must be evaluated whether analyzing continuous haplotype sharing is relevant. It is also of note that the structure of the bidirectional HST is influenced more by the side that has experienced earlier recombinations and that large differences in SNP density on left and right sides of the locus can add some bias to the bidirectional HST.

### Digital twins for noninvasively measuring predictive markers of right heart failure [^1350d509]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

To study the effects of geometric complexity, we examined 3 different levels of complexity in 5 patients with 3D digital twins. Our findings indicated that the predicted LPA pressure in the level 1 geometry closely matched those of level 2 or level 3 LPA pressures. This result is advantageous, as level 1 geometries take far less time to segment (Fig. 2). Although this result holds for LPA pressure predictions, more detailed geometries may be necessary for studies focused on hemodynamics in distal branches or when averaging hemodynamic metrics across the entire geometry. The finding that the simplest geometry is sufficient for predicting LPA pressure motivates future investigations into whether even simpler geometries or reduced-order models could provide similarly accurate predictions. While this is a valuable direction for future work, it is beyond the scope of this proof-of-concept study, which focuses on demonstrating that pressure predictions are feasible using 3D models. We note that our 3D model can accurately predict pressure without needing elastic walls or complex boundary conditions, an advantage of the 3D model over reduced-order models, which rely on a larger number of parameters for tuning. While level 1 geometries are sufficient and preferred for predicting LPA pressure, our methodology should be re-evaluated for digital twins with different objectives.

Building on the findings regarding geometric complexity, we expanded our study to include 20 patient-specific level 1 geometries and compared the predicted pressures to IHM measurements. The digital twin pressure predictions matched the IHM measurements well, with all predictions falling within the range deemed acceptable — a difference between -8.2 and 6.5 mmHg. The Bland-Altman 95% interval for these comparisons is [-6.4,6.2] mmHg across the 20 patients, within the tolerance noted in ref.for comparisons between IHMs and RHC PAP values. Furthermore, we note that these successful predictions occur without precise knowledge of the IHM location — we only know that the IHM device is placed in the left pulmonary artery. Instead, we assume that the pressure drop in the LPA is minimal, and thus represents LPA pressure as the pressure predicted at the vessel's longitudinal midpoint. Although simulated pressure predictions match IHM recordings well, predictions could be even more accurate if the precise location of the IHM device in the simulated geometry were known, as the localization of IHM recordings is uncertain. These comparisons were conducted using steady inlet and 0-pressure outlet conditions for the 3D model, further confirming that level 1 segmentation models can effectively predict IHM pressure readings.

Figure 1
Four-step confirmation of the thoracic segment confirmation. (A) Schematic diagram of the placement of the ultrasonic probe. (B) The first step was to confirm the first rib. The ultrasound probe was placed in the paraspinal sagittal position of the spine and then moved cranially to caudally. The first hypoechoic shadow was the first rib. (C) The second step was to confirm the target rib. We moved the probe cranially to caudally and placed the target rib segment in the center of the ultrasound image. (D) The third step was to rotate the ultrasound probe 90 degrees to form a transverse axis with the spine and display the transverse process, rib, and the PP on the ultrasound image. (E) The fourth step was to move the probe parallel from the cranial to the caudal region to hide the transverse process and reveal the IAP image. The IAP cortex showed a linear hyperechoic image under ultrasound.

An in-plane puncture was performed from the lateral to medial end (Figure 2A). At this point, if there was a rib or scapula blocking the puncture outside the puncture route, the probe could rotate 5–15 degrees toward the caudal end to avoid the obstruction (Figure 2B). We drew an oblique line A along the PP and a vertical line B along the edge of the IAP on the ultrasound image. The starting point of line B was the edge of IAP, and the end point is the intersection with line A. The midpoint of line B was the puncture end point (Figure 2C). A 22-gauge Tuohy needle (TUORen, Co. Ltd. Henan, China) was then used to puncture from outside to inside using the in-plane technique (Figure 2D).

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^9a18e059]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular (LV) volume quantification by echocardiography — acquisition and measurement guidance are as follows: LV volumes should be measured from the apical four- and two-chamber views. Two-dimensional echocardiographic image acquisition should aim to maximize LV areas, while avoiding foreshortening of the left ventricle, which results in volume underestimation. Acquiring LV views at a reduced depth to focus on the LV cavity will reduce the likelihood of foreshortening and minimize errors in endocardial border tracings (Table 1). Because the issue of foreshortening is less relevant in 3D data sets, 3D image acquisition should focus primarily on including the entire left ventricle within the pyramidal data set. To ensure reasonably accurate identification of end-systole, the temporal resolution of 3D imaging should be maximized without compromising spatial resolution. At the mitral valve level, the contour is closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the mitral ring with a straight line. LV length is defined as the distance between the bisector of this line and the apical point of the LV contour, which is most distant to it. The use of the longer LV length between the apical two- and four-chamber views is recommended. Contrast agents should be used when needed to improve endocardial delineation when two or more contiguous LV endocardial segments are poorly visualized in apical views.

### Two-phase analysis in consensus genetic mapping [^6364adec]. G3 (2012). Low credibility.

As a conflict region, we imply a set of segments of the maps for the mapping populations that include shared and unique markers and fit the conditions: (a) unique markers are flanked by or are adjacent to the shared markers and (b) at least for one pair of populations, two or more shared markers from the region appear in conflict order. The procedure of defining conflict region is illustrated in Figure 2. The analysis of several datasets may reveal a few conflict regions separated by regions of no conflict. In Figure 2, the process of delineating a conflict region is based on overlaps of pairwise conflicts. The conflict between markers a and b includes the first five sets; the conflict region is bordered by a single line. A second conflict, between b and d markers, starts at set 4 and extends until set 7. In defining the boundaries of the conflict region, we employ the following rules: (i) the size of the region depends on the conflict markers, where a conflict marker can coincide with the boundary only if it is simultaneously the end marker of the linkage group (in the example in Figure 2, conflict markers а and b coincide with the end in sets 1 and 2, respectively); (ii) in all other cases, boundary marker for the conflict region may be either a non-conflict shared marker or a unique marker; and (iii) depending on the width of the conflict region, we employ the exact or heuristic optimization algorithm.

Local algorithm of consensus analysis, in contrast to global analysis, applies only to the conflict region. With several regions, the conflicts are resolved successively in each such frame. A conflict region should include at least a pair of shared markers, the order of which in at least one set is opposite to the order in other sets. The conflict region of the entire set of mapping populations should include the considered pair of conflicting markers as well as all markers in between this pair, either shared or unique. In turn, the shared markers in the conflict region can also be in conflict with other markers. This conglomerate of pairwise conflicts makes up a conflict region that can also be extended by including neighbor markers from both sides that do not create any conflict (see Figure 2). This extension is needed because during the process of resolving the conflict(s) within the conflict region, the flanking markers are frozen. Note that if one of the ends of the conflict region coincides with the end of the linkage group, then only one of the ends (the internal one) remains frozen during the optimization.

### Longitudinal and circumferential strain of the proximal aorta [^9d812f81]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

MRI Data Analysis

Images were analyzed using ImageJ version 1.44p (32‐bit; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) with custom macros and plugins. The oblique coronal images were used for displacement, diameter, and length measurements of the proximal aorta. An ImageJ default threshold was applied to create a contour around the aortic cusps and proximal ascending aorta. This contour was manually edited as required to remove coronary arteries and bridging into the pulmonary artery and other adjacent structures. A centerline along the length of the proximal aorta was constructed by creating an array of coordinates midway between closest points on the opposite edges of the aortic contour. These midpoints were interpolated and smoothed, and 21 diameter chords perpendicular to the final centerline were created starting from the STJ and moving distally along the centerline in 1‐mm increments. The STJ was initially identified by a user‐drawn chord and was then adjusted as needed to represent the shortest chord within 2 mm of the user‐defined STJ line. Ten additional chords were created perpendicular to the centerline, starting from a user‐defined line across the aortic annulus and moving through the aortic cusps toward the STJ at evenly spaced increments. Any intersecting chords were redrawn to be evenly spaced between neighboring lines, with the exception of the STJ and annulus. Figure 1 A shows the results of centerline and chord construction in the cusps and proximal ascending aorta during end‐diastole. A linear diameter gradient was calculated as the slope of aortic diameters between the STJ and 20 mm distal to the STJ to characterize the observed widening ascending aorta (Figure 2 A and 2 B). Displacement of the STJ and aortic annulus, and cusp lengthening were measured along the centerline of the proximal aorta. These measurements were obtained for 30 evenly spaced phases of the cardiac cycle (cardiac phases), each representing 1/30th of the RR interval (Figure 2 C and 2 D). Figure 1 B shows the end‐systolic image with the systolic and diastolic aortic contours overlaid in order to illustrate typical systolic movement of the proximal aorta.

### A selection and targeting framework of cortical locations for line-scanning fMRI [^7d5ce816]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Anatomical measures confirm accurate line‐planning

First, we used anatomical information to assess planning accuracy. We created a binarized mask representing the nominal line by taking the middle 16 voxels (indicative of the nominal 4 mm gap between saturation pulses) in the phase encoding direction along the frequency encoding direction. Of note, due to the imperfect nature of these saturation slabs, there are contaminating signals coming from outside the region‐of‐interest (Raimondo, Knapen, et al; Raimondo, Priovoulos, et al.). Because the full registration cascade from target vertex to the line through the low‐resolution image, partial FOV image, and single slice is known, we can project the nominal line image back onto the surface (Figure 3a, b). This showed that for all subjects, the line was indeed placed on the target site as per the overlap of the line (white) and target vertex (red spot) (Figure 3c).

FIGURE 3
Assessment of line‐placement accuracy using anatomical measures. The registration cascade from target vertex (a) to line‐scanning acquisition (b; outer right panel) is known after registering the anatomical image from Session 1 (high‐res) to the anatomical image from Session 2 (low‐res). Within Session 2, we acquired a partial field‐of‐view image (partial FOV), as well as the anatomical slice without OVS pulses (slice). From this slice, we created an image representing the nominal line (line). For each subject, we projected this nominal line image back to the surface from which the target vertex originated, showing sufficient overlap between the target vertex (red dot) and nominal line image (white patches) (c). The patches represent the location at which the nominal line image intersects with GM and looks scattered due to unfolding of the cortex. (d) Variation in registration outcomes after registration anatomies from Sessions 1 and 2, a hundred times for each subject. (e) Effect of subject motion by means of manual alignment of the single slice images on positional stability of the target coordinate. (f) Curvature distributions within the gray patch intersecting with the target location of (c). The curvature is measured as 1/r, where r is the radius of an inscribed circle. Since mean curvature is the average of the two principal curvatures, it has the units of 1/mm.

### Mapping of acetabular posterior wall fractures using a three-dimensional virtual reconstruction software [^822d7e78]. Injury (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The aim of this study was to analyze and describe the fracture patterns of the acetabular posterior wall based on quantitative measurements of the fracture characteristics.

Materials and Methods

Computed tomography images of 51 patients with acetabular posterior wall fractures from an initial cohort of 216 acetabular fractures were imported into a three-dimensional (3D) virtual software. The reconstructed 3D images were utilized to evaluate the following: (i) fracture line mapping on the inner articular and retro-acetabular surfaces, (ii) common zones of fracture and marginal impaction, and (iii) categorization by location and pattern of comminution. The clock-face position was applied for description: the midpoint of the transverse acetabular ligament served as the +180° reference point, and the 0° reference point was set perpendicular to the ligament. The fracture angle on the articular surface was defined as the intersection between the start and end points. The fracture span on the retro-acetabular surface was defined as the ratio of the perpendicular distance, which is between the fracture beak and acetabular rim, to the entire length, which is from the edge to the rim. Quantitative measurements were performed, and the fracture patterns were analyzed. A color scale bar was used to visualize the common and marginal impaction zones.

Results

The articular surface mapping of all the cases demonstrated that the average starting point of the fracture line was +6.2° (± 12.8°) and the endpoint was 96.7° (± 13.3°), and the average fracture angle was 119.6° (± 7.6°) with 80.6% of the fragments having angles within 18.7–117°. The retro-acetabular surface mapping demonstrated that the average fracture span was 0.65 ± 0.20, and 61.7% of the fracture lines were located within 0.6 to 0.9. Marginal impaction was found in 21 cases (21/51, 41.2%; range: between +7° and +105°).

Conclusion

The fracture maps showed fracture patterns and recurrent fracture zones on the articular and retro-acetabular surfaces. However, there was no remarkable pattern of marginal impaction.

### Comparing accuracies of length-type geographic atrophy growth rate metrics using atrophy-front growth modeling [^53dbc2ff]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Observing that GA lesions tend to enlarge along their margins, researchers proposed the perimeter-adjusted growth rate metric, as an extension of the effective radius growth rate to more general, noncircular geometries:

Conveniently, this metric has been well studied in the computer-aided geometric design community in the context of offset curves. It can be shownthat for isotropic, time-invariant growth fields, = Λ for lesions having concave curvatures whose absolute values are small relative to the lesion growth (an illustration of concave and convex margin segments, as well as the precise definition of small, is provided in Appendix 3 and Figure S1). Briefly and informally, a concave margin segment corresponds to an inward bulge in the lesion, and a convex margin segment corresponds to an outward bulge in the lesion). Intuitively, this condition requires that no intrafocus merging occurs. Of note, = Λ for any convex lesion undergoing isotropic, time-invariant growth (a lesion is convex if the entirety of its margin is convex, that is, the lesion has no inward bulges; for example, ellipse-shaped lesions are convex).

Although the above results demonstrate the usefulness of the atrophy-front growth model for interpreting length-type growth rate metrics, they pertain to simplistic geometries and growth patterns. Analysis of arbitrary geometries and growth patterns, for which analytical results are unwieldy or intractable, can be approached numerically, which is the focus of the subsequent section.

Generating Datasets for Numerical Evaluation of Metric Accuracy

Compared with clinically observed GA data, for which the complete growth dynamics are not well understood, simulated GA data have the advantage that the true growth parameters can be precisely specified. Importantly, an observed data set comprising images of a GA lesion acquired at a sequence of follow-up visits does not provide direct information related to the underlying growth field; different growth fields can result in the same observed growth data. This ambiguity is particularly acute for common clinical datasets, for which the intervisit times are relatively lengthy (e.g. 6 months or longer). Because of these challenges, we outline below our growth simulation approach, and then we construct a set of highly simplified lesion geometries and growth fields that highlight inherent limitations of the square-root-transformed and perimeter-adjusted metrics. Finally, we present a semisimulated approach to generating realistic GA growth configurations using real lesion geometries and simulated random growth fields.

### Retinal vascular geometry predicts incident retinopathy in young people with type 1 diabetes: a prospective cohort study from adolescence [^57563a85]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Retinal vascular geometry measurements

Retinal vascular geometry was retrospectively analyzed from baseline retinal photographs. All slides were individually assessed for grading suitability. We considered images to be of poor quality and ungradable if they were blurred, did not completely represent all zones, or if there were fewer than four large arterioles or venules gradable in one image. Right eye digitized retinal photographs of each patient were analyzed by a single grader, masked to participants' characteristics, using a semiautomated computer-assisted image program (Singapore I Vessel Assessment [SIVA], The National University of Singapore) as previously described. This software is able to detect the optic disc and divide the image into three concentric zones: zone A, within 0.5-disc diameter from the optic disc margin; zone B, 0.5- to 1.0-optic disc diameter away; and zone C, 1.0- to 2.0-disc diameter away.

Once the optic disc and zones were identified, vessels were traced. Retinal vessel caliber measurements, represented by the central retinal arteriolar equivalent (CRAE) and the central retinal venular equivalent (CRVE), were calculated as previously described. Measurements were based on the biggest six arterioles and six venules within zone B and C. The grader ensured that the vessel type selected by the program was correct. The software then combined the individual measurements into summary indices:
LDR was calculated as the length from the midpoint of the first branch to the midpoint of the second branch divided by the diameter of the parent vessel at the first branch.
ST was calculated as the ratio between the actual path length of the vessel segment (measured by tracking) and the straight-line length of the same segment.

### Fracture edge features of diaphyseal clavicular fractures: a morphologic study [^8f9da0f5]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous researchers used transverse fractures centered over the midpoint of the clavicle as the diaphyseal clavicular fracture models. However, as a result of shear stress concentration in sigmoid-shaped structures, most diaphyseal clavicular fractures have coronal fracture edges and are located distal to the midpoint. The purpose of this study was to quantify the morphology and utilize these parameters to establish clinically relevant fracture models.

Methods

The computed tomographic DICOM data of 100 consecutive patients were included. We investigated the morphologic characteristics of the fracture edges after virtual fracture reduction. The fracture orientation was determined based on the normal vectors of the best-fit plane of the fracture edges. The fracture location was measured by the extreme points of the edges. The fracture configuration was evaluated using fracture maps.

Results

There were 28 simple, 43 wedge, and 29 multifragmentary types. Coronal oriented fracture edges accounted for more than 70% of the simple, wedge, and multifragmentary types. The most proximal point of the proximal edge was located at 46.7% (42.0%-56.5%), 47.6% (42.5%-50.1%), and 46.3% (42.0%-49.3%) of the endpoint line in the simple, wedge, and multifragmentary types, respectively (P = 0.548). The most distal point of the distal edge was located at 72.2% (68.4%-75.0%), 73.2% (69.5%-76.9%), and 74.0% (69.6%-77.1%) of the endpoint line (P = 0.353). The longest proximal main fragments occurred in the simple types at 71.9% (66.3%-75.4%) of the endpoint line (P < .001), and the shortest distal main fragments occurred in the multifragmentary types at 55.8% (49.8%-59.3%) of the endpoint line (P = 0.001). The heatmaps showed a high concentration of anteriorly distributed wedge fragments (88%; n = 38/43) and coronally distributed multifragmentary fragments (62%; n = 18/29).

Conclusions

We showed that typical diaphyseal clavicular fractures have coronal fracture edges and are located within the distal half of the diaphyseal segment. The fractured fragments were initiated anteriorly in the wedge types and then propagated coronally in the multifragmentary types. The features of these fracture edges could be useful in designing osteotomy models and provide different perspectives of anterior and superior plating techniques.

### Automated 3D cobb angle measurement using U-net in CT images of preoperative scoliosis patients [^4c38a153]. Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Removal of Spinous and Transverse Processes

The U-net segmented whole vertebra regions, containing vertebra body, transverse process, and spinous process. Due to the significant structural alterations in patients with scoliosis, the transverse process and spinous process could introduce biases to estimated spinal curves, and thus were removed by a technique called spoke kernel filtering.

The spoke kernel filtering could exclude transverse and spinous processes, as well as separating connected vertebra regions caused by serious scoliosis. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the spoke kernel aims to eradicate narrow "bottleneck" regions. Utilizing the spoke kernel, neighboring vertebrae, in conjunction with transverse and spinous processes, can be adequately differentiated.

Fig. 1
Spoke kernel filtering. a Center of the spoke kernel was applied to each pixel of spine segmentation. b For each diameter, if both end points were located outside the spine region (red points), its traversing pixels would be removed from the segmentation mask. Otherwise, the traversing points would be preserved (blue dashed lines)

The spoke kernel comprises a circular mask, devised through the midpoint circle algorithm. Line segments spanning the circular epicenter are formulated through the midpoint line algorithm, and they function to bridge centrosymmetric circular coordinates. In spoke kernel filtering, the circle center traverses all spinal pixels in each segmentation mask of vertebral colume. If both ends of a line segment are located on non-spinal structures, all points on this line are considered as candicates to be excluded from the segmentation mask. These line coordinates are collectively discarded upon the finalization of the scan of all spinal voxels. The spoke kernel filtering can be regarded as a speical version of morphological openning operation that removes narrow bridges connecting large regions. Although some boundary voxels could be removed after spoke kernel filtering, the majority remains and vertebral shapes are smoothed. The spoke kernel radius was initially set at 8 mm and adjusted manually to accommodate variances in image dimensions. Therefore, after spoke kernel filtering, detached minuscule regions are removed, utilizing a threshold of 500 voxel count.

### A DNA target-enrichment approach to detect mutations, copy number changes and immunoglobulin translocations in multiple myeloma [^38595024]. Blood Cancer Journal (2016). Low credibility.

IGH translocations and rearrangements

For IGH translocations, we manually ran Brassto find clusters of read pairs where one read maps to the IGH locus and the other in proximity to a known partner of translocation (Supplementary Table S3).

To detect V(D)J rearrangements, we first segmented the sequencing depth of the IGH region using the R package 'changepoint' in order to find positions of copy number change indicative of loss of copy number secondary to deletions in the locus. We then retrieved clusters of read pairs where at least one end mapped to a segmentation breakpoint (max distance: 2 kb) such that the read pair orientations and sequencing depth changes were consistent with a deletion event. To filter out mismapping artifacts and only focus on high-confidence events, we also analyzed a panel of 48 normal samples targeted with the same design (as well as the nonlymphoid lines within our cohort). We only retained events that (1) were supported by ⩾10 reads in the test sample and none in the controls; (2) were supported by reads mapped with a quality of ⩾27 on one end and > 0 on the other; (3) were around a deletion of at least 8 kb of length; and (4) whose start and end coordinates were not duplicated in the control cohort, suggestive of potential artifacts.

### Molecular resolution imaging by post-labeling expansion single-molecule localization microscopy (Ex-SMLM) [^c6f0ee71]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Analysis of microtubule transversal profiles

To analyze and compare the different expansion protocols we developed a home written software that detects fiber like structures and automatically determines the transversal profile along these structures in reconstructed SMLM images. In detail the SMLM images are first convolved with a Gaussian blur compensating for noise discontinuity or holes. A thresholding algorithmthen converts the image from grayscale to binary. Using Lees algorithmthe expanded lines are reduced to one pixel width. The pixel coordinates from all still connected lines are then retrieved and tested for continuity. Points of discontinuity are used as breakpoints and all following coordinates are connected to a new line. Lines, shorter than the minimum required length are discarded. An univariate spline of degree 3 (c-spline) is fitted to each line. Note that shape and gradient of the line depend on the smoothing parameter. The result is a table containing the spline coordinates and the local derivatives. Perpendicular to the derivative a line profile is extracted from the original image at each coordinate point. The averaged profiles for each spline are fitted with the following functions (Eqs. (1–5)):(where h is the intensity, c the center, b the offset, and w the variance of the distribution. Optimal for single profiles).

(optimal for profiles containing a dip).(optimal for profiles exhibiting a dip and high background signal).(y describes the theoretical intensity profile of microtubules whereanddenote the inner and outer cylinder radius. The quality of the fit strongly depends on the initial estimation of the parameters, due to the nonlinearity of the cylinder function.)

(includes the theoretical dimensions of microtubules leaving less degrees of freedom. Might result in a better fit). Note that the fit intensity (h) gives a good estimation for the relative labeling density.

Using the splines fitted to the maximum intensity projection we constructed xz -profile projections of microtubules, by taking line profiles in each z -stack of the 3D image. Averaging the aligned line profiles in a layer yields the intensity values for the corresponding row of the xz -projection.

### A general method for the creation of dilational surfaces [^6025b588]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Dilational structures can change in size without changing their shape. Current dilational designs are only suitable for specific shapes or curvatures and often require parts of the structure to move perpendicular to the dilational surface, thereby occupying part of the enclosed volume. Here, we present a general method for creating dilational structures from arbitrary surfaces (2-manifolds with or without boundary), where all motions are tangent to the described surface. The method consists of triangulating the target curved surface and replacing each of the triangular faces by pantograph mechanisms according to a tiling algorithm that avoids collisions between neighboring pantographs. Following this algorithm, any surface can be made to mechanically dilate and could, theoretically, scale from the fully expanded configuration down to a single point. We illustrate the method with three examples of increasing complexity and varying Gaussian curvature.

### Endpoint localization in guide wire tracking during endovascular interventions [^aff3bbb8]. Academic Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

A method is presented to track guide wires during endovascular interventions under X-ray fluoroscopy. Accurate guide wire tracking can be used to improve guide wire visualization in the low quality fluoroscopic images, and to estimate the position of the guide wire in world coordinates for navigation purposes.

Materials and Methods

A two-step procedure is used to track the guide wire in subsequent frames. First, the position of the guide wire is obtained by fitting a spline to the image. Subsequently, the spline is iteratively moved toward the tip of the guide wire for accurate tip localization. For both steps, a feature image is used in which line-like structures are enhanced. The method is validated using a reference standard, obtained by manual tracings of three observers.

Results

The method is evaluated on 20 image sequences, 10 sequences with a J-tipped guide wire and 10 with a straight guide wire. The tracking success was 96% for J-tipped and 100% for straight guide wires, whereas accurate endpoint localization could be performed in 91.3% and 94.4% of the frames respectively, with a tip localization error of less than 1.5 mm.

Conclusions

Accurate endpoint localization can be performed for both J-tipped and straight guide wires and therefore the presented tracking method can be used for navigation purposes.

### Tracking down the molecular architecture of the synaptonemal complex by expansion microscopy [^39e61f2b]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Protein position analysis

SC cross-sectional profiles using 'Line Profiler': The SYCE3 or SYCP3 input image is convolved with a Gaussian blur, compensating noise and intensity fluctuations. Via Otsu thresholding the image is converted into a binary image. Using Lee's algorithm, a skeletonize image is constructed reducing all expanded shapes to lines with 1 pixel width. Subsequently, all connected pixels unequal to zero are sorted und checked for continuity, i.e. sharp edges mark a breakpoint initiating a new line. The pixel coordinates of each line are then fitted with a c-spline. The c-splines coordinates and local derivatives are a good estimation for the center and orientation of the helical structure of the SYCP3 channel. Note that the orientation and center of the SYCP3 channel can also be estimated by determining the center of mass ('1 channel' mode). Combining spline fitting of the central element with a floodfill algorithm used on the SYCP3 strand, yields potential regions of interest. Using a logical AND operation on the line coordinates and the floodfill image results in the desired source coordinates and directions for further evaluation. Line profiles are then constructed originating at the source coordinates perpendicular to the c-splines derivative. We discarded all distances laying outside of 400–1200 nm to exclude undesired structures, like two strands close to each other. As Line Profiler uses 2D images, it is biased to underestimate the true peak-to-peak distance close to helical twists. Therefore, we histogrammed the distances of all profiles and fitted them to a right-sided half norm formula (1):of intensity y at position x with amplitude A, center c, standard deviation σ, and noise level n as free fit parameters. Strand distances and errors were determined by the center of the least-square fit and its standard deviation. The line profiles are post aligned at the center of the two global maxima. Average profiles are returned for each line and for the whole image.

### A topological fluctuation theorem [^b484087b]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Exact solution for a single vortex

To shed some light on the topological fluctuation theorem (3), we now focus on the physically relevant case d = 3 and consider the motion of a tracer particle in a flow field created by a single straight vortex line oriented along e z, which is given in cylindrical coordinates (r, ϕ, z) bywhereand, so that from Eq. (7) we can readily evaluate. The simple case where the particle motion is restricted to a ring following the flow streamlines, such that the drive is effectively uniform, has been treated previously. This problem (generalizable to higher dimensions) corresponds to a biased random walk and the fluctuation theorem can be shown to result from the Gaussian form of the winding distribution.

However, from the above derivation the relation (3) holds even when the Brownian particle is allowed to move transversally to flow streamlines. Considering closed trajectories winding around a vortex line in free space, the Fokker–Planck equation describing the evolution of the distributioncan be solved exactly, such that the winding distribution is given, up to a normalizing constant, by (details in the Methods section below)where, r 0 denotes the initial radial position of the particle and I ν is the modified Bessel function of the first kind, of order ν.

### Influence of lumbar flexion on the position of the intercrestal line [^c968aeeb]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

This study was performed to ascertain whether the position of the intercrestal line changes as a result of flexion of the lumbar spine.

Methods

Previously taken lumbar spine x-rays of 103 patients in the neutral and full-flexed positions were reviewed. In the lateral flexion images to compensate for the sagittal rotation of the pelvis during lumbar flexion and for the possible difference in the level between the two sides of the ilium when taking the lateral images, the intercrestal line was drawn as follows: a potential line, crossing the midpoint of the highest points of both iliums, should be perpendicular to the tangential line at the point of intersection of the potential line with the skin. The position of the intercrestal line in relation to the spinous process was determined on an imaginary line moved 1 cm toward the vertebral body from the tangential line on the 2 successive spinous processes, and the interspinous distance of L3-4 was measured on this imaginary line.

Results

With full-flexion of the lumbar spine, the position of the intercrestal line in relation to the spinous process [median (25th to 75th percentiles)] changed slightly from L4 (L4-L4-5) into L4-5 (L4-L4-5) (P < .001), but it remained at the same level in 58.3% of the patients (60/103). In no case was a change of more than 1 level observed. The interspinous width (mean ± SD) of L3-4 increased from 6.5 ± 2.4 mm to 13.2 ± 4.4 mm (P < .001).

Conclusion

When compared with the neutral position, the position of the intercrestal line usually does not change with full flexion of the lumbar spine, and even in cases in which change occurs, it does not move beyond the next level.

### Lod scores for gene mapping in the presence of marker map uncertainty [^5a97e6e3]. Genetic Epidemiology (2001). Low credibility.

Multipoint lod scores are typically calculated for a grid of locus positions, moving the putative disease locus across a fixed map of genetic markers. Changing the order of a set of markers and/or the distances between the markers can make a substantial difference in the resulting lod score curve and the location and height of its maximum. The typical approach of using the best maximum likelihood marker map is not easily justified if other marker orders are nearly as likely and give substantially different lod score curves. To deal with this problem, we propose three weighted multipoint lod score statistics that make use of information from all plausible marker orders. In each of these statistics, the information conditional on a particular marker order is included in a weighted sum, with weight equal to the posterior probability of that order. We evaluate the type 1 error rate and power of these three statistics on the basis of results from simulated data, and compare these results to those obtained using the best maximum likelihood map and the map with the true marker order. We find that the lod score based on a weighted sum of maximum likelihoods improves on using only the best maximum likelihood map, having a type 1 error rate and power closest to that of using the true marker order in the simulation scenarios we considered.

### Recommendations for quantification methods during the performance of a pediatric echocardiogram: a report from the pediatric measurements writing group of the American Society of Echocardiography pediatric and congenital heart disease council [^c72a75f7]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Medium credibility.

Left ventricle morphometric evaluation — In pediatric echocardiography, LV size should be measured during both diastole and systole; end-diastole can be defined as the frame at which the MV closes and end-systole as the frame preceding MV opening. Short-axis or minor-axis measurements of LV internal diameter, septal and posterior wall thickness can be obtained in parasternal views, and the short-axis view is the recommended approach because it allows one to choose the diameter with the best blood-endocardium interface. Because M-mode measurements in long axis views can overestimate LV minor-axis diameters compared with 2D measurements, 2D short-axis imaging is the recommended approach to obtain LV short-axis measurements averaged over 3 consecutive cardiac cycles. Ideally, a combination of long-axis and short-axis views should be used to ascertain that the minor-axis measurement is perpendicular to and crosses the midpoints of the ventricular septum and posterior wall and that LV short-axis geometry is circular throughout the cardiac cycle.

### A biosynthetic thumb prosthesis [^8b9b5c49]. NPJ Biomedical Innovations (2025). Medium credibility.

Prior to mechanical testing, the prototype implant was affixed at its proximal end to a titanium hinge, representing the biological MCP joint and residual proximal phalanx. The relationship between the MCP angle (synthetic only for testing, biological in the intended use) and the IP joint (synthetic part of the implant) was characterized using a 3D motion capture system (Vantage, Vicon, Yarnton, Oxfordshire), which were positioned to track the positional changes of reflective markers affixed to the device as it was passively cycled through its full range of motion. To minimize reflection from the metal device, exposed titanium was covered with non-reflective tape. Three reflective markers were placed on each segment of the prototype, along with one at the thumb tip and on each screw. For this analysis, the MCP angle was defined as the angle formed between link C and a vertical line, while the IP angle was defined as the angle formed between the line connecting the midpoints of links A and B and the line extending from the midpoint of link B to the thumb tip.

### A selection and targeting framework of cortical locations for line-scanning fMRI [^48e3a5f5]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

One potential source of variation is the registration accuracy between anatomical images from the first and second session. For each subject, we performed the registration 100 times, applied the resulting matrices to the target coordinate, and calculated the Euclidean distance to the original coordinate targeted in the second session. Thus, for each subject, we obtained a distribution representing registration variation. This procedure showed that registration was highly stable (< 0.4 mm) for all subjects (Figure 3d). An additional source of variation is subject motion. Because of the limited field‐of‐view single slices offer, it is challenging to estimate this accurately. Nevertheless, we manually aligned slices of each run to the first slice right after the first anatomical scan. This procedure assumes motion is limited after initial registration of the first and second session and the acquisition of this slice. We applied each run‐to‐run transformation matrix to the targeted coordinate with antsApplyTransformsToPoints to obtain the coordinate in each run‐specific slice. We then evaluated the Euclidean distance between these coordinates and the initial target coordinate. This showed that motion induced an average displacement of the target coordinate of ~0.6 mm across runs (Figure 3e).

In the current line‐planning implementation, the target coordinate was selected by minimizing the curvature in a patch of cortex that survived the initial pRF‐criteria. For each subject, we estimated the distribution of curvature values present in the line (Figure 3f). This showed that on average, the curvature was predominantly flat (0.04 ± 0.003 1/mm). For some subjects, the initial criteria (e.g. variance explained and/or visual field position) moved the area within which to optimize for curvature towards areas with more curvature. This necessarily results in a loss of spatial specificity within the line; signals coming from non‐GM were mixed into the line. From manual segmentations, we estimated that the voxels covering the cortical ribbon around the target region consisted of 88.34 ± 1.07% GM, 8.22 ± 2.77% WM, and 3.44 ± 3.18% CSF (Figure S5). These estimations are likely conservative given the imperfect OVS bands.

### Intrinsic detection of motion in segmented sequences [^49775cc6]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

While many motion correction techniques for MRI have been proposed, their use is often limited by increased patient preparation, decreased patient comfort, additional scan time, or the use of specialized sequences not available on many commercial scanners. For this reason, we propose a simple self-navigating technique designed to detect motion in segmented sequences. We demonstrate that comparing two segments containing adjacent sets of k-space lines results in an aliased error function. A global shift of the aliased error function indicates the presence of in-plane rigid-body translation, while other types of motion are evident in the dispersion or breadth of the error function. Since segmented sequences commonly acquire data in sets of adjacent k-space lines, this method provides these sequences with an inherent method of detecting object motion. Motion corrupted data can then be reacquired proactively or in some cases corrected or removed retrospectively.

### Anatomical study of the innervation of the masseter muscle and its correlation with myofascial trigger points [^f3797d16]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Masseter Muscle Measurements

The following dimensions were measured: superior transverse (A), greater muscular dimension near the inferior margin of the zygomatic bone maxillary process, and zygomatic arch; lower transverse (B), and greater muscular dimension close to the mandible angle. A longitudinal line (C) was defined and measured between the midpoints of the upper and lower transverse lines of the masseter muscle. The middle transverse line (D) was defined from the midpoint of the longitudinal line and parallel to the upper transverse line (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Dimensions of the masseter muscle in relation to segments: (A) superior transverse; (B) lower transverse; (C) longitudinal line of the masseter muscle; and (D) middle transverse line.

Note: Figure courtesy of Marcos Vinicius de Oliveira.

Sextant Delimitations

The penetration points of the masseteric nerve into the muscle were measured in relation to the median and longitudinal transverse measurements, delimiting an abscissa and ordinate cartesian plane, respectively. As these values vary according to muscle size, the relative values of the penetration point in relation to the median and longitudinal transverse dimensions were calculated. Thus, these dimensions make up 100% of the muscle size, while muscle insertion values make up the relative value. By convention, the following were adopted: the intersection of the axes as the origin and zero point; upper anterior quadrant with positive ordinate and abscissa; lower posterior quadrant with ordinate and negative abscissa; upper posterior quadrant with negative and positive ordered abscissa; and lower anterior quadrant with positive abscissa and negative ordered (Figure 2A).

### Role of mutations and post-translational modifications in systemic AL amyloidosis studied by cryo-EM [^4ceaab39]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Measurement of the persistence length

A total of 197 amyloid fibrils in heart tissue were traced in the STEM tomograms and were then available as polygonal chains. Based on this representation, the squared end-to-end distance R, i.e. the Cartesian plane distance between the starting and end points, and the contour length L, i.e. the sum of the length of all line segments of the polygonal chain, were computed for each fibril. The persistence length P of the fibrils was then determined by regression analysis using the formulaaccording to Kollmer et al.and using the curve-fitting tool in Matlab (MATLAB 2019, The MathWorks). P is contained in the confidence interval from 0.66 μm to 0.81 μm in 95% of all cases. The bending rigidity B is computed based on P according to the formulawhere k B and T denote the Boltzmann constant and the temperature (300 K), respectively.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

Mitral valve leaflet and scallop nomenclature: The anterior (or aortic) leaflet is rounded and occupies a third of the circumference of the annulus, while the posterior (or mural) leaflet occupies the other two thirds and tends to be narrower in radial length; the relative areas of each leaflet are roughly equal and the line of coaptation approximates an arc with the ends referred to as commissures. The anterolateral and posteromedial commissures do not extend to the annulus; the posterior leaflet is often indented, creating three frequently unequal scallops with the middle typically the largest; Carpentier et al.'s nomenclature labels the most lateral segment P1 adjacent to the anterolateral commissure, P2 as central and variable, and P3 as most medial and posterior; the anterior leaflet is larger and uses A1, A2, and A3 for lateral, middle, and medial regions.

### Symmetry breaking in optimal transport networks [^f4124a5b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The main problem in network design is fundamentally different. We are given the density of population and we are looking for the network that minimizes some objective function involving some average time, in general (although other choices are possible, see for example). In this setting, there are usually two different transport modes, a slow one representing for example cars on the road network, and a fast one representing the subway or some rapid transit network. The natural framework here is then the one of multiplex networks comprising two different transportation networks, one known while the structure of the second one is to be determined (for multiplexes in the context of optimization see for example). A practical realization of this problem concerns the specific case of subways (for a network analysis of subways, see for example,–). In most large cities, a subway system has been built and later enlarged, with current total lengths varying from a few kilometers to a few hundred kilometers. The geometry of these networks, as its total length increases, varies from simple lines to more complex shapes with loops for larger networks. In particular, for the largest networks, convergence to a structure with a well-connected central core and branches reaching out to suburbs has been observed.

Algorithmic aspects of network design have been studied within computational geometry (e.g.chapter 9) and location science (e.g.and references therein), and some simpler problems of this type have been addressed previously. For instance, the problem of the quickest access between an area and a given point was discussed in. In network science, the optimization problem is traditionally recast as a navigation problem in lattices with long-range connections. However, our specific question – optimal network topologies as a function of population distribution and network length – is largely an open problem. In, some results were obtained in two-dimensional systems by comparing a priori defined optimal network configurations. First, it was shown that, if the goal is reaching a single point in the plane, then the optimal network is necessarily a tree. Second, the paper hinted at the possibility of the existence of transitions between optimal configurations when the length of the network changes. More precisely, it has been shown that as the length of the network increases resources go preferentially to radial branches and that there is a sharp transition at a critical value of the length where a loop appears.

Stepwise determination of conflict regions. White circles denote shared markers, and gray circles denote unique markers. The figure illustrates the process of delineating conflict regions based on overlapping regions of pairwise conflicts. Conflict between markers a and b includes the first five sets; the conflict region is bordered by a single line. Conflict between b and d starts in the first region (at set 4) and extends until the end (set 7) (its part outside the first region is marked by double lines). The whole conflict region is highlighted in gray.

Inversion and transposition transformations in consensus analysis. Black and gray circles represent shared and unique markers, respectively. Shared markers with the same name are connected with solid lines. The left part of the figure illustrates the operation "inversion": due to a large interval in set 2 (recombination rate ∼0.31), the distal part of the map in set 2 is in conflict with the one in set 1. Operation "inversion" returns a nonconflicting order. Similarly, in the right part of the figure, a source of the conflict is the interval with loose linkage in set 1. Operation "transposition" returns a nonconflicting order.

All errors are standard deviations. Those for the theory are estimated by bootstrapping (Methods: Statistical Analysis).

To predict the front speed and decay length, we solved Eqs. (1)-(3) in a co-moving frame. To facilitate solution, we made three well-justified assumptions in the distal front: we omitted the internal dendrite density (because terminal branches are in the majority), we dropped the collision term (because it is second order in density, which is small), we set the radial transport termto zero (because it decays as). Using an exponential trial solution, we obtained a constraint Eq. (16) on the allowed values ofversusas shown in Fig. 6c. The marginally stable solutionmust satisfy. This condition pinpoints the emerging front speedas the minimal speed along the-curve, which corresponds to a singular solution for the decay length.

### A novel method of cervical pedicle screw placement from C3 to C5 and its clinical applications [^dea55729]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

Applied anatomical study and clinical application.

Objective

To design and optimize the method of cervical pedicle screw placement for cervical vertebrae C3-C5, and to test it in clinical applications.

Summary Of Background Data

Most of the anatomical studies on cervical pedicle screw placement previously published focused on the lower cervical vertebrae. Clinically, it is much more difficult to place C3, C4, and C5 screws than C6 and C7 screws; therefore, anatomical measurements of C3-C5 pedicles and design of an appropriate screw placement method are required.

Methods

A total of 20 cervical vertebrae specimens were prepared, and bilateral pedicle screws were manually inserted for C3-C5. The intersection of the horizontal line through the midpoint of the transverse process root and the vertical line through the mediolateral third of the superior articular process was used as the entry point. The screws were inserted along the axis of the pedicle, with the axis of the screw coinciding with that of the pedicle. The specimens were truncated along the horizontal or sagittal plane of the pedicle, and a variety of measurements were made to determine appropriate screw type and placement. Finally, this screw fixation technique was applied in clinical situations with the placement of 26 C3 screws, 26 C4 screws, and 38 C5 screws.

Results

Pedicular height was larger than pedicular width for the same segment of C3-C5, and pedicular width of the different segments did not significantly vary. The lengths of the screw channels for C3-C5 screw placement were similar. The transverse angles of C3-C5 segments displayed a decreasing trend, whereas the vertical angles did not. In all clinical cases, all screws were properly within the pedicles examined using postoperative computed tomography scan. Only 1 C3 screw penetrated the medial cortex and slightly entered the spinal canal, but no clinical symptoms occurred.

Conclusion

The intersection of the horizontal line through the midpoint of the transverse process root and the vertical line through the mediolateral third of the superior articular process represents a superior frame of reference for the entry point for C3-C5 pedicle screw fixation. Clinically, we recommend the transverse angles to be 90° for C3 and 80° for C4 and C5, and the vertical angles to be 70° for C3-C5. We found that screws with a diameter of 3.5 mm and length of 20 mm or 22 mm to be safe, objective, and reliable.

For comparison, the scaling of SD as a function of f c predicted by the von Mises distribution is displayed (dashed line). d Histograms of angle difference ψ rescaled by their corresponding SDs σ ψ (solid lines) are well-approximated by the von Mises distribution with unit SD (dashed line). e Angle difference distribution obtained from the experimental data from n = 8 networks (solid bars) compared with the von Mises distribution predicted by the theory for an external field strength of f c = 0.6 (dashed line). The latter value is inferred from the matching of theoretical and experimental values of the SDs displayed in (c), and no other fit parameter is used.

### Ventricular dyssynchrony assessed by gated myocardial perfusion SPECT using a geometrical approach: a feasibility study [^06ca1a95]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Contraction analysis

Initial localization of the endocardial and epicardial borders by Corridor4DM is performed based on gradient operators and predefined information on shape, location and continuity of the ventricular wall. Using a cylindrical-spherical sampling structure intensity profiles are created contained by the endocardial and epicardial boundaries. Refined surface estimates are determined by a set of one- and two-dimensional weighted splines. A Gaussian function is applied to the intensity profiles contained by these new surface estimates to locate peak myocardial activity. The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian is utilized to produce the myocardial thickness and is scaled to an average thickness of 10 mm in end diastole for gated studies. In the other frames myocardial thickness is scaled with preservation of the myocardial mass. The resulting endocardial and epicardial borders are used to calculate the time-volume curve.

Polar maps are constructed by radial sampling of 460 sectors within the myocardial volume (bounded by the cardiac borders) at each gating interval. The perfusion maps are based on the maximal count value within each sector. Wall thickening, which is based on these perfusion maps, is defined as the difference between the maximum count value occurring within a sector during the cardiac cycle and the count value at end diastole.

Wall motion is based on a adapted implementation of the centerline technique. A midline is positioned between the endocardial surface at end diastole and end systole (see Fig. 1). Perpendicular to this midline, normal vectors are placed connecting corresponding sectors in the end-diastolic and end-systolic frame. Maximal motion of a sector is defined as the absolute length of a vector between the end-systolic and end-diastolic positions of that segment and is depicted in millimetres. The time to peak motion is used to describe the timing of ventricular contraction patterns. The moment of peak motion in a sector is defined as the percentage of the cardiac cycle at which the motion vector is maximal (% RR cycle).

### Linear optics of the eye and optical systems: a review of methods and applications [^4440d19e]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

The visual axis of an eye is defined as the incident ray segment of the nodal ray that arrives at the centre of the fovea. In an eye that suffers from astigmatism, nodal points do not exist as points and so the definition fails. However, Harrispoints out that eyes with astigmatism do have nodal rays and he proposes a revised definition for visual axes. A nodal ray is any ray whose incident and emergent segments are parallel, that is. Nodal rays may undergo translation. A visual axis is defined as a nodal ray with two segments, an internal V and externalsegmentand is not one continuous ray or line through the eye. The internal segment reaches the fovea atwith, while the external segment is in object-space and of greater clinical relevance.

The pupillary axis is defined as the line perpendicular to the cornea that passes through the centre of the entrance pupil of the eye. Clinically, it is the line that objectively determines a person's direction of gaze. The entrance pupil is an image of the pupil seen through the cornea and in an eye with astigmatic anterior elements, this image breaks up into two line foci and the familiar interval of Sturm and becomes blurred, and consequently, the pupillary axis is not well defined. A modified definition that includes astigmatic eyes and decentred or tilted anterior elements is 'the pupillary axis is the infinite straight line containing the incident segment of the ray that passes through the centre of the (actual) pupil and is perpendicular to the first surface of the eye'. Defining the pupillary axis this way allows the definition to extend to the compound system of an eye with optical compensation such as a contact lens or IOLs.

### The segmental pectoralis major free flap: anatomical features of its vascular pedicle [^41f3d6d1]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The pectoralis major muscle may be suited for free transplantation of a segment of the muscle. We investigated the length and diameter of its vascular pedicle to determine its feasibility.

Methods

The length of the pedicle, its arterial diameter, and its entry point into the muscle were determined in 17 cadaveric flaps.

Results

The pedicle length up to the medial border of the pectoralis minor muscle averaged 6.6 cm. The mean external arterial diameter was 1.8 mm, and the venous diameter was consistently larger. The vascular pedicle consistently entered the muscle lateral to the midpoint of, and a mean of, 8.8 cm caudal to the clavicular line.

Conclusion

The vascular length and diameter are sufficient for microvascular anastomosis. Although an anatomic landmark for the cranial border of the flap could not be defined, the sternocostal part of the pectoralis major muscle may potentially be used as a segmental free flap.

### Quantitative mapping of the per-axon diffusion coefficients in brain white matter [^0bc83ba6]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Second‐Order Approximation

In this work, we model the diffusion signal of an axonal segment using a second‐order approximation 26, which may be written as

Eventually, the spherical mean of the diffusion signal with the parametric response model (7) readswheredenotes the confluent hypergeometric function and erf is the error function. Equation [8] has been derived before 10, 14, 35, but was used in a different context, that is, for the recovery of the fiber orientation distribution.

### Solving olympiad geometry without human demonstrations [^34ba4bce]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Fig. 5
AlphaGeometry discovers a more general theorem than the translated IMO 2004 P1.

Left, top to bottom, the IMO 2004 P1 stated in natural language, its translated statement and AlphaGeometry solution. Thanks to the traceback algorithm necessary to extract the minimal premises, AlphaGeometry identifies a premise unnecessary for the proof to work: O does not have to be the midpoint of BC for P, B, C to be collinear. Right, top, the original theorem diagram; bottom, the generalized theorem diagram, in which O is freed from its midpoint position and P still stays on line BC. Note that the original problem requires P to be between B and C, a condition where the generalized theorem and solution does not guarantee.

Human expert evaluation of AlphaGeometry outputs

Because AlphaGeometry outputs highly interpretable proofs, we used a simple template to automatically translate its solutions to natural language. To obtain an expert evaluation in 2000 and 2015, during which AlphaGeometry solves all geometry problems and potentially passes the medal threshold, we submit these solutions to the USA IMO team coach, who is experienced in grading mathematical olympiads and has authored books for olympiad geometry training. AlphaGeometry solutions are recommended to receive full scores, thus passing the medal threshold of 14/42 in the corresponding years. We note that IMO tests also evaluate humans under three other mathematical domains besides geometry and under human-centric constraints, such as no calculator use or 4.5-h time limits. We study time-constrained settings with 4.5-h and 1.5-h limits for AlphaGeometry in Methods and report the results in Extended Data Fig. 1.

Learning to predict the symbolic engine's output improves the language model's auxiliary construction

In principle, auxiliary construction strategies must depend on the details of the specific deduction engine they work with during proof search. We find that a language model without pretraining only solves 21 problems. This suggests that pretraining on pure deduction proofs generated by the symbolic engine DD + AR improves the success rate of auxiliary constructions. On the other hand, a language model without fine-tuning also degrades the performance but not as severely, with 23 problems solved compared with AlphaGeometry's full setting at 25.

### Longitudinal shapes of the tibia and femur are unrelated and variable [^3d86bdac]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2010). Low credibility.

Fig. 2A–B
The anatomic axis of the femur (longitudinal white line) was a line joining the midpoints of the tibia at the joint line and at the junction of the distal one-fourth and proximal three-fourths of the femur (transverse black line). The mechanical axis of the femur was a line joining the midpoint of the femur at the joint line and the center of the femoral head (longitudinal black line). The angle formed by these two lines was measured. The bow of the femur was quantified by the offset (D) measured from a line (transverse white line) drawn perpendicular from the anatomic axis of the femur to the center of the femoral head. The larger the offset, the larger the bow with a positive value (+) indicating the anatomic axis passed lateral to the center of the femoral head and a negative value (−) indicating the anatomic axis passed medial to the center of the femoral head. (A) The offset of the femur with the greatest lateral bow was 6.4 cm. (B) The offset of the femur with the least lateral bow was −0.4 cm. Because of the variability in the lateral bow of the femur, the mechanical axis of the femur does not form a 5° to 6° angle with the anatomic axis of the distal fourth of the femur in either leg.

We used the arithmetic mean, standard deviation, 95% confidence interval, frequency distribution, and quantile box plot to describe the variability of the angle formed by the anatomic and mechanical axes of the tibia and femur and the bow of the tibia and femur. The quantile box plot summarizes the distribution of data points. The line across the middle of the box identifies the median. The ends of the box indicate the 25th and 75th quantiles. The small ticks indicate the 10% and 90% quantiles, the intermediate ticks indicate the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles, and the large ticks indicate the 0% and 100% quantiles. An unpaired t-test was used to determine whether the angle formed by the anatomic and mechanical axes of the tibia and femur and the bow of the tibia and femur were different between females and males. A correlation coefficient was computed to assess the correlation between the bow of the tibia and the bow of the femur. Each analysis was performed with software (Version 7.0.2, JMP for MacIntosh; SPSS, Chicago, IL;).

### Effect of high-potency cannabis on corpus callosum microstructure [^97f8c29b]. Psychological Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

CC segmentation

The subsections of the CC were defined according to the geometrical instructions given by Witelson. The maximal length of the CC was taken as the line joining the most anterior and posterior point of the callosum. Perpendiculars to this axis were drawn at specific arithmetic divisions resulting in callosal segments, which are shown in Fig. 1 b. The length of CC could then be divided into the fractions described by Witelson, using a new ROI for each subsection. These include: genu, rostral body, anterior mid-body, posterior mid-body, isthmus and splenium (Fig. 1). The ROI for each subsection spans the proportion of the total CC length assigned to it by the Witelson subdivisions (for example, the splenium ROI was one-fifth of the anterior–posterior length of the ROI), and perpendicular height (inferior to superior) at least equal to the corresponding part of the CC ROI, forming a rectangle.

Fig. 1.
Corpus callosum tract: whole (a) and segmented (b). Regions of interest as defined according to Witelson subdivisions. RB, Rostral body; AMB, anterior mid-body; PMB, posterior mid-body; Ism, isthmus. For a colour figure, see the online version.

Data analysis

Sociodemographic characteristics were examined with t tests or χ 2 as appropriate. We first examined differences in CC microstructure between FEP patients and individuals without psychosis using multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVAs), with FA, MD, RD and AD values of the whole CC as dependent variables, group as fixed factor (patients v. individuals without psychosis), and age and gender as covariates of no interest. To examine the effect of cannabis on CC microstructure (for total CC and its subregions) across the whole sample, the same analyses were performed with potency of cannabis (no use, low potency, high potency), frequency of use (never, occasional, daily), cumulative effect of potency/frequency (daily/high-potency users, daily/low-potency users, never used/used weekly) and age at first use (< or > 15 years) separately entered as fixed factors. Finally, these analyses where repeated on an exploratory basis separately for patients with psychosis and individuals without psychosis.

### An ultrasound investigation of tongue dorsum raising in children with cleft palate ± cleft lip [^3ecee540]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The Dorsum Excursion Index

The Dorsum Excursion Index (DEI) is a scalar metric and therefore not sensitive to differences in rotation, translation, or tongue size, making it a useful measure for comparing children of different sizes and ages. The measure is designed to directly assess the extent of tongue dorsum, or back, involvement during articulations. For the purposes of the measure, Zharkova (2013:485) defines the location of the tongue dorsum as "opposite the midpoint of the straight line traced between two ends of the midsagittal tongue curve" (see figure 1).

Figure 1.
Example tongue splines for calculation of dorsum excursion index. Blue = /k/, Green = /t/, red = [q], with the tongue tip to the right. A line, n, is drawn between the ends of the spline and the midpoint found. A perpendicular line, d, is drawn and the dorsum excursion index is calculated as d/n. DEI values are green = 0.34, blue = 0.49 and red = 0.54.

To calculate the DEI, first, the surface of the tongue at the point of interest- either mid-consonant or vowel or the frame of maximum excursion- is traced with a "spline" and then a straight line (n) is drawn between each end of the curve and the midpoint found. A perpendicular line (d) is drawn from this midpoint to the spline and a ratio (d/n) calculated. Figure one illustrates calculation of DEI for a /t/ articulation (green), a /k/ articulation (blue) and a [q] articulation (red) produced by a typical adult speaker where DEI is the ratio of d/n. Since DEI is a ratio measure which can be calculated irrespective of translation or rotation, it is important to note that it is a measure of tongue shape, not place. That is, more bunched shapes have higher DEI values and flatter shapes have lower DEI values, but retraction or place of articulation cannot be assumed.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2008). Medium credibility.

Carotid ultrasound imaging pitfalls and solutions — frequently observed issues and corrective steps include the following: For lack of the "double-line" sign, place the vessel horizontal on screen, move the transducer perpendicular to the vessel, and adjust focus and gain; for tortuous vessel, further extend and slightly rotate the neck to elongate the segment; for image too deep with blurry posterior angles, adjust focus, add gel, press the sternocleidomastoid muscle and slowly decrease pressure until good acoustic impedance is achieved, showing clear double lines; for image too shallow with slice thickness artifact, increase distance of vessel from near field, add more gel, use less pressure, and stack over jugular vein; and for translation artifact from the pulsatile jugular vein, have the patient hold breath at midinspiration to stabilize the image.

### A physical map of human chromosome 14 [^595d1460]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

We report the construction of a tiling path of around 650 clones covering more than 99% of human chromosome 14. Clone overlap information to assemble the map was derived by comparing fully sequenced clones with a database of clone end sequences (sequence tag connector strategy). We selected homogeneously distributed seed points using an auxiliary high-resolution radiation hybrid map comprising 1,895 distinct positions. The high long-range continuity and low redundancy of the tiling path indicates that the sequence tag connector approach compares favourably with alternative mapping strategies.

### Rigorous location of phase transitions in hard optimization problems [^d98ebea5]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

It is widely believed that for many optimization problems, no algorithm is substantially more efficient than exhaustive search. This means that finding optimal solutions for many practical problems is completely beyond any current or projected computational capacity. To understand the origin of this extreme 'hardness', computer scientists, mathematicians and physicists have been investigating for two decades a connection between computational complexity and phase transitions in random instances of constraint satisfaction problems. Here we present a mathematically rigorous method for locating such phase transitions. Our method works by analysing the distribution of distances between pairs of solutions as constraints are added. By identifying critical behaviour in the evolution of this distribution, we can pinpoint the threshold location for a number of problems, including the two most-studied ones: random k-SAT and random graph colouring. Our results prove that the heuristic predictions of statistical physics in this context are essentially correct. Moreover, we establish that random instances of constraint satisfaction problems have solutions well beyond the reach of any analysed algorithm.

### Anatomical study of cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery and its relationship to the structures in sella region [^04dd1ff3]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The shape and position of the cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery (CSICA) are complicated, which makes the surgeries around it difficult. There were many reports about the primary event of internal carotid artery injury resulting in hemorrhage during transsphenoidal resection of pituitary tumors. The anatomical relationship between CSICA and the structures in the sella region around can explain its mechanism.

Purpose

We study the CSICA and its positional relationship to some stationary structures in the sellar region to locate CSICA and prevent it from injuring in the process of transsphenoidal surgery.

Material and Methods

Computed topographic angiography images of 144 internal carotid arteries in individuals were reviewed. The distance from CSICA to midpoint of sella bottom (SB) and the angle between line BA and line BM were measured in the coronal plane, which is across the middle point of SB. The vertical distance from the anterior curve segment of CSICA to the top edge of the sphenoid sinus was measured in people with sphenoid sinus of types III and IV. The horizontal distance between the midpoint of the posterior curve segment and the coronal middle line of SB was measured in the sagittal plane after multiplanar reformation.

Results

The mean (SD) distances from the CSICA to the midpoint of SB were 11.25 (3.35) mm in the right and 11.06 (2.98) mm in the left, and the mean (SD) angles between line BA and line BM were 74.2 (2.16) degrees in the right and 73.5 (2.33) degrees in the left. The mean (SD) vertical distance between the anterior curve segment of the CSICA and the top edge of the sphenoid sinus was -0.62 (0.96) mm, the mean (SD) of the right side was -0.68 (1.24) mm, and the mean (SD) of the left was -0.54 (1.15) mm. The mean (SD) horizontal distance between the midpoint of PS segment and the coronal middle line of SB was 6.41 (1.94) mm in the right and 6.31 (1.33) mm in the left.

Conclusions

The data in our study are valuable for surgeons in real clinical practice to achieve the best possible surgical outcome and maximize safety, and they also contribute to the understanding of the anatomy of CSICA and the structures around.

### Accuracy of left ventricular cavity volume and ejection fraction for conventional estimation methods and 3D surface fitting [^a63b93e6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

Common Volume Geometric Methods Used in the Clinic

Composite midpoint integration method

The commonly used composite midpoint integration method applies to parallel stacks of short‐axis image planes that, ideally, encompass the entire extent of the LV from the mitral valve annulus to the apex (Figure 1). The LVV is estimated by multiplying the observed cavity area on each slice, A, times the slice thickness, h, to get the volume contribution of each slice, and summing these over all slices (Eqn. 1 in Figure 1). This "stack of disks" approach is also commonly referred to as the Simpson's Rule; however, in mathematics the Simpson's Rule refers specifically to integration using quadric polynomials. 22 In this article, the in‐plane cavity area was computed numerically from the user‐selected LV endocardial contour, but in the clinic is often approximated from 1 or 2 user‐defined diameter measurements and a circular or elliptical model for the in‐plane area. A common variant implemented by Wyatt et al 17 models the most apical aspect of the LV as a hemisphere that emanates from the bottom half of the most apical slice (Eqn. 2 in Figure 1).

A, A diagram of an elliptical virtual left ventricle in a slightly oblique side view with short‐axis cut‐planes of thickness h indicated by gray rectangles. The in‐plane endocardial contours are depicted as dotted‐line ellipses. B (top), Gives the equation for the basic composite midpoint integration method as sum over all (N s) cross‐sectional slice areas (A i). B (bottom), Gives a variant from Wyatt et al 17 intended to correct for curvature effects at the apex. The sum is over all slices except the apex, then adds half the apex volume plus the volume of a hemisphere of radius equal to half the slice thickness.

### Comparing accuracies of length-type geographic atrophy growth rate metrics using atrophy-front growth modeling [^d30272cf]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Figure 3 shows the effective radiusand the perimeter-adjustedmetrics plotted against the ground truth growth ratesfor each of the configurations of Figure 2. We can see that, as was analytically derived in the Methods, the perimeter adjusted growth rateis a perfect estimator of Λ for isotropic, nonmerging growth patterns (configurations 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7). We also see that, even for configurations violating these requirements (configurations 3, 4, and 8), performs at or near the pixel resolution of the simulation grid (± 6 μm; Appendix 5) for most clinically observed growth rates. In comparison, the effective radius metricperforms relatively poorly for all but the simplest configuration (configuration 1), for which it was designed. Specifically, the effective radius metric is affected by circularity (equation 2), number of lesion foci (equation 3), and lesion merging.

### Trunk motion and gait characteristics of pregnant women when walking: report of a longitudinal study with a control group [^dbdc08dc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

A matrix was then determined from information on the location of at least three marker points in the segment coordinate system and the location of the same marker points within the laboratory coordinate system. The matrix served to represent the orientation of the segment coordinate system with respect to the laboratory coordinate system. The set of a minimum of three points for each segment was assumed to represent a rigid body. As such, an embedded coordinate system was defined, and its relationship to the segment during dynamic motion remained unchanged.

For the pelvic and thoracic segments, angular motion of each segment in space was calculated using the segment coordinate system with respect to the laboratory coordinate system. The reference position was used to represent zero angular displacement of the pelvic and thoracic segments. To investigate the relative rotational patterns of the pelvic and thoracic segments (thoracolumbar spine), the conventions used for calculation of joint angle using the segment coordinate system were applied where, two segment coordinate system axes were assumed to be embedded in each adjacent segment. The embedded axis in the thoracic segment served as the mediolateral axis and the one in the pelvis served as the longitudinal. The fixed axes moved with the adjacent segments such that the spatial relationship between them changed with motion. The third axis was mutually perpendicular to the two body fixed axes.

Stride length and step width were determined from the spatial trajectories of the foot markers, and the force platform data.

### Retinal vascular geometry predicts incident renal dysfunction in young people with type 1 diabetes [^7cf590f3]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Retinal vascular geometry

Retinal vascular geometry was analyzed from baseline retinal photographs. All slides were individually assessed for grading suitability. Right-eye, digitized retinal photographs of each patient were analyzed by a single grader (M.B.S.), masked to participants' characteristics, using a semiautomated, computer-assisted image program (Singapore I Vessel Assessment or SIVA) as previously described. The grader ensured that the vessel type selected by the program was correct. The software then combined the individual measurements into summary indices:

LDR was calculated as the length from the midpoint of the first branch to the midpoint of the second branch, divided by the diameter of the parent vessel at the first branch.
ST was calculated as the ratio between the actual path length of the vessel segment (measured by tracking) and the straight-line length of the same segment.
Retinal vessel caliber measurements, represented by the central retinal arteriolar equivalent (CRAE) and the central retinal venular equivalent (CRVE), were calculated as previously described.
Branching angle in degrees (°) represented the angle between two daughter vessels.

For quality control of retinal vascular measures, we performed intragrader reliability analysis on 120 randomly selected images to which the grader was masked. The intragrader correlation coefficients (ICCs) for each parameter were as follows: LDRv 0.80, arteriolar LDR 0.84, STv 0.81, arteriolar ST 0.96, CRAE 0.79, CRVE 0.89, arteriolar branching angle 0.65, and venular branching angle 0.4.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^68254cde]. Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation ablation endpoints — paroxysmal, persistent, and long-standing persistent AF — highlight PVI use and endpoint definitions with key procedural requirements. PVI is the cornerstone of AF ablation, and among the writing group members, 95% employ this endpoint during all AF ablation procedures; PVI is demonstrated by entrance block alone by 35%, and by both entrance and exit block by 65%. For persistent AF, it has been suggested that the endpoint should be the termination of AF either to a regular ATA or to sinus rhythm, although other studies have not confirmed that termination predicts longer-term outcomes. Slowing or prolongation of AF cycle length has been used as a surrogate for acute procedural success but might not be useful as a sole procedural endpoint. Regardless of the chosen ancillary target, complete local elimination of that target should be the goal to avoid partially ablated tissue that could serve as a site for future atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence. Empiric linear ablation likely does not add much to ablation of persistent AF; however, if linear ablation along the roof or mitral annulus is added to target roof- or mitral-dependent flutters, then bidirectional block is a prerequisite endpoint, and block across a line must be assessed in sinus rhythm with differential pacing maneuvers.

### Changes in articular cartilage after meniscectomy and meniscus replacement using a biodegradable porous polymer implant [^2c75a3df]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Immunohistochemistry

To determine the location of damaged collagen, the samples were stained using Col2-¾M and Col2-¾C short antibodies. Col2-¾M is a nonspecific indicator of collagen molecule damage, tagging an epitope within the triple-helix of the collagen molecule after the molecule is denatured. Col2-¾C short is a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the COOH terminus of the three-quarter fragment, which is generated very specifically by the cleavage of native type II collagen by mammalian collagenases. Using these antibodies, distinction can be made between mechanical damage (Col2-¾M) and enzymatic cleavage (Col2-¾C short). The staining procedures have been described in detail elsewhere. Adjacent sections were stained with safranin O.

Cartilage thickness

The thickness measurements were made according to a previously described method. The cartilage thickness was measured in the central zone of the tibial plateau and in the corresponding zone on the femoral condyle. For each specimen, five equally distanced (100 μm), safranin O-stained sections were measured at a 12.5× magnification using custom-made software. Manually, a polyline roughly delimiting the cartilage from the subchondral bone was produced. This polyline was converted to a b-spline consisting of a fixed number of points (500 points/section). Two parallel polylines were constructed from this b-spline. One of these polylines was offset to the inside, the other to the outside. A series of straight line segments was generated between each pair of points on these polylines. On each line segment, two points were automatically calculated (Fig. 4). The first one represents the transition between calcified cartilage and cartilage (tidemark level). The second one represents the outside edge of the cartilage. If necessary, these points could be corrected manually. The distance between these points was considered as the cartilage thickness along the line segment. The cartilage thickness was calculated as the mean length of all the segments generated. All sections were investigated blinded and in random order.

Fig. 4
Schematic representation of cartilage thickness measurements. A series of straight line segments perpendicular to both of the polylines were generated. On each line segment, two points were automatically calculated. One point represents the transition between calcified cartilage and cartilage (tidemark), and the other point represents the outer edge of the cartilage. The distance between these points was considered as the cartilage thickness along the line segment. The mean length of all line segments between the two points was calculated as overall cartilage thickness

### Direct insight into the structure-property relation of interfaces from constrained crystal structure prediction [^46ea29b4]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fig. 8
Construction of a starting supercell containing a single Σ5(021) GB.

We see a cut of the supercell along the axis perpendicular to the the (021) boundary plane (pink line). The constrained layers are indicated by the magenta (and yellow) Si atoms, while blue atoms constitute the interface region and their atomic positions are optimized during the MHM simulations. Atoms A and B are highlighted in yellow as they are mentioned in the text.

We implemented our constrained structural prediction in the framework of the MHM, although it can be easily adapted to any other structural prediction algorithm. In the MHM, the energy landscape is explored using a sequence of local geometry optimization steps, followed by molecular dynamics steps in order to allow the system to escape from local minima. In the molecular dynamics steps, the direction of the initial velocities are chosen through a softening procedure. This returns the direction of a low potential barrier which, according to the Bell–Evan–Polanyi principle, is likely to lead to a lower minimum. This new minimum can, after optimization, be accepted or not, depending on whether the energy difference to the previous minimum is below or above a certain threshold. The latter is dynamically adapted to obtain an acceptance rate of ~50%.

We explain now how the constraints are implemented, using again Fig. 8. The relative positions of each purple and yellow atoms belonging to the bulk-like layers are fixed, so that the bulk regions behave like rigid bodies. This is achieved by imposing the following conditions on the forces:where n and m run over pairs of atoms in each bulk region. Then we choose in the top and bottom bulk layers, respectively, one atom A and one atom B. In the top layer, we imposed Eq. (1) to all pairs of atoms containing atom A, while in the bottom layer we impose the same constraint to all pairs containing atom B. We obtain therefore N −1 equations per layer, where N is the number of atoms composing each bulk layer. This kind of constraint is clearly more physical than fixing each single atomic position to the perfect crystalline bulk, as the bulk layer can move as a whole, allowing for the minimization of the strain on the atoms at the interface during their reconstruction. In the interface region, where Si atoms are colored in blue, all atomic coordinates are fully optimized.

### Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase has a noncanonical function in actin bundling [^936fe0ff]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Protrusion dynamics in SH-SY5Y cells

SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell lines were seeded in 35 mm diameter Ibidi µDishes (Ibidi) to a density of 4.5 × 10 5 cells per mL (9 × 10 5 cells per dish). At full confluency and 2-to-4 h prior to imaging, a strip of cells was scraped away with a pipet tip to obtain a front of migrating cells. Phase contrast imaging was done on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam MR3 camera and a LCI Plan-Neofluar 63×/1.30 Imm Korr Ph 3 objective. Images were captured every second for 10 min, resulting in 601 time frames (16-bit, 1388 × 1040 pixels, 102 nm pixel dimension). Parameters describing the dynamics of cellular protrusions were measured using the Fiji distribution of ImageJ, similar to the analysis performed in. To this end, straight line segments (15 µm long) were drawn perpendicular to the movement direction at the front of active lamellipodial protrusions. From these lines, kymograph images were generated ("Multi Kymograph" command, linewidth = 3) and saved. On the kymograph images, line segments were drawn covering entire individual protrusions that move forward at a constant speed (representing lamellipodia, straight lines on kymographs). The displacement in the horizontal (X) direction is the protrusion distance (µm) while the displacement in the vertical (Y) direction is the protrusion persistence (in seconds). The protrusion rate (µm/s) can be calculated by taking the ratio of both and is also represented by the angle of the line segment. Per genotype, we acquired at least ten image sequences, resulting in 21–49 kymographs and at least 185 measured individual protrusions. ANOVA and Tukey HSD statistical testing was performed to compare the genotypes.

### Recommendations for the assessment of carotid arterial plaque by ultrasound for the characterization of atherosclerosis and evaluation of cardiovascular risk: from the American Society of Echocardiography [^be24b962]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Full-vessel three-dimensional carotid ultrasound acquisition — in this approach multiple three-dimensional datasets are acquired along all visualized portions of the common and internal carotid arteries, allowing visualization of the volume of all plaque lesions and summation of total plaque burden. Disadvantages noted are that although additional acquisition time is not significantly increased during scanning, greater expertise, time, and resources are required for off-line analysis and registration; there is a theoretical risk of quantifying a single plaque lesion twice if it is visualized in contiguous acquisitions due to overlap, and currently there are no techniques to register multiple contiguous three-dimensional acquisitions to avoid overlap; protocol standardization is difficult due to anatomic variability in segment lengths, while indexing plaque burden to length visualized and automated software may help standardize quantification and eliminate registration problems.

### Two-phase analysis in consensus genetic mapping [^8146ca57]. G3 (2012). Low credibility.

Here we provide more details on the above-noted case with considerable difference between the map length before and after consensus analysis (89.2 cM vs. 132.9 cM) for chromosome 9 in set 21. As in the BC data, one marker caused the effect. Here it was marker I00098. In this case, the effect was due to a very sparse map, which is actually represented by only four loci separated by 34, 28, and 36 cM. With such distances, unequivocal ordering is problematic. We can see from the illustration that unique order of marker I00098 in set 21 differs from the consensus order: the attempt for consensus resulted in moving this marker to the opposite end of the map, increasing the distance between I00098 and its closest neighbor from 36 cM to nearly 80 cM. It is noteworthy that, in all other sets, the size of the same interval varied from 7 cM in set 11 to 20 cM in set 22. This may mean either very high noise in scoring I00098 in set 21 or hotspot of recombination in this interval in the heterozygote from which set 21 was established.

For illustration, we show here the integral map of chromosome 1. Obviously, this integral map differs significantly from the one shown for BC populations. This is due to the simple fact that BC data included a considerable proportion of non-shared markers, whereas in the RIL data, the proportion of such markers is close to zero. As a result, the integral map for the RIL problem is mainly represented as one-dimensional chain interrupted by some simple loops caused by unique patterns of chromosomal distribution of partially shared markers.

Carotid CIMT acquisition and analysis — measurement technique and metrics: Measurement of CIMT involves tracking the blood-intima and media-adventitia interfaces of the far wall using a leading edge-to-leading edge technique. In general, segments should be measured in triplicate and CIMT values averaged. The task force recommends use of a semiautomated border detection program with validated accuracy, and simple point-to-point measurements of CIMT are not acceptable. Mean CIMT values from the far walls of the right and left CCAs (mean-mean) should be reported, with use of additional segments or maximum values as an alternative if there is local expertise and these measurements can be mapped to normative values. Most reading software will report mean-mean and mean-maximum CIMT values; mean-mean values are more reproducible but less sensitive to change, whereas mean-maximum values are more sensitive to change but less reproducible because they are derived from a single point (or regional maximum) measurement along the 1-cm region.

### ACR-ACOG-AIUM-SPR-SRU practice parameter for the performance of ultrasound of the female pelvis [^1db4f0ec]. SPR/AIUM/SRU/ACR/ACOG (2024). High credibility.

Ultrasound of the female pelvis — uterine measurements indicates that overall uterine length is evaluated in sagittal view from the fundus to the cervix (to the external os, if it can be identified); the length can be measured as a straight line from the fundus to the external os using outer-to-outer technique or by a trace method using outer-to-outer technique; the depth of the uterus is measured in the same sagittal view perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the endometrium, and the maximum width is measured in the transverse or coronal view; if volume measurements of the uterine corpus are performed, the cervical component should be excluded from the uterine length measurement, and a volume measurement of the corpus in the nongravid state is an estimate because there is no sonographic anatomic landmark for where the cervix ends and the uterine corpus begins.

### Sliding multislice (SMS): a new technique for minimum FOV usage in axial continuously moving-table acquisitions [^0da4a47b]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

A novel technique for axial continuously moving-table scans is described that minimizes the required extension of the scanner's field of view (FOV) along the direction of table motion (z) by applying a segmented multislice acquisition technique. Any anatomical slice is acquired by applying the same phase-encoding steps at the same spatial positions along the scanner FOV. The full k-space data set of any anatomical slice is collected while the slice moves through the scanner from one scan position to the next. Simultaneous acquisition of multiple slices is realized by shifting the acquisition trajectories of different slices in time. It is demonstrated how the image artifact behavior that relates to varying imaging properties along the distance the table traverses during the acquisition of any given anatomical slice can be optimized simultaneously for all images. Discontinuities between the images along the slice axis are avoided because all z-dependent scan properties are encoded identically for all slices. Flexible spatial acquisition patterns are proposed to enable data oversampling and overlapping slice acquisitions at reduced table speeds. A framework of equations is presented by which matched parameter combinations for sliding multislice acquisitions can be applied to both single- and multiecho sequences. The new technique is validated on phantom and in vivo measurements using a T1-weighted fast low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence as well as a T2-weighted multi-spin-echo sequence of variable echo train lengths.

### Kinetic drop friction [^4cdabd50]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Here, is the radius describing the position of the contact line, is the azimuthal angle, is the contact angle. After integration, one obtains:in which, is a geometric factor, whose precise value depends on the shape of the drop. Equation (4) is often referred as the Furmidge-Kawasaki equation. Here we call it capillary force.

Therefore, the static friction force per unit widthon a sessile drop is calculated by. We obtainwith Eq. (2) by extrapolating measured kinetic friction forces to. Using the static advancing and receding contact anglesmeasured by the in-/deflated drop ("Method" section and Table 1), we calculate the static-factor:

We find thatlies in the range of 0.5 to 1.5 for all the liquid/surface combinations within the error of the measurements (Fig. 4c). The average-factor of all the liquid/surface systems isfor the onset of sliding. This is consistent with ElSherbini and Jacobi's calculation and Extrand's experimental results (when using drop radius instead of drop width). For a hypothetical two-dimensional drop (Fig. 4b), the two parallel sides which are parallel to the external force do not contribute to the retentive force, resulting in. In reality, depends on the shape of the contact line and on how the actual contact angle varies along the contact line. Consequently, for sessile drops, a-factor < 1 is expected. As an alternative, Tadmor proposed to use the length prefactorrather than the width of the drop in Eq. (4) to calculate the friction force of a sliding drop. Here, is the contact area of the drop, andis its height. Since the contact area cannot be measured by our present setup directly, it would be interesting to check the possibility in the future. We tried to estimate the correlation betweenand the. It does however, not lead to a significant correlation (Supplementary Fig. 26).

### Using rigid motion constraints for the registration of free-form surfaces [^eaadaff5]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2001). Low credibility.

We present a new method for registration of freeform surfaces based on the iterative closest point (ICP) method and on geometric properties of reflected correspondence vectors. The method is based on computing relative gaps between reflected correspondences and between the projections of reflected correspondences along the rotation axis and using these to eliminate false matches. Experimental results on synthetic data and on real range images demonstrate that the method is robust and accurate for image registration with small motions.

Left ventricular (LV) linear measurements and related timing — make linear LV measurements in the parasternal long‑axis (PLAX) view with the chamber optimally centered and as perpendicular as possible to the long axis, take LV dimension measurements just beyond the mitral valve (MV) leaflet tips while avoiding mitral chordal and papillary muscle apparatus and right‑sided structures, move measurements slightly apical if a basal septal bulge is present, measure the left atrial anterior‑posterior diameter using M‑mode or two‑dimensional (2D) imaging with 2D preferred, and use systolic timing for left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) and aortic annulus diameters and diastolic timing for aortic measurements; define the outflow tract diameter by the septum and anterior mitral leaflet at the location yielding laminar flow just proximal to the AV.

Image analysis and postprocessing — dedicated viewing software should be used for image analysis enabling both static and dynamic image reconstructions, scrolling through the images, and changing window width and level settings at the readers' discretion. The isotropic nature of modern CT images allows high quality reformats in any plane. To obtain reformats in parallel and perpendicular to the prosthesis, rotate the axes to be in line with the valve ring and parallel to the valve leaflets, then set the center in the midpoint of the valve orifice in the short-axis and obtain long-axis reformations by rotating the axes while maintaining the annulus plane, which provides an optimal on-edge view of the opening and closing of the leaflets. Attempts have been made to automate this process but these solutions are still in initial development stages. Assess the opening and closing angles, defined as angles between the leaflets and the orifice ring, in cine mode and measure them in the fully open and fully closed positions to evaluate leaflet motion.

Table 3 — two-dimensional linear measurements in the parasternal window PLAX view list core 2D grayscale metrics and illustrate alignment effects on values. In PLAX view, the listed measurements include IVS end-diastole thickness, LVIDd, LVPWd, and RV diameter end-diastole. Biplane imaging can assist with proper perpendicular alignment for the most accurate 2D measurements, with an example where LVIDd is 47.0 mm. When off-axis, biplane imaging shows the consequence of off-axis measurements: the LVIDd is decreased by 3.0 mm from 47.0 mm to 44.0 mm. With a sigmoid septum, when the measurement is moved slightly toward the LV apex just beyond the septal bulge, LVIDd is 53 mm and IVS is 7.0 mm; when the measurement is made at the MV leaflet tips, including the septal bulge, LVIDd is 38.0 mm and IVS is 17.0 mm.
