## Question

cyclical neutropenia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about cyclic neutropenia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining cyclic neutropenia and its core clinical features. Then, I should verify the genetic basis and pathophysiology. Next, I will review diagnostic criteria and the differential, including how to distinguish it from severe congenital neutropenia and PFAPA. After that, I need to examine management, especially G-CSF dosing and infection risk mitigation. Finally, I should consider prognosis, long-term risks, special populations, and summarize a practical clinical algorithm with monitoring needs [^111bMvJC] [^116sMGes] [^113oawni].

> Let me first confirm the definition and epidemiology. Cyclic neutropenia is a rare hematologic disorder characterized by regular, approximately 21-day oscillations of the absolute neutrophil count with nadirs often below 0.5 × 10^9/L, typically lasting 3–8 days, and a prevalence estimated around 1 per million in the general population, though I should note that estimate comes from a case report and may not reflect true epidemiology, so I will treat it as a rough anchor rather than a precise figure [^1155KLgB] [^111bMvJC].

> I will now examine the clinical phenotype during neutropenic nadirs. Patients classically present with fever, malaise, oral aphthae, pharyngitis, cervical lymphadenitis, and skin infections such as cellulitis; severe complications like necrotizing soft tissue infection or sepsis are rare but documented, and I need to remember that fungal infections are uncommon but possible, as illustrated by invasive candidal laryngitis in an infant, so I should not overstate fungal risk while remaining vigilant in severe presentations [^1151Swdy] [^116BRuMK] [^117Xk3J3].

> Next, I should review the genetic basis. Wait, let me verify the proportion attributable to ELANE mutations. Most autosomal dominant cyclic neutropenia is due to heterozygous ELANE variants, with reported detection rates ranging from about 55% to near 100% depending on the cohort and ascertainment; importantly, identical ELANE mutations can manifest as either cyclic or severe congenital neutropenia, indicating phenotype modifiers beyond the single allele, so genotyping alone cannot distinguish CyN from SCN without serial counts [^116sMGes] [^114oZbXt] [^11463h8E].

> Hold on, I should verify the pathophysiology. ELANE encodes neutrophil elastase, and mutant protein appears to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response, leading to premature apoptosis of myeloid precursors; mechanistically, this explains the cyclical depletion of mature neutrophils and the marrow hypoplasia seen at nadir, though the exact determinants of cycling versus static neutropenia remain incompletely defined [^113FhVXm] [^111yWaon].

> Let me consider the diagnostic approach. I need to ensure serial ANC measurements are obtained at least three times weekly for 6 weeks to document cycling, because a single CBC can miss the pattern; bone marrow during nadir often shows myeloid hypoplasia with relative maturation arrest, and genetic testing for ELANE should be pursued when clinical suspicion is high, recognizing that a negative ELANE panel does not exclude CyN and that serial counts remain the gold standard for distinguishing CyN from SCN [^111wL7oT] [^116sMGes] [^11463h8E].

> But wait, what if the periodic symptoms reflect PFAPA rather than neutropenia. I should double-check the differential. PFAPA is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion characterized by regular febrile episodes with aphthae, pharyngitis, and adenitis, onset before age 6, complete wellness between episodes, and normal growth; importantly, PFAPA criteria require exclusion of cyclic neutropenia, so obtaining a CBC at fever onset is critical to avoid misclassification, and I should remember that updated classification criteria exist but are intended for research rather than strict diagnostic use [^115g7bba] [^114KyZp5] [^116rZKqM].

> Next, I should review management. G-CSF is first-line therapy and improves ANC, shortens the duration of severe neutropenia, and reduces infection frequency; typical adult dosing starts around 6 mcg/kg subcutaneously daily, with pediatric regimens individualized and often titrated to maintain ANC above 1.0–1.5 × 10^9/L, and I need to remember that cycling persists even on G-CSF, though the neutropenic window narrows and the cycle may shorten to about 14 days, which helps explain clinical improvement despite ongoing oscillations [^114G8vYK] [^112oWFuw] [^11463h8E].

> I should confirm infection risk mitigation strategies. During febrile neutropenia, prompt empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics are indicated per febrile neutropenia pathways, with risk stratification guiding site of care; for recurrent severe infections, some clinicians use scheduled G-CSF around the expected nadir, and although antibiotic prophylaxis is not routinely recommended for all CyN patients, it may be considered selectively in those with frequent or severe bacterial infections, balancing risks of resistance and adverse effects [^111xxn6L] [^114qE4ge].

> Let me think about prognosis and long-term risks. Historically, CyN carried a favorable prognosis with near-normal life expectancy when managed appropriately, but I should verify malignancy risk. Large registries show that progression to MDS/AML is rare in CyN compared with SCN, with an estimated risk around or below 1% over long-term follow-up, though rare leukemic transformations have been reported, often in the setting of additional acquired mutations or prolonged immunosuppression, so vigilance remains prudent [^115R4PeC] [^11463h8E].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and complications. Severe dental and periodontal disease is common due to repeated infections and impaired neutrophil surveillance, warranting early dental referral, antimicrobial rinses, and professional care; pregnancy can be complicated by infections during nadirs, and although G-CSF is generally considered safe in pregnancy, decisions should be individualized with maternal-fetal consultation; rare associations such as IgA nephropathy have been reported, but causality is uncertain and management follows standard nephrology principles with attention to infection-triggered flares [^112weRVx] [^1135GheL] [^1133MwTG].

> Hold on, I should verify the monitoring cadence. Annual clinical review with CBC and differential is reasonable for stable CyN, with closer surveillance if G-CSF dose changes or infections increase; bone marrow examination is not routinely required in stable CyN but should be considered if cytopenias evolve, new cytogenetic abnormalities are suspected, or if there is concern for transformation, aligning with broader congenital neutropenia surveillance practices [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider the practical diagnostic algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Suspect CyN in patients with recurrent fevers and mucosal infections every 2–4 weeks, obtain serial ANCs three times weekly for 6 weeks to document cycling, perform ELANE sequencing when suspicion remains high, and concurrently exclude mimics such as autoimmune neutropenia, drug-induced neutropenia, and PFAPA; if serial counts show cycling with nadirs below 0.5 × 10^9/L and other causes are excluded, confirm CyN and initiate G-CSF with infection-prevention counseling and dental co-management [^111wL7oT] [^116sMGes] [^1124dLtp].

> Finally, I should confirm key takeaways. Cyclic neutropenia is defined by regular 21-day ANC oscillations with infection-prone nadirs, most often due to heterozygous ELANE mutations, diagnosed by serial counts rather than genotype alone, effectively treated with G-CSF that shortens and elevates the nadir without abolishing cycling, and associated with a low but nonzero risk of severe infection and a very low risk of leukemic transformation, all of which underscore the importance of early recognition, targeted therapy, and coordinated dental and infectious disease care [^111bMvJC] [^112oWFuw] [^115R4PeC].

---

Cyclic neutropenia is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by **regular 21-day oscillations** of the neutrophil count, with nadirs often < 0.5 × 10⁹/L and recurrent infections during neutropenic periods [^116sMGes] [^111bMvJC]. Diagnosis requires **serial CBCs** over 4–6 weeks to document cycling, with **ELANE sequencing** confirming the genetic cause in most cases [^111wL7oT] [^116sMGes]. Management centers on **G-CSF** to reduce infection risk and shorten neutropenic intervals, with supportive care and infection prophylaxis during nadirs [^112oWFuw] [^116idjW4]. Prognosis is generally favorable with treatment, but rare progression to MDS/AML can occur, warranting long-term hematologic surveillance [^115R4PeC] [^11463h8E].

---

## Genetic basis and pathophysiology

- **ELANE mutations**: Most cases result from heterozygous ELANE mutations, causing misfolded neutrophil elastase and ER stress, leading to apoptosis of myeloid precursors and cyclic neutropenia [^116sMGes] [^113FhVXm].

- **Cycling mechanism**: The 21-day periodicity reflects oscillatory hematopoiesis driven by ELANE-related ER stress and altered G-CSF signaling [^11463h8E].

- **Other genes**: Rare cases involve HAX1, CXCR4, or SBDS mutations, often with overlapping SCN features [^114oZbXt].

---

## Clinical manifestations

- **Infections**: Recurrent fever, oral ulcers, pharyngitis, sinusitis, cellulitis, and rare severe infections (e.g. necrotizing fasciitis, sepsis) during neutropenic nadirs [^1151Swdy] [^116BRuMK].

- **Non-infectious symptoms**: Fatigue, malaise, arthralgia, and abdominal pain coinciding with neutropenic periods [^114jZrbF].

- **Severity spectrum**: Mild to severe disease; some patients are asymptomatic between nadirs [^111bMvJC].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and methods

- **Serial CBCs**: Document 21-day ANC oscillations over 4–6 weeks; nadirs typically < 0.5 × 10⁹/L [^111wL7oT].

- **ELANE sequencing**: Confirm diagnosis and exclude other causes; mutations are found in ~80–100% of cases [^116o3JmM] [^112roHDS].

- **Bone marrow**: Myeloid maturation arrest at the myelocyte stage during neutropenic phases [^112weRVx].

- **Differential diagnosis**: Exclude SCN, autoimmune neutropenia, drug-induced neutropenia, and infections [^112gi4vA].

---

## Management strategies

- **G-CSF**: First-line therapy; elevates ANC, shortens nadirs, and reduces infections; typical adult dose is 6 mcg/kg SC daily, titrated to maintain ANC > 1.0 × 10⁹/L [^114G8vYK] [^112oWFuw].

- **Supportive care**: Oral hygiene, dental care, and prompt treatment of infections; consider antibiotic prophylaxis during nadirs in severe cases [^112weRVx].

- **Monitoring**: Regular CBCs to adjust G-CSF dosing and detect complications [^116SN5tK].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is **generally favorable** with G-CSF, with reduced infections and improved quality of life [^112oWFuw]. Complications include **rare progression to MDS/AML** (≤ 1%), severe infections during nadirs, and chronic periodontal disease [^111wL7oT] [^112weRVx]. Long-term outcomes are **excellent with adherence**, though lifelong therapy and monitoring are often required [^112ch2Wg].

---

## Recent advances and ongoing research

Recent advances include **home ANC monitoring** to improve diagnosis and management [^111wL7oT], and ongoing research into **genotype-phenotype correlations**, modifier genes, and potential targeted therapies beyond G-CSF [^114oZbXt] [^115xUm7G].

---

Cyclic neutropenia is a rare, inherited disorder with **regular 21-day ANC oscillations** causing recurrent infections; diagnosis relies on serial CBCs and ELANE sequencing, and management with G-CSF yields excellent outcomes, though lifelong monitoring is essential [^116sMGes] [^111wL7oT] [^112oWFuw].

### Cyclic neutropenia: an unusual disorder of granulopoiesis effectively treated with recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [^116idjW4]. Pediatric Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Cyclic neutropenia (CN) is a rare hematologic disorder characterized by regular cycling of the absolute neutrophil count and a symptom complex presenting during the neutropenic nadirs. Despite the profound cyclic neutropenia, most patients have a benign course of recurrent fever, malaise, oral ulceration, and minor skin and upper respiratory tract infections. Recurrent infections, inflammation, and ulcers can lead to significant chronic morbidity. Severe dental disease is common, pregnancy complications are increased, and overwhelming infections, bowel necrosis, and mortality, although rare, are potential sequelae. We report a 10-year-old boy with a classical presentation of CN that had remained undiagnosed for 10 years. The difficulty in diagnosing this unusual disorder is highlighted. Treatment with daily recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rG-CSF) resulted in a complete clearing of symptoms and a significant increase in quality of life. The excellent clinical response of CN to rG-CSF, in the absence of major adverse effects, is strongly demonstrated by this case and supports rG-CSF as a first-line therapy for CN. The physiologic and adverse effects of rG-CSF use in CN and other neutropenic disorders, including potential leukemic induction, are reviewed. The need for long-term follow-up to investigate the effects of chronic hematopoietic stimulation by rG-CSF is emphasized.

Clinical and laboratory parameters usually allow an easy diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in most cases. Difficult arises, however, when presentation is atypical. A young child with membranous tonsillo-pharyngitis secondary to an isolated neutropenia is reported. The neutrophilic count later showed fluctuations reminiscent of cylic neutropenia. Bone marrow examination revealed the true nature of underlying disorder.

### Full-arch rehabilitation of a patient with cyclic neutropenia [^114Lo66e]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this report is to discuss the treatment of a patient with cyclic neutropenia. This patient presented with flared teeth, thin alveolar bone, and mobile teeth. A staged approach was used to remove her teeth, augment the bone, use immediate fixed provisional to determine the type of final prostheses, and ultimately to use cone-shaped overdenture attachments to retain her final prostheses. The result was rehabilitation of the patient with esthetic full-arch fixed-removable dentures with no adverse sequelae in this patient with this systemic disease.

### A novel homozygous mutation in G6PC3 presenting as cyclic neutropenia and severe congenital neutropenia in the same family [^1131W1xg]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Patients with autosomal recessive cyclic neutropenia have no known causative genetic defect yet.

Methods

Autozygosity mapping on two branches of an extended multiplex consanguineous family presenting with cyclic neutropenia or severe congenital neutropenia to look for candidate gene, followed by candidate gene selection and sequencing.

Results

A single autozygous interval on Chr17:33,901,938–45,675,414 that is exclusively shared by the affected members was identified. This interval spans 11.8 Mb and contains 30 genes. Review of these genes highlighted G6PC3 as the most likely candidate given its known role in neutrophil biology. Direct sequencing revealed a novel homozygous mutation (NM_138387.3, c.974T > G, p. Leu325Arg). Two of our patients had associated congenital defects that are known to occur in patients with G6PC3 mutations, including congenital heart disease and intermittent thrombocytopenia.

Conclusion

Biallelic G6PC3 defects should be considered in patients with autosomal recessive cyclic neutropenia, especially those with typical associated congenital defects.

### Cyclic neutropenia and concomitant IgA nephropathy: a case report [^1133MwTG]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is universally recognized as one of the most common primary glomerular diseases in all ages. Cyclic neutropenia (CN) is a rare haematologic disorder that is associated with mutations of the ELANE gene. The co-occurrence of IgAN and CN is extremely rare. This is the first case report of a patient with IgAN and genetically confirmed CN.

Case Presentation

We report a case of a 10-year-old boy who presented with recurrent viral upper respiratory tract infections accompanied by several episodes of febrile neutropenia, haematuria, proteinuria and acute kidney injury. Upon first admission, his physical examination was unremarkable. His kidney function was impaired, whereas his urine microscopy showed evidence of macroscopic haematuria and proteinuria. Further workup showed elevated IgA. The renal histology was consistent with mesangial and endocapillary hypercellularity with mild crescentic lesions, while immunofluorescence microscopy showed IgA-positive staining, which was characteristic of IgAN. Moreover, genetic testing confirmed the clinical diagnosis of CN, therefore Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was initiated to stabilize the neutrophil count. Regarding proteinuria control, the patient was initially treated with an Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor for approximately 28 months. However, due to progressive proteinuria (> 1 g/24 h), Corticosteroids (CS) were added for a period of 6 months according to the revised 2021 KDIGO guidelines with favorable outcome.

Conclusions

Patients with CN are more susceptible to recurrent viral infections, which can trigger IgAN attacks. In our case CS induced remarkable proteinuria remission. The use of G-CSF contributed to the resolution of severe neutropenic episodes, viral infections and concomitant AKI episodes, contributing to better prognosis of IgAN. Further studies are mandatory to determine whether there is a genetical predisposition for IgAN in children with CN.

### Cyclic neutropenia and concomitant IgA nephropathy: a case report [^1155KLgB]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is universally recognized as one of the most common primary glomerular diseases in all ages. In European studies, it represents approximately 20% of glomerular diseases in childhood. It is characterized by IgA-1-containing immune deposits in the mesangial area of glomeruli. Genetic factors have also been identified to be involved in IgAN pathogenesis, especially at the level of IgA1 galactosylation. However, the majority of paediatric patients with IgAN have a mild clinical course with less advanced histologic lesions. IgAN often presents with macroscopic haematuria developing soon after or coinciding with an upper respiratory tract infection. Nevertheless, a small percentage of patients may present with nephritic syndrome or heavy proteinuria and sometimes with acute kidney injury (AKI), including crescentic disease. Coppo et al. highlighted that 30–60% of paediatric subjects with IgAN will never face any decline in their glomerular filtration rate and have normal life expectancy, while approximately 10% will progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within 10 years after diagnosis. Remissions, either spontaneous or treatment-induced, are common according to Schima et al; therefore, the paediatric nephrologist often faces the dilemma, due to the unpredictable disease outcome, whether to treat paediatric patients with IgAN.

Cyclic neutropenia (CN) is a rare haematologic disorder with a prevalence of one in a million individuals in the general population, which is characterized by regular fluctuations in blood neutrophil count, leading to periodic neutropenia with a ~ 21-day periodic frequency. Recent genetic studies have shown that autosomal-dominant cyclic neutropenia is associated with mutations at locus 19p13.3 in the gene for neutrophil elastase (ELANE). The most common associated symptoms include fever, malaise, mucosal ulcerations, pharyngitis, cervical lymphadenopathy, and intermittent abdominal discomfort.

Secondary IgAN is uncommon. It has been reported in patients with various comorbidities, including gastrointestinal disorders, autoimmune conditions, various infections and neoplasms. However, most of the molecular mechanisms responsible for glomerular deposition of IgG-IgA1 autoantibodies in patients with secondary IgAN have not yet been clearly elucidated. Moreover, according to Saha et al. some associations are coincidental in newly discovered IgAN.

### Cyclic neutropenia with a novel gene mutation presenting with a necrotizing soft tissue infection and severe sepsis: case report [^116BRuMK]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Cyclic neutropenia (CN) is an uncommon hematologic disorder characterized by periodic neutropenia (< 0.2 × 10 9 neutrophils/day for 3–5days) with an average 21-day turnover frequency. Untreated children typically display fever, mouth ulcers and recurrent oropharyngeal infections. Cellulitis is common during neutropenic periods, but bacteremia and severe sepsis are rare. Necrotizing fasciitis is also a rare event in the pediatric population. When it occurs, however, if not promptly diagnosed it can lead to severe wound problems that are difficult to manage. It can even lead to patient's mortality. We report a 31-month-old girl with CN who developed acute necrotizing fasciitis in her left axillary region. Her diagnosis was confirmed by a mutational analysis of the ELANE gene, the causative gene of CN, which revealed a novel mutation. The infection progressed rapidly and resulted in septic shock. Treatment with negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) rescued the patient through effective control of the source of infection.

### ELANE mutations in cyclic and severe congenital neutropenia: genetics and pathophysiology [^116sMGes]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The 2 main forms of hereditary neutropenia are cyclic (CN) and severe congenital (SCN) neutropenia. CN is an autosomal dominant disorder in which neutrophil counts fluctuate with 21-day periodicity. SCN consists of static neutropenia, with promyelocytic maturation arrest in the bone marrow. Unlike CN, SCN displays frequent acquisition of somatic mutations in the gene CSF3R. CN is caused by heterozygous mutations in the gene ELANE, encoding neutrophil elastase. SCN is genetically heterogeneous but is most frequently associated with ELANE mutations. We discuss how the mutations provide clues into the pathogenesis of neutropenia and describe current hypotheses for its molecular mechanisms.

### Cyclic neutropenia with a novel gene mutation presenting with a necrotizing soft tissue infection and severe sepsis: case report [^111yGc8N]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Cyclic neutropenia is a rare disease. We report a 31-month-old girl with congenital cyclic neutropenia with a novel mutation in the ELANE gene who developed an acute necrotizing soft-tissue infection on her left axillary legion.

Case Presentation

A 31-month-old girl was admitted to our pediatric emergency room because of a necrotizing soft tissue infection of the left axillary area. The infection progressed rapidly and resulted in septic shock. Despite a medical treatment and surgical debridement, the sepsis was not controlled, and severe inflammation developed. After applying of negative-pressure wound therapy, her clinical symptoms improved. Finally, she was diagnosed with cyclic neutropenia with a novel genetic mutation. One month after admission, she was discharged with a completely recovered wound and no need for skin grafting.

Conclusion

Both adequate medical treatment and effective control of the source of infection are critically important to reduce morbidity in such complex cases of necrotizing fasciitis as appeared in an immunocompromised pediatric patient.

The patient was discharged; nevertheless, within the following months, he represented with periodic episodes of febrile neutropenia and monocytosis accompanied by viral upper respiratory tract infections. Associated symptoms included macroscopic haematuria and proteinuria with or without AKI. Physical examination was usually unremarkable except for tonsillitis, oral ulcers and cervical lymphadenopathy. His blood pressure values ranged between the 25 th and 50 th centile for his age and height. Laboratory investigation during these episodes revealed neutropenia, anaemia, increased inflammation markers, either microscopic or macroscopic haematuria, proteinuria and kidney function impairment. The patient during these episodes was treated symptomatically with IV hydration and management of biochemical and acid–base abnormalities. Broad spectrum antibiotics were administered in the presence of increased inflammation markers during severe neutropenia episodes. Interestingly, within five to six days after the initial presentation of each AKI episode, his kidney function was returning back to baseline range, without the use of immunosuppressive therapy.

Due to the fluctuation of his neutrophil count number and monocytosis, which followed a 21-day periodicity, genetic testing was performed, and the suspected clinical diagnosis of CN was confirmed. A heterozygous mutation (c.597 + 5G > A) was detected in exon 4 of the ELANE gene, classified as pathogenic according to the ACMG/AMP guidelines, in December 2019. Genetic testing was not performed in the patient's parents and sister upon their refusal. Regarding the management of cyclic neutropenia, the patient was initially administered granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) 2 mcg/kg/24 h in a five-day course before the expected episodes of neutropenia. Thereafter, the neutrophil count was periodically monitored. However, the patient continued to present episodes of severe febrile neutropenia with concomitant AKI; therefore, monthly administration of G-CSF was switched to alternate day (2 mcg/kg/24 h) with favorable outcome.

### Cyclic neutropenia with a novel gene mutation presenting with a necrotizing soft tissue infection and severe sepsis: case report [^1139mY4V]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of septic shock caused by a necrotizing soft-tissue infection occurring in a patient with CN. CN is an uncommon disease characterized by cyclic episodes of severe neutropenia occurring typically at 21-day intervals and resulting in frequent opportunistic infections. During these periods of neutropenia, patients may suffer painful mouth ulcers, gingivitis, lymphadenopathy, fever, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, and bacterial infections. Skin infections such as cellulitis are also common. In contrast to severe CN, however, serious infection and sepsis are rare. Necrotizing soft-tissue infection is also a rare disease that can quickly progress to a life-threatening condition, with a greater risk in immunocompromised individuals. Prompt diagnosis and adequate treatment, including broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical debridement are necessary to prevent morbidity and mortality. In cases of necrotizing soft-tissue infection, adequate surgical debridement is necessary to keep the infection from spreading. Most patients, even children, require repeated debridement. Additional exploration, however, can lead to repetitive general anesthesia, which could be a great burden for pediatric patients.

### Spectrum ofmutations in congenital neutropenia: a single-centre study in patients of Indian origin [^116o3JmM]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

Congenital and cyclical neutropenia are rare inherited diseases that result in recurrent life-threatening bacterial infections due to a deficiency of mature neutrophils. Cyclical neutropenia is usually caused by heterozygous ELANE mutations while congenital neutropenia is genetically heterogeneous with mutations in genes like ELANE, HAX-1, G6PC3 and GFI1. The presence of ELANE mutation aids in the establishment of diagnosis and rules out other secondary causes of neutropenia such as autoimmune cytopenia and evolving aplasia. Further, patients with ELANE mutations are also at a high risk of developing myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukaemia. Hence it is important to screen for these mutations in patients presenting with neutropenia early in life.

Methods

The study included 52 patients who were evaluated for inherited neutropenia. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes and mutation analysis was done by bidirectional Sanger sequencing.

Results

Ten different missense, frameshift or splice site variants in ELANE gene were identified in 11 patients: c.125C > T (p. Pro42Leu), c.164G > A (p. Cys55Tyr), c.169G > A (p. Ala57Thr), c.179T > C (p. Ile60Thr), c.770C > T (p. Pro257Leu), c.367–8C > A, c.597+1G > A along with three novel mutations c.302T > A (p. Val101Glu), c.468G > T (p. Try156Cys) and c.596delT (Phe199Ser fs*13). Family studies were available for three patients and, in all three instances, the mutation had a de novo origin.

Conclusion

The widespread distribution of mutations suggests the need to screen all the exons in ELANE gene for proper characterisation of the genotype.

### Cyclic manner of neutropenia in a patient withmutation [^116Y3m8V]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction: Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) includes a group of genetic disorders which cause to arrest of neutrophil maturation. SCN can be associated with heterogenous group of genetic defects in ELANE, GFI1, HAX1, G6PC3, JAGN1, VPS45 or activating mutations in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) gene. Aim: Here we report a patient who has a HAX1 mutation presented with cyclic manner. Case Report: A 6 year old female patients was admitted with recurrent apthous stomatitis. We followed the patient as cyclic neutropenia according to complete blood count results 2 times for 6 weeks. After persistant neutropenia developed during a severe varicella infection, we analysed HAX1 mutation, the result was interesting and incompatible with reported cyclic neutropenia patients. Conclusion: We suggest that HAX1 deficiency should be thought in patients who have normal neutrophil counts in the between of infections.

### Invasive candidal laryngitis as a manifestation of cyclic neutropenia in an Omani infant [^117Xk3J3]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Cyclic neutropenia is a congenital episodic defect in the development of neutrophils in the bone marrow. It is usually diagnosed late in infancy as it generally takes several cycles of neutropenia before the condition is suspected. These patients often have recurrent mild infectious episodes, but may develop life-threatening bacterial infections; however, they are unlikely to develop fungal infections as the neutropenia is usually self-limiting and of short duration. The authors report the case of an 8-month-old Omani female infant with cyclic neutropenia presenting as severe fungal (Candida) invasive laryngitis, needing life-saving tracheostomy and i.v. antifungal treatment.

### Cyclic neutropenia in a cleft lip and palate patient: a case report [^114xYc1k]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Cleft lip and palate is the most common congenital anomaly. Its association with hematologic disorders is rarely reported. Cyclic neutropenia is a rare blood disorder that may occur spontaneously or has a genetic predisposition. Periodicity/recurrence of cyclic neutropenia has a cyclical pattern reoccurring in multiples of 7 days, usually at 21- or 28-day intervals between attacks, with the patient being fairly asymptomatic. There is no case in the literature that has reported the presence of cyclic neutropenia in cleft patients. We report a case of cleft patient associated with cyclic neutropenia. The clinical features, diagnosis, and course of management are described.

Conclusion

We report that a necrotizing soft-tissue infection with severe sepsis occurred in a patient with CN containing a novel mutation in the ELANE gene. In this immunocompromised pediatric patient, adequate medical treatments with antibiotics and G-CSF plus effective control of the source of infection were critically important to reduce morbidity. For suspected patients, genetic counseling and analysis should be performed for a better understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms of CN.

Unravelling the cause of a neutropenia poses a complex diagnostic challenge. The differential diagnosis ranges from life threatening disease to transient benign causes of little clinical significance. This review offers a practical guide to investigating the neutropenic child, and highlights features that merit specialist referral. Therapeutic options, the role of long term follow up, and the complications of severe chronic neutropenia are considered.

### Cyclic neutropenia with a novel gene mutation presenting with a necrotizing soft tissue infection and severe sepsis: case report [^1153ECSz]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

CN is a rare autosomal dominantly inherited neutropenic disorder caused by a mutation of the ELANE gene located on chromosome locus 19p13.3, which encodes neutrophil elastase. Mutations in ELANE are found in nearly 100% of individuals with typical features of CN and in 38–80% of individuals with congenital neutropenia. The mutations were found to be distributed throughout the length of the gene, rendering any clear pattern (if one exists) less obvious. ELANE mutations are thought to lead to a "gain-of-function" in the neutrophil granule protein leukocyte elastase (e.g. aberrant processing, packaging), causing cellular toxicity in neutrophil precursors. We performed further analysis to determine if this heterozygote sequence variation (p.G125W missense variant of ELANE gene) affects protein function. Because the sequence variations are not known as mutations, we performed two online virtual protein function prediction analyses to predict whether the amino acid substitution found might affect protein function. Using the PolyPhen analysis tool, the variation was predicted as "probably damaging" to protein function. Using the SIFT tool, the result was "Damaging" to protein function. Therefore, the p.G125W missense variant of ELANE gene may negatively affect neutrophil elastase function, which plays a pathophysiologic role in CN.

What should patients look out for?

The first challenge in the diagnosis of febrile neutropenia is to make sure that patients will recognise signs suggesting that they are seriously ill – and take the necessary action.

It is essential to inform all patients receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer about the risk of febrile neutropenia, and to explain what to look out for, before they start their treatment. Typical signs include a temperature higher than 37.5°C, flu-like symptoms, mouth ulcers or a sore mouth that prevents eating. Less commonly with many of the regimens used in the treatment of breast cancer, patients may also have uncontrolled diarrhoea/vomiting, and uncontrolled nose bleeds or bleeding from the gums. Patients should also be made aware that they might not feel hot – indeed, those most at risk sometimes feel cold, or may merely describe systemic malaise/pain.

It is important to indicate to patients and carers, depending on the specific chemotherapy regimen, the days in the treatment cycle when neutrophil counts are likely to be at their lowest and the risk of febrile neutropenia is considered to be greatest. For example, many regimens have nadirs between days 10 and 14, but docetaxel monotherapy tends to result in severe neutropenia several days earlier, on days 5–9. However, timing should not be overemphasised, as the side effect can present outside of the typical days. This is particularly important when a patient is switching from anthracycline to docetaxel (as would be the case on the FEC-T (5-fluorouracil+epirubicin+cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel) regimen often used in clinical practice), when it may be helpful to draw attention to the comparatively early neutrophil nadir associated with the latter drug and the potential, therefore, for cumulative risk.

Computed tomography shows diffuse swelling of the lateral chest wall and axilla 4 days after the initial surgery.

Considering her past history and clinical course, her underlying disease was suspected to be CN. Serial measurements of absolute neutrophil counts for hospitalizations, including laboratory data from the outpatients department, showed neutrophil count oscillations with a 21-day periodicity and neutropenia at the nadir of the cycle. We evaluated the patient to rule out other diseases that cause severe neutropenia. Laboratory tests for immunologic, hematologic and other genetic disorders were performed with no abnormal findings. Therefore, we recommended that her parents to take a family consultation for genetic analysis. The family history revealed that her mother had suffered from recurrent infections and was diagnosed with CN 4 years previously at another hospital. In addition, her grandmother died in her fourth decade as a result of a presumptive diagnosis of hematologic malignancy. The patient's ELANE gene was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction analysis and direct sequencing. A heterozygous sequence variation was noted in exon 4 of the ELANE gene at codon 125 (c.373G > T, p. Gly125Trp). After a genetic analysis, the same mutation was detected only in her mother (Figure 3). This variation was not found in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD).

Results

Enrollment

From 1994 to 2020, the Seattle SCNIR office received inquiries from 1799 physicians and 4544 patients or families about neutropenia and enrollment in the SCNIR; 1752 patients met the criteria and completed the registration in the following categories: congenital, 670 (38%); cyclic, 266 (15%); and autoimmune/idiopathic, 816 (47%). The overall mean follow-up was 9.3 years; 189 patients provided follow-up data for 15 to 20 years, 120 for 21 to 25 years, and 82 for > 25 years; the longest participants came with data rolled over from the randomized trial. There are more than 16 000 patient-years of observational data, including those who died (1089 patient-years), resolved neutropenia (2073 patient-years, largely children), received hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCTs) (1629 patient-years, 483 of 1629 years from deceased patients), lost to follow-up (2028 patient-years), or withdrew from participation (645 patient-years) (see Table 1). Overall outcomes of transplantation, evolution to malignancies, and or death were known for approximately 80% of the enrolled patients; the percentages of lost-to-follow-up patients were: congenital, 18%; cyclic, 17%; autoimmune/idiopathic, 17%.

Demographics

Patients

Symptoms of cyclic and congenital neutropenia were usually present soon after birth, but the diagnosis often followed a series of acute febrile episodes because the infections resemble those of other young children. In older children and adults, the diagnosis was often made with routine blood counts when there were no symptoms of an infection at the time of the test. Table 2 shows ages at onset of symptoms, diagnosis, and the start of G-CSF.

Cyclic neutropenia

Cyclic neutropenia can have onset in childhood or adulthood and is characterized by regular oscillations in circulating neutrophil number. The cycles typically occur at 21-day intervals, but the intervals can range from 15 to 35 days. Neutrophil counts fluctuate and decrease < 500/μl. The monocyte, eosinophil, platelet, and reticulocyte oscillations usually fluctuate, and the periodicity of these cycles is typically the same as that for the neutrophil. The bone marrow is generally hypoplastic during neutropenia periods, with myelocyte arrest. The severity of infections correlates with the severity of neutropenia. Early diagnosis and suspicion prevent death from infection.

Early dental referral is the key to successful dental management of children with neutropenia. Neutropenia predisposes the child to hemorrhagic gingivitis and periodontal disease, but the progression of bone loss is because of the immune responses to pathogenic subgingival plaque. Thus, scrupulous oral hygiene, antimicrobial rinses, frequent professional tooth cleaning, and targeted antibiotic therapy can delay or halt periodontal bone loss. Antibiotic treatment depends on the gingival sulcus fluid microbial culture results. Some articles reported on microorganisms found in PID patients' periodontal pockets.

The microbes detected in cases of severe congenital neutropenia included Prevotella nigrescens, Tanerella forsythia, Campylobacter rectus, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Aggregatibacter actinomycetocomitans, and C andida albicans. Prevotella intermedia, C. rectus, and C. gingivalis were found in patients with cyclic neutropenia. Eradication and control of these pathogens are essential in periodontal disease treatment. Periodic surveillance cultures will help to determine the need for repetition of antibiotic therapy.

The treatment of neutropenic children with periodontal disease is usually more successful in children with localized than with generalized periodontal disease; generalized periodontal disease may be refractory to antibiotic therapy without the underlying neutrophil defect correction. Treatment of the underlying disorder with G-CSF administration and normalization of neutrophil count may not be sufficient to maintain oral health because of possible associated functional neutrophil defects; this underscores the significance of professional dental care for such patients.

### Prevention of febrile neutropenia: use of prophylactic antibiotics [^113KmTha]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

NCCN guidelines

In 2008, the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network published guidelines on the prevention and treatment of cancer-related infections. It recommends prophylactic fluoroquinolones for high-risk and intermediate-risk groups, which largely comprise patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy and those with haematological malignancy in which the anticipated duration of neutropenia is longer than 7 days. For most solid tumours undergoing standard outpatient cyclical chemotherapy, in which the anticipated duration of neutropenia is less than 7 days, prophylactic fluoroquinolones are not recommended, because of the risk of microbial resistance. However, even in the latter circumstances, we believe that when grade 4 neutropenia is expected (e.g. etoposide-containing regimens for testicular and small-cell lung cancers, and regimens containing docetaxel, vinorelbine or doxorubicin), in which the risk of FN is very high, fluoroquinolones should be considered, particularly in the first cycle.

### Mutations in the neutrophil elastase gene in cyclic and congenital neutropenia [^111yWaon]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Severe neutropenia disorders are characterized by extremely low levels of peripheral blood neutrophils, a maturation block of bone marrow progenitor cells and recurring severe bacterial and fungal infections. Recent reports indicated that severe neutropenia is a consequence of an impaired survival and abnormal cell cycle progression of myeloid progenitor cells in both cyclic and severe congenital neutropenia. Mutations in the neutrophil elastase gene were identified in all patients with cyclic neutropenia and most of the patients with severe congenital neutropenia. We hypothesize that expression of mutant neutrophil elastase protein results in deregulation of intracellular activity and premature cell death of myeloid-committed progenitor cells in these disorders, resulting in the lack of peripheral blood neutrophils. The potential molecular mechanisms of mutant-protein-mediated neutropenia is discussed.

5.7 Thrombocytopenia/Neutropenia

Bortezomib is associated with thrombocytopenia and neutropenia that follow a cyclical pattern with nadirs occurring following the last dose of each cycle and typically recovering prior to initiation of the subsequent cycle. The cyclical pattern of platelet and neutrophil decreases and recovery remain consistent in the studies of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, with no evidence of cumulative thrombocytopenia or neutropenia in the treatment regimens studied.

Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently during treatment with bortezomib. Measure platelet counts prior to each dose of bortezomib. Adjust dose/schedule for thrombocytopenia [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Gastrointestinal and intracerebral hemorrhage has occurred during thrombocytopenia in association with bortezomib. Support with transfusions and supportive care, according to published guidelines.

In the single-agent, relapsed multiple myeloma study of bortezomib vs dexamethasone, the mean platelet count nadir measured was approximately 40% of baseline. The severity of thrombocytopenia related to pretreatment platelet count is shown in Table 8. The incidence of bleeding (≥ Grade 3) was 2% on the bortezomib arm and was < 1% in the dexamethasone arm.

In the combination study of bortezomib with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone (VcR-CAP) in previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma patients, the incidence of thrombocytopenia (≥ Grade 4) was 32% vs 1% for the rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) arm as shown in Table 12. The incidence of bleeding events (≥ Grade 3) was 1.7% in the VcR-CAP arm (four patients) and was 1.2% in the R-CHOP arm (three patients).

Platelet transfusions were given to 23% of the patients in the VcR-CAP arm and 3% of the patients in the R-CHOP arm.

The incidence of neutropenia (≥ Grade 4) was 70% in the VcR-CAP arm and was 52% in the R-CHOP arm. The incidence of febrile neutropenia (≥ Grade 4) was 5% in the VcR-CAP arm and was 6% in the R-CHOP arm. Myeloid growth factor support was provided at a rate of 78% in the VcR-CAP arm and 61% in the R-CHOP arm.

2 Case Report

An 8‐month‐old boy with a past medical history of atopic dermatitis presented to the emergency department with three weeks of cyclical fevers and worsening rash. At that time, the patient's mother reported that the patient had developed pink papules and pustules one month prior which were different from his typical atopic dermatitis. Initially, the patient's allergist prescribed triamcinolone 0.1% cream twice daily, hydrocortisone 1% cream twice daily for the face, and mupirocin 2% ointment for open or crusted areas. Despite these treatments, the rash continued to progress and failed to improve. The lesions became more numerous and spread diffusely over the body. The worsening rash and cyclical fevers, with a maximum temperature of 40°C at home, prompted an emergency department visit. There was no pertinent family medical history or scabies risk factors. At the time of the dermatology consultation, the patient's vitals were unremarkable. Physical examination revealed diffuse, erythematous, edematous, tender papules and plaques with crust and scale across the body, sparing the hands and feet (Figure 1). The inguinal folds showed erythematous, pink, and yellow patches. There was also a dense hard nodule on the vertex of the scalp. There was no involvement of ocular or oral mucosa.

### Discerning clinicopathological features of congenital neutropenia syndromes: an approach to diagnostically challenging differential diagnoses [^116Jmxmd]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

The congenital neutropenia syndromes are rare haematological conditions defined by impaired myeloid precursor differentiation or function. Patients are prone to severe infections with high mortality rates in early life. While some patients benefit from granulocyte colony-stimulating factor treatment, they may still face an increased risk of bone marrow failure, myelodysplastic syndrome and acute leukaemia. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for improved outcomes; however, diagnosis depends on familiarity with a heterogeneous group of rare disorders that remain incompletely characterised. The clinical and pathological overlap between reactive conditions, primary and congenital neutropenias, bone marrow failure, and myelodysplastic syndromes further clouds diagnostic clarity. We review the diagnostically useful clinicopathological and morphological features of reactive causes of neutropenia and the most common primary neutropenia disorders: constitutional/benign ethnic neutropenia, chronic idiopathic neutropenia, cyclic neutropenia, severe congenital neutropenia (due to mutations in ELANE, GFI1, HAX1, G6PC3, VPS45, JAGN1, CSF3R, SRP54, CLPB and WAS), GATA2 deficiency, Warts, hypogammaglobulinaemia, infections and myelokathexis syndrome, Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome, the lysosomal storage disorders with neutropenia: Chediak-Higashi, Hermansky-Pudlak, and Griscelli syndromes, Cohen, and Barth syndromes. We also detail characteristic cytogenetic and molecular factors at diagnosis and in progression to myelodysplastic syndrome/leukaemia.

### Impact of different genetic mutations on granulocyte development and G-CSF responsiveness in congenital neutropenia [^114oZbXt]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Congenital neutropenia (CN) comprises a range of disorders that are either isolated or part of a complex genetic disease, characterized by a persistent or intermittent, low peripheral neutrophil count (severe < 0.5 × 10 9 /L and mild 0.5–1.5 × 10 9 /L). The inherited forms of CN often presents with more severe clinical manifestations than those caused by chemotherapy, viral infections, or drug reactions. Life-threatening bacterial infections mostly occur in the first year of life for patients with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) who have not received granulocyte colony–stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment.

Granulocyte development proceeds in a stepwise fashion in the bone marrow (BM) and is regulated by various growth factors and cytokines. Granulocyte-monocyte progenitor cells, the direct precursors to granulocytes and monocytes, first differentiate into myeloblasts (immature granulocytes) and then into promyelocytes. The promyelocytes further differentiate into myelocytes that begin to exhibit distinct characteristics of specific granulocyte lineages, including neutrophils, eosinophils, or basophils. The myelocytes mature into metamyelocytes and subsequently into fully formed granulocytes, including band cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). These cells then leave the BM and migrate to the periphery. Patients with SCN exhibit a maturation arrest at the stages of promyelocytes and myelocytes during granulocyte development in the BM. However, it is incompletely understood why granulopoiesis is disrupted at specific stage in various types of CN caused by different genetic mutations.

For CN cases with known genetic defects, mutations in the ELANE gene are most prevalent, accounting for 55.6% cases. The ELANE (or ELA2) gene encodes the neutrophil elastase protein. A diagnosis of ELANE -related neutropenia is made when a heterozygous pathogenic variant is found in a proband with suggestive clinical findings. Clinical manifestations of ELANE -related neutropenia, which include SCN or cyclic neutropenia (CyN), consist of recurrent fever, skin and oropharyngeal inflammation, and cervical lymphadenitis.CN can also arise because of mutations in other genes, including HAX1, CXCR4, and Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond Syndrome (SBDS). These patients require regular G-CSF treatment to prevent frequent infections, but with a risk of ∼15% to 25% of developing myelodysplasia (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia. Furthermore, patients with CN exhibit heterogeneous responses to G-CSF therapy, but the underlying mechanisms are not well-understood.

### Congenital and acquired neutropenia [^114T5g3F]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2004). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the pathogenesis of congenital and acquired neutropenia is rapidly evolving. New ground-breaking observations have identified the genes responsible for many of the congenital neutropenia syndromes and are also providing new insights into normal neutrophil commitment and differentiation. Acquired neutropenia remains a poorly understood syndrome, although new insights into its pathogenesis are also emerging, especially with regard to subsets of immune neutropenia. In Section I, Dr. Marshall Horwitz reviews the current understanding of the genetic basis, molecular pathology, and approaches to treatment of congenital neutropenia and cyclic hematopoiesis. Mutations in the ELA2 gene, which encodes for neutrophil elastase, cause cyclic hematopoiesis. ELA2 mutations are also the most common cause of congenital neutropenia, where their presence may equate with a more severe clinical course and higher frequency of leukemic progression. Emerging evidence indicates interrelatedness with Hermansky Pudlak syndrome and other disorders of neutrophil and platelet granules. In Section II, Dr. Nancy Berliner presents an overview of the clinical approach to the evaluation and treatment of acquired neutropenia. This includes a review of the pathogenesis of primary and secondary immune neutropenia, drug-induced neutropenia, and non-immune chronic idiopathic neutropenia of adults. Studies used to evaluate patients for potential immune neutropenia are reviewed. Management issues, especially the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), are discussed. In Section III, Dr. Thomas Loughran, Jr., reviews the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia. Possible mechanisms of neutropenia are discussed. In particular, discussion focuses on the relationship between LGL leukemia, rheumatoid disease, and Felty's syndrome, and the complex interplay of defects in neutrophil production, distribution, destruction, and apoptosis that underly the development of neutropenia in those syndromes.

### Four novel ELANE mutations in patients with congenital neutropenia [^116qWHTc]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Congenital neutropenia is a heterogeneous bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by a maturation arrest of myelopoesis at the promyelocyte/myelocyte stage. Cyclic neutropenia (CyN) and severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) are two main forms of congenital neutropenia. Genetic analysis has shown that heterozygous mutations in the ELANE gene encoding the neutrophil elastase are the major cause of these disorders. We investigated the prevalence of ELANE mutations in a group of 16 patients from 14 families with congenital neutropenia. Five patients had typical manifestations of CyN, and 11 patients had SCN. Seven different heterozygous ELANE mutations were found, including four novel mutations.

Background

ELANE mutations can be associated with a variety of immunodeficiency diseases such as severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) and cyclic neutropenia (CN), which are two main clinical phenotypes related to neutropenia. Compared to SCN, CN seemed to be more common. SCN and CN could present with fever, mucosal ulceration, lymphadenitis and severe and/or recurrent infections. However, autoimmune symptoms associated with ELANE mutations are rare. In this study, we reported three cases of ELANE mutations with associated autoimmune diseases such as SLE, AIHA, and ANCA-associated small vasculitis respectively. All the cases presented with SCN or CN.

### Differential transcriptional control of hematopoiesis in congenital and cyclic neutropenia patients harboringmutations [^11463h8E]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cyclic neutropenia (CyN) and severe congenital neutropenia (CN) are autosomal-dominant inherited disorders of hematopoiesis that markedly differ in disease severity. Mutations in the ELANE gene are considered largely responsible for most cases of CyN and CN. Because several identical ELANE mutations have been identified in both groups of patients, genotyping alone is insufficient to establish a clinical diagnosis. CyN is characterized by regular oscillations of peripheral blood neutrophils from nearly normal to severely low counts, generally within 21-day cycles. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at nadir is often less than 200/mmand is associated with fever, mouth ulcers, pharyngitis, sinusitis, and in some cases more severe infections with gram-negative bacteria. By contrast, CN is characterized by recurrent, severe infections that develop in the first months of life, with ANC persistently less than 200/mm. The availability of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for clinical use in CN since 1987 and its successful application to CyN patients has changed the outcome for these patients, providing a markedly improved quality of life. However, during the course of the disease, 53% of CN patients who harbor ELANE mutations and 17% of CyN patients acquire mutations in the gene for the G-CSF receptor, CSF3R. Together with subsequently acquired mutations in, e.g. RUNX1, CSF3R mutations precede the development of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The risk of developing leukemia in CN is considered to be 20%. In CyN patients, G-CSF treatment does not abrogate the cycling of neutrophil counts but increases the amplitude of neutrophil counts during the cycle, leading to a shorter period of severe neutropenia and a reduction in the cycle length from 21 days to approximately 14 days. This suggests an influence of G-CSF on the neutrophil cycling pathomechanism. There are reported cases of AML also in CyN patients.

### De novo missense variant C.170 C > A of ELANE in a Chinese infant with congenital neutropenia: case report and literature review [^112Dnt3R]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is a confirmed case of CN in a Chinese infant with the c.170 C > A variant in the ELANE gene. The child has presented with various degrees of neutropenia since the neonatal period, accompanied by recurrent infections. A bone marrow examination revealed maturation disorders in neutrophils, and elevated percentages of monocytes and eosinophils, along with an increased peripheral monocyte and platelet count, all of which support the diagnosis of CN in this patient. Multiple online prediction analyses and ACMG criteria support the pathogenicity of this de novo missense variant. During the early neonatal stage, the patient consistently exhibited severe neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 × 10^9/L). Periodic fluctuations in neutrophil counts observed twice a week during particular months suggest a cyclical pattern. Therefore, the diagnosis of our patient is appropriate for the intermediate phenotype of CN. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of CN associated with the rare pathogenic variant, c.170 C > A variant in the ELANE gene in the Chinese mainland and a rare variant globally.

### Outcomes for patients with severe chronic neutropenia treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [^112ch2Wg]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Severe chronic neutropenia (SCN), defined as blood neutrophils < 0.5 × 109/L for > 3 months, is an uncommon hematological condition associated with recurrent and severe bacterial infections. After short-term clinical trials showed the benefits of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment for SCN, SCNIR (Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry) opened to determine the long-term benefits and safety of this treatment. This report summarizes findings from more than 16 000 patient-years of prospective observations for patients with congenital and acquired SCN. We observed that adverse outcomes depend on the underlying etiology. Myelodysplasia (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occur infrequently and largely in patients with congenital neutropenias. Having cyclic or chronic autoimmune/ idiopathic neutropenia portends a favorable prognosis. A few patients with idiopathic neutropenia evolve to develop lymphoid malignancies, but they do not appear to be at increased risk of myeloid malignancies, even with very long-term G-CSF therapy. Progression to systemic autoimmune diseases, bone marrow (BM) failure, aplastic anemia, or nonmyeloid malignancies are not expected consequences of SCN or treatment with G-CSF.

Severe congenital neutropenia

Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN), including Kostmann syndrome, is characterized by severe peripheral neutropenia (< 0.2 × 10 9 /L). These patients present with recurrent life-threatening infections in infancy. BM examination frequently shows maturation arrest in the myeloid lineage, and some patients can present with cyclical neutropenia. These patients can progress to MDS and leukemia, usually with an acquisition of secondary mutations in granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor. In most patients, heterozygous variants in the neutrophil elastase gene (ELANE) have been identified. These variants are thought to cause an accumulation of a nonfunctional protein, which, in turn, triggers an unfolded protein response, leading to a maturational arrest. The original family described by Kostmann had AR-SCN and was caused by biallelic variants in HAX1, predicted to result in cell death defects. Variants in other genes (GFI1, G6PC3, CSF3R, JAGN1, and VPS45)have also been associated with SCN (Table 8). Whereas ELANE variants typically produce isolated neutropenia, variants in some other genes are associated with extrahematological abnormalities. There are also several syndromes (reviewed by Hauck and Klein) that involve neutropenia as part of a broader syndrome.

### Paediatric autoimmune diseases with ELANE mutations associated with neutropenia [^112roHDS]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Neutropenia is the main clinical manifestation of ELANE mutations. It has been reported that mutations in the ELANE gene are found in 80–100% of cyclic neutropenia (CN) cases and 35–63% of severe neutropenia (SCN) cases. Both spontaneous and germline mutations may occur. Neutropenia-associated ELANE mutations are usually frame shift and termination mutations that result in structural changes in protein.

CN is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by regular fluctuation of peripheral neutrophils from near normal to severe low levels, generally with a cycle of 21 days, but also can be 2–4 weeks. Clinical manifestations include fever, lymphadenitis, oral ulcer and infections such as sinusitis, pharyngitis, cellulitis, pneumonia, acute peritonitis. The pathogen of infection is usually Gram-negative bacilli. Symptoms usually recur, but severe infections, sepsis, and even death are rare. It can also be asymptomatic. SCN is a congenital phagocytic defect in primary immunodeficiency diseases, which can be autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance. Reported more than germline mutations, spontaneous mutations are characterized by repeated severe infections starting from first few months after birth. They may present with omphalitis at first, followed by otitis media, pneumonia, skin or liver abscess. Patients can have permanent teeth fall out at very early age due to stomatitis and gingival hyperplasia. Neutrophil absolute count (ANC) was always lower than 0.2 × 10 9 /L. The most common pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacilli. Because SCN patients cannot produce pus, the absence of pus at infected lesions is a characteristic change of SCN. Bone marrow biopsy shows neutrophil precursor maturation stop at the promyelocytic/myeloid stage. Unlike CN, SCN is characterized by transition to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).

### Neutrophil elastase in cyclic and severe congenital neutropenia [^113FhVXm]. Blood (2007). Low credibility.

Mutations in ELA2 encoding the neutrophil granule protease, neutrophil elastase (NE), are the major cause of the 2 main forms of hereditary neutropenia, cyclic neutropenia and severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). Genetic evaluation of other forms of neutropenia in humans and model organisms has helped to illuminate the role of NE. A canine form of cyclic neutropenia corresponds to human Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 2 (HPS2) and results from mutations in AP3B1 encoding a subunit of a complex involved in the subcellular trafficking of vesicular cargo proteins (among which NE appears to be one). Rare cases of SCN are attributable to mutations in the transcriptional repressor Gfi1 (among whose regulatory targets also include ELA2). The ultimate biochemical consequences of the mutations are not yet known, however. Gene targeting of ELA2 has thus far failed to recapitulate neutropenia in mice. The cycling phenomenon and origins of leukemic transformation in SCN remain puzzling. Nevertheless, mutations in all 3 genes are capable of causing the mislocalization of NE and may also induce the unfolded protein response, suggesting that there might a convergent pathogenic mechanism focusing on NE.

### De novo missense variant C.170 C > A of ELANE in a Chinese infant with congenital neutropenia: case report and literature review [^116TiMF5]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Congenital neutropenia (CN) is a rare hereditary blood disorder characterized by a significant reduction in neutrophils, making patients prone to recurrent and severe infections and even a risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukemia, often caused by the ELANE variants, and the complex relationship between ELANE variants and clinical phenotypes, as well as the natural course of the disease, remains unclear. We describe a case of CN in a Chinese infant caused by the De Novo missense variant c.170 C > A in the ELANE gene, presented with persistent neutropenia since the neonatal period, accompanied by recurrent infections. He did not receive G-CSF treatment due to the declination of his parents, but antibiotics were administered during infections or with high hsCRP levels. During the early neonatal stage, the patient consistently exhibited severe neutropenia (ANC < 0.5×10^9/L). Periodic fluctuations in neutrophil counts observed twice a week during particular months suggest a cyclical pattern. Until now, he still experiences varying degrees of neutropenia persistently, with ANC occasionally exceeding 1.0×10^9/L during infections. Multiple prediction scoring tools and models support the pathogenicity of this missense variant. This case highlights a rare pathogenic variant of ELANE, which, to our knowledge, is the first case of the variant c.170 C > A (p. Ala57Asp) of the intermediate phenotype of CN in mainland China and a rare variant globally, indicating phenotypic variability in ELANE-related neutropenia due to an Ala57 mutation. The clinical management of CN caused by ELANE variants poses a challenge for clinicians and deserves attention. Timely diagnosis, treatment, and extended follow-up are of paramount value.

A 12-year-old daughter of consanguineous Moroccan parents was diagnosed with cyclic neutropenia, based on a combination of recurrent gingivostomatitis, a fluctuating neutrophil count, and several episodes of severe neutropenia. No ELA2 gene mutations were found. At age 19 years she presented with edema of the limbs, proteinuria and renal failure. Renal amyloidosis AA was diagnosed by biopsy. Gene mutations associated with family Mediterranean fever (FMF) were sought, and a homozygous mutation (M694V) was found in the MFEV gene. This is the novel finding of FMF that masqueraded as cyclic neutropenia.

Ringed sideroblasts describe red blood cell precursors in the bone marrow (erythroblasts) which have a ring of iron-laden mitochondria around the nucleus. These are only visible with a dedicated iron stain, e.g. Perl's Prussian blue. They are seen in sideroblastic anemia (see section).

2.4. Neutropenia

Twenty-seven IMDs in the IEM Knowledgebase are associated with neutropenia.

Barth syndrome is an inherited disorder of mitochondrial phospholipid metabolism, which is caused by variants in the TAZ gene, located on the X chromosome. TAZ encodes Tafazzin, a membrane associated transacylase which is responsible for remodeling the inner mitochondrial membrane phospholipid, cardiolipin. It has an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. It leads to a variable clinical phenotype, characterized by cardiomyopathy, skeletal muscle myopathy, neutropenia, and constitutional growth delay. The neutropenia described in Barth syndrome is quite variable. In a case series of 88 affected males, neutropenia was noted in 84%. The pattern of neutropenia varied from intermittent and unpredictable, cyclical neutropenia, to severe chronic neutropenia. The neutropenia is associated with an increased risk of severe bacterial infections, which can be ameliorated by treatment with granulocyte stimulating factor (G-CSF), and prophylactic antibiotics.

Recent research

Two large, investigator-led, randomised controlled trials published in 2005 provide firm evidence of the efficacy of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis in two distinct contexts: hospitalised patients expecting prolonged neutropenia, and patients receiving cyclical, mainly outpatient-based, chemotherapy causing neutropenia of a short duration.

Hospitalised patients expecting prolonged neutropenia

) reported findings from a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 760 hospitalised adult patients in whom chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (below 1000 neutrophils per mm 3) was expected to last longer than 7 days. The trial included patients receiving chemotherapy for acute leukaemia, lymphomas or solid tumours. They were randomised to receive oral levofloxacin (500 mg daily) or placebo from the start of chemotherapy until the resolution of neutropenia. Intention-to-treat analysis showed a lower incidence of fever in patients receiving levofloxacin compared with the placebo group (65 vs 85%, respectively, P = 0.001). Mortality was lower in the levofloxacin group but the study was not powered to prove this.

Cyclical, mainly outpatient-based, chemotherapy causing neutropenia of short duration

In the UK Significant (simple investigation in neutropenic individuals of the frequency of infection after chemotherapy +/−antibiotic in a number of tumours) Trial, 1565 patients receiving cyclical, mainly outpatient chemotherapy for solid tumours (predominantly breast, lung and testicular) or lymphoma, who were at risk of temporary, severe neutropenia (below 500 neutrophils per mm 3) were randomised to receive either levofloxacin (500 mg daily) or placebo for 7 days during the expected neutropenic period in up to six cycles of chemotherapy. A significant reduction in febrile episodes and hospitalisation for treatment of bacterial infection was documented in the levofloxacin group during all cycles of treatment. Thirty-day mortality was lower in the levofloxacin group (1.5%) compared with the placebo group (2.3%), but the difference did not reach statistical significance. The Significant Trial was by far the largest study looking specifically at antibiotic prophylaxis of FN in patients with solid tumours and lymphoma receiving moderately myelosuppressive chemotherapy, and it resolved the efficacy question for this group of patients.

Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) and Clostridium septicum myonecrosis is an uncommon and life-threatening association requiring urgent combined aggressive medical and surgical management. We report 2 cases of SCN (1 with known Kostmann's syndrome and 1 not known at presentation to have a congenital neutropenic disorder but subsequently received a diagnosis of cyclic neutropenia) who presented with spontaneous C septicum myonecrosis. The cases highlight the importance of response to recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in obtaining a satisfactory outcome for these patients. Early, empirical use of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in patients who are suspected of having a congenital neutropenia and who present with life-threatening sepsis is recommended.

### Epidemiology and clinical features of PFAPA: a retrospective cohort study of 336 patients in Western Sweden [^113yKgj4]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The retrospective approach of this study limits the data available to what was registered in the medical records and thus represent a minimum occurrence, as all symptoms may not have been documented. However, almost all the patients in this cohort were seen by an experienced pediatrician with expert knowledge of autoinflammatory disorders, using a systematic approach to collecting relevant information regarding signs and symptoms. The agreement of our data with that in previous studies regarding the clinical features supports the proposition that the patients included in our study are representative of the PFAPA syndrome.

The current lack of validated diagnostic criteria for PFAPA is an obstacle to creating homogeneous patient cohorts in the research context. As the modified Marshall criteria do not on their own either exclude other diagnoses or include all patients recognized by most physicians in the field as PFAPA, many researchers define their own criteria for the condition to ensure their studies enroll a well-defined group of patients. In the clinical context, physicians also have diverse perspectives of the signs and symptoms that are required to make a PFAPA diagnosis. The recently proposed classification criteria for PFAPA by Gattorno et al. offers a new approach to the definition of PFAPA patients using positive (presence of) and negative (absence of) clinical variables as well as prerequisites of markedly elevated inflammatory markers, careful consideration of confounding diseases and at least 6 months of disease activity. As they were developed for research purposes, the criteria are explicitly not meant to be employed as diagnostic criteria but may nevertheless be helpful in clinical practice. Renko et al. have suggested wider diagnostic criteria, including patients without evidence of aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis, at least in the context of a population where monogenic autoinflammatory disorders as well as cyclic neutropenia are exceedingly rare, such as in populations with mainly Scandinavian ethnicity. In this study, we chose to define PFAPA according to the modified Marshall criteria but divided the cohort into two different subgroups based on the absence or presence of atypical features. Although atypical features should prompt consideration of other causes of the symptoms, a diagnosis of a monogenic autoinflammatory disorder is uncommon, even in patients who display these features, and the classification criteria formulated by Gattorno et al. allow for one atypical feature if the patient fulfils all the other criteria. We considered using these criteria in this study, but the retrospective design made them less appropriate. In addition, they were published after the patients in this cohort were assessed clinically. No significant differences regarding age of onset, sex distribution, clinical features or response to treatment were found in PFAPA patients with vs. without atypical features in this study. Until there is further knowledge of the pathogenesis of PFAPA and specific diagnostic markers have been developed, patients must be evaluated individually, differential diagnosis pursued to a reasonable extent and the PFAPA diagnosis relies on the clinician putting together all the pieces of the puzzle. Expert opinion, which we used for ambiguous cases, has even been suggested as the gold standard for diagnosing PFAPA. We cannot completely exclude the possibility that a few patients with atypical features in this study could have a mAID, but, as the incidence of these disorders is very low in our population, it should not alter the results in any significant way.

### Clinical immunology review series: an approach to the patient with recurrent orogenital ulceration, including Behçet's syndrome [^113jL4qE]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with recurrent orogenital ulcers may have complex aphthosis, Behçet's disease, secondary complex aphthosis (e.g. Reiter's syndrome, Crohn's disease, cyclical neutropenia) or non-aphthous disease (including bullous disorders, erythema multiforme, erosive lichen planus). Behçet's syndrome is a multi-system vasculitis of unknown aetiology for which there is no diagnostic test. Diagnosis is based on agreed clinical criteria that require recurrent oral ulcers and two of the following: recurrent genital ulcers, ocular inflammation, defined skin lesions and pathergy. The condition can present with a variety of symptoms, hence a high index of suspicion is necessary. The most common presentation is with recurrent mouth ulcers, often with genital ulcers; however, it may take some years before diagnostic criteria are met. All patients with idiopathic orogenital ulcers should be kept under review, with periodic focused assessment to detect evolution into Behçet's disease. There is often a delay of several years between patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria and a diagnosis being made, which may contribute to the morbidity of this condition. Despite considerable research effort, the aetiology and pathogenesis of this condition remains enigmatic.

Methods

Data were collected retrospectively from the electronic medical charts of all of the children diagnosed with PFAPA, who were followed at the outpatient pediatric rheumatology clinic of Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel between March 2014 and April 2021.

The diagnosis of PFAPA was based on previously established clinical criteria. The first of these is periodic fever for at least 6 months with a daily fever of at least 38.5 °C (axillary) for 2 to 7 days. A second criterion is at least five regularly recurring fever episodes with a maximum 2 months interval between them. A third criterion is the presentation of pharyngitis, cervical adenitis, or oral aphthae, at least one in every episode and at least 2 of three in the majority of episodes. A fourth criterion is exclusion of patients with other causes of recurrent fever, infections, immunodeficiency and cyclic neutropenia, according to their medical histories, physical examinations and lab work Additionally, disease onset is before age 6 years, recovery between episodes is complete, and linear growth is normal.

### Towards a new set of classification criteria for PFAPA syndrome [^114KyZp5]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Thanks to a collaborative effort made by clinicians in the field of autoinflammatory diseases we developed a provisional new set of classification criteria for PFAPA disease based on experts' opinion and we tested their performance in a cohort of PFAPA patients. The new criteria seem quite difficult to apply, since they need a precise history that can't always be provided by parents. The characteristics of fever episodes provided in the new criteria are probably too restrictive and excluded nearly half of the patients. Conversely, the criterion "age at onset < 6 years" seems better adapted and excluded only 1 patient. There are not other substantial differences between new criteria and modified Marshall's criteria. Globally, the new criteria were able to classify fewer patients as PFAPA in respect to the modified Marshall's criteria if applied on our cohort of patients. By using these new criteria in clinical practice to diagnose PFAPA, a significant number of patients would not be diagnosed, and we consider them as not useful as diagnostic criteria. On the other hand, since they are very restrictive, these criteria probably would allow selecting a more homogeneous group of patients; therefore they may be suitable to select well-defined cohorts of patients for clinical research. In fact, Marshall criteria have been found to be poorly specific when tested in a population in which different monogenic periodic fevers are present. This study presented some limitations and do not resolve the classification dilemma of PFAPA patients for different reasons. First of all, the elaboration of the new criteria was not the result of a statistical multivariate analysis of real patients with different confounding conditions (i.e. other autoinflammatory diseases, cyclic neutropenia or recurrent infections), but was made on the unique judgment of a panel of experts after the indications coming from a larger Delphi survey. The lack of a control group didn't allow us to calculate specificity and sensitivity of the new criteria. Moreover, the evaluation of the new criteria was done retrospectively on a cohort of only 80 patients with the diagnosis of PFAPA coming from only two centers, for which the diagnosis was based on the judgments of each center, not on the basis of a consensus among different experts.

This was the first attempt to create a new set of classification criteria for PFAPA syndrome based on a consensus among experts. With its limitations, this study allowed us to identify difficulties hidden in a consensus-based process, underlying the need for a definition of gold standard PFAPA patients to develop validated classification criteria, and paving the way for a better-structured project that is ongoing.

Different version proposed for some variables were ranked by participants to choose the most appropriated one (e.g. duration of attacks: > 2 days, > 3 days, < 5 days, 3–6 days, max 5 days, or max 6 days).

Periodicity of the febrile episodes as well as the maximum interval between episodes were specified in the new criteria, as well as the mandatory presence of at least one sign during each episode or even 2 in most episodes.

In the new criteria age at disease onset was modified in the new criteria at < 6 years instead of < 5 years, and more detailed description of other causes that clinician has to exclude were provided (other causes of recurrent fever, infection and other immunodeficiency than cyclic neutropenia). The new criteria specified that the pattern of growth have to be linear. After discussion, response to steroid was considered as supportive criteria and not included in the new criteria.

### Cyclic neutropenia and severe congenital neutropenia in patients with a shared ELANE mutation and paternal haplotype: evidence for phenotype determination by modifying genes [^115xUm7G]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Cyclic neutropenia (CN) and severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) are disorders of neutrophil production that differ markedly in disease severity. Mutations of the ELANE gene (the symbol recently replacing ELA2) are considered largely responsible for most cases of CN and SCN, but specific mutations are typically associated with one or the other.

Procedure

We performed ELANE genotyping on all individuals and paternal sperm in an SCN kindred with eight SCN progeny of a sperm donor and six different mothers.

Results

One patient with CN had the same S97L ELANE mutation as seven patients with the SCN phenotype. The mutant allele was detected in the donor's spermatozoa, representing 18% of the ELANE gene pool, but not in DNA from his lymphocytes, neutrophils, or buccal mucosa, indicating gonadal mosaicism.

Conclusions

The coexistence of CN and SCN phenotypes in this kindred with a shared paternal haplotype strongly suggests both a role for modifying genes in determination of congenital neutropenia disease phenotypes, and the classification of CN and SCN within a spectrum of phenotypes expressing varying degrees of the same disease process.

### Filgrastim-sndz (Zarxio) [^112oWFuw]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The dose was increased incrementally to 12 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day if there was no response.

The main efficacy endpoint was response to filgrastim treatment. ANC response from baseline (< 500/mm3) was defined as follows:

Complete response: median ANC > 1,500/mm3
Partial response: median ANC ≥ 500/mm3and ≤ 1,500/mm3with a minimum increase of 100%
No response: median ANC < 500/mm3

There were 112 of 123 patients who demonstrated a complete or partial response to filgrastim treatment.

Additional efficacy endpoints included a comparison between patients randomized to 4 months of observation and patients receiving filgrastim of the following parameters:

incidence of infection
incidence of fever
duration of fever
incidence, duration, and severity of oropharyngeal ulcers
number of days of antibiotic use

The incidence for each of these 5 clinical parameters was lower in the filgrastim arm compared to the control arm for cohorts in each of the 3 major diagnostic categories. An analysis of variance showed no significant interaction between treatment and diagnosis‚ suggesting that efficacy did not differ substantially in the different diseases. Although filgrastim substantially reduced neutropenia in all patient groups‚ in patients with cyclic neutropenia‚ cycling persisted but the period of neutropenia was shortened to 1 day.

### Low plasma levels of the protein pro-LL-37 as an early indication of severe disease in patients with chronic neutropenia [^114uaVrb]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic neutropenia comprises several different diseases that vary in degree of severity and management. We analysed the levels of the neutrophil-derived protein pro-LL-37 in plasma of patients with chronic neutropenia to assess whether it could be used to differentiate different categories of chronic neutropenia. All patients with severe congenital neutropenia were pro-LL-37 deficient. This was in contrast to patients with autoimmune or idiopathic neutropenia, who exhibited normal pro-LL-37 levels while patients with cyclic neutropenia displayed an oscillation of pro-LL-37 in plasma. Plasma levels of pro-LL-37 may thus prove useful for differential diagnosis of chronic neutropenia.

### Long-term outcomes of myeloid growth factor treatment [^116SN5tK]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2011). Low credibility.

Myeloid growth factors are used to reduce myelotoxicity and the risk of infection after cancer chemotherapy and in patients with chronic neutropenia. This article addresses the long-term benefits and risks associated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy in both settings. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials recently reported long-term outcomes regarding the risk of second malignancies and overall survival. Based on these studies, the risk for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) associated with known carcinogenic agents, such as chemotherapy, could not be distinguished from any risk associated with growth factor support. However, the enhanced delivery of chemotherapy dose intensity enabled by the use of G-CSF in these studies was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality. Although some reduction in treatment-related mortality with G-CSF support may occur, the observed improvement in long-term survival likely relates to better disease control with more-intense G-CSF-supported chemotherapy. Myeloid growth factors have also been shown to benefit patients with severe chronic neutropenia. Almost all patients with cyclic, congenital, or idiopathic neutropenia experience response to G-CSFs. Treatment is titrated to determine a dose that provides a safe elevation in neutrophil counts. Reports have shown that patients can be maintained for years at the same dose after adjusting for growth and development. In congenital neutropenia, the inherent risk of developing myelodysplastic syndromes or AML requires careful monitoring, including routine blood counts and annual bone marrow examinations.

Heterozygous mutations of the gene encoding neutrophil elastase (ELA2) have been associated with cyclic neutropenia (CN) and severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). To date, 30 different mutations have been reported, but no correlation has been found with the degree of neutropenia. To address this issue, we analyzed the clinical, hematologic, and molecular characteristics of 81 unrelated patients with SCN (n = 54) or CN (n = 27). We identified mutations in 31 patients, two thirds of whom had sporadic forms. Familial cases were consistent with dominant inheritance. Seventeen novel mutations were identified, showing that the mutational spectrum encompasses not only the region encoding the mature enzyme but also the prodomains and promoter region. Genotype-phenotype analysis strongly suggested that ELA2 mutations correlate with more severe expression of neutropenia, specifically in patients diagnosed with SCN. This study underlines the importance of ELA2 molecular screening to identify patients who may be at particular risk of severe bacterial infections and/or acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplasia. By phenotypic analysis of affected relatives and carriers of the same ELA2 mutations, we showed that the expression of neutropenia in CN and SCN may be either homogeneous or variable according to the type of mutations, suggesting different pathogenetic mechanisms.

SECTION A: INITIAL PRESENTATION OF FN

Initial Management: Risk Stratification

A1. Adopt a validated risk stratification strategy and incorporate it into routine clinical management (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).

In the 2017 CPG, this recommendation was based on a systematic review of risk stratification schemas identifying multiple rules that had been validated in pediatric populations. No new RCTs were identified that evaluated risk stratification, and thus, the 2017 recommendation was unchanged.

### A high prevalence of neutrophil-specific antibodies in ELANE-mutated severe congenital neutropenia [^111m1oUd]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

An assay for neutrophil-specific antibodies is frequently used in the workup of chronic severe neutropenia and is suggestive of autoimmune, or sporadically alloimmune neutropenia, rather than severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). We analyzed a neutropenia consortium database for the outcomes of antibody testing initiated before receiving genetic diagnosis in Polish SCN cohort. Test results, performed in a single reference laboratory, were available for 14 patients with ELANE-mutated SCN or cyclic neutropenia, and were frequently positive (36%). We note that the trigger for genetic studies in severe neutropenia should not be affected by antibody-positivity and should be clinically driven.

### Guidelines for management of children with fever and neutropenia [^111x5nnK]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2013). Low credibility.

Children presenting with fever and neutropenia (FN) pose unique diagnostic and management challenges. The absence of pediatric-specific guidelines has led physicians to rely on local expertise, interpretation of available data without benefit of national consensus, and extrapolation of adult guidelines for direction. However, the causes, treatment, and outcomes of children with FN differ in important ways from those of adults. Although individual studies have focused on different aspects of the management of FN in children, a universal approach has not been adopted. The literature review below provides a synopsis of a recently published international guideline on management of children with FN. The guideline reviewed represents the first evidence-based, consensus-driven approach to address management of FN in children.

### Is there really an accelerated phase of chronic myeloid leukaemia? [^115w9F6A]. Leukemia (2024). Medium credibility.

Regading the 2022 WHO position: Biologically, we think chronic phase CML is best considered a preleukaemia rather than a leukaemia. We suggest this because chronic phase cells differentiate normally, respond to normal physiological regulatory signals regulatory signals such as granulocyte- and granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factors (G- and G/M-CSFs), function mostly normally, have normal or near normal lifespans and undergo normal terminal differentiation. There are simply too many of them. There is no convincing evidence of uncontrolled proliferation in chronic phase CML. For example, the cells do not form myeloid colonies spontaneously in vitro and mostly function normally in vivo. In persons with chronic phase CML blood granulocyte concentration increases appropriately in infections and in rare persons with cyclical neutropenia and chronic phase CML the blood granulocyte concentration cycles like persons with cyclical neutropenia without CML. Lastly, in untreated chronic phase CML the blood granulocyte concentration usually reaches an stable apogee. Moreover, the gene expression profile (GEP) of chronic phase CML cells resembles normal CD34-postive cells. The increased granulocyte mass in chronic phase CML is explainable by as few as 2–4 extra late-stage cell divisions.

Clinically, CML was initially divided into chronic and terminal or blast phases. Many of these people were in what is termed blast phase and had brief survivals. The proposition of an intermediate accelerated phase was based on identifying co-variates at diagnosis or during the disease course associated with an increased risk of transforming to blast phase. These co-variates were identified before the era of TKI-therapy and differ between classifications. However, accelerated phase was removed from the 2022 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of CML because with TKI-therapy few people with chronic phase CML transform to blast phase.

In an analysis of > 2000 people with CML in either chronic or accelerated phases at diagnosis based on the 2020 ELN and 2022 ICC criteria we found most subjects classified as accelerated phase had outcomes like persons in chronic phase identified as intermediate- or high-risk cohorts classified by the European Treatment and Outcome Study (EUTOS) Long-Term Survival score (ELTS) risk classification. The other 20 percent had some worse outcomes but only if they failed to meet the 2020 ELN TKI-therapy-response milestones. A recent study reported failing to meet these milestones before 1-year has little impact on survival. Noteworthily, even if someone is designated to be in accelerated phase they receive the same TKI-therapy a someone in chronic phase.

### Why is my patient neutropenic? [^112gi4vA]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Neutropenia is a common reason for hematology consultations in the inpatient and outpatient settings and is defined as an absolute neutrophil count less than 1500 cells/μL. Neutropenia varies in severity, with more profound neutropenia being associated with higher rates of infections and infection-related deaths. The causes for neutropenia are diverse and include congenital and acquired conditions (ie, autoimmune, drugs, infection, and malignancy). This article outlines the most common causes of neutropenia and discusses differential diagnoses, treatment modalities, and the mechanisms by which neutropenia occurs.

### Disease progression of WHIM syndrome in an international cohort of 66 pediatric and adult patients [^114g5Ngy]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Material and Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted of an international cohort of patients with WHIM syndrome from 42 centers in 21 countries across Africa, Asia, Australia/Oceania, Europe, North America, and South America. Centers were invited to participate through outreach for collaboration with international, regional-federal, or national immunological societies. Inclusion criteria were based on adapted ESID-PAGID diagnostic criteria for WHIM syndrome: (1) definitive WHIM syndrome diagnosis — chronic (non-cyclic) neutropenia (ANC less than 1000/μL) and a mutation in the intracellular C-tail of CXCR4; (2) probable WHIM syndrome diagnosis — chronic neutropenia (ANC less than 500/μL), myelokathexis, and at least two of the following criteria, chronic or recurrent warts, chronic lymphopenia (ALC less than 1500/μL), hypogammaglobulinemia, and/or a parent with neutropenia and warts.

Age at diagnosis was defined as age when patients fulfilled the adapted ESID-PAGID diagnostic criteria for WHIM syndrome. Patients were characterized (1) as prospectively diagnosed by genetic testing, which was prompted by a positive family history (FH) and diagnosis below the age 1 year; (2) as diagnosed by genetic testing prompted by a known WHIM syndrome diagnosis of a relative, which triggered evaluation for WHIM, regardless of age or degree of kinship; (3) as diagnosed based on clinical signs (Sx) of WHIM syndrome, which triggered evaluation for primary immunodeficiency and subsequent diagnosis of WHIM syndrome. Initial WHIM-related manifestation was defined as the first presenting sign or symptom of WHIM syndrome recorded in the medical record that contributed to a retrospective diagnosis based on chart review, as advocated by Prince and Berman in 2012. Disease progression was calculated as, number of patients with a specific disease manifestation divided by the number of patients tested at a specific age.

The following constitutes key background information on febrile neutropenia:

- **Definition**: FN is a common consequence of cancer chemotherapy characterized by fever and underlying infection.
- **Pathophysiology**: FN is caused by antineoplastic therapy (side-effect leading to myelosuppression or mucositis) in cancer patients.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of FN include fever, underlying infection associated with bacteremia, sepsis, hemodynamic instability, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The 30-day mortality associated with FN ranges from 6% to 10%.

### Severe chronic neutropenia: treatment and follow-up of patients in the severe chronic neutropenia international registry [^1135GheL]. American Journal of Hematology (2003). Low credibility.

Severe chronic neutropenia (SCN) is defined as an absolute neutrophil (ANC) of less than 0.5 x 10(9)/L, lasting for months or years. Congenital, cyclic, and idiopathic neutropenia are principal categories of SCN. Since 1994, the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry (SCNIR) has collected data to monitor the clinical course, treatments, and disease outcomes for SCN patients. This report summarizes data for 853 patients, almost all treated with daily or alternate-day recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF or Filgrastim). G-CSF treatment increased the ANC overall from 0.34 x 10(9)/L ± 0.018 pre-treatment to 3.70 x 10(9)/L ± 0.18 during the first year of treatment. For most patients, the responses were durable with patients remaining on the same dose of G-CSF for many years. Long-term hematological observations showed stable mean leukocyte and neutrophil counts and gradually increasing hemoglobin levels. Thrombocytopenia developed in 4% of patients. As of January 1, 2000, myelodysplasia (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) has occurred in 35 of 387 patients with congenital neutropenia with a cumulative risk of 13% after 8 years of G-CSF treatment. This event occurred without a predictable relationship to the duration or dose of G-CSF treatment. No patients with cyclic or idiopathic neutropenia developed MDS or AML. Other important adverse events included hepatomegaly, osteoporosis, vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, and deaths in 4 of 14 cases requiring splenectomy. Growth and development and the outcome of pregnancy appeared to be unaffected by G-CSF treatment. These data indicate that congenital, cyclic, and idiopathic neutropenia can be effectively treated with long-term G-CSF. The risk of leukemia, osteoporosis, other potentially adverse events, and pregnancy outcome need to be further evaluated with continuing long-term observations.

### Management of chemotherapy-associated febrile neutropenia [^112pUAyS]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

The development of febrile neutropenia during a course of chemotherapy is not only a life-threatening complication, it can also lead to a decision to reduce chemotherapy intensity in subsequent treatment cycles, thus putting patient outcomes at risk. Although there are strategies available for the primary prevention of febrile neutropenia, these are not widely used in the UK management of breast cancer. It is, therefore, paramount to have a well thought out and rigorously implemented care protocol for febrile neutropenia, involving patients, family/carers and health-care professionals in both primary and secondary care, to ensure early detection and effective management.

### Bortezomib [^1141QwNc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6	Gastrointestinal Toxicity

Bortezomib treatment can cause nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and vomiting [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] sometimes requiring use of antiemetic and antidiarrheal medications. Ileus can occur. Fluid and electrolyte replacement should be administered to prevent dehydration. Interrupt bortezomib for severe symptoms.

5.7	Thrombocytopenia/Neutropenia

Bortezomib is associated with thrombocytopenia and neutropenia that follow a cyclical pattern with nadirs occurring following the last dose of each cycle and typically recovering prior to initiation of the subsequent cycle. The cyclical pattern of platelet and neutrophil decreases and recovery remain consistent in the studies of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, with no evidence of cumulative thrombocytopenia or neutropenia in the treatment regimens studied.

Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently during treatment with bortezomib. Measure platelet counts prior to each dose of bortezomib. Adjust dose/schedule for thrombocytopenia [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Gastrointestinal and intracerebral hemorrhage has occurred during thrombocytopenia in association with bortezomib. Support with transfusions and supportive care, according to published guidelines.

In the single agent, relapsed multiple myeloma study of bortezomib vs dexamethasone, the mean platelet count nadir measured was approximately 40% of baseline. The severity of thrombocytopenia related to pretreatment platelet count is shown in Table 8. The incidence of bleeding (≥ Grade 3) was 2% on the bortezomib arm and was < 1% in the dexamethasone arm.

In the combination study of bortezomib with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone (VcR-CAP) in previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma patients, the incidence of thrombocytopenia (≥ Grade 4) was 32% vs 1% for the rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) arm as shown in Table 12. The incidence of bleeding events (≥ Grade 3) was 1.7% in the VcR-CAP arm (four patients) and was 1.2% in the R-CHOP arm (three patients).

Platelet transfusions were given to 23% of the patients in the VcR-CAP arm and 3% of the patients in the R-CHOP arm.

The incidence of neutropenia (≥ Grade 4) was 70% in the VcR-CAP arm and was 52% in the R-CHOP arm. The incidence of febrile neutropenia (≥ Grade 4) was 5% in the VcR-CAP arm and was 6% in the R-CHOP arm. Myeloid growth factor support was provided at a rate of 78% in the VcR-CAP arm and 61% in the R-CHOP arm.

### Outcomes for patients with severe chronic neutropenia treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [^115R4PeC]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Outcomes: myeloid malignancies

Overall, MDS or AML has occurred in 77/1752 (4.4%) of the SCNIR-enrolled patients; 11.3% of the 670 congenital patients developed MDS/AML. Table 4 summarizes outcomes for leukemia treatments, dividing the events before and after 2000. This time point was chosen because HSCT after chemotherapy became the predominant mode of treatment around this time. The diagnoses and number of affected patients were severe congenital neutropenia (64; patients with or without known associate mutation), and others: SDS (5), GSD1b (3), WAS (2), CXCR4 /WHIMs (1), HAX1 (1), and ELANE /cyclic neutropenia (1). There were no cases of AML/MDS in patients with autoimmune/idiopathic neutropenia. The median age at diagnosis of AML/MDS was 16.2 years (mean, 18.7 ± 1.6; standard error of the mean [SEM] [range, 0.40–70.6]); 76 of 77 had been treated with G-CSF, median dose was 7.7 mcg/kg per day (mean, 12.2 ± 1.3; SEM [range, 0.2–100]). The G-CSF dose was significantly higher in congenital patients evolving to MDS and AML; congenital mean G-CSF, 9.6 ± 0.84; SEM (range, 0.16–234.7); congenital patients developing MDS/AML mean G-CSF, 12.46 ± 1.4 SEM (range, 0.6–56.5); P < .0001. It is noteworthy that progression to AML/MDS was rare in patients with cyclic neutropenia; patients were generally treated with lower doses of G-CSF than the congenital group (see Table 3). In the observational cohort of 3248 patient-years, the 1 ELANE /cyclic patient who developed AML had also received long-term immunosuppressive treatment for an unrelated illness.

### Understanding chronic neutropenia: life is short [^111z3tgT]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying chronic neutropenia are extensive, varying from haematopoietic stem cell disorders resulting in defective neutrophil production, to accelerated apoptosis of neutrophil progenitors or circulating mature neutrophils. While the knowledge concerning genetic defects associated with congenital neutropenia or bone marrow failure is increasing rapidly, the functional role and consequences of these genetic alterations is often not well understood. In addition, there is a large group of diseases, including primary immunodeficiencies and metabolic diseases, in which chronic neutropenia is one of the symptoms, while there is no clear bone marrow pathology or haematopoietic stem cell dysfunction. Altogether, these disease entities illustrate the complexity of normal neutrophil development, the functional role of the (bone marrow) microenvironment and the increased propensity to undergo apoptosis, which is typical for neutrophils. The large variety of disorders associated with chronic neutropenia makes classification almost impossible and possibly not desirable, based on the clinical phenotypes. However, a better understanding of the regulation of normal myeloid differentiation and neutrophil development is of great importance in the diagnostic evaluation of unexplained chronic neutropenia. In this review we propose insights in the pathophysiology of chronic neutropenia in the context of the functional role of key players during normal neutrophil development, neutrophil release and neutrophil survival.

### Synchronous disease onset and flares in siblings with PFAPA [^116b2oob]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis syndrome (PFAPA) was first described in 1987. The diagnosis of PFAPA is clinical, requiring the presence of characteristic features and the exclusion of alternative causes. Accepted diagnostic criteria include regularly occurring fevers with an early age of onset symptoms in the absence of upper respiratory tract infection with at least one of the following clinical signs: aphthous stomatitis, cervical lymphadenitis, and pharyngitis, exclusion of cyclic neutropenia, complete absence of symptoms between episodes, and normal growth and development. Updated clinical classification criteria were established in 2019 requiring patients to fulfill at least seven out of the following 8 manifestations including the presence of pharyngitis, 3–6 day duration of episodes, cervical adenitis, and periodicity as well as the absence of diarrhea, chest pain, skin rash and arthritis. The etiology of PFAPA syndrome remains unclear, though it is generally thought to be the result of immune dysregulation. It is considered a non-hereditary disease; however, this has been the subject of debate in recent literature. PFAPA syndrome is self-limited with a favorable prognosis. Symptomatic treatment can be achieved with oral glucocorticoids, which result in dramatic resolution of fever, but do not prevent recurrence. In most children, fever episodes become less frequent over time and eventually cease altogether. Tonsillectomy is an effective option for decreasing the frequency and severity of episodes with a significant potential for cure.

Neutropenia with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) — timing and risk — ICI-related neutropenia typically occurs at a median of 10.5 weeks after the initiation of ICI therapy, and as with any form of neutropenia, ICI-related neutropenia carries an increased risk of infectious complications.

### Mutations in the gene encoding neutrophil elastase (ELA2) are not sufficient to cause the phenotype of congenital neutropenia [^1144PpLw]. British Journal of Haematology (2001). Low credibility.

Mutations in the ELA2 gene encoding human neutrophil elastase have been reported recently to be involved in the aetiology of both, cyclic (CyN) and congenital neutropenia (CN). We analysed the correlation between the occurrence of ELA2 mutations and the neutropenic phenotype in a family with two children affected with CN. The two children harboured the same heterozygous mutation in the ELA2 gene that was inherited from their unaffected father. We conclude that ELA2 mutations are not the single cause of CN although they might be a necessary prerequisite for the expression of the neutropenic phenotype in a subgroup of CN patients.

### An international Delphi survey for the definition of the variables for the development of new classification criteria for periodic fever aphtous stomatitis pharingitis cervical adenitis (PFAPA) [^116rZKqM]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This is the first Delphi survey for the identification of candidate variables for a new set of classification criteria for PFAPA. Using the Delphi technique process involving a large number of clinicians and researchers worldwide dealing with this condition, we obtained a list of variables ranked in order of importance considered as important for the identification of PFAPA patients.

The good rate of response to the Delphi underlined the interest that clinicians and researchers involved in autoinflammation have in this area. Globally, the results of the Delphi reflect the elements that clinicians take into account to identify PFAPA patients.

Participants confirmed the importance of most of the variables already included in the modified Marshall's diagnostic criteria such as regular periodicity, aphthous stomatitis, cervical adenitis, pharyngitis and wellbeing between flares and normal growth and development.

The variable "Age at onset < 5 years" reached the 22th rank, suggesting that currently this features is no longer considered such important. This may be due to the fact that in the last few years it has been observed that PFAPA onset may occur after 5 years and to date several cases of adult onset PFAPA have been described. This finding was confirmed in a recent study in which was demonstrated that most physicians do not require an age at onset < 5 years for diagnosis of PFAPA.

The exclusion of cyclic neutropenia is cited in the list together with exclusion of immunodeficiency. Cyclic neutropenia is an important differential diagnoses for PFAPA, due to its strict periodicity. This condition generally begins within the first year of life and is characterized by a cyclic reduction (every 3 weeks) of the neutrophil count causing febrile attacks due to infections. For this reason a careful evaluation of cell blood count during the first day of fever attacks may be useful in the differential diagnosis.

### Treatment of patients with hematologic neoplasm, fever, and neutropenia [^115tcC6d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Choices of empirical antibiotic therapy for patients with febrile neutropenia must be made with very little information about the source and site of infection. The clinician is aided by recognition of the subtle signs and symptoms of infection in immunocompromised patients. National guidelines should be applied according to the microbiological patterns and trends in drug resistance at each institution. Case studies are provided to illustrate these challenges in daily practice.

Other adverse outcomes

There were few other hematological complications in the 1752 patients. It is noteworthy that 4 patients in the autoimmune/idiopathic group developed systemic lupus erythematosus. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura occurred in patients with congenital (2), cyclic (2), and autoimmune/idiopathic (1) neutropenia. One patient developed glomerulonephritis associated with chronic hepatitis. Seven other patients developed chronic hepatitis (subtype information not available).

Mortality

As expected, infections were the most common cause of death, usually pneumonia, bacteremia, or sepsis syndrome, usually a consequence of severe neutropenia from failure to administer G-CSF, lack of response to G-CSF, or as a complication of HSCT (Table 6). Patients with cyclic neutropenia remained at risk of death from infections. Unfortunately, as noted above, these deaths and severe infections were too often attributable to inconsistencies with G-CSF treatment. Overall, autoimmune/idiopathic neutropenia patients have a superior prognosis.

Neutropenia refers to a group of diseases characterized by a reduction in neutrophil levels below the recommended age threshold. The present study aimed to review the diagnosis and management of neutropenia, including a diagnostic toolkit and candidate underlying genes. This study also aimed to review the progress toward the definition of autoimmune and idiopathic neutropenia rising in infancy or in late childhood but without remission, and provide suggestions for efficient diagnostics, including indications for the bone marrow and genetic testing. The management and treatment protocols for common and unique presentations are also reviewed, providing evidence tailored to a single patient.

### What do families want to improve in the management of paediatric febrile neutropenia during anti-cancer treatment? Report of a patient / public involvement group [^117S6ixZ]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

In high-income countries, the treatment of malignancies in childhood is associated with 5-year survival rates in excess of 80%. This is possible through the use of intensive, toxicity-inducing regimens, where one-third of deaths in this group are the result of complications of therapy rather than directly due to the disease. The cancer treatment often produces acute complications requiring unplanned hospitalisation, disruption, distress and strain for the young persons and their families. One such complication is the co-occurrence of fever in the presence of neutropenia; this combination heralds a possible overwhelming infection and is considered a medical emergency. The absolute risk of death or requirement of intensive care in such episodes is low, approximately 3%. The challenge for families and healthcare professionals is to effectively treat each episode, with minimum exposure to antibiotics and disruption of family life.

Research into episodes of febrile neutropenia(FN), and subsequent clinical practice guidelines have emphasised the need to treat promptly, assess the risk of each episode and treat with antibiotics chosen to address individual and local resistance patterns. The methods of risk assessment and discontinuation of antibiotic therapy are, however, precautionary and conservative, treating two-thirds of patients with broad spectrum antibiotics unnecessarily. Studies have shown that biomarkers of infection/inflammation seem to predict the risk of serious infection and its resolution, but have not been used to guide management. Further refinement of the approach to FN has been identified as a research priority.

In analogous situations with critically ill or immunocompromised hosts, such as adult or neonatal intensive care units, traditional management is similar to that of FN, with the prompt use of antibiotics and their discontinuation when infection has been excluded. Procalcitonin-led guidelines have been shown to reduce exposure to antibiotics and potentially improve mortality rates.

Skin and soft tissue infections in cancer patients with neutropenia — assessment recommendations emphasize episode classification, tissue diagnosis, risk stratification, and extent-of-infection workup. Determine whether the current presentation of fever and neutropenia is the patient's initial episode, persistent unexplained fever after 4–7 days, or a subsequent recurrent episode (strong, low). Aggressively determine the etiology by aspiration and/or biopsy of lesions and submit material for thorough cytological/histological assessments. Risk-stratify patients: high-risk are those with anticipated prolonged (> 7 days) and profound neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] < 100 cells/μL) or a Multinational Association for Supportive Care (MASCC) score of < 21; low-risk are those with anticipated brief (< 7 days) neutropenia and few comorbidities (strong, low) or a MASCC score of ≥ 21 (strong, moderate).

X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy — Barth syndrome (tafazzin) features include tafazzin as an X‑linked cause of DCM that typically presents in male infants with heart failure, neutropenia (cyclic), 3‑methylglutaconic aciduria, and cardiolipin deficiency, with mitochondrial dysfunction on electron microscopy and electron transport chain biochemical analysis. Affected infants commonly show left ventricular dysfunction and dilatation, endocardial fibroelastosis, or a dilated and hypertrophic left ventricle with trabeculations consistent with left ventricular noncompaction; some succumb to heart failure, sudden death, or sepsis attributable to leukocyte dysfunction, and tafazzin encodes an acyltransferase leading to cardiolipin abnormalities.

### What is the best approach to suspected cyclical Cushing syndrome? Strategies for managing Cushing's syndrome with variable laboratory data [^115UwS2F]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Cyclical Cushing's syndrome is a pattern of hypercortisolism in which the biochemistry of cortisol production fluctuates rhythmically. This syndrome is often associated with fluctuating symptoms and signs. It is now being increasingly recognized. The phenomenon is important because it can, if not recognized, lead to errors in diagnosis and differential diagnosis of the syndrome and in assessment of therapeutic outcomes. The techniques and criteria, protocols and dynamic biochemical tools to detect cycling in patients with hypercortisolism are discussed as are the strategies for diagnosing and managing this important subgroup of patients with hypercortisolism.

Who should patients call, and when?

The next challenge in the diagnosis and management of febrile neutropenia is to make sure the patient's symptoms are communicated appropriately and effectively, so that they enter the necessary care pathway (Figure 1).

One major pitfall is the reticence that many patients have towards 'troubling the busy doctor', particularly outside of surgery hours, and it is important to stress the need to seek help as soon as signs of possible febrile neutropenia develop.

Some chemotherapy teams, particularly those managing leukaemia, which carries an especially high risk of treatment-induced infection, instruct patients to make direct contact with their chemotherapy service in the event of symptoms suggesting febrile neutropenia. However, equivalent advice for patients with solid tumours could swamp oncology staff in some services, and the approach taken varies across the country. For example, some teams ask patients to make direct contact with the chemotherapy service within clinic hours, and/or an on-call senior nurse outside of the normal working weekday; some instruct patients to contact emergency primary care services, whatever the day or time. The latter strategy carries the risk that the busy on-call GP will not get the full picture from the patient and will fail to recognise the severity of the risk, which also applies to patients visiting A&E with symptoms of febrile neutropenia.

The potential time lag from presentation to treatment bears a serious risk – as antibiotics should be administered within 60 min of any signs and symptoms of febrile neutropenia developing. Lack of communication between the treating physician at A&E and the patient's oncology department can lead to insufficient knowledge of the patient's case and history; this issue could be resolved by implementing communication protocols that ensure that the patient's oncology team is fully notified of any treatment that their patient has received. In light of these concerns, several chemotherapy services offer patients a back-up contact point if they feel unhappy with the input from community services.

### Studies on cyclic neutropenia… [^114jZrbF]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Cyclic neutropenia is a rare disease characterized by the regular disappearance of neutrohils from the circulating blood at approximately 21-day intervals. The neutropenic phase of the cycle is generally associated with clinical manifestations of fever, malaise, and the appearance of ulcers in the oral mucous membranes. Other symptoms, which are not common to all the patients, include intermittent arthralgia, abdominal pain, sore throat, lymphadenitis, headache, ischiorectal infections, mental depression, conjunctivitis, and cutaneous ulcers. To date only 23 well-documented cases have been reported in the literature. A summary of these cases is presented in Table 1. The neutrophils in the peripheral blood regularly fall to extremely low levels and often disappear for several days during each cycle.

Between attacks the neutrophils may rise to nearly normal levels, but in most of the reported cases the neutrophil count is always somewhat lower than normal and seldom exceeds 50% of the differential count.

### Cyclic neutropenia… [^111bMvJC]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Cyclic neutropenia, or periodic neutropenia as Reimann has recently termed it, is a rare hematological disorder of unknown etiology and is characterized by severe neutropenia or agranulocytosis recurring at approximately 21 day intervals. The neutropenic phase, which lasts for from five to eight days, is usually accompanied by mild fever and localized, superficial infections of the skin or mucous membranes. Sometimes the infection is so severe that it simulates acute agranulocytosis, while, at other times, infection may be minimal or even absent. These symptoms always subside as the neutrophils rise to normal levels during the recovery periods. This sequence of events continues for years without impairing the general health of the person. Accurate recognition of this type of neutropenia is of great importance because it implies a favorable prognosis and because the disorder must be differentiated from acute and chronic types of neutropenia, both idiopathic and secondary, in which a.

### Recurrent oral and cutaneous infections associated with cyclic neutropenia… [^1151Swdy]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Recurrent skin and mucous membrane infections, occurring at regular intervals, should alert the clinician to the possibility of an unusual hematologic disorder known as cyclic or periodic neutropenia. This disease is characterized by a cyclic depression of neutrophils, occurring at intervals of 12 to 30 days lasting from 5 to 8 days and accompanied by fever, malaise, and infections occurring in the skin and mucous membranes. The neutrophils in the peripheral blood regularly fall to low levels or disappear at this time. Between the periods of depression, the neutrophils increase but seldom rise to above 50% of the total. The leukocyte count is usually in the low normal range. The literature describing this rare disorder will be reviewed in this paper, and three cases will be reported. These cases are of particular interest, since a long period of observation: 731–741.

### Study details | NCT07066085 | Serial blood count study… [^111wL7oT]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Serial Blood Count StudyClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview The objective of the Serial Blood Count Study is to determine the utility of home monitoring of white blood cell and absolute neutrophil counts to diagnose cyclic neutropenia and distinguish between cyclic and severe congenital neutropenia. A new home monitoring device called Athelas One was granted an FDA 510K Class 2 clearance for evaluation of white blood count and absolute neutrophil count. The investigators believe this device provides a unique and extremely valuable opportunity to for diagnosis of these diseases. Cyclic neutropenia usually occurs as an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the gene for neutrophil elastase, ELANE. Severe congenital neutropenia is also hereditary and caused by mutations in the same gene. Distinguishing between these diseases by genotyping is imprecise because of overlap in the mutational profiles.

However, the distinction is critical because SCN has a far greater risk of evolution to myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia. The risk is approximately 20–25% for patients with SCN and less than 1% for CyN. Because of this risk, patients with SCN are likely to be referred for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, whereas CyN patients are not. The best way to distinguish between these conditions is with serial ANC determinations. It is not easy for subjects to get 6 weeks of daily blood counts because this requires repeated trips to a clinical laboratory for blood draws, usually from a vein in the arm. From the subject's and family's perspective, the trips are time-consuming and expensive, testing is expensive, and the blood draws often lead to bruising and arm pain from repeated pokes.

Exclusion Criteria:

- Diagnosis of severe chronic neutropenia and negative results for the ELANE mutation
- Less than 5 years of age
- No internet access
- No Cell phone or smart phone that cannot download / install applications
