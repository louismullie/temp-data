## Question

Colchicine for acute cholangitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether colchicine has any role in the management of acute cholangitis and how that aligns with current evidence and guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what acute cholangitis is and what the accepted standard-of-care entails. Then, I should verify whether any guideline or trial supports colchicine in this setting. Next, I will compare chronic cholangiopathies (PBC, PSC) where colchicine has been studied with acute infectious cholangitis to avoid false extrapolation. After that, I should review safety and drug–drug interaction concerns that would be particularly relevant in septic or hepatobiliary disease. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable conclusion and sanity-check it against the references to ensure alignment with best practice [^111RLMUX] [^113KsLob].

> Let me first confirm the definition and standard management of acute cholangitis, so I don't jump to conclusions. Acute cholangitis is a bacterial infection supervening on biliary obstruction; the pillars of therapy are prompt broad-spectrum antimicrobials and urgent biliary decompression, typically by ERCP, with timing driven by severity and source control needs, not anti-inflammatory adjuncts like colchicine [^111RLMUX] [^114nkbWD] [^113KsLob].

> Wait, let me verify whether any reputable guideline mentions colchicine for acute cholangitis. I should double-check WSES guidance, ASGE and EASL gallstone/cholangitis recommendations, and high-level reviews. I see consistent emphasis on antibiotics and biliary drainage, and I find no recommendation or even mention of colchicine for acute cholangitis in these sources, which strongly argues against a role for colchicine in this acute septic indication [^111RLMUX] [^115kboQi] [^113KsLob].

> Hold on, I should be careful not to conflate chronic cholangiopathies with acute cholangitis. Colchicine has been discussed in primary biliary cholangitis and historically in PSC, but those are chronic immune-mediated diseases and not acute biliary sepsis; moreover, high-quality evidence has not supported colchicine's benefit even in PBC, and PSC guidelines do not recommend it for classic PSC, which further reduces any rationale for use in acute cholangitis [^115Gcfv2] [^114o5NQ8].

> Let me consider mechanistic plausibility next, and I should confirm the pharmacology. Colchicine's action is anti-inflammatory via microtubule inhibition and modulation of inflammasome/neutrophil function, but it is not antibacterial and does not relieve obstruction; in an acute biliary sepsis syndrome where bacterial load and obstructive source control drive outcomes, colchicine would not address the pathophysiology, so a benefit signal would be biologically unlikely in this setting [^115MKeNt] [^115bfKew] [^113KsLob].

> I need to check safety issues that could be particularly relevant in acutely ill hepatobiliary patients. Colchicine has a narrow therapeutic index, depends on CYP3A4 and P-gp pathways, is not removed by hemodialysis, and carries explicit label warnings to avoid use in hepatic impairment when combined with P-gp or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors; importantly, macrolides like clarithromycin can precipitate life-threatening colchicine toxicity, which is a real concern in hospitalized patients who may receive interacting antibiotics or have organ dysfunction [^113AjjUZ] [^114jwxgn] [^112khWRa].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought biliary obstruction might directly impair colchicine clearance because enterohepatic/biliary excretion is postulated, which could increase exposure; but I should be cautious here because while biliary excretion and enterohepatic recirculation are described, the magnitude of effect from obstruction per se is not well-quantified in humans, so I should frame this as a plausible, not proven, risk that adds to the overall toxicity concern in hepatobiliary sepsis with potential hepatic dysfunction [^114jwxgn].

> Next, I should review whether any adjacent guideline could be misread to imply an anti-inflammatory role in biliary disease. EASL gallstone guidance supports NSAIDs for biliary colic and early cholecystectomy timing in certain scenarios, but this pertains to colic or peri-choledocholithiasis pathways and still does not introduce colchicine for cholangitis, reinforcing that anti-inflammatory agents are not substitutes for antibiotics and drainage in acute cholangitis [^117RBcqC] [^114rD2gp] [^115kboQi].

> But wait, what if a patient is already on colchicine for gout or FMF when they present with cholangitis; I should consider that. Let me reconsider drug–drug interactions and organ dysfunction risks: in the acute setting, concomitant CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors, sepsis-related renal or hepatic dysfunction, and the inability to dialyze colchicine make continued colchicine potentially hazardous; a risk–benefit reassessment with temporary interruption is prudent, particularly if interacting agents like clarithromycin are used or if hepatic impairment is present [^113AjjUZ] [^114jwxgn] [^112khWRa].

> I will now synthesize the conclusion and double-check it against the core references. There is no evidence or guideline support for colchicine in acute cholangitis; standard-of-care remains prompt antimicrobial therapy with coverage for biliary flora and urgent biliary decompression tailored to severity; colchicine offers no antimicrobial or source-control benefit and introduces meaningful toxicity risks in hepatobiliary sepsis, especially with common inpatient drug interactions and organ dysfunction, so it should not be used for this indication [^111RLMUX] [^113KsLob] [^115kboQi].

Colchicine is **not recommended for acute cholangitis** because it does not address the underlying infection or biliary obstruction [^113KsLob] and is not included in any clinical guidelines [^111RLMUX]. The standard of care is **prompt antibiotics and urgent biliary drainage** [^111RLMUX]; colchicine's anti-inflammatory effects are irrelevant to the pathophysiology of acute cholangitis, and its use risks serious toxicity [^113AjjUZ], especially in hepatic or renal impairment [^113AjjUZ]. There is no evidence supporting colchicine for acute cholangitis, and its use should be avoided.

---

## Pathophysiology of acute cholangitis

Acute cholangitis is a **bacterial infection of the biliary tree**, typically due to obstruction from gallstones, strictures, or tumors. Obstruction allows bacterial overgrowth and retrograde migration of enteric bacteria, leading to inflammation and sepsis [^113KsLob]. The classic presentation is Charcot's triad — fever, jaundice, and right upper quadrant pain — with potential progression to sepsis, shock, and multiorgan failure [^1127GnzZ].

---

## Current standard of care for acute cholangitis

The **standard of care** includes:

- **Antibiotic therapy**: Prompt broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria [^111RLMUX] [^114nkbWD].

- **Biliary drainage**: Urgent biliary decompression, typically via ERCP, to relieve obstruction and prevent sepsis [^111RLMUX].

- **Supportive care**: Fluid resuscitation, hemodynamic support, and monitoring for complications.

---

## Colchicine: pharmacological properties and clinical uses

Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory alkaloid that inhibits microtubule polymerization, reducing neutrophil migration and cytokine release [^115MKeNt]. It is used primarily for gout, familial Mediterranean fever, and pericarditis [^115bfKew]; however, it has a **narrow therapeutic index** and significant toxicity risk [^113AjjUZ], particularly in hepatic or renal impairment [^112NixMc].

---

## Evidence regarding colchicine in acute cholangitis

There is **no evidence supporting colchicine** for acute cholangitis — no clinical trials, case reports, or guidelines support its use. Because it does not address the infection or obstruction central to the disease, it is not appropriate [^113KsLob].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of colchicine in acute cholangitis

Colchicine carries **significant risks**, particularly in hepatic or renal impairment:

- **Gastrointestinal toxicity**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are common.

- **Myopathy and neuropathy**: Risk increases with renal or hepatic impairment.

- **Bone marrow suppression**: Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and aplastic anemia.

- **Multiorgan failure**: Potentially fatal in overdose or impaired clearance [^115XPR6W].

- **Drug interactions**: CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin) [^112khWRa] can cause life-threatening toxicity [^113AjjUZ].

Given these risks, colchicine is **contraindicated in hepatic or renal impairment**, which is common in acute cholangitis.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

No **guidelines** or expert recommendations support colchicine for acute cholangitis [^111RLMUX]. The **standard of care** remains antibiotics and biliary drainage; colchicine has no role.

---

## Comparison with standard treatments

| **Aspect** | **Antibiotics** | **Biliary drainage** | **Colchicine** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | Treat infection | Relieve obstruction | Anti-inflammatory |
| Evidence | Strong | Strong | None |
| Guideline support | Yes | Yes | No |
| Risks | Minimal | Minimal | Significant |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Colchicine is **not recommended for acute cholangitis** because it does not treat the infection or obstruction and carries a significant risk of toxicity [^113AjjUZ], especially in hepatic or renal impairment [^112NixMc]. The **standard of care** is **antibiotics and urgent biliary drainage** [^111RLMUX]; therefore, colchicine should be avoided.

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^111RLMUX]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). High credibility.

Acute cholangitis is an infectious disease characterized by acute inflammation and infection in the bile ducts. This results from a combination of biliary obstruction and bacterial growth in bile. Bacteria enter the biliary system either by ascending from the intestine or via the portal venous system. The most common cause of cholangitis is choledocholithiasis.

The key elements of therapy in acute cholangitis are adequate antimicrobial treatment to avoid or manage septic complications and biliary decompression to restore biliary drainage in case of obstruction. The clinical presentation varies, making initial risk stratification important to guide further management. In severe cholangitis, an early interventional approach is absolutely essential for survival.

- **Type and timing of biliary drainage**: This should be based on the severity of the clinical presentation and the availability and feasibility of drainage techniques such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), and open surgical drainage.

ERCP plays a central role in managing biliary obstruction in patients with acute cholangitis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the treatment of choice for biliary decompression in patients with moderate/severe acute cholangitis (Recommendation 1A).

A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to compare endoscopic and open drainage in 82 patients with severe acute cholangitis with hypotension and disturbed consciousness. The trial demonstrated that the morbidity and…

### Liver biopsy in primary biliary cholangitis: Is sinusoidal fibrosis the missing key [^111Fs3SB]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Low credibility.

The role of liver biopsy in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is controversial, as is the optimal method of histological assessment. We compared the Ludwig and Ishak systems and three components of the Japanese (Nakanuma) staging system to evaluate their clinical and biochemical correlations and prognostic value.

We reviewed biopsies from 106 patients with PBC, derived from a previous trial of colchicine therapy with 24–34 years' follow-up, following which five clinical outcomes were evaluated: hepatic decompensation, cholestatic PBC death/liver transplant, portal hypertensive PBC death, all PBC deaths, and overall survival.

Ludwig and Ishak stages correlated well with prognostically significant parameters, including serum bilirubin, Mayo Score, and Child Score. Serum aspartate aminotransferase correlated with interface hepatitis (IFH), and alkaline phosphatase with orcein deposition, bile duct (BD) loss, and cholestasis. Ludwig correlated with all five clinical outcomes, while Ishak stage was only significantly correlated with two. Sinusoidal fibrosis, orcein deposition, BD loss, and cholestasis all predicted hepatic death/transplant. After correction for Mayo Score, the only histological parameters predictive of clinical outcomes were IFH (associated with two) and sinusoidal fibrosis (associated with all five).

Liver biopsy is required in the diagnosis of around 20% of patients with PBC. The Ludwig system is of more prognostic value than both Ishak and any of the three individual components of the Nakanuma staging system.

### Current update on primary and secondary sclerosing cholangitis [^112dDTh3]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Sclerosing cholangitis can be idiopathic (primary) or secondary to an identifiable cause. Irrespective of cause, sclerosing cholangitis usually progresses to end-stage liver disease and warrants orthotopic liver transplantation. Recent studies provide new insights into the etiopathogenesis, natural history, diagnosis, and management of these different entities.

### Probenecid and colchicine [^1151Eo1h]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016). High credibility.

- **Contraindications**: Hypersensitivity to this product or to probenecid or colchicine. Probenecid and colchicine tablets are contraindicated in children under 2 years of age. They are not recommended for persons with known blood dyscrasias or uric acid kidney stones. Therapy with probenecid and colchicine should not be started until an acute gouty attack has subsided.

- **Pregnancy**: Probenecid crosses the placental barrier and appears in cord blood. Colchicine can arrest cell division in animals and plants. In certain species of animals under specific conditions, colchicine has produced teratogenic effects; the possibility of such effects in humans has also been reported. Due to the colchicine component, probenecid and colchicine is contraindicated in pregnant patients. The use of any drug in women of childbearing potential requires weighing the anticipated benefit against the possible hazards.

### Colchicine: The good, the BAD, the ugly and how to minimize the risks [^113b16TH]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

The management of colchicine poisoning is currently limited to supportive care, as there are no specific or effective treatments available. It is crucial for anyone with a known or suspected colchicine overdose to be admitted for observation for the first 24 hours post-ingestion. If no symptoms or signs develop within this period, they are unlikely to occur. Early after ingestion, activated charcoal or gastric lavage may be useful to prevent further gastrointestinal absorption, though the presence of vomiting can complicate these interventions.

Several mechanisms have been explored in an effort to remove excess colchicine from the body. However, treatment with haemodialysis and plasma exchange is complicated by colchicine's short half-life and its ability to bind to tissues. Plasma exchange is based on the rationale that colchicine is approximately 40–50% protein-bound at therapeutic doses. The data on its benefit are conflicting; while a case report of plasma exchange showed removal of only 0.01% of the ingested dose — an amount unlikely to influence clinical outcomes — other reports have suggested potential benefits. Haemodialysis is indicated to support significant renal impairment rather than as a mechanism for the removal of colchicine.

Several animal models have demonstrated that colchicine-specific antigen-binding fragments can reverse the effects of colchicine. Treatment of colchicine poisoning with colchicine-specific fragment antigen-binding (Fab) has been reported. In one case, a colchicine Fab infusion led to a dramatic increase in plasma colchicine concentrations.

### Primary sclerosing cholangitis: Diagnosis, prognosis, and management [^1168ET55]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the liver of unclear etiology characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis of bile ducts. It primarily affects middle-aged men and is associated with four-fold increased mortality compared to an age- and sex-matched population. Progressive biliary and hepatic damage results in portal hypertension and hepatic failure in a significant majority of patients over a 10- to 15-year period from the initial diagnosis. In addition, PSC confers a markedly increased risk of hepatobiliary cancer, including cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer, compared to the general population; cancer is the leading cause of mortality in patients with PSC. It is associated with inflammatory bowel disease in 70% of patients and increases the risk of colorectal cancer almost ten-fold. Despite significant research efforts in this field, the pathogenic mechanisms of PSC are still incompletely understood, although growing evidence supports the role of genetic and immunologic factors. There are no proven medical therapies that alter the natural course of the disease. Thus, liver transplantation is the only available treatment for patients with advanced PSC, with excellent outcomes in this population.

### An overview of recent treatment options for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^115fdq9U]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic hepatic dysfunction characterized by inflammatory and tissue-degenerative strictures of the biliary tree, leading to cirrhosis and cholangiocarcinoma. The pathophysiological mechanisms involve immune-mediated responses. Numerous treatment modalities targeting the inflammatory aspects have been suggested, but a consensus on the best treatment option is lacking. This study aims to review the most up-to-date treatment options for PSC.

### The role of colchicine in the management of COVID-19: A meta-analysis [^1124V5nU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The study demonstrates that colchicine administration leads to a notable reduction in mortality rates and a decrease in the necessity for oxygen therapy among individuals with COVID-19. Although its impact on broader outcomes like hospitalization rates, ICU admissions, and discharge rates remains minimal, there is a significant finding regarding its efficacy in lowering hospitalizations specifically among PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. This detailed understanding highlights the potential of colchicine as a therapeutic intervention for COVID-19, particularly in mitigating mortality risks and oxygen therapy requirements. These results offer valuable insights for clinicians, highlighting the need to consider colchicine as a viable treatment option for COVID-19 patients, while also emphasizing the necessity for further exploration to optimize its clinical utility.

### AGA clinical practice update on surveillance for hepatobiliary cancers in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis: Expert review [^11162UZh]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for primary sclerosing cholangitis, particularly in relation to malignancy surveillance such as cholangiocarcinoma, the AGA 2019 guidelines recommend considering surveillance for cholangiocarcinoma. This can be achieved with ultrasound, CT, or MRI, with or without serum CA 19–9, every 6–12 months. It is advised for all adult patients with PSC, regardless of disease stage, especially in the first year after diagnosis, and for patients with ulcerative colitis or those diagnosed at an older age.

### Pathogenesis of primary sclerosing cholangitis and advances in diagnosis and management [^1149imsa]. Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), first described in the mid-1850s, is a complex liver disease that presents heterogeneously. It is characterized by chronic cholestasis associated with chronic inflammation of the biliary epithelium, resulting in multifocal bile duct strictures that can affect the entire biliary tree. Chronic inflammation leads to fibrosis involving the hepatic parenchyma and biliary tree, potentially leading to cirrhosis and malignancy. The etiology of PSC is not fully understood, which partially explains the lack of effective medical therapy for this condition. However, there has been progress in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of PSC. Recognizing specific clinical subtypes and their patterns of progression could enhance the phenotypic and genotypic classification of the disease. This review explores our understanding of this enigmatic disorder and discusses important topics for future studies.

### Lodoco [^114jwxgn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In healthy volunteers (n = 12), 40 to 65% of 1 mg orally administered colchicine was recovered unchanged in urine. Enterohepatic recirculation and biliary excretion are also postulated to play a role in colchicine elimination. Following a single oral dose of 0.5 mg daily, the mean effective half-life in healthy volunteers is 19 hours. Colchicine is a substrate of P-gp. Notably, colchicine is not removed by hemodialysis.

- **Specific populations**:

	- **Geriatric patients**: The pharmacokinetic studies of Lodoco were not conducted in elderly patients. In a study aimed at comparing the relative bioavailability between 18 elderly subjects and 20 young subjects, the following pharmacokinetic parameter values (mean ± SD) were observed for colchicine in young and elderly subjects, respectively: AUC (ng·hr/mL) 22.4 ± 7.0 and 25.0 ± 6.9; Cmax (ng/mL) 2.6 ± 0.7 and 2.6 ± 1.0; Tmax (h) 1.4 ± 0.4 and 1.3 ± 0.4; apparent elimination half-life (h) 24.9 ± 5.3 and 30.1 ± 10.8. No statistical difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters was found between the groups, and it was concluded that no dosing adjustments are required in elderly patients.

### British society of gastroenterology and UK-PSC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of primary sclerosing cholangitis [^117Ldn6q]. Gut (2019). High credibility.

These guidelines on the management of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) were commissioned by the British Society of Gastroenterology liver section. The guideline writing committee included medical representatives from hepatology and gastroenterology groups as well as patient representatives from PSC Support. The guidelines aim to support general physicians, gastroenterologists, and surgeons in managing adults with PSC or those presenting with similar cholangiopathies that may mimic PSC, such as IgG4 sclerosing cholangitis. It also serves as a reference for patients with PSC to help them understand their own management. The quality of evidence is presented using the AGREE II format.

Guidance is meant to be used as a reference rather than for rigid protocol-based care, as we understand that the management of patients often requires individual patient-centered considerations.

### Secondary sclerosing cholangitis [^115UnuGL]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). High credibility.

Secondary sclerosing cholangitis (SSC) is a chronic cholestatic biliary disease characterized by inflammation, obliterative fibrosis of the bile ducts, stricture formation, and the progressive destruction of the biliary tree, leading to biliary cirrhosis. SSC is thought to develop as a consequence of known injuries or secondary to pathological processes of the biliary tree. The most frequently described causes of SSC include longstanding biliary obstruction, surgical trauma to the bile duct, and ischemic injury to the biliary tree in liver allografts. SSC may also follow intra-arterial chemotherapy.

Sclerosing cholangitis in critically ill patients is a largely unrecognized new form of SSC and is associated with rapid progression to liver cirrhosis. The mechanisms leading to cholangiopathy in critically ill patients are widely unknown; however, the available clinical data indicate that ischemic injury to the intrahepatic biliary tree may be one of the earliest events in the development of this severe form of sclerosing cholangitis.

Therapeutic options for most forms of SSC are limited, and patients with SSC who do not undergo transplantation have significantly reduced survival compared with patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Sclerosing cholangitis in critically ill patients, in particular, is associated with rapid disease progression and poor outcomes.

### Primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis [^112EsdcY]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Cholestatic liver diseases encompass a broad spectrum of pathologies, with the core injury occurring at the level of cholangiocytes and progressing to hepatic fibrosis and liver dysfunction. Primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis are the most significant progressive cholangiopathies in adults. Although rare, they commonly evolve to liver failure and the need for liver transplantation.

Despite recent advances in the basic knowledge of these cholangiopathies, the pathogenesis remains elusive. Targeted treatments to prevent disease progression and preclude malignancy are not yet available. This review addresses the general clinical features of both diseases, analyzes their commonalities and differences, and provides a state-of-the-art overview of the currently available therapeutics.

### Colchicine and SARS-CoV-2: Management of the hyperinflammatory state [^116AMSo7]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The global COVID-19 pandemic is currently underway. In December 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) licensed the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Therapeutic management of COVID-19 positive patients should primarily aim to avoid severe complications and organ injury caused by generalized inflammation, resulting from a cytokine storm in the most severe stages of viral infection. Knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 suggests a central role for exaggerated activation of the innate immune system as an important contributor to adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Several studies have shown that blocking the cytokine storm or acting early to prevent it can be effective; studies are underway to evaluate agents that may reduce this hyperinflammatory state.

The search for effective management strategies for COVID-19 continues to evolve. Colchicine, one of the oldest anti-inflammatory therapies, targets multiple factors associated with excessive COVID-19 inflammation. It is easily administered, generally well tolerated, and inexpensive. This article presents the scientific and molecular rationale for using colchicine as monotherapy or in combination at various stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection to modulate and control the inflammatory state. Low-dose colchicine may be considered safe and effective for treating and preventing cytokine storms in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly as an adjunctive remedy to other therapeutic agents. Well-organized clinical studies are needed to further assess these potential benefits.

### Colchicine concentrations and relationship with colchicine efficacy and adverse events: Post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis [^116iEyZ6]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Of interest, we have shown that both trough and peak colchicine concentrations are higher in individuals receiving a statin. The interaction between colchicine and statins is well-recognized, as both are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein. Approximately 5% of colchicine is metabolized by CYP3A4 into inactive metabolites, with the majority excreted via the liver and kidneys mediated by P-glycoprotein.

Simvastatin and atorvastatin are substrates of the CYP3A4 enzyme and P-glycoprotein, making them susceptible to interactions with colchicine, resulting in increased colchicine concentrations. In comparison, pravastatin and rosuvastatin are not substrates of CYP enzymes; hence the concomitant use of CYP inhibitors or inducers, such as colchicine, does not affect them. Our finding that colchicine concentrations are higher in those receiving a statin is, therefore, not unexpected.

- **Clinical significance**: Of more importance to patients and healthcare providers is whether there are clinically meaningful adverse events associated with the combination of colchicine and a statin. Both colchicine and statins can cause myopathy. There are four statin-associated myopathy clinical phenotypes: rhabdomyolysis, myalgia or mild hyperCKemia (defined as less than five times the upper limit normal), self-limited toxic statin myopathy, and myositis, which is typically an immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy with anti–3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase antibodies.

The number of participants in our study was too small to undertake reliable analysis of those taking a statin.

### Colchicine: the good, the BAD, the ugly and how to minimize the risks [^117PsGAs]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Clinical uses of colchicine and dosing**: The indications and dosing of colchicine, both established and emerging, are discussed, and adjustments are recommended for individuals with renal impairment or those taking medications known to interact with colchicine. Lower doses are advised in these cases.

Colchicine has ample evidence supporting its effectiveness in managing gout. It is particularly effective in preventing gout flares when starting urate-lowering therapy and for treating gout flares. The older dosing regimen for treating gout flares (1.2 mg initially, followed by 0.6 mg hourly until the flare resolves or diarrhea occurs) is no longer recommended due to high rates of gastrointestinal toxicity. Evidence suggests lower doses are effective without these associated gastrointestinal effects.

In rheumatology practice, colchicine is used to treat CPP deposition disease, especially for preventing and treating acute CPP crystal arthritis. It's also utilized in managing Behçet's syndrome, FMF, and other systemic autoinflammatory syndromes. While colchicine has been used in the treatment of acute pericarditis, its benefits have recently been observed in other cardiovascular diseases, including postoperative atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. The use of colchicine in cardiovascular disease has been reviewed by Deftereos et al.

More sophisticated risk scores designed to predict prognosis in patients with PBC have been developed. In particular, recent approaches to survival analysis have addressed whether simple assessments of biochemical response to treatment, especially with UDCA, may be clinically useful and whether variability in such response may underpin the heterogeneity of earlier treatment and outcome studies. Stratification by biochemistry has now been widely reproduced across cohorts and is recommended for all patients after one year of UDCA therapy. This stratification aims to identify high-risk patients who are predicted to have reduced survival and are considered likely to benefit from new disease-modifying therapy trials.

In addition to stratification by biochemistry, large-scale studies have confirmed the clinical observations that age at presentation and gender are also stratifiers of risk. It is currently unclear which risk/response criteria are optimal for use in clinical practice. At present, the significance of meeting response criteria prior to therapy and its impact on the use of UDCA therapy remains unclear. Conversely, effectively classifying low risk may help reduce secondary care follow-up for many. To that effect, more dynamic linear risk models have been developed, but more information is needed on how to implement these clinically.

### Colchicine's role in cardiovascular disease management [^114rED5G]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2024). High credibility.

Colchicine — an anti-inflammatory alkaloid — has assumed an important role in the management of cardiovascular inflammation approximately 3,500 years after its first medicinal use in ancient Egypt. Primarily used in high doses for the treatment of acute gout flares during the 20th century, research in the early 21st century demonstrated that low-dose colchicine effectively treats acute gout attacks, lowers the risk of recurrent pericarditis, and can contribute to secondary prevention of major adverse cardiovascular events.

As the first Food and Drug Administration-approved targeted anti-inflammatory cardiovascular therapy, colchicine currently has a unique role in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The safe use of colchicine requires careful monitoring for drug-drug interactions, changes in kidney and liver function, and counseling regarding gastrointestinal upset. Future research should elucidate the mechanisms of anti-inflammatory effects of colchicine relevant to atherosclerosis, the potential role of colchicine in primary prevention, its use in other cardiometabolic conditions, colchicine's safety in cardiovascular patients, and opportunities for individualizing colchicine therapy using clinical and molecular diagnostics.

### The role of colchicine in the management of COVID-19: A meta-analysis [^116KxRbW]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly affected global healthcare and economic systems and was caused by coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The clinical presentation of the disease ranges from a flu-like illness to severe pneumonia and death. As of September 2022, the cumulative number of cases exceeded 600 million worldwide, with more than 6 million deaths. Colchicine is an alkaloid drug used in many autoinflammatory conditions such as gout, familial Mediterranean fever, and Behçet's syndrome. It inhibits the production of superoxide and the release of interleukins that stimulate the inflammatory cascade. Colchicine also decreases the differentiation of myofibroblasts and the release of fibrotic mediators including transforming growth factor (TGF-β1), which are related to fibrosis. Moreover, colchicine has been used to treat viral myocarditis caused by CMV or EBV, interstitial pneumonia, and pericarditis resulting from influenza B infection. Additionally, colchicine is considered safe and affordable with broad availability.

- **Objective**: The aim of the study was to assess the evidence of colchicine effectiveness in COVID-19 treatment.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted until May 2022, yielding 814 articles after ranking the articles according to authors and year of publication. Only 8 clinical trials and cohort studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included for further data collection, analysis, and reporting.

### Colchicine concentrations and relationship with colchicine efficacy and adverse events: Post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis [^113HYAiq]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Our objective was to examine the relationship between colchicine plasma concentrations and clinical and demographic factors and to determine the relationship between colchicine concentrations, colchicine efficacy, and colchicine‐specific adverse events.

Post hoc analyses were undertaken using data from a 12‐month randomized controlled trial involving 200 people with gout that compared low‐dose colchicine to placebo for the first six months while starting allopurinol, with a further six‐month follow‐up. Steady‐state colchicine plasma concentrations were measured 30 to 80 minutes post-dose (assumed peak) and just before the dose (trough) at month three, and creatine kinase (CK) levels were measured at months zero, three, and six. Self‐reported gout flares, adverse events, and serious adverse events were collected monthly.

Peak and trough colchicine concentrations were available for 79 participants in the colchicine arm. Multivariable analysis showed that those taking a statin and non‐Māori and non‐Pacific ethnicity were independently associated with higher trough concentrations, and age older than 60 years was independently associated with higher peak concentrations. Trough and peak colchicine concentrations were significantly higher in those who had any adverse event between months four and six. However, there was no association between colchicine concentrations and colchicine‐specific adverse events (gastrointestinal and muscle) or with CK changes in the colchicine‐treated patients.

### Colchicine or methotrexate, with ursodiol, are effective after 20 years in a subset of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis [^1148L6Ev]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

The combination of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), colchicine, and methotrexate (MTX) is an effective therapy for a subset of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) who do not respond to UDCA. However, the durability of the response is unclear. We investigated whether the response to combination therapy was durable.

- **Methods**: We followed, for 10 additional years (range 9–13 years), 29 patients with PBC who had been treated with the combination of UDCA and MTX or UDCA and colchicine in a randomized controlled trial that began in 1988 and lasted 10 years.

- **Results**: Of the 11 patients given MTX plus UDCA, 9 were still alive and well, whereas 2 died from causes unrelated to liver disease at the ages of 79 and 70. Of the 18 patients given the combination of colchicine and UDCA, 12 were alive and well 20 years after the trial ended. Three had progressive liver disease; 2 of these had liver transplantation and 1 died of pneumonia. Three died of unrelated causes at the ages of 73, 76, and 76 years, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Treatment with the combination of UDCA and MTX or UDCA and colchicine led to sustained clinical remission in a subset of patients with PBC. The response to the combination of UDCA and MTX appeared to be more durable than to UDCA and colchicine.

### The role of colchicine in the management of COVID-19: A meta-analysis [^111gx6bd]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of colchicine on mortality was evaluated through eight pooled studies, which demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality rates among COVID-19 patients receiving colchicine compared to those receiving placebo or standard care. These findings align with a recent systematic review that reported a similar decrease in all-cause mortality across three observational studies. Additionally, a recently published meta-analysis indicated a reduction in mortality among COVID-19 patients treated with colchicine. This analysis incorporated data from four randomized controlled trials and five observational studies, involving a total of 5522 patients.

Conversely, studies by Mehta et al. and Toro-Huamanchumo et al. documented no effect of colchicine on mortality rates among COVID-19 patients.

The heterogeneity test among the pooled studies exhibited significant differences, indicating interstudy variation. However, pooling these heterogeneous studies provided valuable information. Our results suggest that colchicine may have a beneficial effect in reducing mortality among COVID-19 patients, particularly when administered during the early stages of the disease. This can be attributed to the anti-inflammatory role of colchicine, which interacts with microtubules involved in cellular division, migration, and adhesion. This interaction robustly influences the immune system response and reduces the inflammatory reaction. Additionally, colchicine decreases…

### Management of primary sclerosing cholangitis [^116Qodam]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Guidelines for clinical practice are intended to indicate preferred approaches to medical problems as established by scientifically valid research. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are preferable; however, reports and expert review articles are also utilized in a thorough review of the literature conducted through the National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE. When only data that will not withstand objective scrutiny are available, a recommendation is identified as a consensus of experts. Guidelines are applicable to all physicians who address the subject, without regard to specialty training or interests, and are intended to indicate the preferable but not necessarily the only acceptable approach to a specific problem.

Guidelines are intended to be flexible and must be distinguished from standards of care that are inflexible and rarely violated. Given the wide range of specifics in any healthcare problem, the physician must always choose the course best suited to the individual patient and the variables in existence at the moment of decision. Guidelines are developed under the auspices of the American College of Gastroenterology and its Practice Parameters Committee and approved by the Board of Trustees. Each has been intensely reviewed and revised by the Committee, other experts in the field, physicians who will use them, and specialists in the science of decision analysis. The recommendations of each guideline are therefore considered valid at the time of their production based on the data available.

### Recent advances in the management of primary sclerosing cholangitis [^114Rn5eV]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by fibroinflammatory damage to the biliary tree, typically in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease, with an increased risk of liver failure and cholangiocarcinoma. A complex pathophysiology, heterogeneity in clinical features, and the rare nature of the disease have contributed to the lack of effective therapy at the time of writing. However, recent innovations in the characterization and prognostication of patients with PSC, in addition to new tools for medical management and emerging pharmacologic agents, give rise to the potential for meaningful progress in the next several years. This review summarizes concepts in PSC and highlights particular areas in need of further study.

The recommendations are based on the GRADE classification system (Strong/Weak; quality of evidence: High/Moderate/Low/Very low).

- **Evidence levels**: GRADE classifies recommendations as strong or weak. The strength of a recommendation is determined by several factors: the balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies; quality of evidence; variability in values and preferences; and resource use. The larger the difference between the desirable and undesirable effects, the greater the likelihood of a strong recommendation. Conversely, the narrower the gradient, the higher the likelihood that a weak recommendation is warranted. Higher quality of evidence increases the likelihood of a strong recommendation. Greater variation or uncertainty in values and preferences increases the likelihood of a weak recommendation. The higher the costs of an intervention, meaning greater resource consumption, the less likely a strong recommendation will be made.

Strong recommendations suggest that most informed patients would choose the recommended management, allowing clinicians to structure their interactions with patients accordingly. In contrast, weak recommendations indicate that patient choices will vary based on their values and preferences, requiring clinicians to ensure that patient care aligns with these values and preferences.

### Confirmed fatal colchicine poisoning in an adolescent with blood and bile concentrations-implications for GI decontamination [^115XPR6W]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2023). Low credibility.

Colchicine is commonly used to treat diseases such as acute gouty arthritis. However, it has a very narrow therapeutic index, and ingestions of more than 0.5 mg/kg can be deadly. We report a fatal acute colchicine overdose in an adolescent. Blood and postmortem bile colchicine concentrations were obtained to better understand the degree of enterohepatic circulation of colchicine.

- **Case report**: A 13-year-old boy presented to the emergency department after acute colchicine poisoning. A single dose of activated charcoal was administered early; however, no other doses were attempted. Despite aggressive interventions such as exchange transfusion and veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO), the patient died 8 days later. Postmortem histology was notable for centrilobular necrosis of the liver and a cardiac septal microinfarct. The patient's blood colchicine concentration on hospital days 1 (approximately 30 hours post-ingestion), 5, and 7 was 12 ng/mL, 11 ng/mL, and 9.5 ng/mL, respectively. A postmortem bile concentration obtained during autopsy was 27 ng/mL.

- **Discussion**: Humans produce approximately 600 mL of bile daily. Assuming that activated charcoal would be able to adsorb 100% of biliary colchicine, using the bile concentration obtained above, only 0.0162 mg of colchicine per day would be able to be adsorbed and eliminated by activated charcoal in this patient.

- **Conclusion**: Despite supportive care, activated charcoal, VA-ECMO, and exchange transfusion, modern medicine may not be enough to prevent death in severely poisoned colchicine patients.

### Colchicine and the heart [^115bfKew]. European Heart Journal (2021). High credibility.

Colchicine is a unique, sophisticated anti-inflammatory agent that has been used for decades for the prevention of acute inflammatory flares in gout and familial Mediterranean fever. In recent years, clinical trials have demonstrated its potential in a range of cardiovascular (CV) conditions. Colchicine is avidly taken up by leukocytes, and its ability to bind to tubulin and interfere with microtubular function affects the expression of cytokines and interleukins, and the ability of neutrophils to marginate, ingress, aggregate, express superoxide, release neutrophil extracellular traps, and interact with platelets.

In patients with acute and recurrent pericarditis, clinical trials involving more than 1,600 patients have consistently shown that colchicine halves the risk of recurrence [relative risk (RR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42–0.60]. In patients with acute and chronic coronary syndromes, multicenter randomized controlled trials in over 11,000 patients followed for up to 5 years demonstrated that colchicine may reduce the risk of CV death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and ischemia-driven revascularization by more than 30% (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49–0.81).

Use of colchicine at doses of 0.5–1.0 mg daily in CV trials has proved safe. Early gastrointestinal intolerance limits its use in approximately 10% of patients; however, about 90% of patients tolerate it well over the long term. Despite isolated case reports, clinically relevant drug interactions with moderate to strong CYP3A4 inhibitors/competitors or P-glycoprotein inhibitors/competitors are rare if this dosage of colchicine is used in the absence of contraindications.

### Colchicine for pericarditis [^111LbuzD]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Colchicine is one of the oldest available drugs. It has been used for centuries to treat and prevent gouty attacks and more recently to prevent attacks of autoinflammatory diseases such as familial Mediterranean fever. Its main mechanism of action is the capability to block the polymerization of tubulin, thus affecting the function of microtubules. The capability to concentrate in white blood cells, especially granulocytes, and interfere with their function explains its potential as an anti-inflammatory drug.

Colchicine (0.5 mg twice daily for patients over 70 kg or once daily for those weighing less), in addition to standard anti-inflammatory therapy, in either acute or recurrent pericarditis, may hasten the response to anti-inflammatory therapy and reduce the subsequent risk of recurrences. After exclusion of contraindications and appropriate dose adjustment, the drug is safe and well-tolerated. The more common side effect is gastrointestinal intolerance, occurring in 5–10% of cases, and may be controlled by dose reduction or temporary discontinuation.

### Colcrys [^115MKeNt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Colcrys exerts its beneficial effect in patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) through a mechanism that has not been fully elucidated. However, evidence suggests that colchicine may interfere with the intracellular assembly of the inflammasome complex present in neutrophils and monocytes, which mediates the activation of interleukin-1β. Additionally, colchicine disrupts cytoskeletal functions by inhibiting β-tubulin polymerization into microtubules, consequently preventing the activation, degranulation, and migration of neutrophils thought to mediate some gout symptoms.

In healthy adults, Colcrys is absorbed when given orally, reaching a mean Cmax of 2.5 ng/mL (range 1.1 to 4.4 ng/mL) within one to two hours (range 0.5 to 3 hours) following a single dose administered under fasting conditions. Following oral administration of Colcrys as 1.8 mg of colchicine over one hour to healthy, young adults under fasting conditions, colchicine appears to be readily absorbed, reaching mean maximum plasma concentrations of 6.2 ng/mL at a median time of 1.81 hours (range 1.0 to 2.5 hours). Following the nonrecommended high-dose regimen (4.8 mg over six hours), mean maximal plasma concentrations were 6.8 ng/mL at a median of 4.47 hours (range 3.1 to 7.5 hours).

After ten days on a regimen of 0.6 mg twice daily, peak concentrations range from 3.1 to 3.6 ng/mL (range 1.6 to 6.0 ng/mL), occurring 1.3 to 1.4 hours post-dose (range 0.5 to 3.0 hours).

### Impact of comorbidities on gout and hyperuricaemia: an update on prevalence and treatment options [^116xUkZR]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Comorbidities can imply contraindications for drugs usually prescribed for the management of acute flares in gout. Colchicine and NSAIDs should not be used for patients with renal failure, who are usually given intra-articular or systemic steroids. Furthermore, in cases of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, steroids can be poorly tolerated, especially when repeated courses are needed in patients with frequent flares.

Following the observation that interleukin 1 (IL-1) plays a major role in monosodium urate (MSU) crystal-triggered inflammation, IL-1 blockers have been proposed for the management of flares for patients with difficult-to-treat disease. Open studies of the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra support its off-label use for patients resistant to or with contraindications to NSAIDs, colchicine, and steroids. Canakimumab, a long-lasting antibody to IL-1β, has been approved by the European Medical Agency (but not the US Food and Drug Administration), following two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing it to intra-muscular triamcinolone acetonide.

The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) has recommended considering IL-1 blockers for the management of gout flares in patients with frequent flares and contraindications to NSAIDs, colchicine, and steroids (both oral and injectable). Infection is a contraindication.

According to the EULAR and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommendations, small doses of colchicine should be used during the first six months of urate-lowering therapy (ULD) to decrease the risk of ULD flares. Colchicine exposure has been found to be up to two-fold higher in individuals with impairments that increase drug retention.

### Pharmacological interventions for primary sclerosing cholangitis: An attempted network meta-analysis [^113GxxXj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic cholestatic liver disease associated with both hepatobiliary and colorectal malignancies, which can result in liver cirrhosis and its complications. The optimal pharmacological treatment for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis remains controversial.

- **Objectives**: To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different pharmacological interventions in people with primary sclerosing cholangitis by performing a network meta-analysis, and to generate rankings of available pharmacological interventions according to their safety and efficacy. Given that it was not possible to assess whether potential effect modifiers were similar across comparisons, we did not perform the network meta-analysis but instead used standard Cochrane methods. When trials begin to provide an adequate description of potential effect modifiers, we will attempt to conduct a network meta-analysis.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index - Expanded, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and randomized controlled trials registers until February 2017 to identify randomized clinical trials (RCT) on pharmacological interventions for primary sclerosing cholangitis.

- **Selection criteria**: We included only RCTs, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status, in which participants were given a diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis. We excluded trials that included previously liver-transplanted participants. We considered any of various pharmacological interventions compared.

### Prevpac [^112khWRa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

There have been post-marketing reports of colchicine toxicity with concomitant use of clarithromycin and colchicine, especially in the elderly, some of which occurred in patients with renal insufficiency. Deaths have been reported in some such patients (see precautions).

For information about warnings of other drugs that may be used in combination with amoxicillin or clarithromycin, refer to the warnings section of their package inserts.

Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clarithromycin and/or amoxicillin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

### The role of colchicine in the management of COVID-19: a meta-analysis [^112Qn3jj]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The efficacy of colchicine on the duration of COVID-19 illness was assessed in three clinical trials. Lopes et al. found that hospitalized COVID-19 patients who received colchicine had a shorter duration of illness until recovery compared to patients who received a placebo. This is similar to the result reported by a recent study, which may be attributed to the anti-inflammatory and immune modulatory roles of colchicine in the management of COVID-19. However, two clinical trials reported that colchicine did not affect the duration of COVID-19 illness, aligning with the results of a recently published study investigating the efficacy of colchicine on the duration of the COVID-19 clinical course.

- **The efficacy of colchicine on need for hospitalization**: Tardif et al. investigated the efficacy of colchicine among non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients versus a placebo and found that colchicine did not influence the need for hospitalization among non-hospitalized patients. A recent clinical trial assessing the effect of colchicine on the prognosis of non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed no significant effect of colchicine on the hospitalization rate.

- **The efficacy of colchicine on need for O2 therapy**: Lopes et al. assessed the efficacy of colchicine on the need for O2 therapy. The results demonstrated that colchicine use led to a significant decrease in the need for O2 therapy in patients with COVID-19.

### Colchicine concentrations and relationship with colchicine efficacy and adverse events: Post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis [^117VfbCj]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Low credibility.

Colchicine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with an oral bioavailability of approximately 50% on average. It is primarily eliminated through biliary excretion and feces. Colchicine is mainly transported into the gastrointestinal tract by the multidrug resistance transporter molecule P-glycoprotein. The enteric and hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), which catalyzes the demethylation of colchicine to inactive metabolites, also contributes to colchicine metabolism, along with a minor (10%–20%) contribution to elimination via the kidneys. Importantly, CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein are very frequently colocalized, such that many drugs mutually and robustly inhibit CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein. Colchicine is also subject to a range of drug interactions, particularly with CYP3A4 inhibitors, which can result in a doubling of colchicine plasma concentrations, and with P-glycoprotein inhibitors, which may quadruple colchicine concentrations.

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is the use of drug concentrations to guide therapy to improve drug efficacy and/or reduce toxicity. It has particular benefits for drugs with a narrow therapeutic range, in which the difference between clinically effective concentrations and concentrations associated with adverse events is small. Colchicine has a narrow therapeutic range, with many patients experiencing dose-dependent gastrointestinal toxicity. Plasma colchicine concentrations have been measured in some cases of fatal colchicine overdose, with levels ranging from 10 to 250 ng/mL (10–250 μg/L).

### Novel strategies and therapeutic options for the management of primary biliary cholangitis [^114saMLC]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune liver disease with a varied course of progression. It ranges from being completely asymptomatic to aggressive disease that leads to cirrhosis and may result in liver transplantation. Additionally, symptoms can be debilitating and significantly impact the quality of life. For decades, only one anti-cholestatic agent was available to target this disease, and it was effective in only about half of the patients, with little or no effect on symptoms. With an increased understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of PBC and potential drug treatment targets, pharmaceutical companies have shown greater interest in this rare disease. A large number of novel therapeutic molecules have been developed and are currently being evaluated. In this review article, all the novel molecules in use and in trials targeting cholestasis and symptoms in PBC are discussed.

### Colchicine-associated ring mitosis in liver biopsy and their clinical implications [^114LP6i9]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Colchicine is an alkaloid with antimitotic activity used to treat a variety of medical conditions. Colchicine toxicity can result in multiorgan failure and death. In recent years, the histopathologic features of colchicine toxicity in various organs — such as the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, salivary glands, muscle, and skin — have been described. However, the histopathologic manifestations of colchicine in the liver have not been reported.

We present the case of a 54-year-old man with transfusion-acquired chronic hepatitis C and longstanding gout managed with colchicine. A liver biopsy performed showed changes consistent with chronic hepatitis C, along with many scattered mitoses arrested in metaphase in the hepatocytes that have been referred to as "ring" mitoses. The liver biopsy was compared with the biopsy from 7 years ago, which appeared similar; however, ring mitoses were absent.

Ring mitoses have been associated with colchicine-mediated tissue injury in various other sites, and their presence is believed to represent colchicine-induced liver injury in this case.

### Colchicine: The good, the BAD, the ugly and how to minimize the risks [^116BLmAr]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Colchicine plays a significant role in managing various conditions, including gout, familial Mediterranean fever, amyloidosis, Behçet's syndrome, recurrent pericarditis, and calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease. The adverse effect profile of colchicine is well understood. However, due to its narrow therapeutic index, colchicine has been associated with overdose and fatalities. When ingested in toxic amounts, the mainstay of management is supportive care. Strategies to minimize the risk of colchicine poisoning can focus on three broad causes: unauthorized access, intentional overdose, and inappropriate dosing.

Culturally safe and appropriate education about storage and the correct use of colchicine is essential to minimize the risk of overdose.

### The role of colchicine in the management of COVID-19: A meta-analysis [^116izrCi]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

In this meta-analysis, the studies investigating the role of colchicine in the management of COVID-19 were reviewed. After a comprehensive search, eight studies were identified. These included two cohort studies: Brunetti et al. and Scarsi et al. The other studies consisted of four randomized controlled trials: Deftereos et al, the Recovery Collaborative Group, Lopes et al, and Tardif et al. Additionally, two non-randomized trials were included: Mareev et al. and Sandhu et al. The meta-analysis involved a total of 16,488 patients, with 8,146 in the treatment group receiving colchicine, and 8,342 in the control group who received either a placebo or standard treatment.

### Usefulness of interleukin-1 receptor antagonists in patients with recurrent pericarditis [^117Uka5S]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine remain the standard of care as the initial treatment of acute pericarditis. Corticosteroids and traditional immunosuppressive medications are often added if patients develop symptoms and remain medically refractory. There has been growing interest in the use of interleukin-1 receptor antagonists (IL-1RAs) in managing pericarditis, especially in medically refractory cases.

Anakinra-treatment for idiopathic pericarditis is a recent pilot trial showing the benefit of using the IL-1RA, anakinra, in recurrent pericarditis. Publications remain limited, and more outcomes trials are needed. This review focuses on the mechanism of action, clinical utility, and current and future studies that investigate the role of IL-1RAs in the management of recurrent pericarditis.

### The role of colchicine in the management of COVID-19: A meta-analysis [^114tiPmV]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has robustly affected global healthcare and economic systems and was caused by coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The clinical presentation of the disease ranges from a flu-like illness to severe pneumonia and death. As of September 2022, the cumulative number of cases exceeded 600 million worldwide, with more than 6 million deaths. Colchicine is an alkaloid drug used in many autoinflammatory conditions, such as gout, familial Mediterranean fever, and Behçet's syndrome. It inhibits the production of superoxide and the release of interleukins that stimulate the inflammatory cascade. Colchicine decreases myofibroblast differentiation and the release of fibrotic mediators, including transforming growth factor (TGF-β1), related to fibrosis. Moreover, colchicine has been used to treat viral myocarditis caused by CMV or EBV, interstitial pneumonia, and pericarditis resulting from influenza B infection. Additionally, colchicine is considered safe, affordable, and widely available.

- **Objective**: The aim of the study was to assess the evidence of colchicine's effectiveness in COVID-19 treatment.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted until May 2022, yielding 814 articles after ranking these according to authors and year of publication. Only 8 clinical trials and cohort studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included for further data collection, analysis, and reporting.

### British society of gastroenterology and UK-PSC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of primary sclerosing cholangitis [^116PXkuX]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

These guidelines on the management of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) were commissioned by the British Society of Gastroenterology liver section. The guideline writing committee included medical representatives from hepatology and gastroenterology groups, as well as patient representatives from PSC Support. The guidelines aim to support general physicians, gastroenterologists, and surgeons in managing adults with PSC or those presenting with similar cholangiopathies, which may mimic PSC, such as IgG4 sclerosing cholangitis. It also acts as a reference for patients with PSC to help them understand their own management.

The quality of evidence is presented using the AGREE II format. Guidance is meant to be used as a reference rather than for rigid protocol-based care, as it is understood that management of patients often requires individual patient-centered considerations.

### Colchicine for primary biliary cirrhosis: a Cochrane hepato-biliary group systematic review of randomized clinical trials [^115Gcfv2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Colchicine is used for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis due to its immunomodulatory and antifibrotic potential. However, the results from randomized clinical trials have been inconsistent. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effect of colchicine for primary biliary cirrhosis.

- **Methods**: We identified randomized clinical trials comparing colchicine with placebo or no intervention. We analyzed effects using fixed and random effects models and investigated heterogeneity through subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

- **Results**: We included 10 trials involving 631 patients, four of which were high-quality trials. No significant differences were detected between colchicine and placebo/no intervention regarding mortality (relative risk (RR), 1.21; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.71–2.06), mortality or liver transplantation (RR = 1.00; 95% CI, 0.67–1.49), liver complications, liver biochemical variables, liver histology, or adverse events. An extreme case analysis for mortality favoring colchicine did not show beneficial effects, whereas an analysis favoring placebo/no intervention demonstrated a detrimental effect of colchicine (RR = 2.28; 95% CI, 1.17–4.44). The number of patients without improvement of pruritus significantly decreased in the colchicine group (RR = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.65–0.87), although this estimate was based on only 156 patients from three trials.

- **Conclusions**: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of colchicine for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. We are unable to exclude a risk of bias due to the limited data available.

Immunosuppression and other treatments

Despite the presumed immune-mediated disease process in PSC, clinical experience of treating those with active colitis using steroids and other immunosuppressant agents has not demonstrated improvement in PSC disease activity or outcome. Small randomized trials have investigated the role of prednisolone, budesonide, colchicine, penicillamine, azathioprine, ciclosporin, methotrexate, mycophenolate, and anti-tumor necrosis factor monoclonal antibodies. There is no evidence that any of these drugs are effective, and therefore none can be recommended for the treatment of classic PSC. Nevertheless, some of these drugs may have a role in an overlap syndrome, since pediatric patients and those with additional features of AIH are more likely to respond to immunosuppressive treatments. A retrospective study in adults suggested a beneficial role of steroids in a subgroup with additional features of AIH. Those with good evidence of PSC and additional features of AIH should be treated similarly to those with classic AIH. The choice of the most appropriate systemic steroid therapy is not clear.

Steroids have been given to the subset of patients with PSC and a raised serum IgG4 (after exclusion of IgG4-SC). In a small study of 18 patients, steroids led to a fall in bilirubin in 9 out of 10 patients with raised bilirubin, and a significant fall in ALP, but steroid-related side effects and post-steroid relapse were common.

A review of small case series with limited evidence suggests modest improvement in liver biochemistry in patients treated with vancomycin.

### A score for predicting colchicine resistance at the time of diagnosis in familial Mediterranean fever: data from the TURPAID registry [^112iQ4EX]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common monogenic fever syndrome characterized by febrile attacks of polyserositis accompanied by elevated acute-phase inflammatory markers. Variants in the MEFV gene, which encodes for pyrin, are associated with FMF.

Colchicine has been the standard treatment for FMF over the last 50 years. It leads to the release of guanine nucleotide exchange factor H1 (GEF-H1), a RhoA activator, by binding to microtubules. RhoA inhibits the overactivated mutant pyrin in FMF. Although most FMF patients respond well to colchicine, resistance or intolerance to colchicine constitutes a problem in 5–10% of patients. The reason for colchicine resistance remains unknown. Anti-IL-1 drugs are currently used in the management of colchicine-resistant/intolerant FMF patients. Recently, an international consensus group defined colchicine resistance.

Several studies have analyzed the differences between colchicine-resistant and colchicine-responsive FMF patients. Features such as early symptom onset, greater attack frequency, longer attack duration, erysipelas-like erythema (ELE), myalgia/protracted febrile myalgia, arthritis, higher colchicine dose, high acute phase reactants, and homozygosity for exon 10 MEFV mutations have been associated with colchicine resistance so far. In one of these studies, the authors attempted to develop a predictive score for colchicine resistance in FMF patients; however, the number of patients was limited (n = 104). Early prediction of colchicine resistance during FMF diagnosis would help physicians set up a personal treatment plan.

Regarding the medical management for IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis, and more specifically concerning corticosteroids, EASL 2022 guidelines recommend initiating prednisone/prednisolone (0.5–0.6 mg/kg/day) as first-line therapy for untreated active IgG4-related cholangitis. Treatment response should be evaluated after 2–4 weeks before tapering prednisone/prednisolone by clinical, biochemical, and/or radiological criteria.

### Colchicine: The good, the BAD, the ugly and how to minimize the risks [^116JRtaM]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Colchicine is an effective medication for many conditions but has a narrow therapeutic index. Colchicine in overdose is frequently fatal, and there is no specific therapy other than supportive care. Appropriate and effective education about the storage and use of colchicine is essential to eliminate the risk of overdose.

### The role of colchicine in the management of COVID-19: A meta-analysis [^116jptPd]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The review focused on clinical trials and cohort studies investigating colchicine administration in COVID-19 patients versus standard treatment or placebo. Participants were adult patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or high-resolution CT chest scans with CO-RADS 4 or 5. All healthcare settings, including community/primary care, hospital outpatient, or long-stay institutions, were considered eligible.

- **Types of interventions**: Clinical trials and cohort studies were assessed where colchicine was administered to COVID-19 patients versus the standard treatment or placebo.

- **Types of outcome measures**: The outcomes considered included mortality, duration of COVID-19 illness until recovery, the need for hospitalization, O2 therapy, ICU admission, and artificial ventilation.

- **Inclusion criteria**:
	1. Cohort studies, randomized and non-randomized clinical trials conducted on adult human subjects.
	2. Studies with patients diagnosed with COVID-19 confirmed through positive RT-PCR and/or high-resolution CT chest scans with CO-RADS 4 or 5.
	3. Studies conducted in all healthcare settings (community/primary care, hospital outpatient, or long-stay institutional).
	4. Studies published in Arabic, English, French, or Spanish.

This methodological framework ensured the comprehensive inclusion of relevant studies and standardization in assessing colchicine's role in managing COVID-19.

### The British Society of Gastroenterology/UK-PBC primary biliary cholangitis treatment and management guidelines [^116sdUEj]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The histopathology of PBC classical staging systems for PBC divides the histological injury of PBC into four stages: florid duct lesions and portal inflammation without interface activity (stage 1); interface hepatitis, ductular proliferation, and periportal fibrosis (stage 2); bridging necrosis or bridging fibrosis (stage 3); and cirrhosis (stage 4). These systems are easy to apply and are quite reproducible. However, their practical utility is limited due to the uneven distribution of diagnostic histological lesions of PBC and different disease stages co-existing at any time. Furthermore, they incorporate features such as inflammation, which is more appropriately regarded as a manifestation of disease activity (histological 'grade') rather than disease progression (histological 'stage').

A more recent scoring system, described by Nakanuma and colleagues, sums up individual scores for fibrosis, bile duct loss, and severity of chronic cholestasis based on copper-associated protein deposition to assess disease stage. It provides a separate system for grading necroinflammatory activity based on cholangitic and hepatitic features. Similar to the classical staging systems, the Nakanuma staging system correlates well with clinical and laboratory features. Subsequent studies have suggested that the Nakanuma system is more useful than previously described staging systems in predicting adverse outcomes in patients with PBC and may also help in predicting treatment responses.

### Diagnosis and management of acute cholangitis [^1127GnzZ]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). High credibility.

Acute cholangitis is a disease that can be associated with an increase in serum ALT, altered mental status, and an increase in serum TBIL. Patients may experience nausea, acute cholecystitis, an increase in serum ALP, vomiting, and a decrease in WBC count. Other symptoms include an increase in serum CRP, chills, Reynolds' pentad, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and gallstones.

Additionally, there may be an increase in serum AST, Charcot's triad, fever, and an increase in serum gamma-glutamyltransferase. The condition can also be associated with acute pancreatitis, hypotension, shock, right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, an increase in WBC count, and jaundice.

Rates of response were similar for the recommended low-dose treatment group (38%) and the nonrecommended high-dose group (33%) but were higher compared to the placebo group (16%) as shown in Table 8.

Figure 1 shows the percentage of patients achieving varying degrees of improvement in pain from baseline at 24 hours.

The evidence for the efficacy of colchicine in patients with FMF is derived from the published literature. Three randomized, placebo-controlled studies were identified, which randomized a total of 48 adult patients diagnosed with FMF and reported similar efficacy endpoints as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria. One of the studies randomized 15 patients with FMF to a six-month crossover study during which five patients discontinued due to study noncompliance. The ten patients completing the study experienced five attacks over the course of 90 days while treated with colchicine compared to 59 attacks over the course of 90 days while treated with placebo. Similarly, the second study randomized 22 patients with FMF to a four-month crossover study during which nine patients discontinued due to lack of efficacy while receiving placebo or study noncompliance. The 13 patients completing the study experienced 18 attacks over the course of 60 days while treated with colchicine compared to 68 attacks over the course of 60 days while treated with placebo. The third study was discontinued after an interim analysis of six of the 11 patients enrolled had completed the study; results could not be confirmed.

### Primary sclerosing cholangitis - a comprehensive review [^1117aJ9p]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare disorder characterized by multifocal bile duct strictures and progressive liver disease. Inflammatory bowel disease is usually present, and there is a high risk of cholangiocarcinoma and colorectal cancer. Most patients ultimately require liver transplantation, after which disease recurrence may occur. With limited therapeutic options and a lack of proven surveillance strategies, patients currently have significant unmet needs.

In the present seminar, we provide a comprehensive review of the status of the field. We emphasize developments related to patient stratification and disease behavior and provide an overview of management options from a practical, patient-centered perspective. We survey advances made in the understanding of PSC pathogenesis and summarize the ongoing efforts to develop an effective therapy based on these insights.

### Medical treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis: What have we learned and where are we going [^1135WMGN]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

It has proven difficult to establish robust evidence for significant clinical benefits of medical treatment in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). For ursodeoxycholic acid, clinical practice guidelines only offer vague recommendations, leading to a situation of variable prescription rates depending on local reimbursement policies and physician preference. The difficulty in drug development in PSC is partly related to a poor understanding of critical disease processes, with a failure to identify relevant mechanisms of action of putative drugs. The variable disease course, both intra-individually and between individuals, and the lack of robust definitions of what success looks like for clinical trials in PSC have also contributed to the negative outcomes of trials performed.

In this review article, we discuss these uncertainties and challenges, building on key previous and ongoing clinical trials. Despite the lack of consensus for ideal phase II and phase III study designs, several trials for diverse compounds are currently ongoing, indicating a shift from therapeutic nihilism toward hope for people with PSC. While waiting for robust efficacy data for drugs currently being tested, the lack of effective interventions should not motivate the prescription of compounds to people with PSC based on low-quality evidence.

### Diagnosis and management of acute cholangitis [^113KsLob]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute cholangitis:

- **Definition**: Acute cholangitis is a bacterial infection that occurs in the setting of biliary obstruction, characterized by fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of acute cholangitis involves a blockage in the bile ducts, often due to choledocholithiasis or strictures. This blockage allows for the retrograde migration of bacteria from the intestine into the biliary system, leading to bacterial overgrowth and subsequent immune response, which results in inflammation and infection of the bile ducts.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of acute cholangitis in the US is estimated at 3,000 per 100,000 person-years.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with acute cholangitis often present with the Charcot triad of fever, jaundice, and RUQ pain. In severe cases, patients may also exhibit signs of sepsis, such as hypotension and altered mental status.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis can vary and is influenced by factors such as disease severity, the patient's overall health, and the timeliness and effectiveness of treatment. Certain laboratory values, such as a WBC count > 20,000 cells/mcL and a TBIL level > 10 mg/dL, have been identified as independent prognostic factors for adverse outcomes.
