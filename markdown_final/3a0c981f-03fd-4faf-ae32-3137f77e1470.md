## Question

What is post laminator syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about post-laminectomy syndrome, specifically its definition, pathophysiology, prevalence, diagnostic approach, and evidence-based treatment options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative definitions and nomenclature. Then, I should verify the core pathophysiological mechanisms. Next, I will review epidemiology and risk factors. After that, I need to check the diagnostic framework and imaging considerations. Finally, I will examine the treatment hierarchy, including interventional and neuromodulation options, and close with a concise synthesis and caveats about evidence quality and implementation gaps.

> Let me first confirm the definition and nomenclature so I don't anchor on an outdated term. Post-laminectomy syndrome, historically synonymous with failed back surgery syndrome, is now encompassed by the ICD-11 term persistent spinal pain syndrome, defined as persistent or recurrent pain in the back or legs after anatomically successful spine surgery that fails to meet preoperative expectations, with pain typically persisting beyond three months and often indefinitely, reflecting a mismatch between surgical goals and outcomes [^111QE7XX] [^113cgJxk].

> Wait, let me verify the scope across spinal regions before I overgeneralize to the lumbar spine. Although the term originated in the lumbar literature, analogous post-surgery syndromes are described in the cervical and thoracic regions, sharing similar constructs of persistent or recurrent axial and/or radicular pain after surgery that does not fulfill expectations, which justifies applying the same diagnostic and management principles with region-specific modifications [^113j6u69] [^111s9euG].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology, but I need to ensure I separate established contributors from speculative ones. The strongest contributors include epidural fibrosis with nerve root tethering, recurrent or residual disc herniation, acquired spinal stenosis, facet joint degeneration or iatrogenic injury, and biomechanical instability; animal models of post-laminectomy syndrome demonstrate paraspinal muscle spasm, epidural and perineural scarring, and nerve root adherence, supporting a multifactorial model rather than a single-cause explanation [^113W64En] [^1172oREP].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of facet joints because I recall conflicting prevalence estimates. In post-surgical chronic low back pain, facet joint pain prevalence is around 16% with a high false-positive rate on single blocks, whereas a comparative study suggested facet-mediated pain in 32% of post-surgical patients versus 44% in non-surgical controls, underscoring that facet pain is a contributor but not the sole driver in many cases and must be confirmed with controlled diagnostic blocks when suspected [^1143MXxc] [^1118NcVR].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and risk factors to frame pretest probability. The incidence of persistent pain after lumbar surgery ranges from about 10% to 40%, with risk influenced by preoperative psychological factors, inadequate clinical-imaging correlation, surgical factors such as aggressive decompression or mislevel surgery, and postoperative complications including infection, hematoma, or pseudarthrosis; importantly, the likelihood of a successful revision declines with each subsequent operation, reinforcing the need for careful selection and sequencing of treatments [^113W64En] [^116RXVqV].

> Let me think about the diagnostic approach, and I should double-check that I'm not overpromising on any single test. There is no gold standard; diagnosis is clinical and supported by imaging that must be interpreted in the context of surgical anatomy and timing, with MRI best for detecting epidural fibrosis, recurrent herniation, and stenosis, while recognizing that postoperative changes can confound interpretation; targeted diagnostic blocks for facet and sacroiliac sources are appropriate when the pain generator remains unclear, and myeloscopy should be avoided given invasiveness and lack of supportive evidence [^112yB4m5] [^1143MXxc] [^113Za423].

> I need to ensure the treatment hierarchy aligns with guideline strength and real-world feasibility. Conservative care remains foundational, including physical therapy, NSAIDs, and neuropathic agents, but many patients require interventional options; caudal or interlaminar epidural injections have Level II evidence for post-lumbar surgery syndrome and can provide meaningful relief in selected patients, with caudal access often preferred when scar limits interlaminar routes [^111yTPJT] [^112EBQRQ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overstated transforaminal epidural injections for post-surgery syndrome; I should correct that. Evidence for transforaminal epidurals in post-lumbar surgery syndrome is limited, and guidelines generally favor caudal or interlaminar approaches for this indication, reserving transforaminal injections for radiculitis due to disc herniation where evidence is stronger [^112EBQRQ] [^112fMyzX].

> Next, I should review percutaneous adhesiolysis because epidural fibrosis is a key pain driver. Randomized trials and systematic reviews support adhesiolysis with targeted delivery of local anesthetic, hypertonic saline, and steroid, showing markedly higher rates of at least 50% pain relief compared with caudal epidural injections alone, with benefits persisting up to two years in some studies; accordingly, adhesiolysis is reasonable after failure of simpler epidural approaches and is supported by fair-to-good evidence in guidelines [^115pCDfh] [^11566Fbz] [^1124NZhN].

> I should confirm the role of neuromodulation, especially spinal cord stimulation, and I need to check both efficacy and implementation gaps. High-quality comparative data show SCS can outperform repeat surgery for pain relief and patient satisfaction in post-laminectomy syndrome, and SCS is associated with reduced transition to opioid therapy in opioid-naive patients, yet underutilization persists, particularly in rural and primary care settings where provider awareness and referral patterns lag behind the evidence base [^113cTB1o] [^115qEZj8] [^1127j3bG].

> But wait, what if the pain phenotype is more focal or mixed-mechanism; I should consider alternatives. Dorsal root ganglion stimulation and peripheral nerve field stimulation can be considered for focal or complex pain distributions, and interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation programs have demonstrated improvements in pain, function, and self-efficacy even in patients who failed SCS, supporting a multimodal, stepwise approach rather than reliance on a single modality [^114FQwPo] [^114n7owC].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Post-laminectomy syndrome reflects persistent or recurrent spinal pain after surgery that fails to meet expectations, driven by a combination of epidural fibrosis, recurrent or residual disc, stenosis, facet or sacroiliac contributions, and biomechanical or neuromuscular changes. Diagnosis is clinical with imaging and selective blocks, and management should escalate from conservative care to caudal or interlaminar epidurals, then adhesiolysis, and finally neuromodulation or interdisciplinary rehabilitation, recognizing that evidence strength varies and shared decision-making is essential given modest average effect sizes and heterogeneous pathophysiology [^113W64En] [^111QE7XX].

Post-laminectomy syndrome (PLS), also called failed back surgery syndrome, is **persistent or recurrent pain** [^111QE7XX] after lumbar surgery, often due to epidural fibrosis, recurrent disc herniation, or nerve root injury [^113W64En]. It affects 10–40% of patients [^113W64En] and is diagnosed clinically, supported by MRI to identify scar tissue or recurrent herniation [^112kzYba]. Management is **multidisciplinary**, including medications, physical therapy, and interventional procedures such as epidural injections or spinal cord stimulation [^115shgVx]; percutaneous adhesiolysis has Level I evidence for pain relief [^1124NZhN]. Prognosis varies, with about half of patients improving and the rest experiencing chronic pain and disability [^notfound].

---

## Definition and clinical presentation

PLS is defined as **persistent or recurrent pain** in the back or legs after lumbar surgery, with or without radiculopathy, that fails to improve or worsens despite technically successful surgery [^111QE7XX]. Clinical features include:

- **Persistent or recurrent pain**: Continuous or intermittent pain in the back, legs, or both, often resembling the preoperative pain pattern [^notfound].

- **Radiculopathy**: Nerve root pain characterized by shooting or burning sensations, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the lower extremities [^notfound].

- **Functional impairment**: Reduced mobility, difficulty performing daily activities, and impaired quality of life [^114n7owC].

- **Psychological distress**: Anxiety, depression, and emotional distress due to chronic pain and disability [^116RXVqV].

---

## Etiology and pathophysiology

PLS is **multifactorial**, with several contributing factors:

| **Etiological factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Epidural fibrosis | Formation of scar tissue around nerve roots, causing adhesion, tethering, and mechanical irritation, leading to persistent pain and radiculopathy [^113W64En] [^116yhAhL]. |
| Recurrent disc herniation | Re-herniation of disc material at the surgical site, compressing nerve roots and causing recurrent pain and radiculopathy [^113W64En]. |
| Nerve root injury | Direct injury or inflammation of nerve roots during surgery, resulting in chronic neuropathic pain [^113j6u69]. |
| Spinal instability | Loss of spinal stability due to excessive bone removal or inadequate fusion, causing abnormal motion and pain [^116RXVqV]. |
| Facet joint degeneration | Degeneration of facet joints adjacent to the surgical site, contributing to axial pain and stiffness [^1143MXxc]. |
| Psychological factors | Pre-existing psychological conditions, such as anxiety and depression, influencing pain perception and recovery [^116RXVqV]. |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis of PLS is primarily **clinical**, supported by imaging studies [^112yB4m5]. The following diagnostic tools are commonly used:

- **Clinical assessment**: Detailed history, physical examination, and pain assessment tools (e.g. visual analog scale, numeric rating scale) [^114DbB8g].

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Gold standard imaging modality to identify epidural fibrosis, recurrent disc herniation, nerve root compression, and other structural abnormalities [^112kzYba].

- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Useful for evaluating bony structures, spinal instability, and hardware-related complications [^notfound].

- **Electromyography (EMG)**: Helps differentiate radiculopathy from other neurological conditions and assess nerve root function [^notfound].

---

## Treatment strategies

Management of PLS requires a **multidisciplinary approach**, including:

- **Conservative management**: Medications (NSAIDs, gabapentinoids, antidepressants), physical therapy, psychological counseling, and lifestyle modifications [^114n7owC].

- **Interventional procedures**: Epidural steroid injections, facet joint injections, nerve blocks, and percutaneous adhesiolysis [^1124NZhN].

- **Neuromodulation**: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an effective, evidence-based treatment for refractory PLS, providing significant pain relief and functional improvement [^113cTB1o] [^1149MbpT].

- **Surgical revision**: Reserved for cases with identifiable structural abnormalities amenable to surgical correction, such as recurrent disc herniation or spinal instability [^115frz8k].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Prognosis of PLS **varies widely**, with approximately 50% of patients experiencing significant improvement with conservative and interventional treatments, while the remaining 50% continue to experience chronic pain and disability. Factors influencing prognosis include the underlying etiology, severity of pain, psychological factors, and the effectiveness of treatment interventions [^notfound].

---

## Prevention strategies

Preventive measures to minimize the risk of PLS include:

- **Careful patient selection**: Thorough preoperative evaluation and selection of appropriate surgical candidates [^112sTL6q].

- **Minimally invasive surgical techniques**: Reducing tissue trauma and minimizing the risk of epidural fibrosis and nerve root injury [^111tFd8z].

- **Postoperative rehabilitation**: Early mobilization, physical therapy, and psychological support to promote recovery and reduce chronic pain [^114n7owC].

- **Avoidance of unnecessary surgery**: Conservative management should be prioritized whenever possible to prevent unnecessary surgical interventions [^116kiC4h].

---

Post-laminectomy syndrome is a complex, multifactorial condition characterized by persistent or recurrent pain after lumbar surgery. Effective management requires a **multidisciplinary approach**, including conservative treatments, interventional procedures, and neuromodulation. Prognosis varies, with about half of patients experiencing significant improvement, while the other half continues to experience chronic pain and disability.

Our aims in this study were to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of veterans receiving SCS implants in the VHA and their one-year post-implant outcomes. We focused on SCS implants for three high prevalence MSDs for which SCS may be indicated, namely post-laminectomy syndrome of the lumbar region, thoracic or lumbosacral neuritis or radiculitis, and lumbago. For these analyses, we compared veterans with these three MSDs who either received an SCS implant or did not during the observation period. For this cohort of veterans, we examined changes in pain intensity ratings and changes in opioid therapy receipt and dosing following SCS implantation.

Cervical post-surgery syndrome — clinical features, proposed mechanisms, and epidural intervention context: It represents a cluster of symptoms following cervical spine surgery wherein the expectations of the patient and spine surgeon are not met, with animal models of post-lumbar laminectomy syndrome demonstrating paraspinal muscle spasms, tail contractures, pain behaviors, tactile allodynia, epidural and perineural scarring, and nerve root adherence. Multiple factors, including surgical trauma to the posterior cervical muscles and external immobilization, have been suggested as causative, yet the precise mechanism of post-operative axial pain remains unclear; soft tissue injuries, including intraoperative damage of the posterior extensor musculature, and nerve tissue injuries sustained during surgery have been suggested as contributors. Based on this pathophysiologic basis, epidural interventions are performed in the cervical spine with appropriate outcomes.

### Transforaminal epidural blood patch [^112EBY3D]. Pain Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Spinal headache is an occasional, but painful complication of epidural injection procedures due to dural puncture that allows leakage of CSF from the thecal sac, thereby reducing intracranial pressure. In the event of failure of conservative management, (e.g. abdominal binder, fluids, acetaminophen), an epidural blood patch is often used. This case report describes a patient with spinal headache after a transforaminal selective epidural injection in a post laminectomy patient that was treated with a transforaminal epidural blood patch after the failure of conservative management. The patient underwent left transforaminal epidural injections at L5 and S1 for management of chronic low back pain secondary to post laminectomy syndrome. Three days later, the patient presented with a severe post lumbar puncture headache and failed to respond to conservative management. Interlaminar epidural approach for blood patch was not feasible secondary to prior laminectomy. Transforaminal epidural blood patch was performed utilizing 2 mL of autologous blood at each of the two sites. The patient recovered well without headache. In cases, with inability to perform interlaminar blood patch, a transforaminal approach may be considered.

Demographic Data

Among 1 165 723 patients with a diagnosis of PLS (including fusion and instrumentation) whose records were reviewed, 552 937 patients were eligible for inclusion (26 179 patients [4.7%] with a SCS and 526 758 patients [95.3%] without). For baseline opioid use status, 384 552 patients were opioid-naive and 123 553 were on LOT. The median (IQR) duration between PLS diagnosis and SCS placement was 2.3 (0.2–6.7) months. Figure 1 shows demographic data among study patients. The median (IQR) age of patients was 60 (51–69) years, with 305 802 patients (55.3%) being female. Among those reporting racial identify (37.0% [204 758 patients]), 9.3% (18 971 patients) were African American, 0.3% (648 patients) were Asian, and 90.4% (185 139 patients) were White. Compared with overall data from the Diamond Network, patients receiving a PLS diagnosis were more likely to be White (90.4% vs 85.2%; difference, 5.2% [95% CI, 5.1%-5.4%]; P < .001) than African-American (9.3% vs 12.8%; difference, −3.5% [95% CI, −3.5% to −3.7%]; P < .001) or Asian (0.3% vs 2.0%; difference, −1.7% [95% CI, −1.7% to −1.6%]; P < .001). Compared with PLS patients not receiving an SCS, PLS patients who received an SCS were also more likely to be White (93.7% vs 90.3%; difference, 3.4% [95% CI, 2.9% to 4.0%]; P < .001) than African American (6.1% vs 9.4%; difference, −3.3% [95% CI, −3.8% to −2.8%]; P < .001) or Asian (0.2% vs 0.3%; difference, −0.1% [95% CI, −0.3% to −0.1%]; p = 0.01). Other factors associated with receiving an SCS implant included older mean (SD) age (61.38 [12.94] years vs 59.77 [12.72] years; P < .001), female sex (56.5% vs 55.2%; difference, 1.3% [95% CI, 0.7% to 1.9%]; P < .001), higher mean (SD) Charlson comorbidity index scores (1.21 [1.80] vs 1.15 [1.79]; P < .001), presence of psychosocial risk factors, and use of psychotropic medications (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Unlike in univariate analysis, the results of multivariable analysis found that patients with a history of antipsychotic use (OR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.87–0.98]; p = 0.01) were less likely to receive SCS. There was no significant association between female sex and SCS implantation (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Although TriNetX includes data from health care organizations (HCOs) across the United States, a substantial plurality of patients were from the South (41.3% [292 333 patients]).

Examining the Odds of an SCS Implant by Inclusion of Diagnosis

Three MSDs were included in the SCS analytic sample ("inclusion diagnoses", see Methods); these diagnoses (post-laminectomy syndrome of the lumbar region, thoracic or lumbosacral neuritis or radiculitis, and lumbago) were examined individually to determine the contribution of each group to the SCS outcomes. The disorders are not mutually exclusive (7% of the analytic sample and 47% of the veterans who had an SCS implant had at least 2 MSD inclusion diagnoses). For each of the inclusion diagnoses, there was overinclusion in the SCS sample for veterans with more than one diagnosis. Veterans with a diagnosis of lumbago (either alone or concurrent with one of the other inclusion diagnoses) comprised 96.2% of the analytic sample and 93.6% of the sample receiving SCS. However, among those veterans receiving an implant, only 47.4% had a diagnosis of lumbago alone. Similarly, veterans with post-laminectomy syndrome of the lumbar region (either alone or concurrent with at least one other inclusion diagnosis) accounted for only 1.2% of the analytic sample but comprised 25.0% of the veterans receiving implants. Veterans with thoracic or lumbosacral neuritis or radiculitis (alone or concurrent with one of the other two diagnoses) examined accounted for 9.7% of the analytic sample and 41.2% of implants.

Enrolled Patients

Based on data from 5 institutions, 142 consecutive patients met the inclusion criteria. In total, 27 patients did not undergo surgery due to the patients' personal circumstances, and 38 patients were excluded because the radiographs obtained were inadequate for evaluating the parameters in this study or because postsurgical, full standing spinal radiographs were not obtained. There were no patients with a coronal deformity > 30°. None of the patients who underwent thoracolumbar fusion surgery met the exclusion criteria. Additionally, there were no totally fused spine patients, such as AS, or cervical deformity patients with thoracic apex or lumbar apex.

Ultimately, 78 patients were enrolled in this study. Among them, 25 underwent anterior reconstruction and 53 underwent either posterior reconstruction with instrumentation, including 3-column osteotomy, or a combination of anterior and posterior (AP) reconstruction surgery. We also assessed the etiology of each case. Among 25 patients who underwent anterior surgery, 9 patients developed entire cervical kyphosis with multilevel degenerative disc lesion, 8 patients developed myelopathy with local kyphosis, 6 patients developed adjacent level disorders because of prior fixation surgery, and 2 patients developed postlaminectomy kyphosis. In addition, among 53 patients who underwent posterior or combined both AP surgeries, 5 patients exhibited dropped head syndrome, 25 patients exhibited distal junctional kyphosis, 20 patients exhibited post laminectomy kyphosis, and 3 patients suffered instrumentation failure.

The average Cobb CL in patients who underwent posterior or AP surgery was 33.7° (range, −2°-88°). In patients who underwent anterior reconstruction, the average Cobb CL was 19.1° (range, 3°-51°), indicating that the Cobb CL in patients who received anterior reconstruction surgery was relatively mild. However, all patients who underwent anterior reconstruction surgery had local kyphosis in the middle and/or lower cervical segments with a local kyphosis of 20.6° (range, 6°-51°).

### A traumatic central cord syndrome occurring after adequate decompression for cervical spondylosis: biomechanics of injury: case report [^114adVHb]. Spine (2005). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case report with review of the literature.

Objectives

To present the first case of a central cord syndrome occurring after adequate decompression, and review the mechanics of the cervical spinal cord injury and postoperative biomechanical and anatomic changes occurring after cervical decompressive laminectomy.

Summary Of Background Data

Cervical spondylosis is a common pathoanatomic occurrence in the elderly population and is thought to be one of the primary causes for a central cord syndrome. Decompressive laminectomy with or without fusion has been a primary treatment for spondylotic disease and is thought to be protective against further injury. To our knowledge, there are no cases of a central cord syndrome occurring after adequate decompression reported in the literature.

Methods

Case study with extensive review of the literature.

Results

The patient underwent C3-C7 cervical laminectomy without complications. After surgery, the patient's spasticity and gait difficulties improved. She was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation for further treatment of upper extremity weakness. The patient fell in the rehabilitation center, with a central cord syndrome despite adequate decompression of her spinal canal. The patient was treated conservatively for the central cord and had minimal improvement.

Conclusions

Decompressive laminectomy provides an immediate decompressive effect on the spinal cord as seen by the dorsal migration of the cord, however, the biomechanics of the cervical spine after decompressive laminectomy remain uncertain. This case supports the ongoing research and need for more intensive research on postoperative cervical spine biomechanics, including decompressive laminectomies, decompressive laminectomy and fusion, and laminoplasty.

### The postsurgical lumbosacral spine. magnetic resonance imaging evaluation following intervertebral disk surgery, surgical decompression, intervertebral bony fusion, and spinal instrumentation [^1171L9xJ]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

It should be clear to those who perform and interpret medical images of the spine following one or more forms of surgical therapy that the images are often difficult to interpret in part because of the superimposition of the original disease process, alteration engendered by the surgery, or a complication of the surgical procedure. Although long-term experience in this area is helpful in regard to improving interpretive skills, certain sequela can be predicted regardless of the interpreter's background. Once the normal or expected postsurgical findings are understood, the subtle and gross changes that depart from these observations can be analyzed better. The importance of a high level of competence in the domain of post-therapeutic neurodiagnostic imaging is in the knowledge that the patient returning for restudy may be acutely in distress or even in medical danger (e.g., postoperative spondylitis). In fact, the clinical presentation posttherapeutically may well be more severe or dire than was observed pretherapeutically. An indepth appreciation of the broad range of clinicoradiologic possibilities as presented [figure: see text] here should place the medical imaging physician in an excellent position to provide an experienced diagnostic evaluation in the patient presenting with recurrent or new signs and symptoms following any one of the spectrum of possible spinal surgical procedures.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^115y3Uvo]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Transforaminal epidural injections — evidence by indication indicates fair evidence that they will prevent surgery in a reasonable proportion of patients. For spinal stenosis, the available evidence is fair for short-term outcomes and limited for long-term improvement with local anesthetic and steroids. For axial or discogenic pain without radiculitis, disc herniation, or spinal stenosis, the literature does not illustrate significant evidence and the evidence is limited. For post lumbar surgery syndrome, the evidence is poor based on an active-control randomized controlled trial. Overall, evidence is good for radiculitis secondary to disc herniation with local anesthetics and steroids and fair with local anesthetic only; it is fair for spinal stenosis with local anesthetic and steroids, and limited for axial pain and post surgery syndrome with local anesthetic with or without steroids for short-term and long-term relief.

Neuromodulation

Neuromodulation has been used to treat many painful syndromes ranging from post laminectomy syndrome, CRPS, thoracic neuralgia, various neuropathies and focal pain patterns. There are various implantable therapies including peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), peripheral nerve field stimulation (PNFS), spinal cord stimulation (SCS), and dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRGs). Superficial therapies have also included transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENs) and scrambler therapy. In general, more focal pain patterns have been treated with DRGs, PNS, PNFS, and external devices such as TENs, and scrambler therapy.SCS has been used in the treatment of more global pain patterns, such as back and leg pain, given its more blanket approach than stimulating a single nerve or dermatome.

### Postlaminectomy cervical deformity [^112sTL6q]. Neurosurgical Focus (2003). Low credibility.

Postlaminectomy cervical kyphosis is an important consideration when performing surgery. Identifying factors predisposing to postoperative deformity is essential. The goal is to prevent postlaminectomy cervical kyphosis while exposing the patient to minimal additional morbidity. When postlaminectomy kyphosis does occur, surgical correction is often required and performed via an anterior, posterior, or combined approach. The authors discuss the indications for surgical approaches as well as clinical results.

### Ventral column spinal cord stimulation for postlumbar laminectomy syndrome [^111rJ6Ve]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Spinal cord stimulation is an increasingly used treatment for a number of chronic pain states. Dorsal column stimulation is historically and currently the anatomical target of choice for most chronic pain conditions, including postlaminectomy syndrome and radicular pain. However, early studies suggested that stimulation of an alternative target, the ventral columns that carry pain fibers in the anterior and lateral spinothalamic tracts, may offer comparable or superior pain relief. A patient undergoing standard-of-care spinal cord stimulation trial had an additional lead placed on the right ventrolateral aspect of the spinal cord. After the usual 7-day trial of dorsal column stimulation, the dorsal leads were removed and ventrolateral column stimulation was applied through the retained ventral lead for a period of 3 days. The Brief Pain Index Short Form and Numeric Rating Scale were recorded for both dorsal and ventral stimulation. Ventrolateral spinal cord stimulation provided comparable outcomes compared with dorsal column stimulation using nonparesthesia-based stimulation. The results suggest further investigation into spinal cord stimulation anatomical placement and mechanism of action is warranted.

### Contribution of facet joints to chronic low back pain in postlumbar laminectomy syndrome: a controlled comparative prevalence evaluation [^1118NcVR]. Pain Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Postlumbar laminectomy syndrome, or pain following operative procedures of the lumbar spine, is increasingly a common entity in modern medicine. Multiple causes proposed for recurrence of pain after lumbar laminectomy are: epidural fibrosis, recurrent disc herniation, instability, and facet joints. Even though the prevalence of persistent low back pain secondary to the involvement of lumbosacral facet joints has been described in controlled studies from 15% to 45%, the prevalence of facet joint mediated pain in postlumbar laminectomy syndrome has not been studied. This prospective, randomized, controlled comparative evaluation was performed to determine the prevalence of facet joint mediated pain in persistent low back pain in postlumbar laminectomy patients with a comparative non-surgical group. One hundred patients with fifty patients in each group were randomly assigned with group I consisting of fifty patients without history of previous surgery and group II consisting of fifty patients with history of previous surgery. Results showed that the prevalence of facet joint mediated pain in non-surgical patients was 44% compared to 32% in post surgical patients determined by comparative controlled local anesthetic blocks utilizing lidocaine and bupivacaine. This study also showed a false positive rate of 36% in non-surgical group and 24% in post-surgical group. In conclusion, this study shows that facet joint mediated symptomatology in chronic low back pain is prevalent, both in non-surgical as well as post-surgical patients even though prevalence was somewhat higher in the non-surgical group compared to post-surgical group.

### Lack of neuromodulation knowledge among rural family medicine residents: a call for implementation research [^112wLBKb]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite demonstrated superiority over medical management for the treatment of neuropathic back and leg pain, many believe that spinal cord stimulation is under-utilized in the treatment of post-laminectomy syndrome. Many factors contribute to the lack of use including access, payer status, lack of available providers, and lack of dissemination of knowledge of the technology. In rural states like Arkansas, these factors are most likely prominent. Despite evidence demonstrating a lack of efficacy and increase morbidity with the use of opioids for the treatment of most chronic pain disease states, opioids are routinely used. Per the CDC, Arkansas physicians prescribed 93.5 prescriptions per 100 persons in 2018, well above the national average of 51.4 for the same year.

To increase the availability of health care in the community, provide consultation and education for area health care professionals, and offer health education to individuals across Arkansas, The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences has strategically placed family medicine residency programs in rural areas within seven of these eight regions of Arkansas to increase the number of primary care providers in rural areas of Arkansas as well as provide evidence-based healthcare for rural Arkansas. Due to this mission, the authors felt that the residents in these programs would be a good surrogate for knowledge among health providers in these rural communities.

With mounting evidence demonstrating benefit with spinal cord stimulation for the treatment of post-laminectomy syndrome, the purpose of this study is to assess the knowledge on this evidence among rural Arkansas family medicine residents and whether referrals for this treatment have been implemented into their practice. Our hypothesis is that rural Arkansas family medicine residents will have poor knowledge about spinal cord stimulation for the treatment of post-laminectomy syndrome and poor implementation of referrals for this treatment in their practice.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^111s9euG]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

Thoracic post-surgery syndrome — epidural interventions: Post thoracic surgery syndrome is rare compared to lumbar or cervical post-surgery syndromes, and early diagnosis and appropriate management has been recommended. Epidural interventions are performed less frequently than in the lumbar and cervical spine; for thoracic post-surgery syndrome these procedures must only be performed if there is appropriate access available below the surgical level or with catheterization with or without adhesiolysis.

### Migration of epidural leads during spinal cord stimulator trials [^117FUG6w]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Retrospective review of radiographic imaging was carried out for 35 patients at the University of Utah, Huntsman Cancer Institute, and Salt Lake City Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Eight separate attending physicians performed cases that were included in the study. The primary indication for SCS trial included post-laminectomy syndrome (20 patients, 57%), lumbosacral radiculopathy (6 patients, 17%), chronic back pain (4 patients, 11%), peripheral neuropathy (3 patients, 9%), chronic post-thoracotomy pain (1 patient, 3%), and complex regional pain syndrome (1 patient, 3%). Thirty-one of 35 patients (88.5%) had a successful trial, defined as improvement in pain of at least 50%. The average length of trial was 6.8 days with a median of 7 days and a range of 4–8 days. Thirty-four patients underwent SCS trial utilizing 2 leads and 1 patient underwent a single-lead trial. Demographic and additional procedural information can be found in Tables 1 and 2.

Procedure Details

Thirty-three of 35 patients (94%) had radiographically significant intra-trial migration of at least one lead. All these migrations were found to be caudad in direction. On an individual basis, 78% of leads were found to have significant radiographic migration. The mean degree of migration was 1.17 vertebral levels (Standard Deviation (SD) 0.88). Further details on lead migration can be found in Table 3.

Table 3
Migration Details

In assessing risk factors for lead migration, a diagnosis of post-laminectomy syndrome as compared to other diagnoses was associated with increased likelihood of lead migration (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.07–1.61, p = 0.014). No association was found with age, sex, BMI, height, access level or device manufacturer. Variables including trial length of 7 days as compared other lengths, lead tip location at T9 as compared to elsewhere, physician experience of > 5 years as compared to < 5 years, and utilization of adhesive strips or sutures as compared to adhesive fixation device had lower rates of lead migration, however because of the small sample size in this study, the p-values for these Elastic Net selected factors from the unpenalized regression model were not statistically significant. See Table 4 for full statistical details.

### Management of pain of post lumbar surgery syndrome: one-year results of a randomized, double-blind, active controlled trial of fluoroscopic caudal epidural injections [^114DbB8g]. Pain Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Post lumbar surgery syndrome represents a cluster of nomenclature and syndromes following spine surgery wherein the expectations of the patient and spine surgeon are not met, with persistent pain following lumbar surgery. Multiple causes have been speculated to cause pain after lumbar surgery. Epidural steroid injections are most commonly used in managing post surgical pain in the lumbar spine. However, there is a paucity of evidence of epidural injections in managing chronic low back pain with or without lower extremity pain in post surgery syndrome.

Study Design

A randomized, double-blind, active controlled trial.

Setting

An interventional pain management practice, a specialty referral center, a private practice setting in the United States.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of caudal epidural injections in patients with chronic low back and lower extremity pain after surgical intervention with post lumbar surgery syndrome.

Methods

One-hundred forty patients were randomly assigned to one of 2 groups; Group I patients received caudal epidural injections with local anesthetic (lidocaine 0.5%), whereas Group II patients received caudal epidural injections with 0.5% lidocaine 9 mL mixed with 1 mL of 6 mg non-particulate Celestone. Randomization was performed by computer-generated random allocation sequence by simple randomization.

Outcomes Assessment

Multiple outcome measures were utilized which included the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), the Oswestry Disability Index 2.0 (ODI), employment status, and opioid intake with assessment at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-treatment. Significant pain relief and disability reduction were described as 50% or more reduction in scores from baseline.

Results

Combined pain relief (≥ 50%) and disability reduction was recorded in 53% of the patients in the local anesthetic group, and 59% of patients in the local anesthetic and steroid group with no significant differences noted with or without steroid over a period of one-year. However, the data from the successful group showed improvement in 70% of patients in Group I and 75% of patients in Group II. The average procedures per year were 4 with an average total relief per year of 38.1 ± 14.5 weeks in Group I and 38.4 ± 13.2 weeks in Group II over a period of 52 weeks in the successful group.

Limitations

The results of this study are limited by the lack of a placebo group and one-year outcomes.

Conclusion

Caudal epidural injections in chronic function-limiting low back pain in post surgery syndrome without facet joint pain may be effective in a significant proportion of patients with improvement in functional status and significant pain relief.

Clinical Trial

NCT00370799.

### Methylene blue-associated serotonin syndrome: a' green' encephalopathy after parathyroidectomy [^116pUn9M]. Neurocritical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Methylene blue (MB) infusion is frequently used to localize the parathyroid glands during parathyroidectomy and generally considered safe. Several recent reports suggest neurological toxicity and post-operative altered mental state typically after large dose infusions. The mechanism by which MB has neurotoxic effects in some patients remains uncertain.

Case Report

A 67-year-old male underwent lumbar laminectomy followed by parathyroidectomy. Postoperatively, he was comatose (Glasgow Coma Scale of 7) and underwent extensive neurological evaluation. Brain computed tomography (CT) imaging and CT angiography revealed no ischemia, vessel occlusion, or hemorrhage. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed only slowing of cerebral hemispheric activity bilaterally. Over the next 48 h, his mental status slowly improved and the patient made a full neurological recovery (Glasgow Coma Scale 15).

Conclusion

Methylene blue, when used in patients on antidepressant drugs, may be associated with a transient encephalopathic state and serotonin syndrome. Patients on antidepressants undergoing parathyroidectomy who may receive MB infusion should be considered for alternative parathyroid gland identification or discontinuation of the antidepressants before surgery. MB-associated serotonin syndrome is an increasing and under recognized ('green') post-operative encephalopathy that warrants education to critical care neurologists and other physicians.

### Failed back surgery syndrome: review and new hypotheses [^114rrk5i]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) is a term used to define an unsatisfactory outcome of a patient who underwent spinal surgery, irrespective of type or intervention area, with persistent pain in the lumbosacral region with or without it radiating to the leg. Pain may appear after surgery and persist despite the intervention for up to 3 months, with chronic consequences. There are other definitions for the same disorder such as postlumbar surgery syndrome, postlaminectomy syndrome, failed back syndrome, and postoperative persistent syndrome. In the text studied, the percentage of pain detected after spinal surgery varies ranging from a low of 5% to a high of 74.6%, and the percentage of need for re-operation ranging from 13.4% to 35%.–According to some authors, the percentages are not consistent with the type of intervention. If the patient has undergone a minimally invasive intervention, for example, a microdiscectomy, it does not mean that the patient will present with more minor symptoms than if a major surgical intervention had taken place, for example, fusion of the vertebrae.–Other authors report that the type of surgical approach may influence the response rate to FBSS in favor of microsurgery. At present there are no surgical strategies able to prevent the instances of FBSS.

### A review of emerging evidence for utilization of a percutaneous interspinous process decompression device to treat symptomatic lumbar adjacent-segment degeneration [^113bfYTs]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

Postlaminectomy syndrome diagnoses secondary to adjacent segment degeneration are a substantial and rising cause of morbidity in the United States. Emerging spinal cord neuromodulation technologies have produced successful outcomes for postlaminectomy neuropathic pain but are less effective in treating neurogenic claudication secondary to recurrent lumbar stenosis. Percutaneous interspinous process decompression systems can be used as a salvage treatment modality for persistent structural neurogenic claudication in postlaminectomy syndrome or after spinal cord stimulator implantation.

Methods

This paper is a review of emerging evidence for efficacious utilization of percutaneous interspinous process decompression.

Results

A recent pragmatic trial of subjects who underwent percutaneous interspinous process decompression for lumbar stenosis with intermittent neurogenic claudication reported that 63% (26/41) maintained minimal clinically important improvement in visual analog scale (VAS) leg pain, 61% (25/41) in VAS back pain, 78% (32/41) in function objective values, and 88% (36/41) reported satisfaction with treatment at 12 months postop. All subjects in a small case series of seven individuals with postlaminectomy adjacent-segment disease reported postoperative satisfaction scores of 3 or 4 on a 0–4 scale and were also able to decrease or wean completely off controlled pain medications. In another study, there was a significant decrease in average leg pain (60% improvement, P < 0.0001, N = 25) and axial low back pain (58% improvement, P < 0.0001, N = 25) in patients who underwent one- or two-level percutaneous interspinous process decompression as a rescue treatment for reemerging neurogenic claudication after spinal cord stimulator implantation.

Conclusions

The spine often is a focus of progressive disease. Furthermore, mechanical changes associated with spinal instrumentation can lead to additional disease at adjacent levels. Many individuals will present with symptomatic neurogenic claudication recalcitrant to multimodal management strategies, including even the most sophisticated neuromodulation technologies. Implementation of salvage percutaneous interspinus process decompression implantation in cases of adjacent segment degeneration or incomplete spinal cord stimulation can decompress structural causes of neurogenic claudication while sparing the patient from more invasive surgical reoperation techniques.

### Epidural steroids in the management of chronic spinal pain and radiculopathy [^117PxM8D]. Pain Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Epidural injections with or without steroids are used extensively in the management of chronic spinal pain. However, evidence is contradictory with continuing debate about the value of epidural steroid injections in chronic spinal syndromes. The objective of this systematic review is to determine the effectiveness of epidural injections in the treatment of chronic spinal pain. Data sources include relevant literature identified through searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE (Jan 1966- Mar 2003), manual searches of bibliographies of known primary and review articles, and abstracts from scientific meetings. Both randomized and non-randomized studies were included in the review based on the criteria established by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Studies were excluded from the analysis if they were simply review or descriptive and failed to meet minimum criteria. The results showed that there was strong evidence to indicate effectiveness of transforaminal epidural injections in managing lumbar nerve root pain. Further, evidence was moderate for caudal epidural injections in managing lumbar radicular pain. The evidence in management of chronic neck pain, chronic low back pain, cervical radiculopathy, spinal stenosis, and post laminectomy syndrome was limited or inconclusive. In conclusion, the evidence of effectiveness of transforaminal epidural injections in managing lumbar nerve root pain was strong, whereas, effectiveness of caudal epidural injections in managing lumbar radiculopathy was moderate, while there was limited or inconclusive evidence of effectiveness of epidural injections in managing chronic spinal pain without radiculopathy, spinal stenosis, post lumbar laminectomy syndrome, and cervical radiculopathy.

### Cervical laminoplasty: a critical review [^112hLF4x]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

Object

The technique of cervical laminoplasty was developed to decompress the spinal canal in patients with multi-level anterior compression caused by ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament or cervical spondylosis. There is a paucity of data confirming its superiority to laminectomy with regard to neurological outcome, preserving spinal stability, preventing postlaminectomy kyphosis, and the development of the "postlaminectomy membrane".

Methods

The authors conducted a metaanalysis of the English-language laminoplasty literature, assessing neurological outcome, change in range of motion (ROM), development of spinal deformity, and complications. Seventy-one series were reviewed, comprising more than 2000 patients. All studies were retrospective, uncontrolled, nonrandomized case series. Forty-one series provided postoperative recovery rate data in which the Japanese Orthopaedic Association Scale was used for assessing myelopathy. The mean recovery rate was 55% (range 20–80%). The authors of 23 papers provided data on the percentage of patients improving (mean approximately 80%). There was no difference in neurological outcome based on the different laminoplasty techniques or when laminoplasty was compared with laminectomy. There was postlaminoplasty worsening of cervical alignment in approximately 35% and with development of postoperative kyphosis in approximately 10% of patients who underwent long-term follow-up review. Cervical ROM decreased substantially after laminoplasty (mean decrease 50%, range 17–80%). The authors of studies with long-term follow up found that there was progressive loss of cervical ROM, and final ROM similar to that seen in patients who had undergone laminectomy and fusion. In their review of the laminectomy literature the authors could not confirm the occurrence of postlaminectomy membrane causing clinically significant deterioration of neurological function. Postoperative complications differed substantially among series. In only seven articles did the writers quantify the rates of postoperative axial neck pain, noting an incidence between 6 and 60%. In approximately 8% of patients, C-5 nerve root dysfunction developed based on the 12 articles in which this complication was reported.

Conclusions

The literature has yet to support the purported benefits of laminoplasty. Neurological outcome and change in spinal alignment are similar after laminectomy and laminoplasty. Patients treated with laminoplasty develop progressive limitation of cervical ROM similar to that seen after laminectomy and fusion.

### The prevention effect of poly (L-glutamic acid) / chitosan on spinal epidural fibrosis and peridural adhesion in the post-laminectomy rabbit model [^116yhAhL]. European Spine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Spinal epidural fibrosis and adhesion are implicated as one of the key factors of failed back surgery syndrome, which may cause dura mater compression or peridural tethering, resulting in persistent backache and leg pain. Various materials or drugs have been used to inhibit formation of epidural fibrosis and reduce the compressive effect on neural structures. Nevertheless, the effects are not satisfied. In this study, we investigated the prevention effect of poly (L-glutamic acid)/chitosan (PLGA/CS) barrier on epidural fibrosis developing post-laminectomy in a rabbit model.

Methods

Sixteen rabbits were divided randomly into two equal groups: group A (experimental group, n = 8) and group B (non-treatment group, n = 8). In both groups, total L5–6 laminectomy was performed; further both ligamentum flavum and epidural fat were removed gently. In experimental group, the laminectomy sites were treated with PLGA/CS barriers, while no additional treatment was received in non-treatment group. At 1, 12 and 24 weeks post-surgery, the animals were subjected to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation. Following last MRI examination, all rabbits were sacrificed and their spinal columns were totally removed for further macroscopic and histological evaluation.

Results

MRI showed that rabbits treated with PLGA/CS barrier at 12 and 24 weeks post-surgery had less epidural fibrosis or scar tissue, peridural adhesion, foreign body reaction and low pressure of spinal cord in comparison with the non-treatment group. In consistence with the radiographic results, macroscopic analysis and histological examination showed that the amount of scar tissue and the extent of epidural adhesion decreased significantly in experimental groups. Concerning the fibroblast density evaluated, the scores were significantly lower in experimental group compared with those in non-treatment group.

Conclusion

The results of our study demonstrate that PLGA/CS barrier is effective in inhibiting epidural fibrosis and peridural adhesions in post-laminectomy rabbit model.

### Outcomes reported after surgery for cauda equina syndrome: a systematic literature review [^116ghvfJ]. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

METHODS

This study has been registered as 824 on the COMET (Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials) website. Table 1 lists the inclusion criteria applied to the search strategy.

TABLE 1
Inclusion Criteria for the Systematic Literature Review

Search Strategy

We searched Medline, Embase, and CINAHL Plus (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature). The search strategy for each database is available in Appendix 1. Online trial registries included Clinical Trials.gov, EU clinical trials registry and the ISRCTN (International Standard Randomized Controlled Trials Number) registry. The trial registries were searched for any completed or ongoing trials in surgery for CES and no relevant studies were found. Only case reports and abstracts were excluded in the initial search term as we wanted studies with five or more patients. We only included studies published after January 1, 1990 to keep investigation (post-MRI era) and surgical management of CES in line with current medical practice. Citations were collated with Endnote X7 referencing program (Thomson Reuters, New York, NY) and duplicates removed.

Data Extraction

Titles and abstract were initially screened by NS to identify potential studies for inclusion, for which full text articles were obtained for further assessment. Approximately, 10% of included articles were randomly checked for suitability by clinical supervisors and any discussion regarding uncertainty of eligibility criteria applied to the search results was discussed with them (SC, MW, and TM). A data extraction form was used to collect data on study design and location, patient demographics, timing of operation, definition of CES, diagnosis, etiology, surgical procedure, follow-up duration, outcome terminology, outcome definition, and assessment tool.

### 10 kHz spinal cord stimulation for combined alleviation of post-laminectomy syndrome and chronic abdominal pain: a case report [^116AKW2t]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This case describes SCS insertion with multi-level lead placement targeting both post-laminectomy pain and abdominal pain. This strategy can be useful to patients with concurrent pain from more than one source. Additionally, this case adds to the growing evidence that SCS can be helpful in treating chronic visceral pain syndromes. We look forward to following this patient's long-term results with our treatment and believe this case further demonstrates the usefulness of SCS in difficult to treat chronic pain conditions.

### 10 kHz spinal cord stimulation for combined alleviation of post-laminectomy syndrome and chronic abdominal pain: a case report [^116nQ1y8]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Chronic pain affects roughly 50 million Americans, or 20.4% of the national population, and is a huge economic burden on society. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a cost-effective interventional treatment modality for patients with chronic neuropathic and radicular pain. It is traditionally reserved for patients suffering from post-laminectomy syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome, or chronic back pain that is refractory to other less invasive techniques. There have been a few cases describing the use of SCS at higher levels to successfully obtain coverage of visceral abdominal pain. Here we describe an interesting case of a patient who suffered from chronic back pain and radiculopathy with post-laminectomy syndrome as well as chronic abdominal pain. We describe the use of high-frequency SCS to alleviate the patient's post-laminectomy pain as well as his abdominal pain. Our case describes SCS use with multi-level lead placement targeting both post-laminectomy pain ﻿and abdominal pain. We describe a strategy that can be useful to patients with concurrent pain from more than one source. Our case also adds to the growing evidence supporting the use of SCS for treating chronic visceral pain syndromes.

### Non-compressive postoperative cauda equina syndrome following decompression and transforaminal interbody fusion surgery [^113EAA4e]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Postoperative cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a known rare complication following lumbar disc surgery. Seldom are they seen following decompression for spinal stenosis and may be actually more frequent and under-reported? Emergent surgical exploration remains the mainstay of management as the factors responsible for postop CES remains a variety of compressive forces. Yet many a time postoperative imaging or surgical exploration fails to identify a pathology and this leads to an ischaemic theory responsible for CES. Our article highlights conservative management in these selective group. We share our experience in two cases of incomplete CES during our routine transforaminal interbody fusion which we followed closely without re-exploration eventually ending in a favourable outcome. Key messages: The factors responsible for postop CES remains mostly a variety of compressive forces though in some instances postoperative imaging or surgical exploration fails to identify such in some cases. This leads to an ischaemic theory responsible for CES. The role of conservative management of postoperative CES in certain selective cases has a favourable outcome as illustrated in our cases.

### Spinal endoscopic adhesiolysis in post lumbar surgery syndrome: an update of assessment of the evidence [^111Vee5K]. Pain Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Post lumbar surgery syndrome refers to pain occurring or present after lumbar surgery. While the causes of pain after lumbar surgery are multi-factorial, scarring is a significant source of that pain. Low back and/or leg pain after lumbar surgery can persist despite appropriate conservative therapy. Spinal endoscopy allows direct visual evaluation of the epidural space, along with mechanical lysis of any adhesions present.

Study Design

A systematic review of the effectiveness of spinal endoscopic adhesiolysis in post lumbar surgery syndrome.

Objective

To evaluate and update the effectiveness of spinal endoscopic adhesiolysis in treating post lumbar surgery syndrome.

Methods

The available literature on spinal endoscopic adhesiolysis in treating post lumbar surgery syndrome was reviewed. The quality assessment and clinical relevance criteria utilized were the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review Group criteria as utilized for interventional techniques for randomized trials and the criteria developed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale criteria for observational studies. The level of evidence was classified as good, fair, and limited or poor based on the quality of evidence developed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Data sources included relevant literature identified through searches of PubMed and EMBASE from 1966 to September 2012, and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles.

Outcome Measures

Pain relief and functional improvement were the primary outcome measures. Other outcome measures were improvement of psychological status, opioid intake, and return to work. Short-term effectiveness was defined as improvement of 12 months or less; whereas, long-term effectiveness was defined 12 months or longer.

Results

For this systematic review, 21 studies were identified. Of these, one randomized controlled trial (RCT) and 5 observational studies met the inclusion criteria. Two of the observational studies were excluded because of other methodological issues, despite showing positive outcomes. Using current criteria for successful outcomes, these studies indicate that there is fair evidence for the effectiveness of spinal endoscopy in the treatment of persistent low back and/or leg pain in post lumbar surgery syndrome.

Limitations

The limitations of this systematic review include the paucity of literature.

Conclusions

The evidence is fair that spinal endoscopy is effective in the treatment of post lumbar surgery syndrome.

Cervical spine — The evidence for cervical provocation discography is limited; whereas the evidence for diagnostic cervical facet joint nerve blocks is good with a criterion standard of 75% or greater relief with controlled diagnostic blocks. The evidence is good for cervical interlaminar epidural injections for cervical disc herniation or radiculitis; fair for axial or discogenic pain, spinal stenosis, and post cervical surgery syndrome. The evidence for therapeutic cervical facet joint interventions is fair for conventional cervical radiofrequency neurotomy and cervical medial branch blocks, and limited for cervical intraarticular injections.

### Systematic review of caudal epidural injections in the management of chronic low back pain [^117XsdJ3]. Pain Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Caudal epidural injection of local anesthetics with or without steroids is one of the most commonly used interventions in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain. However, there has been a lack of well-designed randomized, controlled studies to determine the effectiveness of caudal epidural injections in various conditions - disc herniation and radiculitis, post-lumbar laminectomy syndrome, spinal stenosis, and chronic low back pain of disc origin without disc herniation or radiculitis.

Study Design

A systematic review of caudal epidural injections with or without steroids in managing chronic pain secondary to lumbar disc herniation or radiculitis, post lumbar laminectomy syndrome, spinal stenosis, and discogenic pain without disc herniation or radiculitis.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of caudal epidural injections with or without steroids in managing various types of chronic low back and lower extremity pain emanating as a result of disc herniation or radiculitis, post-lumbar laminectomy syndrome, spinal stenosis, and chronic discogenic pain.

Methods

A review of the literature was performed according to the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review Group Criteria as utilized for interventional techniques for randomized trials and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) criteria for observational studies. The level of evidence was classified as Level I, II, or III based on the quality of evidence developed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Data sources included relevant literature of the English language identified through searches of PubMed and EMBASE from 1966 to November 2008, and manual searches of bibliographies of known primary and review articles.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure was pain relief (short-term relief = up to 6 months and long-term ≥ 6 months). Secondary outcome measures of improvement in functional status, psychological status, return to work, and reduction in opioid intake were utilized.

Results

The evidence showed Level I for short- and long-term relief in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain secondary to lumbar disc herniation and/or radiculitis and discogenic pain without disc herniation or radiculitis. The indicated evidence is Level II-1 or II-2 for caudal epidural injections in managing low back pain of post-lumbar laminectomy syndrome and spinal stenosis.

Limitations

The limitations of this study include the paucity of literature, specifically for chronic pain without disc herniation.

Conclusion

This systematic review shows Level I evidence for relief of chronic pain secondary to disc herniation or radiculitis and discogenic pain without disc herniation or radiculitis. Further, the indicated evidence is Level II-1 or II-2 for caudal epidural injections in managing chronic pain of post lumbar laminectomy syndrome and spinal stenosis.

### Neurological outcome following laminectomy in spinal metastases [^114oPCbz]. Spinal Cord (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective outcome measurement study.

Objectives

Patients suffering from malignant tumour disease and metastases to the spine develop a variety of clinical complaints including radicular symptoms and/or spinal cord compression syndromes. Palliative decompressive laminectomy with total or partial tumour resection is an acknowledged method of treatment, despite controversy.

Setting

The Department of Neurosurgery of the University of Vienna.

Method

Patients suffering from metastases with predominant infiltration of the dorsal epidural parts, or patients who could not be operated on via an anterior approach, were included. Eighty-four patients who met these criteria underwent decompressive laminectomy with total or partial tumour removal. The study analyzed motor function, pain relief and continence in a 2- and 4-month post-operative follow-up. According to the criteria of motor performance, 20% of the patients had been mobile pre-operatively.

Results

In the immediate post-operative period 45%, after 2 months 33% and after 4 months 26%, were considered mobile. None of the paraplegic patients showed functional improvement. The median survival time was 6.5 months. Pre-operatively, 56% of the patients had shown continence dysfunction. Post-operatively, 38%, and after 2 months 46% of the patients, developed continence disorders. A significant reduction in analgesic medication was also observed in the post-operative period.

Conclusion

In our series, palliative laminectomy with total or subtotal tumour reduction in patients with malignant spinal metastatic disease resulted in amelioration of motor function, pain and continence and therefore improved the patients' quality of life. The improvement in quality of life shows that this method is a valuable option in neurosurgical therapy, except for cases with pre-operative paraplegia. However, in patients with severe pre-operative paraparesis, the authors recommend laminectomy only in very exceptional cases, because of the poor post-operative neurological results.

### Clinical outcomes of integrative Korean medicine treatment in patients with neck pain following cervical disc surgery: a multi-center retrospective study [^113EfBaj]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cervical disc disorder is a clinical syndrome caused by structural abnormalities of the cervical spine, wherein the cervical intervertebral disc compresses the cervical nerve roots. It is a leading cause of neck pain. Affected individuals experience neck pain along with varying degrees of radiating arm pain, muscle weakness, and sensory abnormalities in the upper extremities, depending on the severity of cervical nerve root compression. The global prevalence of cervical disc disorder has been increasing, and, consequently, so have the associated socioeconomic costs on the patients and health care systems.

Conservative treatments for cervical disc disorder include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroid injections, physical therapy, and rest. Surgical treatment is performed on patients who do not respond to conservative treatments or who have progressive neurological symptoms, with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, and posterior laminectomy being standard procedures.

The number of cervical disc surgeries and the associated costs are increasing; however, surgery does not always yield satisfactory outcomes as neck pain, dysphagia, and paralysis, among other surgery-associated complications, have been reported post-operatively. Furthermore, there are many cases where symptoms do not improve post-surgery, necessitating rehospitalization or resulting in recurrence. Such persistent pain after surgery, often referred to as failed back or neck surgery syndrome, has been reported to occur in approximately 10–40%, of patients and represents a significant global health issue due to its considerable socioeconomic burden.

Medical and scientific consensus regarding the impact of the degree of disc herniation on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fusion surgery on postoperative prognosis remains inconsistent. Some studies have suggested that magnetic resonance image (MRI) signal changes in the cervical disc may serve as important indicators for postoperative prognosis after cervical spine surgery, whereas other studies have reported that the location and type of herniation itself do not have a significant impact. Regarding fusion surgery, although one study reported that baseline patient conditions have a greater influence on long-term prognosis, others have indicated that the cervical disc arthroplasty group showed significantly better outcomes in terms of pain and reoperation rates than the fusion surgery group.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^112EBQRQ]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic lumbar epidural injections — lumbar epidural injections include caudal, interlaminar, and transforaminal, and common indications include chronic low back and/or lower extremity pain of at least 3 months duration which has failed to respond or poorly responded to noninterventional and nonsurgical conservative management resulting from disc herniation/lumbar radiculitis (evidence – good for caudal, interlaminar, and transforaminal), lumbar spinal stenosis (evidence – fair for caudal and interlaminar, limited for lumbar transforaminal), post lumbar surgery syndrome (evidence – fair for caudal and limited for transforaminal), and axial or discogenic low back pain without facet joint or sacroiliac joint pain or disc herniation (evidence – fair for caudal and lumbar interlaminar and limited for transforaminal). Additional qualifiers include moderate to severe pain causing functional disability, that lumbar interlaminar may be performed in post surgery syndrome only if the access to the epidural space is obtained outside the scar, and that caudal epidural is the modality of choice for post surgery syndrome based on the level of pathology.

### 10 kHz spinal cord stimulation for combined alleviation of post-laminectomy syndrome and chronic abdominal pain: a case report [^112tnvHJ]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain affects roughly 50 million Americans, or 20.4% of the national population, and is a huge economic burden on society. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a cost-effective interventional treatment modality for patients with chronic neuropathic and radicular pain. It is traditionally reserved for patients suffering from post-laminectomy syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome, or chronic back pain that is refractory to other less invasive techniques. There have been a few cases describing the use of SCS at higher levels to successfully obtain coverage of visceral abdominal pain. Here we describe an interesting case of a patient who suffered from chronic back pain and radiculopathy with post-laminectomy syndrome as well as chronic abdominal pain. We describe the use of high-frequency SCS to alleviate the patient's post-laminectomy pain as well as his abdominal pain. Our case describes SCS use with multi-level lead placement targeting both post-laminectomy pain ﻿and abdominal pain. We describe a strategy that can be useful to patients with concurrent pain from more than one source. Our case also adds to the growing evidence supporting the use of SCS for treating chronic visceral pain syndromes.

### Failed back surgery syndrome: review and new hypotheses [^116RXVqV]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Risk factors

Literature identifies the possible risk factors leading to such chronic syndrome, divided into pre- and postintervention risk, and risks occurring during the surgical procedure. The patient may present with spinal instability prior to surgery, or in proceeding to surgery, there may be anomalies shown in the clinical images without good clinical correlation. There is a nonexhaustive relationship between the surgeon and the patient's response to surgery. Another preintervention risk factor is linked to the cause that leads to disease or spinal radiculopathy arising from metabolic problems (diabetes), vascular, viral, previous trauma, and tumors. It is acknowledged that psychosocial factors also have an effect on the presence of FBSS. Patients who demonstrate a psychologically altered state, such as depression, anxiety, somatization, and hypochondria, are more prone to unsatisfactory surgical outcomes.

Risk factors during the surgical procedure that would affect response rate of FBSS are especially related to surgeon error, such as an incorrect vertebral localization of the problem or a partially completed operation (eg, an inadequate decompression). The surgical procedure itself (vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty) could create vertebral fractures, independent from intervention of the surgeon.

Oversights by the surgeon, such as an aggressive decompression could lead to spinal instability, or a nonperfect positioning of the means of synthesis, and an erroneous clinical decision of the requirement for surgery.–The unfavorable factors on encountering FBSS after surgery are manifold, such as postoperative complications in the presence of hematomas or infections. The presence of pseudarthrosis after surgical fusion and encountering epidural fibrosis alter the function and nutrition to the root of nerve.,

Anatomic and biomechanical intervention-related alterations may lead to instability of the spine, sacroiliac dysfunction, and foraminal compressions or overburden an area of the vertebra or other vertebral areas and predispose the patient to further spinal pathology, similar to those that led the patient to have surgery.–

Another postoperative factor is changes in the myofascial system connected to the vertebral area of the surgery, in particular to the paraspinal muscles in spasm or hypotrophy, which can cause referred pain that is difficult to distinguish from real spinal radiculopathy. The same biomechanical alterations lead to proprioceptive disturbances of other muscles, like the multifidus, lumbar rotators and the transverse abdominis, which, similar to a vicious circle, will cause pain in the lumbar region. Currently, there is no "Gold" standard in the cure and treatment of FBSS.

### Interventional techniques: evidence-based practice guidelines in the management of chronic spinal pain [^1149MbpT]. Pain Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The evidence-based practice guidelines for the management of chronic spinal pain with interventional techniques were developed to provide recommendations to clinicians in the United States.

Objective

To develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for interventional techniques in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic spinal pain, utilizing all types of evidence and to apply an evidence-based approach, with broad representation by specialists from academic and clinical practices.

Design

Study design consisted of formulation of essentials of guidelines and a series of potential evidence linkages representing conclusions and statements about relationships between clinical interventions and outcomes.

Methods

The elements of the guideline preparation process included literature searches, literature synthesis, systematic review, consensus evaluation, open forum presentation, and blinded peer review. Methodologic quality evaluation criteria utilized included the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) criteria, Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) criteria, and Cochrane review criteria. The designation of levels of evidence was from Level I (conclusive), Level II (strong), Level III (moderate), Level IV (limited), to Level V (indeterminate).

Results

Among the diagnostic interventions, the accuracy of facet joint nerve blocks is strong in the diagnosis of lumbar and cervical facet joint pain, whereas, it is moderate in the diagnosis of thoracic facet joint pain. The evidence is strong for lumbar discography, whereas, the evidence is limited for cervical and thoracic discography. The evidence for transforaminal epidural injections or selective nerve root blocks in the preoperative evaluation of patients with negative or inconclusive imaging studies is moderate. The evidence for diagnostic sacroiliac joint injections is moderate. The evidence for therapeutic lumbar intraarticular facet injections is moderate for short-term and long-term improvement, whereas, it is limited for cervical facet joint injections. The evidence for lumbar and cervical medial branch blocks is moderate. The evidence for medial branch neurotomy is moderate. The evidence for caudal epidural steroid injections is strong for short-term relief and moderate for long-term relief in managing chronic low back and radicular pain, and limited in managing pain of postlumbar laminectomy syndrome. The evidence for interlaminar epidural steroid injections is strong for short-term relief and limited for long-term relief in managing lumbar radiculopathy, whereas, for cervical radiculopathy the evidence is moderate. The evidence for transforaminal epidural steroid injections is strong for short-term and moderate for long-term improvement in managing lumbar nerve root pain, whereas, it is moderate for cervical nerve root pain and limited in managing pain secondary to lumbar post laminectomy syndrome and spinal stenosis. The evidence for percutaneous epidural adhesiolysis is strong. For spinal endoscopic adhesiolysis, the evidence is strong for short-term relief and moderate for long-term relief. For sacroiliac intraarticular injections, the evidence is moderate for short-term relief and limited for long-term relief. The evidence for radiofrequency neurotomy for sacroiliac joint pain is limited. The evidence for intradiscal electrothermal therapy is moderate in managing chronic discogenic low back pain, whereas for annuloplasty the evidence is limited. Among the various techniques utilized for percutaneous disc decompression, the evidence is moderate for short-term and limited for long-term relief for automated percutaneous lumbar discectomy, and percutaneous laser discectomy, whereas it is limited for nucleoplasty and for DeKompressor technology. For vertebral augmentation procedures, the evidence is moderate for both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. The evidence for spinal cord stimulation in failed back surgery syndrome and complex regional pain syndrome is strong for short-term relief and moderate for long-term relief. The evidence for implantable intrathecal infusion systems is strong for short-term relief and moderate for long-term relief.

Conclusion

These guidelines include the evaluation of evidence for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in managing chronic spinal pain and recommendations for managing spinal pain. However, these guidelines do not constitute inflexible treatment recommendations. These guidelines also do not represent a "standard of care".

### 10 kHz spinal cord stimulation for combined alleviation of post-laminectomy syndrome and chronic abdominal pain: a case report [^112GAsqh]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

According to CDC data from the 2016 National Health Interview Survey, chronic pain affects roughly 50 million Americans, or 20.4% of the national population. Chronic low back and neck pain carries an estimated healthcare spending cost of $67.5 billion-$94.1 billion annually, the third highest in the US after ischemic heart disease and diabetes. The costs are even higher when societal costs are also included. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a cost-effective interventional treatment modality for patients with chronic neuraxial and radicular pain. It is traditionally reserved for radiculopathy or chronic back pain that is refractory to other less invasive techniques. However, there is some evidence that SCS may be useful for a variety of visceral pain syndromes as well.–

There have been a few case reports of using SCS at higher levels than traditional levels to successfully obtain coverage of visceral abdominal pain such as pancreatitis. Leads are placed higher around T5-T6 for visceral coverage. Here we present an interesting case of a patient who suffered from chronic back pain and radiculopathy with post-laminectomy syndrome as well as chronic abdominal pain. We describe the use of high-frequency SCS to alleviate the patient's post-laminectomy pain as well as his abdominal pain.

### Lack of neuromodulation knowledge among rural family medicine residents: a call for implementation research [^113j9qMQ]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Of the 115 rural, Arkansas family medicine residents contacted, 39 completed the digital survey, yielding a 34% completion rate. Of respondents, 41% stated they have treated a patient with post-laminectomy syndrome during their training. Only 10% of respondents have treated a patient with or referred a patient for neuromodulation/spinal cord stimulation. However, close to 66% of respondents stated they would refer a patient for neuromodulation in the future (Table 2). Other chronic pain therapies have wide-spread use among respondents including chronic opioid management (56%), Gabapentinoids/Antidepressants (46%), Epidural Steroid Injections (28%). Acupuncture (0%), Chiropractic Manipulation (5.13%), and Radiofrequency Ablation (7.69%) are recommended even less (Figure 2).

Graphic comparison of survey answers to "Which of the following therapies have you prescribed or referred a patient for who has chronic pain from failed back surgery syndrome/post-laminectomy syndrome?"

Among respondents, the mean rating of knowledge of neuromodulation was low, 18.66 on a scale of 0 to 100 (Table 3). This was only higher than chiropractic manipulation (14.00) and radiofrequency ablation (12.97). Responding rural, Arkansas family medicine residents rate their knowledge of neuromodulation lower than gabapentinoids/antidepressants (48.10), chronic opioid therapy (45.44), epidural steroid injections (29.30), and acupuncture (19.21).

### Systematic review of percutaneous adhesiolysis and management of chronic low back pain in post lumbar surgery syndrome [^115wuPZY]. Pain Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Post lumbar surgery syndrome or failed back surgery syndrome with persistent pain continues to increase over the years. The speculated causes of post lumbar laminectomy syndrome include acquired stenosis, epidural fibrosis, arachnoiditis, radiculopathy, and recurrent disc herniation. Epidural fibrosis may account for as much as 20% to 36% of all cases of failed back surgery syndrome. Percutaneous epidural adhesiolysis has been employed in interventional pain management in the treatment of chronic, refractory low back and lower extremity pain after back surgery.

Study Design

A systematic review of randomized trials and observational studies.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of percutaneous adhesiolysis in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain due to post lumbar surgery syndrome.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted utilizing electronic databases, as well as systematic reviews and cross references from 1966 through December 2008. The quality of individual articles used in this analysis was assessed by modified Cochrane review criteria for randomized trials and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) criteria for assessment of observational studies. Clinical relevance was evaluated using 5 questions according to the criteria recommended by the Cochrane Review Back Group. Analysis was conducted using 5 levels of evidence, ranging from Level I to III, with 3 subcategories in Level II.

Outcome Parameters

The primary outcome measure was pain relief (short-term relief of at least 6 months and long-term relief of more than 6 months). Secondary outcome measures were improvement in functional status, psychological status, return to work, and change in opioid intake.

Results

Of the 13 studies considered for inclusion, 3 randomized trials and 4 observational studies met the inclusion criteria for methodologic quality assessment and evidence synthesis based on methodologic quality scores of 50 or more. Evidence of percutaneous adhesiolysis in the management of chronic low back pain in post-lumbar surgery syndrome is Level I to Level II-1, with evidence derived from 3 randomized trials.

Limitations

There is a paucity of efficacy and pragmatic trials. No trials have been published after 2006.

Conclusion

The indicated level of evidence for percutaneous adhesiolysis is Level I or II-1 based on the US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) criteria.

### The effectiveness of an intensive interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation program in the treatment of post-laminectomy syndrome in patients who have failed spinal cord stimulation [^114n7owC]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Post-laminectomy syndrome (PLS) patients who have previously undergone spinal cord stimulation and failed to have significant improvement create a unique challenge for ongoing pain management. We hypothesize that, following successful completion of intensive, interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation (IPR), this patient population can achieve a significant reduction in pain, improvement in mood, functional levels, and self-efficacy.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted comparing the following for patients prior to enrollment in the IPR program and upon completion: numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores; functional status via the six-minute walk test; mood via the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI) Life control scores and MPI Interference, and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS); and self-efficacy via the Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ).

Results

Forty-three patients met inclusion criteria, with 17 males and 26 females and a mean age of 64 years. Patients demonstrated a statistically significant increase in six-minute walk test distance of 104 m, a decrease in average NRS pain score of 1.4 points, an increase in average MPI life control by 8.3 points, a decrease average MPI interference by 5.3 points, an increase in average Short Form-36 by 6.5 points, an increase in average PCS by 4.4 points, and an increase in average PSEQ score of 18.1. Their average mood via CES-D improved by 4.2 points.

Conclusions

Intensive, interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation provides an effective therapeutic modality for patients with post-laminectomy syndrome who have failed spinal cord stimulation by decreasing pain levels and by increasing functional status and self-efficacy.

### Lack of neuromodulation knowledge among rural family medicine residents: a call for implementation research [^117L5yWR]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This was the first study to evaluate the knowledge of neuromodulation, an evidence-based therapy for post-laminectomy syndrome, among rural family medicine residents. Through our survey study, we found that slightly less than half of rural family medicine residents have made the diagnosis of post-laminectomy syndrome or failed back syndrome. Despite this, only one quarter of those have referred a patient for neuromodulation. We also noted that these residents rated their knowledge of neuromodulation below acupuncture, chronic opioid management, adjuvant medications, and epidural steroid injections despite mounting evidence of the effectiveness of neuromodulation for the treatment of this condition.

While the efficacy of neuromodulation has been demonstrated, this evidence-based therapy has not been widely adopted, particularly as a referral option for family medicine residents seeing patients with post-laminectomy syndrome. We feel that this finding is particularly important because many chronic pain patients are treated exclusively by their primary care physicians. This especially holds true in rural America and in rural areas around the globe. While randomized controlled trials are always needed to prove efficacy of novel treatment options, the movement of evidence-based practices (EBP) into routine clinical usage is not spontaneous and often takes focused, dedicated effort. It has been shown that an EBP require an average of seventeen years to be incorporated into routine clinical practice. Despite these averages, over half of proven, efficacious treatments never reach widespread clinical usage. This demonstrates that even the best clinical evidence does not guarantee any tangible public health impact, as seems to be the case with neuromodulation in certain contexts.

### Post-cervical decompression parsonage-turner syndrome represents a subset of C5 palsy: six cases and a review of the literature: case report [^113wHr83]. Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 5% of cervical decompression cases are complicated by postoperative weakness. Parsonage-Turner syndrome (PTS) or neuralgic amyotrophy is known to be precipitated by surgery and unrelated to technical or structural issues. Our practice has seen a number of cases of PTS after cervical decompression surgery. In this case report, we discuss a series of such patients, highlighting the commonalities with the more frequently diagnosed C5 palsy. We conclude with our management algorithm.

Clinical Presentation

Six patients with post-cervical decompression PTS were referred to our institution during a 32-month period. All patients were examined physically, radiographically, and electromyographically and were followed for up to 2 years or until symptoms resolved. Conservative management was the rule, and surgical intervention, including nerve releases and nerve reconstruction, was undertaken in select circumstances. In the majority of patients (4 of 6 patients), pain management and physical therapy alone were used and achieved eventual resolution of pain and recovery of motor strength. The other 2 patients required adjunctive surgical procedures to maximize their outcomes.

Conclusion

PTS accounts for a subset of patients experiencing postoperative weakness after cervical decompression operations. Although it is at times difficult to arrive at this diagnosis, an understanding of the history of PTS, among other causes of postoperative weakness, allows a structured approach to these patients. An evidence-based approach to management helps provide the best outcome for a given patient.

### Lack of neuromodulation knowledge among rural family medicine residents: a call for implementation research [^113fcXAi]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

There are many potential reasons why there is not widespread referrals of patients with post-laminectomy syndrome to neuromodulators. Many primary care providers have historically treated chronic non-malignant pain with opioids. While the CDC guidelines have been effective at reducing average oral morphine equivalents, most academic family medicine physicians (88.4%) report feeling confident in their ability to prescribe opioids for non-malignant chronic pain. While the CDC guidelines do state that "nonpharmacologic therapy" is preferred for chronic pain treatment over opioids, the examples used in the manuscript do not include advanced pain procedures like radiofrequency ablation and neuromodulation. This could lead to a lack of inclusion of these therapies in treatment algorithms in primary care education programs not only in the United States but around The World. In addition, since very little neuromodulation literature is published in primary care or family medicine journals, the dissemination of this literature into these fields is unknown. Lastly, these authors have found that there is little crossover between the current fields of implementation science and neuromodulation in the currently published literature. We feel that the basic principles of implementation science would lend themselves to an increased uptake of this EBP.

Implementation science is defined as

"the scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidence based practices into routine practice, and, hence, to improve the quality and effectiveness of health services".

This novel research field seeks to solve the lack of acceptance of an EBP by combining implementation interventions into a comprehensive implementation strategy that can be replicated in other institutions, health-care systems, or populations. In the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change Project (ERIC), Powell et al lists seventy-three defined implementation strategies. Examples of implementation interventions include education/training, audit and feedback, performance incentives, electronic medical record based reminders, and academic detailing. The goal of implementation science research is to propose an implementation strategy would increase the uptake of an EBP like use of neuromodulation in patients with post-laminectomy syndrome with the hopes that this implementation strategy can be widely replicated. While this may represent a fundamental change in the way that research is conducted in the field of neuromodulation, these authors feel that incorporating these types of strategies could have far-reaching patient care implications. Implementation based neuromodulation research could fuel the universal, world-wide acceptance of neuromodulation as a first line treatment for proven indications-like post-laminectomy syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome, and others.

### Epidural steroids in the management of chronic spinal pain: a systematic review [^117QkJFU]. Pain Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Epidural injection of corticosteroids is one of the most commonly used interventions in managing chronic spinal pain. However, there has been a lack of well-designed randomized, controlled studies to determine the effectiveness of epidural injections. Consequently, debate continues as to the value of epidural steroid injections in managing spinal pain.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of various types of epidural steroid injections (interlaminar, transforaminal, and caudal), in managing various types of chronic spinal pain (axial and radicular) in the neck and low back regions.

Study Design

A systematic review utilizing the criteria established by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) for evaluation of randomized and non-randomized trials, and criteria of Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review Group for randomized trials were used.

Methods

Data sources included relevant English literature performed by a librarian experienced in Evidence Based Medicine (EBM), as well as manual searches of bibliographies of known primary and review articles and abstracts from scientific meetings within the last 2 years. Three reviewers independently assessed the trials for the quality of their methods. Subgroup analyses were performed among trials with different control groups, with different techniques of epidural injections (interlaminar, transforaminal, and caudal), with different injection sites (cervical/thoracic, lumbar/sacral), and with timing of outcome measurement (short- and long-term).

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure is pain relief. Other outcome measures were functional improvement, improvement of psychological status, and return to work. Short-term improvement is defined as 6 weeks or less, and long-term relief is defined as 6 weeks or longer.

Results

In managing lumbar radicular pain with interlaminar lumbar epidural steroid injections, the evidence is strong for short-term relief and limited for long-term relief. In managing cervical radiculopathy with cervical interlaminar epidural steroid injections, the evidence is moderate. The evidence for lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections in managing lumbar radicular pain is strong for short-term and moderate for long-term relief. The evidence for cervical transforaminal epidural steroid injections in managing cervical nerve root pain is moderate. The evidence is moderate in managing lumbar radicular pain in post lumbar laminectomy syndrome. The evidence for caudal epidural steroid injections is strong for short-term relief and moderate for long-term relief, in managing chronic pain of lumbar radiculopathy and postlumbar laminectomy syndrome.

Conclusion

There is moderate evidence for interlaminar epidurals in the cervical spine and limited evidence in the lumbar spine for long-term relief. The evidence for cervical and lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections is moderate for long-term improvement in managing nerve root pain. The evidence for caudal epidural steroid injections is moderate for long-term relief in managing nerve root pain and chronic low back pain.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^1155716U]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Thoracic interlaminar epidural injections — the literature is scant in reference to thoracic epidural injections; consequently, only interlaminar epidural injections are described, with common indications including chronic mid back or upper back pain of at least 3 months duration which has failed to respond or poorly responded to non-interventional and non-surgical conservative management resulting from thoracic disc herniation/radiculitis, thoracic spinal stenosis, and thoracic post surgery syndrome.

### Cauda equina syndrome as a postoperative complication of lumbar spine surgery [^114hQAcX]. Neurosurgical Focus (2004). Low credibility.

Object

The term "cauda equina syndrome" (CES) has been used to describe the signs and symptoms in patients with compressive neuropathy of multiple lumbar and sacral roots. This syndrome is well known as an indication for surgical intervention in treating lumbar spine disease, but relatively unknown as a postoperative complication following surgery for disease. In this study the author describes two cases of CES that occurred following uneventful lumbar spine procedures — one microdiscectomy and one decompressive laminectomy.

Methods

Preoperative, operative, and postoperative management is discussed and the relevant literature reviewed. One patient suffered perineal numbness and bowel and bladder difficulty following a decompressive laminectomy. Postoperative imaging studies were negative for residual lesion and the treatment goal pursued was partial long-term resolution of symptoms. The second patient had progressive numbness and weakness in the lower extremities. Results of urgent postoperative magnetic resonance imaging studies were inconclusive and repeated exploration was performed within hours of the initial procedure. The patient made a full recovery, although the intraoperative findings did not reveal a clear cause of the patient's symptoms.

Conclusions

Postoperative symptoms of partial or complete CES represent a medical emergency, especially if they are progressive. It is necessary to perform urgent postoperative imaging in patients, but the results are not always helpful. Surgical exploration is warranted if a mass lesion is demonstrated on imaging studies or if symptoms progress and the disease origin is not clear based on available information.

### Lack of neuromodulation knowledge among rural family medicine residents: a call for implementation research [^113cgJxk]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The economic impact of chronic pain in the United States, including both medical care and loss of productivity, is approximately $635 billion dollars. While back pain composes the majority of these patients, 14.8% of patients with chronic back pain have a diagnosis of post-laminectomy syndrome. Post-laminectomy Syndrome (now referred to as persistent spine pain syndrome) is a disease of persistent and/or intermittent back pain with or without sciatica continuing for more than six months after a spine surgery. It is estimated to occur after 10% to 40% of lumbar spine operations and unfortunately, surgical success rate declines after each operative attempt.

Spinal cord stimulation for the treatment of chronic back and leg pain has been discussed in the literature since 1965 after the groundbreaking report of the gate control theory of pain by Melzack and Wall. After the clinical introduction of this therapy by Shealy in 1967, extensive work has been conducted to not only refine and improve this technology but also to demonstrate its efficacious use in the treatment of challenging pain states. The evidence behind the use of spinal cord stimulation over medical management or spine reoperation for the treatment of neuropathic back and leg pain caused by post-laminectomy syndrome is well established. With recent improvements to technology including the introduction of high frequency, novel waveforms, and closed loop feedback mechanisms, outcomes are continuing to improve.

### Comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for facet joint interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) guidelines facet joint interventions 2020 guidelines [^1143MXxc]. Pain Physician (2020). High credibility.

Facet joint interventions guidelines 2020 — post-surgical facet joint pain prevalence and diagnostic block performance are detailed: A specific etiology of back pain can be diagnosed in only about 15% of patients with certainty based on clinical examination alone; in post-surgical chronic low back pain, the prevalence of facet joint pain was 16% with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 9% to 23%, with a false positive rate with a single block with lidocaine of 49%; in post-surgical chronic neck pain, cervical facet joint origin was 36% with 50% false positive rates, with 80% relief as the criterion standard; among lumbar fusion cases, 5 of the 28 had facet joint pain, with other findings including 7 with internal disc disruption, 12 with sacroiliac joint pain, and 4 due to soft tissue irritation; in post laminectomy syndrome, the facet joint contribution showed a prevalence of 44% in patients who never underwent surgery compared to 32% in patients who underwent surgical intervention.

### Association of spinal cord stimulator implantation with persistent opioid use in patients with postlaminectomy syndrome [^113LRMqC]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, among all patients, SCS for PLS resulted in statistically significant reductions in the number of opioid prescriptions in some comparisons, but the reduction was small and its clinical relevance is questionable. However, SCS was associated with a lower rate of new opioid use in patients who were previously opioid-naive. Since one of the motivations to offer SCS to patients with PLS is to decrease or discontinue opioid use, further study is needed to evaluate this objective outcome measurement.

Low back pain and persistent spinal pain syndrome (PSPS): Case vignette and literature review

We present a case of an 81-year-old male suffering from post-laminectomy syndrome, status post L3 to pelvis fusion resulting in refractory, disabling pain. Patient experienced bilateral back and lower extremity pain on going for a 5-year period exacerbated by bending, twisting and lifting and accompanied by weakness, numbness and tingling sensations significantly impacting his ability to perform daily activities and engage in personal hobbies, as well as maintain grooming and hygiene. Patient had previously undergone both physical therapy and epidural injections but reported no relief with physical therapy and only temporary relief with injections. On physical examination, patient exhibited subjective sensory deficits in the L4 and L5 dermatomes. Given limited response to conservative management and symptoms suggestive of neuropathic pain, the patient was deemed an appropriate candidate for spinal cord stimulator trial.

Percutaneous spinal cord stimulator leads were placed intraoperatively by entering the epidural space at T12-L1 interspace using right paramedian approach. Electrodes were advanced in cephalad fashion to T8 level bilaterally. Using a combination of electrodes and polarities, successful stimulation of the patient's bilateral lower back and bilateral leg pain was obtained. On follow up visit patient endorsed 95 ​% improvement in both legs and back pain. Patient endorsed reduction in analgesic medication use, as well as improved sleep and ambulation.

Given significant improvement with trial, the patient was scheduled for permanent spinal cord stimulator placement. On subsequent follow up visits, the patient endorsed 80 ​% improvement in bilateral leg and back pain. Patient reported further decrease in analgesic medication requirement and sustained improvements in both ambulation and sleep, as well as return to activities of daily living. This case highlights the successful utilization of spinal cord stimulation as an effective treatment modality for patients suffering from post-laminectomy syndrome refractory to conservative management.

### Protocol for evaluation of the comparative effectiveness of percutaneous adhesiolysis and caudal epidural steroid injections in low back and / or lower extremity pain without post surgery syndrome or spinal stenosis [^112FXfvt]. Pain Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of chronic low back pain with or without lower extremity pain continues to be a challenge. Epidural steroids are commonly utilized in patients after the failure of conservative treatment. The results of epidural steroid injections have been variable based on the pathophysiology, the route of administration, injected drugs, and utilization of fluoroscopy. In patients resistant to fluoroscopically directed epidural injections, percutaneous epidural adhesiolysis and percutaneous targeted delivery of injections with or without adhesiolysis has been recommended. Percutaneous adhesiolysis has been studied in chronic pain syndromes related to post laminectomy syndrome and spinal stenosis with encouraging results. There is a paucity of literature regarding the effectiveness of the targeted delivery of medications with or without epidural adhesiolysis in patients recalcitrant to epidural steroid injections without a history of surgery and spinal stenosis.

Study Design

A randomized, equivalence trial of percutaneous lumbar adhesiolysis and caudal epidural steroid injections in patients with low back and/or lower extremity pain without post surgery syndrome or spinal stenosis.

Setting

An interventional pain management practice setting in the United States.

Objective

The study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of percutaneous epidural adhesiolysis in managing chronic low back and/or lower extremity pain in patients without post lumbar surgery syndrome or spinal stenosis and compare it with fluoroscopically directed caudal epidural steroid injections

Methods

The study design includes 120 patients randomly assigned into 2 groups. Group I (60 patients), the control group, will receive caudal epidural injections with catheterization up to S3 with local anesthetic, steroids, and 0.9% sodium chloride solution; Group II (60 patients), the intervention group, will receive percutaneous adhesiolysis with target delivery of lidocaine, 10% hypertonic sodium chloride solution, and non-participate betamethasone. Randomization will be performed by computer-generated random allocation sequence by simple randomization.

Outcome Measures

Multiple outcome measures will be utilized including numeric rating scale (NRS), the Oswestry Disability Index 2.0 (ODI), employment status, and opioid intake with assessment at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post treatment. Significant pain relief is considered as 50% or more, whereas significant improvement in the disability score is defined as a reduction of 40% or more.

Results

The results will be analyzed to show significant relief as well as improvement in functional status.

Limitations

This study is limited by potentially inadequate double blinding and the lack of a placebo group.

### Assessment of effectiveness of percutaneous adhesiolysis and caudal epidural injections in managing post lumbar surgery syndrome: 2-year follow-up of a randomized, controlled trial [^11566Fbz]. Journal of Pain Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The literature is replete with evaluations of failed surgery, illustrating a 9.5%-25% reoperation rate. Speculated causes of post lumbar surgery syndrome include epidural fibrosis, acquired stenosis, recurrent disc herniation, sacroiliac joint pain, and facet joint pain among other causes.

Methods

Patients (n = 120) were randomly assigned to two groups with a 2-year follow-up. Group I (control group, n = 60) received caudal epidural injections with catheterization up to S3 with local anesthetic (lidocaine 2%, 5 mL), nonparticulate betamethasone (6 mg, 1 mL), and 6 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution. Group II (intervention group, n = 60) received percutaneous adhesiolysis of the targeted area, with targeted delivery of lidocaine 2% (5 mL), 10% hypertonic sodium chloride solution (6 mL), and nonparticulate betamethasone (6 mg). The multiple outcome measures included the Numeric Rating Scale, the Oswestry Disability Index 2.0, employment status, and opioid intake with assessments at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months posttreatment. Primary outcome was defined as 50% improvement in pain and Oswestry Disability Index scores.

Results

Significant improvement with at least 50% relief with pain and improvement in functional status was illustrated in 82% of patients at the 2-year follow-up in the intervention group compared to 5% in the control group receiving caudal epidural injections. The average number of procedures over a period of 2 years in Group II was 6.4 ± 2.35 with overall total relief of approximately 78 weeks out of 104 weeks.

Conclusion

The results of this study show significant improvement in 82% of patients over a period of 2 years with an average of six to seven procedures of 1-day percutaneous adhesiolysis in patients with failed back surgery syndrome.

### Neuropathic pain after spinal intradural benign tumor surgery: an underestimated complication? [^112TJzgh]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population

We performed a monocentric retrospective cohort study of all patients undergoing surgical treatment for spinal intradural tumors between April 2009 and July 2020. Patients harboring malignant or high-graded tumors such as anaplastic ependymomas WHO grade III, astrocytomas WHO grade II and higher-graded, or intradural metastases were excluded from the analysis due to their aggressive behavior with a distinctly more complex pain syndrome.

First, we assessed preoperative data such as gender, age, type and duration of symptoms, and comorbidities. Secondly, we retrieved intraoperative information such as duration of surgery, surgical approach, and complications from the medical records. Postoperative follow-up assessment included the presence of postsurgical pain syndromes focusing on the occurrence of neuropathic pain with the need of pharmaceutical treatment, particularly including specific medication targeting neuropathic pain such as Gabapentine or Carbamazepine, as well as the neurological and clinical status using the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale (KPS). Tumor entities including tumor grading according to the World Health Organization (WHO) System were captured. We analyzed the extent of resection (EOR), location of the tumor regarding the spinal cord (intradural intramedullary vs. extramedullary), surgical information (root amputation, midline vs. lateral incision of the spinal cord), and the spinal level (cervical vs. thoracic vs. lumbar spine). The approach was classified into unilateral approach (laminotomy, hemilaminectomy, foraminotomy), laminectomy, laminoplasty, and dorsal fixation. We assessed the postoperative course and extracted long-term data from the follow-up examinations.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^115shgVx]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Lumbar radicular pain and post-lumbar surgery syndrome — percutaneous disc procedures, adhesiolysis, spinal cord stimulation (SCS), and intrathecal infusion systems are described with evidence ratings and algorithm placement. Percutaneous mechanical disc decompression includes APLD, percutaneous lumbar laser disc decompression, a mechanical high rotation per minute device utilizing an Archimedes' screw, and coblation nucleoplasty or plasma decompression, and based on the current evidence synthesis the evidence is fair for nucleoplasty and limited for APLD, mechanical disc decompression, and decompression; evidence for IDET and biacuplasty is fair and limited for discTRODE. In patients with post-lumbar surgery syndrome after failure to respond to fluoroscopically directed epidural injections, percutaneous adhesiolysis is considered, and the evidence is described as fair to good for managing post lumbar surgery syndrome and spinal stenosis with chronic low back or lower extremity pain non-responsive to conservative modalities. The next step in the radicular pain algorithm is implantable therapy with SCS and implantable infusion systems, and SCS is recommended to the patient population for whom all other appropriate medical options have been tried without sufficient improvement in pain control, with fair evidence for SCS in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain secondary to post lumbar surgery syndrome. Finally, long-term management of chronic non-cancer pain may be achieved with intrathecal infusion systems; however, there is only limited evidence and the literature is described as scant with no randomized trials meeting inclusion criteria with long-term follow-ups.

### A comparative effectiveness evaluation of percutaneous adhesiolysis and epidural steroid injections in managing lumbar post surgery syndrome: a randomized, equivalence controlled trial [^11793sk1]. Pain Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Speculated causes of post lumbar surgery syndrome include epidural fibrosis, acquired stenosis, and facet joint pain among other causes. Even though fluoroscopically directed caudal epidural injections and facet joint interventions are effective in some patients, others continue to suffer with chronic persistent pain. Percutaneous adhesiolysis with target delivery of medications has been demonstrated to be effective in these patients. However, the evidence for percutaneous adhesiolysis in managing post surgery syndrome has been questioned, coupled with a paucity of controlled trials.

Study Design

A randomized, equivalence, controlled trial.

Setting

An interventional pain management practice, a specialty referral center, a private practice setting in the United States.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of percutaneous epidural adhesiolysis in patients with chronic low back and lower extremity pain in post surgery syndrome and compare with fluoroscopically directed caudal epidural steroid injections.

Methods

Patients were randomly assigned to one of 2 groups: Group I (60 patients) receiving caudal epidural injections with catheterization up to S3 with local anesthetic, steroids, and 0.9% sodium chloride solution serving as the control group, and Group II (60 patients) receiving percutaneous adhesiolysis with targeted delivery of lidocaine, 10% hypertonic sodium chloride solution, and non-particulate Betamethasone serving as the intervention group. Randomization was performed by computer-generated random allocation sequence by simple randomization.

Outcomes Assessment

Multiple outcome measures were utilized including the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), the Oswestry Disability Index 2.0 (ODI), employment status, and opioid intake with assessment at 3, 6, and 12 months post treatment. Significant pain relief was described as 50% or more, whereas significant improvement in the disability score was defined as a reduction of 40% or more.

Results

Significant pain relief (≥ 50%) and functional status improvement was recorded in 73% of patients in Group II versus 12% in Group I (P < 0.001). The average procedures per year were 3.5 with an average total relief of 42 out of 52 weeks in Group II and 2.2 procedures with total relief per year of 13 weeks in Group I (P < 0.001).

Limitations

The results of this study are limited by potentially inadequate double blinding, by the lack of a placebo group, and the preliminary report of one-year follow-up.

Conclusions

Percutaneous adhesiolysis in chronic function-limiting, recalcitrant low back pain in post lumbar surgery syndrome demonstrated effectiveness in 73% of the patients.

### Persistent spinal pain syndrome: a proposal for failed back surgery syndrome and ICD-11 [^111QE7XX]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mixter and Barr's seminal publication in 1934 described intervertebral disc herniation as a cause of lumbago and sciatica. This description of a treatable lesion brought spine surgery into mainstream surgical practice. As spine surgery flourished, so did reports of unrelieved or even worsened pain following surgery. The first term used to describe these cases was "post-laminectomy syndrome". This was followed by a series of publications by Burton, who introduced the term Failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS). FBSS was used in subsequent publications by Ross, Wilkinson, and Law. The first published appearance of this English language term in Europe was in 1988. Over time, the use of the term FBSS has increased exponentially (Figure 1) while alternative descriptive labels have declined in use.

Figure 1.
Number of publications indexed in PubMed using the term "Failed back surgery syndrome" in the title.

Many definitions and revisions of FBSS have been proposed but failed to gain traction:

FBSS indicates persistent, new, or recurrent low back and/or lower extremity pain following one or more spine surgeries.
The outcome of lumbar spine surgery does not meet the pre-surgical expectations of both the patient and surgeon.
Surgical end stage after one or several operative interventions on the lumbar neuraxis indicated to relieve lower back pain, radicular pain, or the combination of both that has not resulted in improvements.
Lumbar (or cervical) pain of unclear origin either persisting despite surgical intervention or appearing after surgical intervention for spinal (origin) pain originally in the same anatomical distribution.
Chronic radicular pain that persists or recurs in the same distribution despite anatomically satisfactory previous spinal surgery.
Persistent or recurrent pain in the back, neck, or limbs despite surgery or treatment thought likely to relieve pain.

### Lack of neuromodulation knowledge among rural family medicine residents: a call for implementation research [^115v2DPK]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Despite high-level evidence that neuromodulation is an effective treatment for post-laminectomy/failed back syndrome, this study demonstrates that there is poor implementation of this practice by rural family medicine residents. While increased dissemination of this data through targeted education, lectures, and conferences may be helpful, we feel that the proven methods of implementation science research could be a large asset to the neuromodulation community. Ongoing discussion of how to better implement EBPs in neuromodulation is needed at practice, institutional, and society levels worldwide.

### Prevention of postlaminectomy epidural fibrosis using bioelastic materials [^112cg9yu]. Spine (2003). Low credibility.

Study Design

The use of elastic protein-based polymers for the prevention of epidural fibrosis following lumbar spine laminectomy was investigated in a rabbit model.

Objectives

To determine the safety and efficacy of two bioelastic polymers in matrix and gel forms as interpositional materials in preventing postlaminectomy epidural fibrosis.

Summary Of Background Data

Postlaminectomy epidural fibrosis complicates revision spine surgery and is implicated in cases of "failed back syndrome". Materials employed as mechanical barriers to limit tethering of neural elements by the fibrosis tissue have met with little success. A recent family of protein-based polymers, previously reported to prevent postoperative scarring and adhesions, may hold promise in treating this condition.

Methods

Sixteen female New Zealand White rabbits underwent laminectomy at L4 and L6. Two polymer compositions, each in membrane and gel forms, were implanted at a randomly assigned level in four rabbits each, with the remaining level serving as an internal control. The animals were killed at 8 weeks, and qualitative and quantitative histology and gross pathologic examination were performed for both the control and the experimental sites to assess the polymers' efficacy in preventing dorsal epidural fibrosis.

Results

The use of the polymers caused no adverse effects. Compared to the control sites, both polymers in either gel or membrane form significantly reduced the formation of epidural fibrosis and its area of contact with the dura postlaminectomy. However, no significant difference in efficacy was detected between either the polymers or their respective forms in preventing epidural fibrosis.

Conclusions

The selected compositions of biosynthetic, bioelastic polymers were safe and effective in the limiting the direct contact and consequent tethering of the underlying neural elements by the postlaminectomy epidural fibrosis in rabbits.

### Is neck pain a marker for something serious? Like myelopathy [^111ycJcd]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

Is there a role of surgery for neck pain

Laminoplasty aims to alleviate mechanical compression of the spinal cord in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), potentially leading to reversible changes that could reduce inflammation and improve cord reperfusion, thereby alleviating neck pain. However, studies have demonstrated that while laminoplasty does not exacerbate neck pain, it also does not significantly improve it. This lack of improvement may be attributed to the patients in these studies having a lower baseline prevalence of neck pain or presenting with spondylotic changes. In patients exhibiting significant spondylotic alterations, DCM, and factors contributing to dynamic spinal cord compression, laminoplasty alone may be insufficient for addressing axial neck pain. In such cases, alternative surgical interventions, such as laminectomy combined with fusion or a hybrid construct involving both anterior and posterior approaches for indirect decompression, might be necessary to relieve spinal cord pressure and mitigate other pain generators in the neck. Further research is essential to elucidate the inflammatory response in patients with DCM and axial neck pain following surgical intervention. Advanced studies employing proteomics and metabolomics are needed to identify potential causal relationships between these factors.

ASIPP Epidural Guidelines — evidence levels by indication and approach (Kaye et al) report that a review included 52 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with Level II evidence for long-term improvement in lumbar disc herniation or radiculitis using caudal, interlaminar, or transforaminal epidural injections with no significant differences among groups. The review also reports Level II for long-term management of cervical disc herniation with interlaminar epidural injections; Level II to III for thoracic disc herniation with an interlaminar approach; Level II for caudal and lumbar interlaminar injections with Level III for lumbar transforaminal injections for lumbar spinal stenosis; Level II for cervical spinal stenosis with interlaminar injection; Level II for axial or discogenic pain in the lumbar region treated with caudal or lumbar interlaminar injections, whereas Level III in the cervical region treated with cervical interlaminar injections; and Level II for post-lumbar surgery syndrome with caudal epidural injections and Level II for post cervical surgery syndrome, while it was Level III with cervical interlaminar epidural injections.

### Axial pain after posterior cervical spine surgery: a systematic review [^111tFd8z]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Posterior operative approach has been the standard treatment for cervical compressive myelopathy, and axial pain after laminoplasty or laminectomy as a postoperative complication is now gradually receiving more and more attention. The objective of this study was to provide a systematic review of the current understanding of axial pain after cervical laminoplasty and laminectomy, and summarize clinical features, influence factors and preventive measures of axial pain after posterior decompressive surgery based on a review of literature published in the English language. Axial pain distributes over nuchal, periscapular and shoulder regions. Posterior surgery is not the major cause of axial pain, but axial pain can be worsened by the procedure. There are many clinical factors that influence postoperative axial pain such as age, preoperative axial pain, different surgical technique and postoperative management, but most of them are still controversial. Several surgical modifications have been innovated to reduce axial pain. Less invasive surgery, reconstruction of the extensor musculature, avoiding detachment of the semispinalis cervicis muscle and early removal of external immobilization have proved to be effective. Axial pain is under the influence of multiple factors, so comprehensive methods are required to reduce and avoid the postoperative axial pain. Because of methodological shortcomings in publications included in this systematic review, different results from different studies may be produced due to differences in study design, evaluation criteria, sample size, and incidence or severity of axial pain. More high-quality studies are necessary for drawing more reliable and convincing conclusions.

### Outcomes reported after surgery for cauda equina syndrome: a systematic literature review [^116Hpno9]. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

Most common surgical method in studies was a laminectomy and discectomy as seen in Table 2 but there were other studies that predominantly performed surgery via a microdiscectomy. Laminectomy alone, or with instrumentation was also mentioned for CES patients. In fact, now there is an increase in the popularity of endoscopic lumbar discectomy procedurethat adds to the range of procedures available when dealing with CES secondary to disc herniation. There is no consensus in the literature as to a specific decompressive procedure to be used for CES secondary to compressive pathology. This is also another factor that may affect outcomes for these patients.

In total, there were 737 outcomes reported verbatim and categorized into 20 core outcome domains and 12 subdomains. Instead of the same term being used for each outcome, there exists 507 variations in terminology (Table 4). In addition, most of the outcomes in the included articles have no definition. Except bladder function, adverse events, need for intervention, and global quality of life, all other outcomes had "no definition" in the majority of the included articles (Figure 3). This highlights that there is significant heterogeneity in not only the outcome terminology used but the level to which it is defined in the literature. Except global quality of life, emotional functioning, role functioning, and social functioning, most outcomes did not have an assessment tool in most of the articles (Figure 3). Fourteen of the outcome domains/subdomains we categorized had multiple different assessment tools used for each of them as seen in Table 5. There is a lack of uniformity over which assessment tool is best suited for each outcome in the literature. If outcomes are being measured with different scales, scoring systems, and questionnaires then it would be difficult to synthesize these results for meaningful analyses.

### Prevalence of specific types of pain diagnoses in a sample of United States adults [^113i61Ze]. Pain Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with pain conditions place significant demands on health care services globally. Health economists have reported the annual economic cost of pain in the United States as high as $635 billion. A common challenge in treating patients suffering from chronic pain conditions is accurate diagnosis and treatment.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine the modern-day prevalence of individual types of pain diagnoses in adults.

Study Design

Retrospective analysis of Truven MarketScan® Commercial and Medicare Supplemental database.

Setting

United States patient population with a pain diagnoses from 2000 to 2012.

Methods

Multivariate analysis was used to determine the individual prevalence of specific types of pain diagnoses over a 13-year period.

Patients

We grouped the 6,575,999 patients with ICD-9 pain diagnoses into pain groupings.

Results

We determined the prevalence of pain groupings as back pain (74.7%), chronic pain (10.4%), complex regional pain syndrome (1.2%), degenerative spine disease (63.6%), limb pain (50.0%), neuritis/radiculitis (52.8%), and post-laminectomy syndrome (14.8%).

Limitations

Retrospective and non-randomized study, with a patient cohort that is weighted towards recent years and commercial insurance. Coding discrepancies that are recorded and collected for patients.

Conclusions

The demographic differences and similarities within the subgroups highlighted the concept that pain diagnoses should be considered as separate, but related entities. The present study helps us to better understand the frequency of specific pain diagnoses, and directs future studies to appropriately focus on pain diagnoses based on prevalence. This will allow increased understanding of the variation in pain diagnoses and prevent over-generalization in studies examining pain patients to more accurately reflect the varied subtypes and their economic impact.

### Percutaneous adhesiolysis in the management of chronic low back pain in post lumbar surgery syndrome and spinal stenosis: a systematic review [^116kiC4h]. Pain Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Low back pain after either post lumbar surgery syndrome or spinal stenosis in the absence of surgery is a vexing problem. Post lumbar surgery syndrome can occur in any age group, while low back and radicular pain from spinal stenosis is a disease of aging. As the population ages, the incidence of symptomatic spinal stenosis will increase. There are currently limited treatment options for either group. Further surgery is not uniformly effective in relieving pain after previous surgery. While therapies are being developed to treat pain due to spinal stenosis, no therapy other than adhesiolysis will treat pain due to scarring. Adhesiolysis was developed as a means of removing epidural scarring leading directly or indirectly to compression, inflammation, swelling, or a decreased nutritional supply of nerve roots. Adhesiolysis utilizes a number of modalities in the effort to break up epidural scarring, including the use of a wire-bound catheter for mechanical adhesiolysis, placement of the catheter in the ventro-lateral aspect of the epidural space at the site of the exiting nerve root, and the use of high volumes of injectate, including local anesthetics and saline, either hypertonic or isotonic, along with steroids.

Study Design

A systematic review of percutaneous adhesiolysis in the treatment of refractory low back and leg pain due to post lumbar surgery syndrome or spinal stenosis.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of percutaneous adhesiolysis in the treatment of refractory low back and leg pain due to post lumbar surgery syndrome or spinal stenosis. The severity of risks and adverse advents associated with percutaneous adhesiolysis were also evaluated.

Methods

The available literature on percutaneous adhesiolysis for the treatment of refractory low back and leg pain due to post lumbar surgery syndrome or spinal stenosis was reviewed. The quality assessment and clinical relevance criteria utilized were the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review Group criteria as utilized for interventional techniques for randomized trials and the criteria developed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale criteria for observational studies. The level of evidence was classified as good, fair, and limited (or poor) based on the quality of evidence developed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Data sources included relevant literature identified through searches of PubMed and EMBASE from 1966 to June 2012, and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure was pain relief of at least 6 months. Secondary outcome measures were improvement in functional status, change in psychological status, return to work, and reduction in opioid use or interventions.

Results

For this systematic review, 15 studies were identified and selected for review. Of these, 5 randomized controlled trials and 2 observational studies met the inclusion criteria. Applying the USPSTF criteria, these studies indicate that there is fair evidence that percutaneous adhesiolysis is effective in relieving low back and/or leg pain caused by post lumbar surgery syndrome and that there is fair evidence that percutaneous adhesiolysis is effective in relieving low back and/or leg pain caused by spinal stenosis. The incidence of complications from percutaneous adhesiolysis is low and the complications are generally minimal and self-limited. The procedure should be considered to be low risk for serious adverse events when performed by well-trained physicians.

Limitations

The limitations of this systematic review include the paucity of literature.

Conclusion

In summary, there is fair evidence that percutaneous adhesiolysis is effective in relieving low back and/or leg pain due to post lumbar surgery syndrome or spinal stenosis.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^112mWdzg]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Epidural injection recommendations by indication state that the evidence is good for caudal epidural, interlaminar epidural, and transforaminal epidural injections with or without steroids in managing disc herniation or radiculitis. For axial or discogenic pain, the evidence is fair for either caudal epidural or lumbar interlaminar epidural injections with or without steroids, while the evidence is limited for transforaminal epidural injections. For spinal stenosis, the evidence is fair for caudal and interlaminar injections and limited for transforaminal epidural injections with or without steroids. For post surgery syndrome, the evidence is fair for caudal epidural injections with or without steroids. Accordingly, for axial or discogenic pain, either lumbar interlaminar or caudal epidural injections are recommended, and for post surgery syndrome, the preferred modality of treatment is with caudal epidural with or without steroids.

### Lack of neuromodulation knowledge among rural family medicine residents: a call for implementation research [^1127j3bG]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Spinal cord stimulation is a proven, evidence-based therapy for persistent spinal pain syndrome. While some patients with this disease are managed by chronic pain physicians, many are managed in primary care offices. Despite mounting evidence, dissemination of this research outside of neuromodulation related fields and implementation of this treatment in common practice has not yet occurred. We hypothesize that family medicine residents in rural training programs will have little knowledge of neuromodulation despite it being an evidence-based and common treatment of post-laminectomy syndrome.

Materials and Methods

Online surveys were sent to family medicine residents in six rural family medicine training programs at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Regional Programs to characterize knowledge of neuromodulation as a treatment for post-laminectomy syndrome.

Results

Forty-one percent of responding rural, Arkansas family medicine residents reported treating post-laminectomy syndrome during their training, yet only 10% have referred a patient for neuromodulation consultation. Residents rated their knowledge of neuromodulation/spinal cord stimulation at 19 on a scale of 0 (no knowledge) to 100 (extensive knowledge).

Conclusion

Despite proof that neuromodulation is an evidence-based treatment for post-laminectomy/failed back syndrome, rural family medicine residents have limited knowledge about the therapy and many do not consider a referral for neuromodulation. Further research to ascertain effective implementation strategies to increase the uptake of neuromodulation for patients with post-laminectomy syndrome is desperately needed.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^1177AWNf]. Pain Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for interventional techniques in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic spinal pain.

Methodology

Systematic assessment of the literature.

Evidence

I. Lumbar Spine
- The evidence for accuracy of diagnostic selective nerve root blocks is limited; whereas for lumbar provocation discography, it is fair.
- The evidence for diagnostic lumbar facet joint nerve blocks and diagnostic sacroiliac intraarticular injections is good with 75% to 100% pain relief as criterion standard with controlled local anesthetic or placebo blocks.
- The evidence is good in managing disc herniation or radiculitis for caudal, interlaminar, and transforaminal epidural injections; fair for axial or discogenic pain without disc herniation, radiculitis or facet joint pain with caudal, and interlaminar epidural injections, and limited for transforaminal epidural injections; fair for spinal stenosis with caudal, interlaminar, and transforaminal epidural injections; and fair for post surgery syndrome with caudal epidural injections and limited with transforaminal epidural injections.
- The evidence for therapeutic facet joint interventions is good for conventional radiofrequency, limited for pulsed radiofrequency, fair to good for lumbar facet joint nerve blocks, and limited for intraarticular injections.
- For sacroiliac joint interventions, the evidence for cooled radiofrequency neurotomy is fair; limited for intraarticular injections and periarticular injections; and limited for both pulsed radiofrequency and conventional radiofrequency neurotomy.
- For lumbar percutaneous adhesiolysis, the evidence is fair in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain secondary to post surgery syndrome and spinal stenosis.
- For intradiscal procedures, the evidence for intradiscal electrothermal therapy (IDET) and biaculoplasty is limited to fair and is limited for discTRODE.
- For percutaneous disc decompression, the evidence is limited for automated percutaneous lumbar discectomy (APLD), percutaneous lumbar laser disc decompression, and Dekompressor; and limited to fair for nucleoplasty for which the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has issued a noncoverage decision. II. Cervical Spine
- The evidence for cervical provocation discography is limited; whereas the evidence for diagnostic cervical facet joint nerve blocks is good with a criterion standard of 75% or greater relief with controlled diagnostic blocks.
- The evidence is good for cervical interlaminar epidural injections for cervical disc herniation or radiculitis; fair for axial or discogenic pain, spinal stenosis, and post cervical surgery syndrome.
- The evidence for therapeutic cervical facet joint interventions is fair for conventional cervical radiofrequency neurotomy and cervical medial branch blocks, and limited for cervical intraarticular injections. III. Thoracic Spine
- The evidence is limited for thoracic provocation discography and is good for diagnostic accuracy of thoracic facet joint nerve blocks with a criterion standard of at least 75% pain relief with controlled diagnostic blocks.
- The evidence is fair for thoracic epidural injections in managing thoracic pain.
- The evidence for therapeutic thoracic facet joint nerve blocks is fair, limited for radiofrequency neurotomy, and not available for thoracic intraarticular injections. IV. Implantables
- The evidence is fair for spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in managing patients with failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) and limited for implantable intrathecal drug administration systems. V. ANTICOAGULATION
- There is good evidence for risk of thromboembolic phenomenon in patients with antithrombotic therapy if discontinued, spontaneous epidural hematomas with or without traumatic injury in patients with or without anticoagulant therapy to discontinue or normalize INR with warfarin therapy, and the lack of necessity of discontinuation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including low dose aspirin prior to performing interventional techniques.
- There is fair evidence with excessive bleeding, including epidural hematoma formation with interventional techniques when antithrombotic therapy is continued, the risk of higher thromboembolic phenomenon than epidural hematomas with discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy prior to interventional techniques and to continue phosphodiesterase inhibitors (dipyridamole, cilostazol, and Aggrenox).
- There is limited evidence to discontinue antiplatelet therapy with platelet aggregation inhibitors to avoid bleeding and epidural hematomas and/or to continue antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel, ticlopidine, prasugrel) during interventional techniques to avoid cerebrovascular and cardiovascular thromboembolic fatalities.
- There is limited evidence in reference to newer antithrombotic agents dabigatran (Pradaxa) and rivaroxan (Xarelto) to discontinue to avoid bleeding and epidural hematomas and are continued during interventional techniques to avoid cerebrovascular and cardiovascular thromboembolic events.

Conclusions

Evidence is fair to good for 62% of diagnostic and 52% of therapeutic interventions assessed.

### A review of emerging evidence for utilization of a percutaneous interspinous process decompression device to treat symptomatic lumbar adjacent-segment degeneration [^113cTB1o]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Spinal cord stimulation has been an indicated treatment modality for postlaminectomy syndrome since gaining approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1989. North et al. published a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing outcomes in subjects with postlaminectomy syndrome who were assigned to either undergo implantation of an early-generation conventional stimulation system or proceed with repeat decompressive spine surgery. In this study, nine of 19 (47%) individuals with successful stimulator trials and subsequent permanent implantation reported > 50% improvement in pain and high levels of satisfaction at the 24-month follow-up, whereas only three of 26 (12%) individuals who underwent repeat spine surgery achieved successful outcomes. North et al. later published a cost-utility comparison of treating postlaminectomy syndrome with either early generations of spinal cord stimulation technology or reoperation. They reported that spinal cord stimulation was both more clinically effective and significantly less expensive than reoperation procedures (mean cost per patient success was $117,901 for spinal cord stimulation; no reported cases of success for reoperation despite mean per-patient expenditure of $260,584). The authors of these studies concluded that conventional spinal cord stimulator implantation should be offered early for individuals with postlaminectomy syndrome as an alternative to repeat decompressive spine surgery.

### Comparison of 3 approaches to percutaneous epidural adhesiolysis and neuroplasty in post lumbar surgery syndrome [^111jBkGp]. Pain Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Percutaneous epidural adhesiolysis and neuroplasty (PEAN) has been proven to be safe and effective in treating different spine pathologies, in particular post lumbar surgery syndrome (PLSS).

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and complication rates of the 3 different PEAN anatomical approaches (caudal, S1 foraminal, and L5-S1 transforaminal) used to treat PLSS.

Study Design

This study used a case control, blind study.

Setting

The research took place at the pain clinic and interventional pain practice room at Asyut University Hospital, Assiut, Egypt.

Methods

Sixty consecutive PLSS patients were recruited and randomized into 3 groups (caudal, S1 foraminal, and L5-S1 transforaminal) before receiving adhesiolysis and neuroplasty. All patients underwent nerve conduction studies and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Pain severity levels were assessed and measured using the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (OSW) and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Patient satisfaction was evaluated using a Likert scale. The first assessment was performed prior to the procedure to determine the patients' baseline levels of pain severity. Follow-up assessments were performed 1-, 3-, and 6-months after the procedure.

Results

Results of the group pairwise analysis indicated that, relative to baseline, there were significant decreases in pain relief scores (VAS and OWS) and functional assessment expressed by patients' satisfaction across all time intervals and in all 3 groups (P < 0.01). Conversely, a between group analysis revealed that VAS, OWS, and patient satisfaction scores were comparable across the 3 groups at all time intervals (P > 0.05). There were no differences in rates of complications between the 3 different groups.

Limitations

Our study was limited by the low number of patients and the short duration (6 months) of follow-up.

Conclusion

The 3 anatomical approaches (caudal, S1 foraminal, and L5-S1 transforaminal) result in the same outcome with regard to pain relief and complication rate.

Key Words

Post lumber surgery syndrome, post laminectomy back pain, percutaneous adhesiolysis, Racz catheter, percutaneous neuroplasty.

### Caudal epidural injections in the management of chronic low back pain: a systematic appraisal of the literature [^112oxEzJ]. Pain Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Epidural injections with local anesthetics and steroids are one of the most commonly used interventions in managing chronic low back pain and lower extremity pain of various causes. However, despite their extensive use, debate continues on their effectiveness due to the lack of well-designed, randomized, controlled studies to determine the effectiveness of epidural injections in general, and caudal epidural injections in particular.

Study Design

A systematic review of caudal epidural injections with or without steroids in managing chronic pain secondary to lumbar disc herniation or radiculitis, post lumbar laminectomy syndrome, spinal stenosis, and discogenic pain without disc herniation or radiculitis.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of caudal epidural injections with or without steroids in managing various types of chronic low back pain with or without lower extremity pain emanating as a result of disc herniation or radiculitis, post lumbar laminectomy syndrome, spinal stenosis, and chronic discogenic pain.

Methods

The available literature on caudal epidural injections with or without steroids in managing various types of chronic low back pain with or without lower extremity pain was reviewed. The quality assessment and clinical relevance criteria utilized were the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review Group criteria as utilized for interventional techniques for randomized trials and the criteria developed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale criteria for fluoroscopic observational studies. The level of evidence was classified as good, fair, or poor based on the quality of evidence developed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Data sources included relevant literature identified through searches of PubMed and EMBASE from 1966 to December 2011, and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure was pain relief (short-term relief = up to 6 months and long-term > 6 months). Secondary outcome measures of improvement in functional status, psychological status, return to work, and reduction in opioid intake were utilized.

Results

For this systematic review, 73 studies were identified. Of these, 51 were excluded and a total of 16 studies met inclusion criteria for methodological quality assessment with 11 randomized trials and 5 non-randomized studies. For lumbar disc herniation, the evidence is good for short- and long-term relief of chronic pain secondary to disc herniation or radiculitis with local anesthetic and steroids and fair relief with local anesthetic only. In managing chronic axial or discogenic pain, spinal stenosis, and post surgery syndrome, the indicated evidence is fair.

Limitations

The limitations of this study include the paucity of literature, specifically for chronic pain without disc herniation.

Conclusion

There was good evidence for short- and long-term relief of chronic pain secondary to disc herniation or radiculitis with local anesthetic and steroids and fair relief with local anesthetic only. Further, this systematic review also provided indicated evidence of fair for caudal epidural injections in managing chronic axial or discogenic pain, spinal stenosis, and post surgery syndrome.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^113W64En]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

Lumbar post-surgery syndrome — definition, etiologies, incidence, and interventional management: Failed back surgery syndrome is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as persistent or recurrent pain mainly in the lower back or legs after previously anatomically successful surgeries, with frequent or recurrent leg pain reported in 5% to 36% of patients 2 years after the operation and other literature showing occurrence rates from 10% to 40%. Patients with extensive epidural fibrosis were 3.2 times more likely to experience recurrent radicular pain than those with less scarring, and described abnormalities include mechanical tethering of nerve roots, disturbances in blood flow, and expression of proinflammatory cytokines with irritation of the dorsal root ganglion. Consequently, in post-lumbar surgery syndrome, a multitude of pathophysiologic bases have been described including recurrent disc herniation, scarring and entrapment of the nerve roots and discogenic pain. These can be addressed with epidural interventions, either with epidural injections or percutaneous adhesiolysis, and multiple RCTs and systematic reviews have been performed with caudal epidural injections as well as percutaneous adhesiolysis in post-lumbar surgery syndrome.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^114wCn3G]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Disc-related pathology, spinal stenosis, and radiculitis — definitions and epidemiology are summarized: chronic, persistent low back, lower extremity pain, and radicular pain may be secondary to disc herniation, disc disruption, disc degeneration, spinal stenosis, or post lumbar surgery syndrome with or without radiculitis; a herniated lumbar disc is defined as displacement of disc material beyond the intervertebral disc space; magnetic resonance imaging findings of a herniated disc are not always accompanied by clinical symptoms; the prevalence of a symptomatic herniated lumbar disc is about 1% to 3%, occurring most often among people aged 30 to 50 years, with a male to female ratio of 2:1.

### Pain management after laminectomy: a systematic review and procedure-specific post-operative pain management (prospect) recommendations [^117DAj2n]. European Spine Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

With lumbar laminectomy increasingly being performed on an outpatient basis, optimal pain management is critical to avoid post-operative delay in discharge and readmission. The aim of this review was to evaluate the available literature and develop recommendations for optimal pain management after one- or two-level lumbar laminectomy.

Methods

A systematic review utilizing the PROcedure-SPECific Post-operative Pain ManagemenT (PROSPECT) methodology was undertaken. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in the English language from 1 January 2008 until 31 March 2020-assessing post-operative pain using analgesic, anaesthetic and surgical interventions-were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Databases.

Results

Out of 65 eligible studies identified, 39 RCTs met the inclusion criteria. The analgesic regimen for lumbar laminectomy should include paracetamol and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective inhibitor administered preoperatively or intraoperatively and continued post-operatively, with post-operative opioids for rescue analgesia. In addition, surgical wound instillation or infiltration with local anaesthetics prior to wound closure is recommended. Some interventions-gabapentinoids and intrathecal opioid administration-although effective, carry significant risks and consequently were omitted from the recommendations. Other interventions were also not recommended because there was insufficient, inconsistent or lack of evidence.

Conclusion

Perioperative pain management for lumbar laminectomy should include paracetamol and NSAID- or COX-2-specific inhibitor, continued into the post-operative period, as well as intraoperative surgical wound instillation or infiltration. Opioids should be used as rescue medication post-operatively. Future studies are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of our recommendations.

### Treatment of a large cohort of veterans experiencing musculoskeletal disorders with spinal cord stimulation in the veterans health administration: veteran characteristics and outcomes [^112JkGDg]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The current study describes the demographic and clinical characteristics of veterans who received SCS implants in VHA settings during the study period. Among the three diagnoses examined, the likelihood of receiving an SCS particularly increased with diagnoses of either post-laminectomy syndrome of the lumbar region and/or thoracic or lumbosacral neuritis or radiculitis. Many veterans had more than one MSD inclusion diagnosis which increased their odds for an SCS implant. This suggests more serious and/or complex cases were more likely to get this more invasive treatment option. In particular, all post-laminectomy groups had high rates of SCS implants, relative to their inclusion rate in the analytic sample.

White, aged 35–44 years, and married veterans with the selected diagnoses of interest had greater odds of receiving an SCS implant. It is possible that the difference in SCS implant receipt reflects an age- or race-related difference in access to this pain management treatment. An alternative explanation for the observed age difference is that older veterans may have received an SCS implant prior to the starting date of the MSD cohort, and, as a result, would be less likely to need an SCS during the study time period. Younger veterans also may have been in better health and/or more willing to accept newer technology or surgical interventions. Race differences could reflect differences in veteran preferences or potentially provider bias.

### Cervical interlaminar epidural injections in the treatment of cervical disc herniation, post surgery syndrome, or discogenic pain: cost utility analysis from randomized trials [^113kR2M8]. Pain Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Neck pain is one of the major conditions attributing to overall disability in the United States. There have been multiple publications assessing clinical and cost effectiveness of multiple modalities of interventions in managing chronic neck pain. Even then, the literature has been considered sparse in relation to cervical interlaminar epidural injections in managing chronic neck pain. In contrast, cost utility studies of lumbar interlaminar injections, caudal epidural injections, cervical and lumbar facet joint nerve blocks, percutaneous adhesiolysis demonstrated costs of less than $3,500 for quality-adjusted life year (QALY).

Objectives

To assess the cost utility of cervical interlaminar epidural injections in managing chronic neck and/or upper extremity pain secondary to cervical disc herniation, post-surgery syndrome in neck, and axial or discogenic neck pain.

Study Design

Analysis based on 3 previously published randomized trials of the effectiveness of cervical interlaminar epidural injections assessing their role in disc herniation, cervical post-surgery syndrome, and axial or discogenic pain.

Setting

A contemporary, private, specialty referral interventional pain management center in the United States.

Methods

Cost utility of cervical interlaminar epidural injections with or without steroids in managing cervical disc herniation, cervical post-surgery syndrome, and cervical discogenic or axial neck back pain was conducted with data derived from 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included a 2-year follow-up, with inclusion of 356 patients. The primary outcome was significant improvement defined as at least 50% in pain reduction and disability status. Direct payment data from all carriers from 2018 was utilized for the assessment of procedural costs. Overall costs, including drug costs, were determined by multiplication of direct procedural payment data by a factor of 1.67 to accommodate for indirect payments respectively for disc herniation, discogenic pain, and cervical post-surgery syndrome.

Results

The results of the 3 RCTs showed direct cost utility for one year of QALY of $2,412.31 for axial or discogenic pain without disc herniation, $2,081.07 for disc herniation, and $2,309.20 for post surgery syndrome, with an average cost per one year QALY of $2,267.57, with total estimated overall costs with addition of indirect costs of $3,475.38, $4,028.55, $3,856.36, and $3,785.89 respectively.

Limitations

The limitation of this cost utility analysis includes that it is a single center evaluation. Indirect costs were extrapolated.

Conclusion

This cost utility analysis of cervical interlaminar epidural injections in patients nonresponsive to conservative management in the treatment of disc herniation, post surgery syndrome and axial or discogenic neck pain shows $2,267.57 for direct costs with a total cost of $3,785.89 per QALY.

### Review article: MRI of the postoperative lumbar spine [^112yB4m5]. Neuroradiology (2002). Low credibility.

Imaging assessment of the lumbosacral spine following surgery is complex and depends upon several factors, including the anatomy of the patient, the surgical procedure and the disease process for which it was performed, the age of the patient, the biomechanical condition of the underlying cortical and cancellous bone, intervertebral disc and musculoligamentous tissues, the time since surgery procedure and the duration and nature of the postsurgical syndrome. Depending upon these factors, one or a combination of complementary imaging modalities may be required to demonstrate any clinically relevant abnormality, to assist the surgeon in deciding if repeat surgery is necessary, its nature and at which vertebral level(s) it should be directed. This review stresses the important role of MRI following lumbar discectomy, intervertebral fusion and/or instrumentation in achieving the most beneficial and timely outcome in the patient presenting with an acute, subacute or chronic failed back surgery syndrome.
