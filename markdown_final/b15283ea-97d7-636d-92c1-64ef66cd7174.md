## Question

Lactate range

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the lactate range, including normal values, thresholds for hyperlactatemia, prognostic cutoffs, and how to interpret serial changes in critically ill patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the normal physiologic range in unstressed individuals. Then, I should verify how "normal" is defined in critically ill patients and why that differs. Next, I will examine thresholds for hyperlactatemia and their prognostic meaning, including relative hyperlactatemia. After that, I need to check how serial lactate kinetics inform prognosis and guide therapy. Finally, I will consider special populations, measurement nuances, and synthesize a practical clinical framework with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the normal physiologic range in unstressed adults. In healthy individuals, basal lactate is typically around 1.0 ± 0.5 mmol/L, and many laboratories cite a reference interval of roughly 0.5–2.0 mmol/L, which aligns with regulatory and clinical summaries noting a normal plasma lactate of about 0.9–1.9 mEq/L, acknowledging that units are equivalent to mmol/L in this context [^98e69fc3] [^c767af26].

> Wait, let me verify how "normal" shifts in critical illness. In the ICU, a lactate up to 2.0 mmol/L is often considered "within normal limits", but this is a conservative convention rather than a physiologic truth; importantly, even values within this so-called normal range carry risk, and the concept of relative hyperlactatemia has emerged to capture mortality risk at lactate levels above about 0.75–1.35 mmol/L in critically ill cohorts, well below 2.0 mmol/L [^98e69fc3] [^72a1e690] [^e95f254b].

> I will now examine thresholds for hyperlactatemia and their prognostic implications. Hyperlactatemia is generally defined as lactate greater than 2.0 mmol/L, and lactate at or above 4.0 mmol/L with concurrent hypotension is part of the Sepsis-3 definition of septic shock and is consistently associated with higher mortality; in fact, lactate ≥ 4.0 mmol/L carries a markedly increased risk of death in sepsis cohorts, with sensitivities and specificities around 66–83% and 80–85% for predicting sepsis, underscoring that lactate alone is neither sensitive nor specific enough to diagnose sepsis without clinical context [^e8beae2a] [^40e9372e] [^821765fc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "normal" lactate being safe. I should double-check the data on relative hyperlactatemia. Multiple studies show that lactate levels within the reference range, particularly above about 1.35 mmol/L, independently predict hospital and ICU mortality; in a large multicenter cohort, mortality risk began to rise even above 0.75 mmol/L, and time-weighted lactate within the normal range remained strongly associated with death, suggesting that both magnitude and duration of even modest elevations matter [^e95f254b] [^72a1e690] [^bd174031].

> Next, I should review lactate kinetics and clearance. Let me think about the time course: in optimal resuscitation, lactate typically declines by more than 10% within 1–2 hours, and a decrease over 6–24 hours correlates with improved survival across heterogeneous critically ill populations; however, I need to ensure I don't mislabel this as "clearance", because changes reflect both decreased production and altered clearance, and the term "lactate clearance" is pharmacokinetically imprecise even though it remains in common clinical usage [^ff001648] [^cf2b3786] [^e0040451].

> I should confirm practical monitoring cadence. Serial lactate every 1–2 hours early in resuscitation is reasonable in acute conditions, with many protocols targeting a relative decrease of about 10–20% over 1–2 hours; in children, normalization within 2–4 hours is associated with reduced persistent organ dysfunction, and in adults, early lactate measurement and remeasurement within a few hours are associated with better outcomes, reinforcing the value of trending rather than isolated values [^ff001648] [^b2e974c9] [^72f43252].

> But wait, what if the patient is not septic or the lactate is high for non-hypoxic reasons. I need to check for type B etiologies and clearance issues: catecholamine-driven aerobic glycolysis, impaired hepatic clearance, thiamine deficiency, mitochondrial dysfunction, and exogenous lactate sources can all elevate lactate even when oxygen delivery is adequate; this is why lactate must be interpreted alongside clinical perfusion, acid–base status, and organ function, and why persistent elevation despite resuscitation should prompt reassessment of both production and clearance mechanisms [^85d20524] [^5064cd17] [^016a9d71].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. In pregnancy and labor, lactate rises with maternal pushing and can exceed 2.0 mmol/L even in uncomplicated deliveries, so I should avoid overcalling sepsis solely on a single elevated value during the second stage; in neonates, brain lactate is higher early in life and declines with maturation, which matters when interpreting MR spectroscopy; in trauma, lactate is a sensitive marker of hemorrhagic shock and guides resuscitation; in acute mesenteric ischemia, a normal lactate does not exclude the diagnosis, so I should not anchor falsely on a normal value [^4cd92158] [^9908e130] [^24dc4bc2] [^8c99f25d].

> I should double-check measurement nuances. Peripheral venous lactate is acceptable for screening, but agreement with arterial lactate worsens in hyperlactatemia; a peripheral venous lactate ≤ 2.0 mmol/L reliably rules out arterial hyperlactatemia, whereas values above 2.0 mmol/L should be confirmed arterially when decisions hinge on accuracy; tourniquet time should be minimized to avoid spurious elevation, and serial measurements should be obtained from a consistent source when possible [^39e30589] [^9e0dc449].

> Let me synthesize a practical clinical framework. Normal lactate in unstressed adults is about 1.0 ± 0.5 mmol/L, but in critically ill patients, risk begins to rise above roughly 1.35 mmol/L, hyperlactatemia is defined at > 2.0 mmol/L, and lactate ≥ 4.0 mmol/L with hypotension signifies septic shock; serial lactate trends every 1–2 hours early on, with a target of at least a 10–20% relative decrease over 1–2 hours, provide more prognostic and therapeutic insight than isolated values, and persistent elevation should trigger reassessment of perfusion, clearance, and alternative etiologies rather than reflexive escalation alone [^98e69fc3] [^e8beae2a] [^ff001648] [^364ebebe].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the "normal" ICU upper limit of 2.0 mmol/L meant values below that were benign; hold on, I should verify and correct that. Even lactate levels within the 1.0–2.0 mmol/L band carry increased mortality risk in critical illness, so I need to treat trends and context with caution and avoid false reassurance from a "normal" single value, especially if the clinical picture suggests hypoperfusion or ongoing stress [^72a1e690] [^e95f254b] [^bd174031].

---

The normal lactate range in adults is **0.5–2.0 mmol/L** (5–20 mg/dL) [^c767af26]. Levels above 2.0 mmol/L indicate hyperlactatemia, and values ≥ 4.0 mmol/L with pH < 7.35 define lactic acidosis [^5064cd17]. In critically ill patients, even mild elevations within the "normal" range are associated with increased mortality, so lactate should be interpreted in clinical context and trended over time [^72a1e690] [^e95f254b]. Serial lactate measurements every 1–2 hours are recommended in acute settings to assess response to therapy and guide resuscitation [^ff001648] [^e0040451].

---

## Normal lactate range

- **Normal range**: 0.5–2.0 mmol/L (5–20 mg/dL) in adults [^c767af26].
- **Physiological variation**: Resting lactate is typically 1.0 ± 0.5 mmol/L; exercise or stress can transiently increase levels without pathology [^98e69fc3] [^6d04571b].
- **Units**: 1 mmol/L = 9.01 mg/dL; ensure consistent units when interpreting results [^notfound].

---

## Hyperlactatemia and lactic acidosis

- **Hyperlactatemia**: Lactate > 2.0 mmol/L [^5064cd17].
- **Lactic acidosis**: Lactate ≥ 4.0 mmol/L with pH < 7.35 [^5064cd17].
- **Type A**: Tissue hypoxia from shock, hypoxemia, or anemia [^5064cd17].
- **Type B**: Non-hypoxic causes such as sepsis, liver disease, malignancy, or drugs [^5064cd17].

---

## Clinical significance of lactate levels

Lactate is a **marker of tissue hypoperfusion and metabolic stress** [^2255fc2e]; elevated levels correlate with illness severity and mortality across settings [^be6578c5]. Even mild elevations within the "normal" range are associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients, so lactate should be interpreted in clinical context and trended over time [^72a1e690] [^e95f254b].

| **Lactate level (mmol/l)** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| 0.5–2.0 | Normal range |
| 2.1–4.0 | Mild hyperlactatemia; increased risk in critical illness |
| ≥ 4.0 | Severe hyperlactatemia; high mortality, especially with hypotension [^821765fc] |

---

## Lactate measurement and interpretation

- **Sampling**: Arterial or venous blood; peripheral venous lactate is acceptable in emergencies, but arterial samples are preferred for accuracy [^39e30589].
- **Serial measurements**: Recommended every 1–2 hours in acute settings to assess response to therapy [^ff001648] [^e0040451].
- **Clearance**: A decrease > 10% over 1–2 hours suggests improved perfusion; persistent elevation warrants reassessment of therapy [^cc8bf0d4].

---

## Factors influencing lactate levels

Several factors can elevate lactate independent of hypoxia, including **hepatic dysfunction** (reduced clearance), **renal impairment** (reduced elimination), **catecholamines** (increased aerobic glycolysis), and **exogenous lactate** (e.g. lactated Ringer's) [^5064cd17] [^2255fc2e]. Interpretation should account for these contributors to avoid misattribution to hypoperfusion [^364ebebe].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Sepsis**: Measure lactate in suspected sepsis; guide resuscitation to normalize lactate when elevated [^802f3d97] [^e2fb61fd].
- **Pediatrics**: Lactate is useful for risk stratification and guiding resuscitation in pediatric sepsis, though evidence is weaker than in adults [^b2e974c9] [^6a130a6f].
- **Trauma**: Lactate helps assess hemorrhagic shock and guide resuscitation [^24dc4bc2] [^a86283f7].

---

## Limitations and pitfalls

Lactate is **neither sensitive nor specific** for sepsis or hypoperfusion; results must be interpreted in clinical context [^40e9372e] [^f2eeaee0]. Persistent elevation may reflect impaired clearance rather than ongoing hypoxia, especially in liver disease [^016a9d71]. Non-hypoxic causes (e.g. catecholamines, malignancy) can elevate lactate and confound interpretation [^5064cd17].

---

The normal lactate range is **0.5–2.0 mmol/L**; values above this indicate hyperlactatemia, and ≥ 4.0 mmol/L with pH < 7.35 defines lactic acidosis. Serial lactate measurements and clinical context are essential for accurate interpretation and guiding therapy.

Dashed lines represent an unfavorable course and suggest the need for treatment to be reviewed, if this has not already been done, because the current management is likely ineffective

We performed a literature search on this subject to address several questions. First, is the observation of a better prognosis with decreasing lactate concentrations a consistent finding in all types of critically ill patient? Second, although some studies have suggested that repeated lactate measurements may be particularly useful in sepsis, can similar observations be made in other acute disease states or even in heterogeneous groups of critically ill patients? Third, how fast should lactate concentrations decrease in optimal conditions and is there any particular time interval that could be recommended? Fourth, some studies in emergency medicine considered only patients with lactate values > 4 mEq/l as an at-risk population, but is this approach valid? In other words, is the study of lactate kinetics more useful when lactate concentrations exceed a given value?

### Even mild hyperlactatemia is associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients [^6c2213f1]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hyperlactatemia (> 2 m M) has been shown to be an independent predictor of mortality in different groups of critically ill patients, such as those with sepsis, with or without organ failure, trauma, and acute inflammatory response syndrome. It has been also used to guide management of critically ill patients. For example, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and early goal-directed therapy recommend resuscitation of sepsis patients with lactate > 4 m M. In clinical practice, less attention is paid to lactate levels within the reference range (≤ 2 m M), as their clinical significance is not well understood. Studies have suggested that relative hyperlactatemia in patients with septic shock has been associated with mortality, indicating that lactate might remain normal before and during resuscitation, thus questioning what is the best cutoff threshold of lactate that should trigger resuscitation. However, data in this area remain limited. Therefore, we sought to determine the best cutoff threshold for serum lactate that is within the reference range (0.01 to 2.00 m M) that best discriminates between survivors and nonsurvivors of critical illness and to examine the association between relative hyperlactatemia (lactate above the identified threshold) and mortality.

### Lactate as a marker of energy failure in critically ill patients: hypothesis [^acc4ecfd]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Lactate measurement in the critically ill has been traditionally used to stratify patients with poor outcome. However, plasma lactate levels are the result of a finely tuned interplay of factors that affect the balance between its production and its clearance. When the oxygen supply does not match its consumption, organisms such as man who are forced to produce ATP for their integrity adapt in many different ways up to the point when energy failure occurs. Lactate, being part of the adaptive response, may then be used to assess the severity of the supply/demand imbalance. In such a scenario, the time to intervention becomes relevant: early and effective treatment may allow the cell to revert to a normal state, as long as the oxygen machinery (i.e. mitochondria) is intact. Conversely, once the mitochondria are deranged, energy failure occurs even in the presence of normoxia. The lactate increase in critically ill patients may therefore be viewed as an early marker of a potentially reversible state.

### Relative hyperlactatemia and hospital mortality in critically ill patients: a retrospective multi-centre study [^72a1e690]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Higher lactate concentrations within the normal reference range (relative hyperlactatemia) are not considered clinically significant. We tested the hypothesis that relative hyperlactatemia is independently associated with an increased risk of hospital death.

Methods

This observational study examined a prospectively obtained intensive care database of 7,155 consecutive critically ill patients admitted to the Intensive Care Units (ICUs) of four Australian university hospitals. We assessed the relationship between ICU admission lactate, maximal lactate and time-weighted lactate levels and hospital outcome in all patients and also in those patients whose lactate concentrations (admission n = 3,964, maximal n = 2,511, and time-weighted n = 4,584) were under 2 mmol.L-1 (i.e. relative hyperlactatemia).

Results

We obtained 172,723 lactate measurements. Higher admission and time-weightedlactate concentration within the reference range was independently associated with increased hospital mortality (admission odds ratio (OR) 2.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 3.5, P = 0.01; time-weighted OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.9 to 7.00, P < 0.0001). This significant association was first detectable at lactate concentrations > 0.75 mmol.L-1. Furthermore, in patients whose lactate ever exceeded 2 mmol.L-1, higher time-weighted lactate remained strongly associated with higher hospital mortality (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.8 to 12.4, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

In critically ill patients, relative hyperlactataemia is independently associated with increased hospital mortality. Blood lactate concentrations > 0.75 mmol.L-1 can be used by clinicians to identify patients at higher risk of death. The current reference range for lactate in the critically ill may need to be re-assessed.

### Utility of lactate levels in the diagnosis and prognosis of septic shock [^bc4bce9e]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Early recognition of septic shock and its treatment are key factors for limiting progression to multiple organ dysfunction and death. Lactate, a byproduct of metabolic pathways, is usually elevated in tissue hypoperfusion and shock and is associated with poor prognosis in sepsis. As a biomarker, it may help the clinician in risk stratification, and the identification and treatment of sepsis. In this article, we provide an update on lactate's pathophysiology and role in diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis in children with sepsis and septic shock.

### Relative hyperlactatemia and hospital mortality in critically ill patients: a retrospective multi-centre study [^5e7b7360]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

In healthy individuals there is a continuous cycle of lactate production and metabolism, which ensures that blood lactate concentrations are normally low. Higher blood lactate concentrations occur when lactate production exceeds clearance, when clearance capacity is decreased or more frequently when both occur simultaneously. Elevated blood lactate concentrations above the accepted normal reference range (absolute hyperlactataemia) are common and associated with increased hospital mortality in the critically ill. Their usefulness in identifying critically ill patients at higher risk of death has led to the adoption of lactate measurement in most blood gas analyzers and the frequent measurement of lactate in the critically ill.

While the normal lactate concentration in unstressed individuals is 1.0 ± 0.5 mmol.L -1, patients with critical illness are considered to have normal lactate levels at concentrations of less than 2 mmol.L -1. Furthermore, this 2 mmol.L -1 cut off may be considered to be a conservative threshold as some have suggested that a level of up to 4 mmol.L -1 is within the normal limits.

However, it is unknown whether a higher blood lactate concentration within the current reference range (relative hyperlactataemia) might also be associated with increased hospital mortality. This knowledge would be clinically important because the currently used upper reference limit for lactatemia may fail to identify many patients who are at higher risk of death.

We hypothesized that higher blood lactate concentrations within the reference range would be associated with an increased risk of hospital death and investigated the relationship between ICU admission, maximal and time-weighted blood lactate concentrations and hospital mortality in a large cohort of critically ill patients.

### The ten pitfalls of lactate clearance in sepsis [^04140aeb]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Lactate as a goal of what?

The complexity of lactate as a molecule, substrate, biomarker, energy source, component of some intravenous fluids, and major modulator of cellular bioenergetics during physiological stress is formidable. Such complexity makes it impossible to define what goal it should be a marker or target of. Seeking to lower lactate levels (by whatever means given the multiple events that regulate its blood levels) has no credibility and no logic in terms of hemodynamics, bioenergetics, or tissue protection. In fact, it could make more biological sense to assist the natural process of lactate utilization and generation during sepsis or during other physiological stress situations by administering lactate. Until we are able to define the goals that we wish to achieve by manipulating lactate and have the means of measuring whether we have achieved such goals or not, the idea of seeking to lower lactate by increasing its "clearance" in sepsis is both an illusion and a folly.

Lactate — initial ED testing, thresholds, and repeat strategy are specified as follows: We support initially measuring blood lactate levels in the ED (venous or arterial) and repeating lactate measurement after initial resuscitation only if elevated above 4 mmol/L or if there is suspicion of clinical deterioration, and we endorse the use of venous lactate specimens. Convenient thresholds used to note abnormal elevation are more than 2.0 mmol/L and more than 4.0 mmol/L; the most convincing data of benefit from repeat measurements studied those with an initial lactate level of at least 4 mmol/L, with a common practice of measuring lactate in 2-hour intervals and using a 10% relative decline between measurements to indicate improvement. Blood lactate level is not a specific diagnostic test for sepsis, and elevations correlate with a higher risk of short-term mortality.

### Even mild hyperlactatemia is associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients [^98e69fc3]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Among critically ill patients with lactate levels within the reference range (0.01 to 2.00 m M), we found lactate of 1.35 m M to be the best cutoff threshold that discriminated between survivors and nonsurvivors. Relative hyperlactatemia was an independent predictor of hospital and ICU mortality.

The first demonstration of lactate in human blood was in shock patients, by Johann Joseph Scherer in 1843. Subsequent work led to the demonstration that tissue hypoxia was associated with increased lactate level. Elevated lactate is frequently seen in critically ill patients and is primarily a consequence of inadequate oxygen delivery, usually associated with significant cardiopulmonary compromise, as seen in cardiogenic, hypovolemic, and septic shock.

In an unstressed individual, the basal lactate concentration is 1.0 ± 0.5 m M. In critically ill patients, a lactate level of ≤ 2 m M is considered to be within the reference range, and therefore, hyperlactatemia is defined as lactate of > 2 m M. A wealth of literature exists on hyperlactatemia (> 2 m M) but not on lactate within the reference range.

### A prospective study of lactate levels in uncomplicated spontaneous and induced labor [^4cd92158]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Maternal pushing can yield lactate levels that are above the normal range for nonpregnant individuals. Many hospitals require lactate levels as part of sepsis bundles, and this can confuse the clinicians when measured during labor. The objective of this study was to observe lactate levels in uncomplicated labor.

Study Design

This was a prospective study of patients presenting to Labor and Delivery in early labor. Patients met inclusion criteria if they presented at 37 weeks' gestation or greater and were either 3 to 4cm dilated, in early labor with rupture of membranes less than 12hours, or were being induced for oligohydramnios or postdates gestation. A baseline maternal lactate level was collected at enrollment. Further levels were collected at complete cervical dilation and every 30minutes during the second stage of labor up to 3hours or until delivery.

Results

From January 7, 2021, through December 30, 2021, a total of 148 screened patients met the inclusion criteria and 38 were enrolled. Eight (21%) patients withdrew after baseline lactate level was drawn. Twenty-three (61%) patients had a level drawn at complete dilation. Of the 12 (32%) patients with a lactate level drawn at complete and after 30minutes of pushing, the mean change in lactate level was 2.0 ± 1.8mmol/L or 0.07 ± 0.06mmol/L/min (p < 0.01). This change is more pronounced in the second stage of labor for patients with chorioamnionitis (2.6mmol/L), although this difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.41).

Conclusion

Lactate levels increase significantly once a patient reaches complete cervical dilation within 30minutes of pushing. This increase is more pronounced, although significantly, in patients with chorioamnionitis. As sepsis is one of the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality, this pilot study is relevant for providers to see the natural course of lactate levels in labor.

Key Points

### The value of blood lactate kinetics in critically ill patients: a systematic review [^ff001648]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our systematic literature review has provided the following answers to our initial questions. First, observation of a better prognosis with decreasing lactate concentrations is consistent throughout the literature. Second, these observations are not specific to septic patients, but apply to all common situations of hyperlactatemia and in heterogeneous patient populations. Third, the changes are relatively slow, and it is difficult to provide recommendations about the speed of decrease in lactate concentrations in the best conditions. Clearly repeating measurements every 12 hrs can generally separate those who will do well from those who are likely to die, but shorter time intervals may be helpful. On the basis of our observations, we would recommend checking blood lactate concentrations as often as every 1–2 hrs in acute conditions. Fourth, the study of lactate kinetics appears to be valid regardless of the initial value and not only in patients with severe hyperlactatemia.

### Relative hyperlactatemia and hospital mortality in critically ill patients: a retrospective multi-centre study [^bd174031]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Statement of key findings

We tested whether higher levels of lactatemia within the current reference range (relative hyperlactemia) are independently associated with an increased risk of hospital mortality. We found that most patients admitted to ICU had an admission or time weighted lactate level within the current normal reference range and yet a crude hospital mortality rate of approximately 20%. We also found that higher ICU admission (Lac ADM) and time weighted (Lac TW) blood lactate concentrations within the normal reference range were strongly and independently associated with hospital mortality. In addition, this increased mortality risk was first detected at lactate concentrations above 0.75 mmol.L -1.

### How to interpret lactate [^b64c5416]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2021). Medium credibility.

The association between hyperlactataemia and poorer outcomes in acutely unwell adults and children is well recognised. Blood lactate testing has become readily available in acute settings and is considered a first-line investigation in international guidelines for the management of sepsis. However, while healthcare professionals do appreciate the value of measuring blood lactate in acute severe illness, its clinical significance and interpretation remain less well understood. In this paper, we present the evidence for the use of lactate as a diagnostic test and prognostic marker in acutely unwell children.

### The ten pitfalls of lactate clearance in sepsis [^016a9d71]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Lactate levels: production versus clearance

In clinical practice the change in lactate levels over time is thought to primarily reflect a change in production. As increased levels are generally associated with circulatory dysfunction, we often see a decrease in lactate levels as associated with an improvement in circulatory status and hypothesize (but cannot prove) decreased production. However, as true clearance in both stable septic patients and septic shock animals is significantly decreased in shock states, ongoing hyperlactatemia or even a rise in lactate levels may reflect decreased clearance rather than an increase in production of lactate. This is typically seen in the presence of shock with associated ischemic hepatitis. In addition, the complex inter- and intracellular metabolism of lactate makes our understanding of lactate physiology in shock extremely limited (see Sect. " Lactate as a substrate ").

Introduction

The clinical significance of elevation of lactate levels within the reference range is not well studied. The objective of this study was to determine the best cutoff threshold for serum lactate within the reference range (0.01 to 2.00 mM) that best discriminated between survivors and nonsurvivors of critical illness and to examine the association between relative hyperlactatemia (lactate above the identified threshold) and mortality.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted to the medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care academic center. Youden index was calculated to identify the best lactate cutoff threshold that discriminated between survivors and nonsurvivors. Patients with lactate above the identified threshold were defined as having relative hyperlactatemia. Multivariate logistic regression, adjusting for baseline variables, was performed to determine the relationship between the above two ranges of lactate levels and mortality. In addition, a test of interaction was performed to assess the effect of selected subgroups on the association between relative hyperlactatemia and hospital mortality.

Results

During the study period, 2,157 patients were included in the study with mean lactate of 1.3 ± 0.4 mM, age of 55.1 ± 20.3 years, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score of 22.1 ± 8.2. Vasopressors were required in 42.4%. Lactate of 1.35 mM was found to be the best cutoff threshold for the whole cohort. Relative hyperlactatemia was associated with increased hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 1.98), and ICU mortality (aOR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.26 to 2.17) compared with a lactate level of 0.01 to 1.35 mM. This association was consistent among all examined subgroups.

Conclusions

Relative hyperlactatemia (lactate of 1.36 to 2.00 mM) within the first 24 hours of ICU admission is an independent predictor of hospital and ICU mortality in critically ill patients.

### The value of blood lactate kinetics in critically ill patients: a systematic review [^2255fc2e]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Since the early studies by Weil and others, blood lactate concentrations have been used widely as a marker of altered tissue perfusion in critically ill patients. In physiological conditions, about 1500 mmol of lactate is produced daily from various organs, including the muscle, the intestine, the red blood cells, the brain, and the skin. Lactate is metabolized by the liver (about 60%), the kidneys (about 30%), and other organs. The normal blood lactate concentration is around 1 mEq/l. Even minor increases in lactate concentrations to > 1.5 mEq/l are associated with higher mortality rates. The exact pathophysiologic mechanisms of hyperlactatemia have been much debated, because the condition does not always simply reflect the development of anaerobic metabolism. In sepsis in particular, metabolic alterations can contribute to elevated blood lactate concentrations, including increased glycolysis, catecholamine-stimulated Na–K pump activity, alterations in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, and reduced lactate clearance primarily as a result of liver hypoperfusion. Regardless of these mechanisms, hyperlactatemia is a hallmark characteristic of shock states and the degree of increase in lactate concentrations is directly related to the severity of the shock state and to mortality rates.

Despite the multiple causes of the shock state, all causes possess the common abnormality of oxygen supply not meeting tissue metabolic demands. Compensatory mechanisms may mask the severity of hypoxemia and hypoperfusion, since catecholamines and extracellular fluid shifts initially compensate for the physiologic derangements associated with patients in shock. Despite the achievement of normal physiologic parameters after resuscitation, significant metabolic acidosis may continue to be present in the tissues, as evidenced by increased lactate levels and metabolic acidosis. This review discusses the major endpoints of resuscitation in clinical use.

### Relation of serum lactate dehydrogenase to coronary artery disease [^ec767bfc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is known pathologic marker for a diversity of diseases, including myocardial ischemia. Strenuous and enduring physical activity can transiently induce a greater total LDH level, still within its normal range. To date, however, it has not been determined whether normal-range LDH might be inversely associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) in the low-cardiovascular-risk, physically active, adult population. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis. A total of 5,519 healthy adults aged 34 to 86 years were followed up for a mean period of 4.2 years. The cohort incidence of CAD was 6.1% (338 cases) from 2001 to 2009. In the present cohort, greater mean LDH levels were significantly associated with a greater number of years, days/week, and minutes/week of leisure time activity (p = 0.02, p = 0.04, and p = 0.01, respectively). These associations were externally validated successfully by analysis of all 5,064 healthy participants aged ≥ 40 years with normal-range LDH from the 2007 to 2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys combined. For instance, the mean LDH level was significantly greater in those engaged in 6 to 7 versus 1 to 5 days/wk of vigorous-intensity work activity (138.0 ± 20.7 IU/L vs 133.3 ± 21.7 IU/L, respectively, p = 0.007). In our cohort, the hazard ratio for CAD according to the normal total serum LDH tertiles, adjusted for multiple risk and protective CAD factors in a Cox proportional hazards model, was 0.70 (95% confidence interval 0.54 to 0.92) in the greater versus lower tertile (p for trend = 0.01). In conclusion, we suggest that increased normal-range total serum LDH is associated with reduced short-term risk of CAD outcome in this low-risk, physically active population.

### The value of blood lactate kinetics in critically ill patients: a systematic review [^cf2b3786]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

As for the blood levels of any substance, elevated lactate levels can be the result of increased production, reduced elimination, or both. A dynamic evaluation of serial lactate concentrations may thus be more informative than a single value. This concept of repeating blood lactate concentrations over time as an indicator of response to therapy was first proposed in 1983, based on an idea raised after a publication by Orringer et al. in 1977 showing that the decrease in lactate levels after cessation of grand mal seizures was actually quite rapid, with a half-life of about 50% in 1 hr. Many studies have since emphasized that changes in lactate over the first hrs of treatment may represent a valuable monitoring tool. Some studies have even proposed integrating changes in lactate concentrations as a target in therapeutic protocols or including them as one of the sepsis resuscitation "bundles". A number of investigators have used the term "lactate clearance" to describe decreasing lactate levels, but this is incorrect for two reasons. The first is that the changes in lactate concentrations over time reflect changes in production and in elimination. The decrease in lactate over time may reflect decreased (over)production more than increased clearance by the liver and other organs. The specific study of lactate clearance would require intravenous injection of radiolabeled lactate, as has been done in several studies. The second reason why use of the term is incorrect is that "clearance" or "elimination" implies a progressive normalization of blood lactate concentrations, which is too simplistic. Blood lactate concentrations can have a complex evolution and may even increase over time (Fig. 1), a situation that one should then call "negative lactate clearance".

### Reference values for umbilical artery lactate by mode of delivery and gestational age: a retrospective observational study [^f1879bf5]. Neonatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Umbilical artery cord blood provides information about the intrauterine metabolism during labor. Umbilical artery lactate is a useful parameter in predicting neonatal morbidity, but data on normal values are limited. We aimed to provide reference ranges of umbilical artery lactate values across the combination of gestational age and mode of delivery.

Methods

A single-center retrospective observational study of liveborn infants born between 23 and 42 completed weeks gestation was conducted. Lactate, base deficit (BD), and pH from arterial cord blood were assessed between June 2018 and November 2020 and compared across gestational ages and modes of delivery.

Results

Overall, there were 3,353 infants with evaluable data. Lactate values at the 50th, 90th, and 97th percentile were 3.4, 7.0, and 9.0 mmol/L. Lactate was inversely correlated with pH (r = -0.77, p < 0.001) and positively correlated with BD (r = 0.63, p < 0.001). Lactate values changed significantly across gestational age (Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.001) which was attributable to an increase in lactate at 39–41 weeks gestational age. Also, lactate values were different across modes of delivery (Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.001) with lowest values in elective CS and highest values in vaginal instrumental deliveries. Comprehensive reference ranges across modes of delivery and gestational ages could be established.

Discussion

Mode of delivery and gestational age contribute to lactate levels with highest values occurring in vaginal instrumental deliveries and between 39 and 41 weeks gestational age. Based on these observations, we provide detailed reference ranges for clinical use.

### Normal lactate concentration range in the neonatal brain [^9908e130]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Lactate peaks are occasionally observed during in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) scans of the neonatal brain, even in healthy patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the normal range of neonatal brain lactate concentration, as a definitive normal range would be clinically valuable.

Methods

Using a clinical 3T scanner (echo/repetition times, 30/5000ms), single-voxel MRS data were obtained from the basal ganglia (BG) and centrum semiovale (CS) in 48 healthy neonates (postconceptional age (PCA), 30-43weeks), nine infants (age, 1-12months old), and 20 children (age, 4-15years). Lactate concentrations were calculated using an MRS signal quantification program, LCModel. Correlations between regional lactate concentration and PCA (neonates), or age (all subjects) were investigated.

Results

Absolute lactate concentrations of the BG and CS were as follows: neonates, 0.77mM (0–2.02) [median (range)] and 0.77 (0–1.42), respectively; infants, 0.38 (0–0.79) and 0.49 (0.17–1.17); and children, 0.17 (0–0.76) and 0.22 (0–0.80). Overall, subjects' lactate concentrations decreased significantly with age (Spearman: BG, n = 61, ρ = -0.38, p = 0.003; CS, n = 68, ρ = -0.57, p < 0.001). However, during the neonatal period no correlations were detected between lactate concentration in either region and PCA.

Conclusion

We determined normal ranges of neonatal lactate concentration, which may prove useful for diagnostic purposes. Further studies regarding changes in brain lactate concentration during development would help clarify the reasons for higher concentrations observed during the neonatal period, and contribute to improvements in diagnoses.

### Anion gap as a prognostic tool for risk stratification in critically ill patients-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^94eaa53d]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

A rise in the AG in critically ill patients was long thought to be predominantly due to lactic acidosis, yet several studies reported poor sensitivity of the AG in detecting hyperlactataemia defined by a lactate threshold of 2.5 mmol/l. The AG was an excellent predictor of severe hyperlactataemia defined as lactate above 4 mmol/l or 5 mmol/l; however, Nichol and colleagues found that a higher lactate concentration even within a normal reference range of 2 mmol/l independently predicts mortality. The AG may thus miss patients at risk of mortality, as a considerable degree of hyperlactataemia is required to push the AG outside its normal reference range if the baseline AG is low. This is in keeping with the extreme difference in lactate levels between survivors and non-survivors observed in the study reporting the highest predictive value of AG. Other studies reported smaller, albeit mostly statistically significant, differences in lactate levels between survivors and non-survivors.

### The ten pitfalls of lactate clearance in sepsis [^e0040451]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The problem with clearance

Clearance is the removal of a substance from blood, expressed as a volume (milliliters) over time (minutes). However, changes in lactate levels are the sum of ongoing production and removal from the blood by excretion (e.g. urine, sweat) and its metabolism (e.g. uptake by cells as a direct source of energy, conversion to glucose by the liver). To talk about "lactate clearance" when actually describing a decrease in blood level is wrong and misleading. Following the review of 96 studies, Vincent et al. concluded that given recent evidence, measurements every 1–2 h would give clinically relevant data about the decrease in lactate levels.

### Lactic acidosis in sepsis: It's not all anaerobic: implications for diagnosis and management [^85d20524]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Increased blood lactate concentration (hyperlactatemia) and lactic acidosis (hyperlactatemia and serum pH < 7.35) are common in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In some patients, most of the lactate that is produced in shock states is due to inadequate oxygen delivery resulting in tissue hypoxia and causing anaerobic glycolysis. However, lactate formation during sepsis is not entirely related to tissue hypoxia or reversible by increasing oxygen delivery. In this review, we initially outline the metabolism of lactate and etiology of lactic acidosis; we then address the pathophysiology of lactic acidosis in sepsis. We discuss the clinical implications of serum lactate measurement in diagnosis, monitoring, and prognostication in acute and intensive care settings. Finally, we explore treatment of lactic acidosis and its impact on clinical outcome.

### Early lactate measurement is associated with better outcomes in septic patients with an elevated serum lactate level [^72f43252]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, early lactate measurement (within 1 h after ICU admission) in septic patients with elevated serum lactate levels (> 2.0 mmol/L) is associated with a lower risk-adjusted 28-day mortality. The decrease in time to the administration of vasopressors may have mediated this effect. Repeating the measurement within 3 h after the initial measurement is appropriate for patients whose lactate was measured within 1 h of admission.

### The value of blood lactate kinetics in critically ill patients: a systematic review [^af19e569]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The time course of blood lactate levels could be helpful to assess a patient's response to therapy. Although the focus of published studies has been largely on septic patients, many other studies have reported serial blood lactate levels in different groups of acutely ill patients.

Methods

We performed a systematic search of PubMed, Science Direct, and Embase until the end of February 2016 plus reference lists of relevant publications. We selected all observational and interventional studies that evaluated the capacity of serial blood lactate concentrations to predict outcome. There was no restriction based on language. We excluded studies in pediatric populations, experimental studies, and studies that did not report changes in lactate values or all-cause mortality rates. We separated studies according to the type of patients included. We collected data on the number of patients, timing of lactate measurements, minimum lactate level needed for inclusion if present, and suggested time interval for predictive use.

Results

A total of 96 studies met our criteria: 14 in general ICU populations, five in general surgical ICU populations, five in patients post cardiac surgery, 14 in trauma patients, 39 in patients with sepsis, four in patients with cardiogenic shock, eight in patients after cardiac arrest, three in patients with respiratory failure, and four in other conditions. A decrease in lactate levels over time was consistently associated with lower mortality rates in all subgroups of patients. Most studies reported changes over 6, 12 or 24 hrs, fewer used shorter time intervals. Lactate kinetics did not appear very different in patients with sepsis and other types of patients. A few studies suggested that therapy could be guided by these measurements.

Conclusions

The observation of a better outcome associated with decreasing blood lactate concentrations was consistent throughout the clinical studies, and was not limited to septic patients. In all groups, the changes are relatively slow, so that lactate measurements every 1–2 hrs are probably sufficient in most acute conditions. The value of lactate kinetics appears to be valid regardless of the initial value.

### Risk stratification of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome complicated with sepsis using lactate trajectories [^be83b422]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Elevated lactate levels are common in the setting of sepsis and usually represent an imbalance between increased production in the presence or absence of tissue hypoxia and changes in clearance. Given their well-established association with multiple organ dysfunction, blood lactate levels and their trend over time are increasingly recognized as reliable markers of illness severity and mortality. Border and Weil et al. observed that lactate levels ≥ 4 mmol/L were associated with a 50% mortality in patients with shock during a study period of 36 h. An increasing body of evidence suggests that lactate measurements represent a valuable and straightforward indicator for the early identification of severe sepsis and are associated with poor outcomes. Interestingly, current evidence suggests that compared with initial lactate levels at presentation or other single measured lactate values, serial blood lactate level measurements can better characterize the dynamic process of lactate production and elimination in vivo. Serial lactate levels can also help define the patient's trajectory and encourage a review of the therapeutic strategy. Over the years, the prognostic value of serial measurements of multiple types of lactate levels or calculations from lactate levels has been investigated, for example, the duration of hyperlactatemia, the area under the curve of serial lactate measurement (lactate AUC), and lactate clearance. Importantly, decreased lactate levels were associated with improved outcomes in almost all critically ill patients. Moreover, the later the lactate level is reduced, the worse the clinical prognosis is.

### The ten pitfalls of lactate clearance in sepsis [^be6578c5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Lactate as a marker of severity

The evidence that lactate is a marker of illness severity in all situations of physiological stress is overwhelming. In sepsis it is a powerful predictor of mortality. In the recent ARISE trial, data were prospectively collected on lactate levels at randomization. Approximately, one-third of patients were randomized because of isolated hyperlactatemia and compared with patients randomized because of isolated hypotension. Despite similar age and sources of infection, patients with isolated hyperlactatemia had 1.7 times the risk of 90-day mortality and were less likely to be discharged alive form ICU and hospital. This predictive value has been recognized by the SEPSIS-3 consensus definition of shock, which requires the presence of hyperlactatemia.

### Blood lactate measurements and analysis during exercise: a guide for clinicians [^6d04571b]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2007). Low credibility.

Blood lactate concentration ([La(-)](b)) is one of the most often measured parameters during clinical exercise testing as well as during performance testing of athletes. While an elevated [La(-)](b) may be indicative of ischemia or hypoxemia, it may also be a "normal" physiological response to exertion. In response to "all-out" maximal exertion lasting 30–120 seconds, peak [La(-)](b) values of approximately 15–25 mM may be observed 3–8 minutes postexercise. In response to progressive, incremental exercise, [La(-)](b) increases gradually at first and then more rapidly as the exercise becomes more intense. The work rate beyond which [La(-)](b) increases exponentially [the lactate threshold (LT)] is a better predictor of performance than V O2max and is a better indicator of exercise intensity than heart rate; thus LT (and other valid methods of describing this curvilinear [La(-)](b) response with a single point) is useful in prescribing exercise intensities for most diseased and nondiseased patients alike. H(+)-monocarboxylate cotransporters provide the primary of three routes by which La(-) transport proceeds across the sarcolemma and red blood cell membrane. At rest and during most exercise conditions, whole blood [La(-)] values are on average 70% of the corresponding plasma [La(-)] values; thus when analyzing [La(-)](b'), care should be taken to both (1) validate the [La(-)](b)-measuring instrument with the criterion/reference enzymatic method and (2) interpret the results correctly based on what is being measured (plasma or whole blood). Overall, it is advantageous for clinicians to have a thorough understanding of [La(-)](b) responses, blood La(-) transport and distribution, and [La(-)](b) analysis.

### Effect of high-dose dexamethasone on perioperative lactate levels and glucose control: a randomized controlled trial [^853dbe05]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Outcome measures

The primary outcome was the area under the curve (AUC) of glucose and lactate levels in the first 15 hours of postoperative ICU stay. The AUC was calculated by using the trapezoid rule approximation method, with no threshold for normal values. After 15 hours, most patients were discharged to the surgical ward, where GRIP was not used, glucose levels were measured less frequently, and lactate levels were measured rarely. When patients arrived at the ICU, glucose and lactate levels were always sampled. After that, the GRIP system determined the sampling frequency of glucose and lactate levels, so the sampling frequency differs among patients. This information is presented in Figure S1 (Additional file 1). GRIP suggests a time interval to the next sample, depending on previous glucose values and insulin infusion rate. We therefore interpolated hourly glucose and lactate values to calculate the AUC. Secondary outcomes were total insulin consumption and the hyperglycemic index (HGI). The HGI is a measure of overall hyperglycemia that is not influenced by hypoglycemic episodes or unequal sampling intervals. It is calculated by dividing the area under the glucose curve that lies above the upper limit of the normal range by the observation time. The HGI was calculated for two cutoff values: 8.0 mmol/L as the upper end of our target glucose range and 6.0 mmol/L according to the original method of calculation described by Vogelzang et al. Intraoperatively, glucose and lactate were routinely sampled at least three times: before, during, and after CPB. Finally, we report ICU length of stay, ICU readmissions, inotropic or vasopressor support requirement during the ICU stay, postoperative surgical site infections, gastrointestinal hemorrhages, length of hospital stay, and 30-day mortality.

Regression model

Because the effect of dexamethasone on lactate levels is not well understood, we evaluated the role of glucose as an intermediate in the relation between dexamethasone and postoperative lactate levels. In a multivariate linear regression model, we assessed the effect of dexamethasone on postoperative lactate levels (AUC of the first 15 hours of postoperative ICU stay) and added postoperative glucose levels (AUC of the first 15 hours of postoperative ICU stay) to the model as a covariable.

### Relative hyperlactatemia and hospital mortality in critically ill patients: a retrospective multi-centre study [^1d7a8d96]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Implications for clinicians

These findings expand our understanding of lactate as a clinical biomarker in the ICU. Relatively small changes in lactate homeostasis as detected by higher blood concentrations within the reference range may reflect important otherwise undetected physiological changes, which may reflect widespread metabolic stress and increased use of lactate as a fuel source.

A higher time weighted lactate (Lac TW) below 2 mmol.L -1, the cohort of patients whose lactate ever exceeded 2 mmol.L -1, was also strongly associated with increased hospital mortality. This finding extends our understanding of the reference range by emphasizing the role of the duration of lactate derangement in predicting increased risk of death. Furthermore, it highlights the clinical importance of persistently higher lactate concentrations. This notion may explain why Lac TW (which reflects the extent and duration of the derangement) but not Lac MAX (which only reflects its momentary extent) predicted mortality within the reference range.

Our results suggest that ICU clinicians confronted with a patient with a Lac ADM or Lac TW (persistently higher lactate) over 0.75 mmol.L -1 should look for any remediable causes of physiological stress and appreciate that these patients are at increased risk of an adverse outcome.

The time course of blood lactate levels could be helpful to assess a patient's response to therapy. Although the focus of published studies has been largely on septic patients, many other studies have reported serial blood lactate levels in different groups of acutely ill patients.

Methods

We performed a systematic search of PubMed, Science Direct, and Embase until the end of February 2016 plus reference lists of relevant publications. We selected all observational and interventional studies that evaluated the capacity of serial blood lactate concentrations to predict outcome. There was no restriction based on language. We excluded studies in pediatric populations, experimental studies, and studies that did not report changes in lactate values or all-cause mortality rates. We separated studies according to the type of patients included. We collected data on the number of patients, timing of lactate measurements, minimum lactate level needed for inclusion if present, and suggested time interval for predictive use.

Results

A total of 96 studies met our criteria: 14 in general ICU populations, five in general surgical ICU populations, five in patients post cardiac surgery, 14 in trauma patients, 39 in patients with sepsis, four in patients with cardiogenic shock, eight in patients after cardiac arrest, three in patients with respiratory failure, and four in other conditions. A decrease in lactate levels over time was consistently associated with lower mortality rates in all subgroups of patients. Most studies reported changes over 6, 12 or 24 hrs, fewer used shorter time intervals. Lactate kinetics did not appear very different in patients with sepsis and other types of patients. A few studies suggested that therapy could be guided by these measurements.

Conclusions

The observation of a better outcome associated with decreasing blood lactate concentrations was consistent throughout the clinical studies, and was not limited to septic patients. In all groups, the changes are relatively slow, so that lactate measurements every 1–2 hrs are probably sufficient in most acute conditions. The value of lactate kinetics appears to be valid regardless of the initial value.

### Use of admission serum lactate and sodium levels to predict mortality in necrotizing soft-tissue infections… [^117ead7b]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

On exploratory classification and regression tree analysis, admission serum lactate and sodium levels were predictors of mortality, with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 28%, positive predictive value of 23%, and negative predictive value of 100%. A serum lactate level greater than or equal to 54. 1 mg/dL alone was associated with a 32% mortality, whereas a serum sodium level greater than or equal to 135 mEq/L combined with a lactate level less than
54. 1 mg/dL was associated with a mortality of 0%. On CART analysis, 2 admission variables, serum lactate and sodium levels, were predictors of mortality. Patients with a lactate level greater than or equal to 54. 1 mg/dL had a mortality of 32%. Patients with a serum lactate level less than 54. 1 mg/dL combined with a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L had a mortality of 19%. Necrotizing soft-tissue infections remain a highly lethal disease.

The present study of 124 patients with NSTI found a mortality of 17%. On CART analysis, 2 admission laboratory variables, an elevated serum lactate level and decreased serum sodium level, were included in a decision tree to predict an increased risk of death. Through CART analysis, we created a simple model for predicting mortality, using admission serum sodium and lactate levels. The model had a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 28%, positive predictive value of 23%, and negative predictive value of 100%. The association between elevated serum lactate level, low serum sodium level, and increased mortality can potentially be explained by several mechanisms. William Schecter, MD, San Francisco, California: Necrotizing soft-tissue infections, a poorly understood group of infections most prevalent among injection drug users, alcoholics, and impoverished obese diabetic patients, has a wide spectrum of both clinical presentation and clinical course.

This retrospective review of 124 patients with NSTI treated between 1997 and 2006 at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center identified a serum lactate level greater or equal to than 6 mmol/L and a serum sodium less than 135 mEq/L as simple and accurate tests to predict mortality in this group of patients.

### Demystifying lactate in the emergency department [^a6b23261]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The role of lactic acid and its conjugate base, lactate, has evolved during the past decade in the care of patients in the emergency department (ED). A recent national sepsis quality measure has led to increased use of serum lactate in the ED, but many causes for hyperlactatemia exist outside of sepsis. We provide a review of the biology of lactate production and metabolism, the many causes of hyperlactatemia, and evidence on its use as a marker in prognosis and resuscitation. Additionally, we review the evolving role of lactate in sepsis care. We provide recommendations to aid lactate interpretation in the ED and highlight areas for future research.

Blood lactate for risk stratification in suspected pediatric sepsis — panel position and practice — states: "We were unable to issue a recommendation about using blood lactate values to stratify children with suspected septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction into low- versus high-risk of having septic shock or sepsis."

### The value of blood lactate kinetics in critically ill patients: a systematic review [^cc8bf0d4]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Although changes in blood lactate kinetics were clearly significant after 6 hrs in many studies and after 12 hrs in most, it is currently not possible to define the best time interval between lactate measurements. The normal reduction in lactate concentrations when overproduction of lactate abruptly ceases after grand mal seizures is about 50% in 1 hr. Although Levraut et al. suggested that lactate clearance may be decreased in septic patients, Revelly et al. reported similar values in patients with sepsis and in healthy volunteers.

The rate of lactate decrease in optimal treatment conditions is quite variable. In the best conditions, blood lactate concentrations decreased by more than 10% in 1 hr in patients who responded rapidly to resuscitation or by 10–20% in 2 hrs. A study by Hernandez et al. suggested a > 50% decrease in lactate concentrations during the first 6 hrs of resuscitation in patients with septic shock. Although some systems now allow the quasi-continuous measurement of lactate concentrations, determinations every 1–2 hrs are probably sufficient; in the interventional study by Jansen et al. the protocol was to measure blood lactate every 2 hrs. Even though serial blood lactate concentrations have been suggested to guide therapy, our review underlines that changes in lactate over time are relatively slow, taking place over hrs, and this may be too slow to guide therapy. Serial lactate concentrations should serve as a regular control, similar to how in the past a navigator would consult a compass from time to time to ensure that their boat was still heading in the right direction. If lactate concentrations do not normalize over time, the need for changes in therapy should be considered.

### Consensus on circulatory shock and hemodynamic monitoring. task force of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^91d41ba5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The prognostic value of lactate levels exceeds that of blood pressure. While hyperlactatemia is associated with worse outcome in any type of shock, a correct interpretation also depends on the type of shock, i.e. septic shock versus hemorrhagic shock.

From a metabolic perspective, elevations in blood lactate concentration may be due to increased production, a decreased clearance or a combination of the two. As elevated plasma lactate forms part of the definition of shock, the argument to measure it as a diagnostic marker of shock is circular. Many studies have confirmed the association between initial serum lactate level and mortality independently of clinical signs of organ dysfunction in patients not only with severe sepsis, but also those in cardiogenic shock.

An early decrease in blood lactate levels may indicate the resolution of global tissue hypoxia and has been associated with a decreased mortality rate. Two studies proposed 'lactate-based management' of ICU patients. Jones et al. studied 300 patients, of whom more than 80% had septic shock, who were treated to normalize central venous pressure (CVP) and MAP; additional management to normalize lactate clearance compared with management to normalize ScvO 2 did not result in different rates of hospital mortality. Jansen et al. showed, in patients with hyperlactatemia (> 3.0 mEq/L) on ICU admission, that lactate-guided therapy (with the aim of decreasing lactate by ≥ 20% every 2 h for the initial 8 h) in comparison with no lactate-guided therapy (in which the treatment team had no knowledge of lactate levels other than the admission level) reduced hospital mortality when predefined risk factors were adjusted (hazard ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.43–0.87; P = 0.006). These authors demonstrated a reduced rate of organ failure — but no reduced mortality — in the lactate group compared with the control group in the early observation period (between 9 and 72 h). Lactate levels between the control and lactate groups were similar over a 3-day period. In clinical practice, we suggest serial measurements of lactates and/or base deficit to evaluate not only the outcome and prognosis but also to guide therapy; lactate measurements can be performed every 2 h in the first 8 h and every 8–12 h thereafter.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^5064cd17]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Scenarios

Lactic Acidosis

Unbalanced lactate production or consumption leads to elevated lactate levels, known as hyperlactatemia (lactate > 2 mmol/L). Lactic acidosis is defined by a serum lactate > 4 mmol/L and pH < 7.35. Hyperlactatemia can be further subdivided based on the etiology of the elevated lactate level. Type A hyperlactatemia includes states of dysoxia and decreased tissue perfusion, as seen in shock, significant anemia, and severe hypoxia. Type B hyperlactatemia broadly encompasses disorders of oxidative phosphorylation within the mitochondria, sepsis, ineffective lactate clearance in the liver, and congenital inborn errors of metabolism. Septic shock is a common cause of hyperlactatemia in critically ill patients encountered in the ED. Hypotension leads to increased anaerobic glycolysis (type A) and decreased hepatic clearance of lactate. Acidemia also shunts excess pyruvate towards lactate production and prevents lactate from entering the Cori cycle for gluconeogenesis. Sepsis can cause significant hyperlactatemia in the absence of hypoperfusion through accelerated glycolysis in the absence of hypotension (type B).

### Clinical correlates of arterial lactate levels in STEMI patients [^b7f720db]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Increases in blood lactate reflect decreases in systemic blood flows associated with low blood flow states characteristic of circulatory shock. Accordingly, the report by Vermeulen and colleagues documents the use of the blood lactate measurement as a prognostic indicator in settings of ST elevation myocardial infarction. That lactate value therefore identified high-risk patients as a complication, often with clinical signs of cardiogenic shock of corresponding severities.

SCAI SHOCK stage classification — differentiating preshock (stage B) from classic shock (stage C) emphasizes that patients with hypoperfusion but no hypotension are higher risk, that lactate is useful yet imperfect, and that a lactate threshold can anchor stage C. The page states that the distinction between stage B and stage C is critical and requires multiple data points; that patients with hypoperfusion in the absence of hypotension are at higher risk of dying; that lactate may be normal in chronic heart failure with low cardiac index; and that "a lactate level of > 2 mmol/L is consistent with at least SCAI SHOCK stage C," while recognizing non‑shock causes of elevated lactate and hypoperfusion with normal lactate.

### The role of lactate metabolism in heart failure and cardiogenic shock: clinical insights and therapeutic implications [^83e4978a]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is associated with poor prognosis, especially when it progresses to cardiogenic shock (CS), where survival rates substantially decline. A key area of interest is the role of blood lactate as a biomarker in these conditions. Lactate is produced under normal physiological conditions but increases with impaired tissue perfusion, a hallmark of HF and CS. Elevated lactate levels result from increased production, reduced clearance or both and are often associated with worse outcomes. Traditionally considered a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism, lactate is now recognized as an important energy substrate, particularly in myocardial tissue during periods of metabolic stress. Recent studies suggest that dynamic lactate monitoring, including lactate clearance (LC), may provide critical insights into patients' prognoses and responses to therapy. Serial measurements of lactate have been shown to predict survival in critically ill patients, including those with HF and CS. In CS, elevated lactate levels correlate with increased mortality risk, and LC is emerging as an important parameter in treatment protocols. Despite growing evidence of lactate's clinical relevance, research is needed to establish standardized thresholds and optimal monitoring timelines. Understanding the complexities of lactate metabolism and its role in HF and CS could lead to improved risk stratification and more personalized treatment approaches.

### Ready for prime time? Biomarkers in sepsis [^4c6bc4d0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a common condition managed in the emergency department. Current diagnosis relies on physiologic criteria and suspicion of a source of infection using history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and imaging studies. The infection triggers a host response with the aim to destroy the pathogen, and this response can be measured. A reliable biomarker for sepsis should assist with earlier diagnosis, improve risk stratification, or improve clinical decision making. Current biomarkers for sepsis include lactate, troponin, and procalcitonin. This article discusses the use of lactate, procalcitonin, troponin, and novel biomarkers for use in sepsis.

### Recommendations for hemodynamic monitoring for critically ill children-expert consensus statement issued by the cardiovascular dynamics section of the European society of paediatric and neonatal intensive care (ESPNIC) [^9e0dc449]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Lactate measurement

Determination of blood lactate concentration is a cheap, fast, and easy bedside parameter that has demonstrated utility to predict the outcome or to trigger the need to intensify medical treatment. The committee showed some variation in their approach to the use of lactate in children since 5 out of 10 recommendations needed a revision.

In critically ill patients or children with shock, early and serial lactate blood sampling from a reliable site such as a central venous or arterial indwelling catheter is recommended, though peripheral venous sampling with tourniquet time < 60 s is possible. This is specifically recommended when the initial capillary lactate value is > 3.0 mmol/L. Studies report an association between failure to normalize lactate levels to a certain threshold (3.0 ± 1.0 mmol/L) during the first 12 to 24 h of ICU admission, and adverse outcomes regardless of the reason for ICU admission. Experts could not agree on the use of lactate as part of a goal-directed approach and only weakly agreed on the approach to a persistent high lactate level. In the latter, lactate levels should always be used in conjunction with other clinical indicators of poor systemic perfusion and monitoring parameters. Persistently elevated lactate levels may reflect other mechanisms rather than those derived from poor tissue perfusion in shock and instead reflect aerobic glycolytic mechanisms including catecholamine administration or endogenous release (Table 4).

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^bd38ddc7]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — serum lactate and capillary refill time (CRT) as perfusion targets: Serum lactate is an important biomarker of tissue hypoxia and dysfunction, but is not a direct measure of tissue perfusion, and normal serum lactate levels are not achievable in all patients with septic shock; studies support resuscitative strategies that decrease lactate toward normal. When advanced hemodynamic monitoring is not available, alternative bedside perfusion measures may be used; temperature of the extremities, skin mottling and CRT have been validated and are reproducible. In the ANDROMEDA-SHOCK trial, a resuscitation strategy targeting CRT normalization was compared with a lactate strategy aiming at normalization or decreasing lactate levels by 20% every 2 hours in the first 8 hours; at day 3 the CRT group had lower organ dysfunction (mean SOFA score 5.6 [SD 4.3] versus 6.6 [SD 4.7]; p = 0.045), while 28-day mortality was 34.9% versus 43.4% and not statistically significant (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.55–1.02). Despite no clear mortality effect, using CRT during resuscitation has physiologic plausibility and is easily performed, noninvasive, and low cost, but this approach should be augmented by careful, frequent, and comprehensive patient evaluation to predict or recognize fluid overload early.

Results

Baseline characteristics of patients with lactate within reference range

Of 10,791 patients admitted to the ICU during the study period, 4,538 (42.1%) had lactate levels measured within 24 hours of admission to ICU. Of those with measured lactate, 2,157 (47.5%) patients had lactate levels within the reference range (0.01–2.00 m M). Table 1 describes the baseline characteristics of these patients. The mean age was 55.1 ± 20.3 years: 37.6% of them were female patients; APACHE II score was 22.1 ± 8.2; 22.5% had sepsis diagnosis on admission; 75% were mechanically ventilated; and 42.4% were receiving vasopressors. The mean lactate was 1.3 ± 0.4 m M. The overall ICU and hospital mortality were 14.1% and 30.0%, respectively.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^a86283f7]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Serum lactate has been used as a diagnostic parameter and prognostic marker of haemorrhagic shock since the 1960s. The amount of lactate produced by anaerobic glycolysis is an indirect marker of oxygen debt, tissue hypoperfusion and the severity of haemorrhagic shock. Similarly, base deficit values derived from arterial blood gas analysis provide an indirect estimation of global tissue acidosis due to impaired perfusion. Vincent and colleagues showed the value of serial lactate measurements for predicting survival in a prospective study in patients with circulatory shock. This study showed that changes in lactate concentration provide an early and objective evaluation of patient response to therapy and suggested that repeated lactate determinations represent a reliable prognostic index for patients with circulatory shock. Abramson and colleagues performed a prospective observational study in patients with multiple traumatic injuries to evaluate the correlation between the time course of blood lactate levels and survival. All patients in whom lactate levels returned to the normal range (≤ 2 mmol/L) within 24 h survived. Survival decreased to 77.8% if normalisation occurred within 48 h and to 13.6% in those patients in whom lactate levels were elevated above 2 mmol/L for more than 48 h. These findings were confirmed in a study by Manikis et al. who showed that initial lactate levels were higher in non-survivors after major trauma and that prolongation of time to normalisation of lactate levels of more than 24 h was associated with the development of post-traumatic organ failure. The determination of lactate and/or base deficit may be particularly important in penetrating trauma. Following this type of injury, triage vital signs, such as blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate, do not reflect the severity of injury and are not related to lactate or base deficit levels. A systemic review on the value of blood lactate kinetics in critically ill patients has been published recently.

### Early lactate measurement is associated with better outcomes in septic patients with an elevated serum lactate level [^464b6fde]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is one of the leading causes of in-hospital death in the intensive care unit (ICU), with a short-term mortality rate ranging from 30 to 50%. Elevation as well as slow clearance of serum lactate levels has been reported to be associated with increased mortality in sepsis. As a product of anaerobic metabolism, lactate elevation can to some extent reflect poor tissue perfusion, though it can be affected by other factors. Thus, monitoring lactate levels may help clinicians understand the tissue perfusion situation and identify unrecognized shock, enabling them to adjust treatment in a timely fashion.

Because randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality with lactate-guided resuscitation, lactate measurement has been introduced into the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines as an important component of the treatment bundles. The 2012 SSC bundle emphasized that an initial lactate level must be measured between 6 h before and 3 h after sepsis onset, followed by a repeated measurement within 6 h of sepsis presentation if the initial value is elevated. Levy et al. updated the SSC bundle to indicate that the initial lactate measurement should be performed within 1 h of onset and remeasured within 2–4 h to guide resuscitation if the initial lactate is > 2.0 mmol/L. However, there are limited studies focused on the timing of lactate measurement and remeasurement and its effect on outcomes. One study by Han et al. demonstrated that patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and initial lactate levels > 2.0 mmol/L had a 2% increase in the odds of death with each hour delay in lactate measurement. According to the analysis of 96 studies, Vincent et al. concluded that lactate measurement every 1–2 h is probably sufficient in most acute conditions, including sepsis. However, the optimal timing of the initial lactate measurement for septic patients remains controversial, and whether earlier initial and repeated lactate measurements could make a difference for septic patients with a higher lactate level remains unexplored.

Therefore, we designed this study to examine the relationship between early lactate measurement (within 1 h after ICU admission) and the outcomes of septic patients with an elevated serum lactate level (> 2.0 mmol/L), as well as to characterize the association of delays in initial lactate measurement and remeasurement with 28-day mortality to better understand the benefit of lactate monitoring in sepsis management.

### Sepsis-associated hyperlactatemia [^97a81b2e]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The concept of lactate clearance

In 2004 Nguyen and colleagues reported that 'lactate clearance', defined as the percentage decrease in lactate from emergency department presentation to 6 hours later, was an independent predictor of mortality. They concluded that 'lactate clearance in the early hospital course may indicate a resolution of global tissue hypoxia and that this is associated with decreased mortality rates. ' This study popularized the concept of 'lactate clearance'.

Jones and colleagues extended the concept of targeting resuscitation in sepsis to achieve a lactate 'clearance' of at least 10% as a marker of restoration of oxygen delivery to the tissues with resuscitation treatment. However, as mentioned above, we lack evidence to justify any assumption that this fall is due to a correction of an oxygen debt. The most recent Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend 'targeting resuscitation to normalize lactate in patients with elevated lactate levels as a marker of tissue hypoperfusion' (grade 2C).

In this sense, the concept of 'lactate clearance' is misleading and should not be logically used in patients with sepsis as either the final decision point in the resuscitation strategy to determine adequacy of oxygen delivery or a target for interventions (additional management to normalize lactate clearance). Further, the term 'clearance' in relation to lactate is scientifically and pharmacokinetically incorrect. Clearance represents the removal of a substance from a unit of volume over a unit of time, typically expressed in milliliters per minute. Logically, it is impossible to know if the rate and/or amount of decline in SAHL is due to increased removal, decreased production, dilution because of fluid administration during resuscitation or all the above in variable combinations. Moreover, increased lactate production can remain concealed by increased utilization in septic patients, suggesting that a normal blood level of lactate does not prove that its metabolism is normal.

### Unlocking the metabolic and anti-inflammatory therapeutic potential of lactate in critically ill patients [^0d6c3e4d]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Current evidence calls for a reappraisal of lactates role in critical care — not merely as a biomarker, but as a potential therapeutic agent. Its metabolic, anti-inflammatory, and signaling properties offer promising avenues for organ support in critically ill patients. Importantly, clinical studies using hypertonic sodium lactate have consistently reported good safety profiles, despite transient elevations in pH, plasma osmolality, or serum sodium levels. This supports the tolerability of lactate-based therapies in diverse patient populations. A paradigm shift is therefore warranted: future research should move beyond lactate clearance to explore its targeted administration as an adjunct or alternative treatment strategy. Priority must be given to large-scale randomized trials and mechanistic studies to determine optimal dosing, timing, and patient selection. Harnessing lactate's full therapeutic potential may significantly broaden the current armamentarium in intensive care medicine.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^b2e974c9]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric sepsis — blood lactate as a risk marker: Blood lactate levels provide a valuable indirect marker of tissue hypoperfusion, and in adults, blood lactate greater than 2 mmol/L is included within the operational definition of septic shock and lactate should be repeated if the initial value exceeds 2 mmol/L. In a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) study, the mortality rate for children with hypotension requiring vasopressors with lactate greater than 2 mmol/L was 32.0% compared with 16.1% if lactate was less than or equal to 2 mmol/L, and other studies have shown that lactate levels greater than 4 mmol/L are consistently associated with mortality. Although blood lactate may be affected by conditions of the blood draw, both venous and arterial lactate measurements have been shown to be independently associated with mortality in children. In one prospective pediatric study, normalization of lactate within 2–4 hours of presentation was associated with decreased risk of persistent organ dysfunction (adjusted RR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29–0.78). However, no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have tested whether initial or serial lactate measurement directly informs evaluation and/or management in children, and lactate levels should therefore be interpreted as part of a more comprehensive assessment of clinical status and perfusion.

### Varying association of laboratory values with reference ranges and outcomes in critically ill patients: an analysis of data from five databases in four countries across Asia, Europe and north America [^3622ca44]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2021). High credibility.

Laboratory results

The IQR and median values of the most severely deranged measured laboratory investigations, for creatinine (maximum), haemoglobin (minimum), lactate (maximum) and sodium (maximum), stratified by database and patient outcomes, are displayed in online supplemental table 2. The locally used normal reference ranges for each database are also reported.

Regarding the distribution of investigation results and their corresponding reference ranges, the sodium measurements of best outcome patients consistently fell within the corresponding normal range (online supplemental figure 1), though other laboratory results did so variably. While the upper margin of the creatinine reference range includes the vast majority of best outcome patients from the PLAGH-ICUdb and UCIHJ23db, increasing proportions of best outcome patients had creatinine values beyond the upper margin in AUMCdb, MIMIC and eICU-CRD (online supplemental figure 2). The distribution of haemoglobin results shows that the majority of patients tended to record values below the lower margin of their local reference range across all databases, irrespective of whether they had best or worst outcomes (figure 1). Similarly, the distribution of lactate measurements indicates that a substantial proportion of patients with best outcomes had a measured lactate above the upper margin of local reference ranges, particularly in MIMIC and eICU-CRD (figure 2).

### Cerebrospinal fluid analysis in the workup of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome: a systematic review [^f5032466]. JAMA Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

GLUT1 deficiency syndrome is a treatable neurometabolic disorder, characterized by a low concentration of glucose in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and a decreased CSF to blood glucose ratio. Reports of patients with apparently normal CSF glucose levels, however, have raised the question whether CSF analysis is a reliable screening tool for GLUT1 deficiency syndrome.

Objective

To determine the value of CSF analysis in the workup of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome.

Evidence Review

PubMed was searched until July 2012 by using the terms glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) deficiency syndrome, glucose transporter defect, and SLC2A1-gene. Relevant references mentioned in the articles were also included. The CSF results of all patients with genetically proven GLUT1 deficiency syndrome described in literature were reevaluated.

Findings

The levels of glucose in CSF, the CSF to blood glucose ratios, and the levels of lactate in CSF were reported for 147 (94%), 152 (97%), and 73 (46%) of 157 patients, respectively. The CSF glucose levels ranged from 16.2 to 50.5 mg/dL and were at or below the 10th percentile for all 147 patients. The CSF to blood glucose ratios ranged from 0.19 to 0.59 and were at or below the 10th percentile for 139 of 152 patients (91%), but they could be within the normal range as well. The CSF lactate levels ranged from 5.4 to 13.5 mg/dL and were at or below the 10th percentile for 59 of 73 patients (81%). A typical CSF profile for GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, which is defined as a CSF glucose level at or below the 10th percentile, a CSF to blood glucose ratio at or below the 25th percentile, and a CSF lactate level at or below the 10th percentile, was found in only 35 of 4099 CSF samples (0.9%) present in our CSF database of patients who received a diagnosis other than GLUT1 deficiency syndrome.

Conclusions and Relevance

We conclude that if age-specific reference values are applied, CSF glucose and lactate levels are adequate biomarkers in the diagnostic workup of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome. Future availability of whole-exome sequencing in clinical practice will make the existence of a reliable biomarker for GLUT1 deficiency syndrome even more important, in order to interpret genetic results and, even more importantly, not to miss SLC2A1-negative patients with GLUT1 deficiency syndrome.

### Serum lactate testing to predict mortality in patients with sepsis… [^821765fc]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

2 In a single-center cohort study of 830 adults with sepsis who were admitted to the hospital from the emergency department, 28-day mortality was independently associated with increased lactate levels. 2 Mortality was increased in patients with sepsis and an initial lactate level of 4. 0 mmol per L or greater, compared with a lactate level less than
2. 0 mmol per L. In this study, a single lactate level of 4. 0 mmol per L or greater at the time of sepsis diagnosis had a sensitivity of
0. 51, a specificity of 0. 75, a positive likelihood ratio of
2. 0, and a negative likelihood ratio of 0. 65 for predicting 28-day mortality.
2. Prospective data from nearly 20, 000 patients in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign demonstrated that a single serum lactate level greater than 4. 0 mmol per L in the presence of hypotension is associated with higher in-hospital mortality compared with either a serum lactate level of
4.

0 mmol per L or less or the absence of hypotension. A retrospective cohort study of 1, 865 adults with sepsis found that average lactate scores within the first 24 hours of hospital admission had a higher sensitivity, similar specificity, and greater area under the receiver operating characteristic curve than qSOFA for predicting 30-day mortality. 6 The AUROC of lactate is similar to that of the SOFA score. 6 These scores have marginal accuracy for predicting mortality because an AUROC of 0. 6 to
0. 7 is considered poor.
7. Harms Although a lactate level greater than
4. 0 mmol per L clearly correlates with higher mortality in patients with sepsis, lactate levels between 2. 0 and
4. 0 mmol per L are often incorrectly used to identify septic shock, which could lead to overdiagnosis and the unnecessary initiation of aggressive treatment. Moreover, lactate can be elevated for other reasons, including hepatic disease.

An overemphasis on lactate level without consideration of the clinical context could provide false reassurance or lead to unnecessary interventions, hospitalizations, or higher level of care.

### Tissue ischemia microdialysis assessments following severe traumatic haemorrhagic shock: lactate / pyruvate ratio as a new resuscitation end point? [^862994d2]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Additionally, fluid administration, which is a core treatment for shock and hypovolemia for preserving effective haemodynamic functions and tissue perfusion, has limits and adverse effects. Excessive fluid amounts lead to diluted coagulation factors, hypothermia and endothelial glycocalyx damage. Hypervolemia and fluid overload also lead to interstitium expansion. These influence the transcapillary gas and substrate exchange and decrease oxygen transport to tissues. Hypovolemia leads to vasoconstriction and microvasculatory blood flow restriction, which cause ischemia due to low oxygen and substrate delivery. Tissue perfusion could be altered with the administration of vasoactive agents, and knowledge of metabolic tissue conditions (i.e. LPR) during haemostatic resuscitation could help guide treatment.

Lactataemia evaluation in shock is typically difficult in practice; elevated arterial lactate levels are associated with increased mortality and morbidity, and lactate normalisation is one of most frequent resuscitation targets. Arterial lactate could be elevated without clinical signs of shock but could also be an indication of on-going ischemia. In contrast, during a shock state, lactate could accumulate in low or non-perfused tissues, and serum levels could be falsely determined to be low. After tissue perfusion is restored, lactate levels increase as a sign of reperfusion, and high lactate levels could be connected with normal aerobic metabolism. The normalisation of lactate values depends on the hepatic clearance of lactate or its consumption in tissues, which could also decrease during shock. It is expected that lactate levels will follow the oxygen debt, but in some clinical conditions, lactate levels may normalise without the resolution of tissue oxygen debt. There are also a number of non-ischemic factors that elevate lactate levels (e.g. stress and catecholamines). Arterial lactate levels should, therefore, be critically evaluated because assessment of the lactate levels alone fails to discriminate between ischemia and aerobiosis.

Lactate and lactate clearance

Lactate production in the human body is greatest in muscle and, under normal conditions, is predominantly hepatically cleared, with a small contribution of renal clearance. In CS, with decreased tissue perfusion, microcirculatory dysfunction, and high levels of endogenous catecholamines, cells switch into anaerobic metabolism, and lactic acid is produced. Lactate rises in situations of beta-2 receptor activation in skeletal muscle, which triggers aerobic glycolysis and lactate production as an alternative source of fuel — this phenomenon is often seen with epinephrine administration. While the absolute levels of lactate are established prognostic markers in multiple shock states, these patients are highly dynamic, and an assessment of lactate over time may be of greater value. In 2018, Fuernau et alevaluated serum lactate levels and lactate clearance (LC) in a cohort of the IABP-SHOCK II trial, finding that serum lactate at 8 hours and LC were independent predictors of 30-day mortality. They also found that an 8-hour lactate of ≥ 3.1 mmol/L and LC of −3.45%/h in the first 8 hours of resuscitation were of highest predictive value. In a substudy of the CAPITAL DOREMI trial, LC was shown to be an independent predictor of 30-day survival as early as 8 hours after enrollment. Complete LC, defined as the time between baseline lactate to the first normal lactate (defined as < 2.0 mmol/L), was the strongest predictor of 30-day survival of all the definitions of LC. A similar distinguishing LC value at 8 hours for survival was seen in CAPITAL DOREMI: −5.55%/h in survivors and −3.06%/h in nonsurvivors. An understanding of LC and a time point of 8 hours could support a short, predefined period of pharmacologic stabilization to monitor those patients who will continue to improve and not require advanced therapies vs avoiding "missing the window" to escalate support in those patients who would continue to fail on first-line support and may benefit the most from the addition of MCS. To date, randomized trials utilizing LC as an endpoint in resuscitation of other shock states have not shown improvements in mortality. No such trials have been conducted in CS, suggesting another potential area for future study.

### Sodium lactate, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, dextrose (LACTATED Ringer's AND DEXTROSE) [^c767af26]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions. Sodium (Na+) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Chloride (Cl−) has an integral role in buffering action when oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs in the red blood cells. The distribution and excretion of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) are largely under the control of the kidney which maintains a balance between intake and output.

Sodium lactate provides sodium (Na+) and lactate (C3H503−) ions. The lactate anion is in equilibrium with pyruvate and has an alkalizing effect resulting from simultaneous removal by the liver of lactate and hydrogen ions. In the liver, lactate is metabolized to glycogen which is ultimately converted to carbon dioxide and water by oxidative metabolism. The sodium (Na+) ion combines with bicarbonate ion produced from carbon dioxide of the body and thus retains bicarbonate to combat metabolic acidosis (bicarbonate deficiency). The normal plasma level of lactate ranges from 0.9 to 1.9 mEq/liter.

Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production).

Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium.

### The prognostic value of blood lactate levels relative to that of vital signs in the pre-hospital setting: a pilot study [^c49bd671]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Pre-hospital blood lactate levels were associated with in-hospital mortality.

- A blood lactate level of 3.5 mmol/L was the best cut-off value in the pre-hospital phase to discriminate survivors from non-survivors.

- The prognostic value of pre-hospital blood lactate level was superior to that of heart rate and systolic blood pressure.

- The use of blood lactate measurement in EMS might have potential for triage decisions, earlier detection of occult shock and earlier start of goal-directed therapy.

Evaluation and therapeutic approach of tissue hypoperfusion

Lactate

Measurements of blood lactate levels can be useful to detect occult tissue hypoxia and also to monitor the effects of therapy.

Lactate is a byproduct of glycolysis. In the first phase, which is anaerobic and occurs in the cytoplasm, glucose is transformed into pyruvate. If oxygen is present, the pyruvate enters the mitochondria to participate in the second phase of reactions, generating ATP, H 2 O, and CO 2, but can also be transformed into lactate if oxygen is lacking or in some cells that do not contain mitochondria. In normal conditions, most pyruvate enters the mitochondria, so that the normal lactate/pyruvate ratio is around 10. In anaerobic conditions, pyruvate cannot enter the mitochondria and massive amounts of lactate will be produced and the lactate/pyruvate ratio increases well above 20.

It is commonly accepted that hyperlactatemia is mostly of hypoxic origin in critically ill patients with circulatory failure. However, tissue hypoxia cannot be sustained for long periods of time without inducing cell death, as the energy produced by anaerobic metabolism is quite low compared to aerobic metabolism. Mild hyperlactatemia in hemodynamically stable septic patients is often not related to tissue hypoxia. Sepsis-induced inflammatory mediators accelerate aerobic glycolysis, increasing pyruvate availability. This increase in pyruvate availability can lead to increased lactate production, even in the presence of large amounts of oxygen. In addition to the increased lactate production, a decrease in lactate clearance can participate in hyperlactatemia. In patients with shock, hyperlactatemia is often of hypoxic origin shortly after admission, while hyperlactatemia persisting for more than 1 day is often of nonhypoxic origin.

### Agreement between arterial and peripheral venous lactate levels in the ED: a systematic review [^39e30589]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In the Emergency Department, lactate measurement is a useful tool to risk-stratify critically ill patients. However, it is unclear whether arterial or peripheral venous lactate levels can be used interchangeably for this purpose. In this systematic review, we provide an overview of studies investigating the agreement between arterial and peripheral venous lactate levels in the Emergency Department.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials/Wiley, Web of Science/Clarivate Analytics, and references of selected articles were assessed for all studies comparing arterial and peripheral venous lactate levels in adult patients in the emergency department. Two reviewers independently screened all potentially relevant titles and abstracts for eligibility using a standardized data-worksheet.

Results

Nine studies were included. Peripheral venous lactate levels tend to be higher than arterial lactate levels with mean differences ranging from 0.18 mmol/l to 1.06 mmol/l. Importantly, poorer agreement occurs in hyperlactatemia. At a cut-of level of 1.6 mmol/l, peripheral venous lactate can rule out arterial hyperlactatemia with a sensitivity between 94% and 100%. At a cut off value of 2 mmol/l, sensitivities of 97% and 100% were found.

Conclusion

Agreement between arterial and peripheral venous lactate is poor in hyperlactatemia, making peripheral venous lactate an unreliable parameter to use interchangeably in the ED. In clinical practice, peripheral venous lactate can be used as a screening tool to rule out arterial hyperlactatemia at a cut-off value of 2 mmol/l. However, hyperlactatemia should be confirmed using arterial sampling in case of a peripheral venous lactate level > 2 mmol/l.

Lactic acidosis is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and is commonly considered in the differential diagnosis of patients on ART. In the developing world, definitive diagnosis by laboratory measurement of lactate may be impossible. Point-of-care devices are available that provide simple, accurate measurements of lactic acid levels at relatively low cost. Their use in an HIV treatment programme in rural Haiti has greatly assisted clinical decision-making in patients with symptoms suggestive of lactic acidosis.

### Is lactic acidosis after lung transplantation associated with worse Outcomes? [^5cb7b9aa]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Elevated lactate levels may be caused by increased production suggestive of tissue ischemia; however, they may also occur without evidence of ischemia, by catecholamine activation of beta receptors. The purpose of this study was to determine the factors associated with increased lactate levels during and after lung transplantation and to evaluate whether lactate levels were associated with increased time to extubation and postoperative complications.

Methods

This was a retrospective study of patients who underwent lung transplantation between January 2015 and May 2017 at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. Multivariable linear regression was used to determine the factors associated with peak lactate levels and to find the associations between lactate levels and outcomes of nitric oxide time, intubation time, length of stay, and creatinine level. Logistic regression was used to determine the associations between lactate levels and acute kidney injury and atrial fibrillation.

Results

A total of 86 patients underwent single-lung transplantation (n = 17; 20%) or double-lung transplantation (n = 69; 80%). All patients initially had normal lactate levels. On univariate analysis, lactate levels at several time points were correlated with subsequent acute kidney injury, increased time to extubation, and increased nitric oxide time. After adjustment, the study found that higher peak intensive care unit lactate levels (regression coefficient B = 0.046; interquartile range, 0.006, 0.086; P = 0.025) were associated with longer length of stay.

Conclusions

Cardiopulmonary bypass time, total ischemic time, and catecholamine use were associated with higher lactate levels, whereas nitric oxide and higher pulmonary artery pressures were associated with lower levels. Increased lactate levels were independently associated with longer intubation times, postoperative acute kidney injury, and longer length of stay.

### The value of blood lactate kinetics in critically ill patients: a systematic review [^6f75aac1]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

We searched databases of PubMed, Science Direct, and Embase until the end of February 2016 to identify studies that evaluated the capacity of serial blood lactate concentrations to predict outcome, using the search terms "Lactate levels" OR "lactate clearance" AND "shock" OR "critically ill" AND "mortality". We included original prospective or retrospective clinical studies. There was no restriction based on language. We excluded studies in pediatric populations, experimental studies, case reports, and studies that did not report changes over time in lactate values or relationship of changes in lactate concentrations to all-cause mortality rates. We had no restriction on the initial location in the hospital (e.g. ICU, trauma unit, emergency room, operating room). We also checked the reference lists of included articles to capture any references missed during the search. We classified the different adult populations into general ICU patients, general surgical ICU patients, cardiac surgery patients, trauma patients, patients with sepsis, patients with cardiogenic shock, post-cardiac arrest patients, patients with respiratory failure, and others.

Blood lactate — use of trends to guide resuscitation: We suggest using trends in blood lactate levels, in addition to clinical assessment, to guide resuscitation of children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). In children with an elevated blood lactate, repeat testing that reveals a persistent elevation in blood lactate may indicate incomplete hemodynamic resuscitation and should prompt efforts to further promote hemodynamic stability. Pediatric evidence includes one observational study of lactate-guided resuscitation that included 77 children with sepsis in the ED, in which lactate normalization was associated with a decreased risk of persistent organ dysfunction (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.29–0.73 and adjusted RR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29–0.78); indirect adult evidence includes six RCTs with a total of 1,007 patients evaluating lactate-guided resuscitation of patients with septic shock.

### Contemporary hemodynamic monitoring, fluid responsiveness, volume optimization, and endpoints of resuscitation: an AAST critical care committee clinical consensus [^71afd3a8]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Heart rate/blood pressure/urine output

Heart rate, blood pressure, and urine output are basic vital signs that can be obtained non-invasively. Variations in heart rate can be one of the earliest signs of hypovolemia and malperfusion. Blood pressure and urine output provide added qualification for suspected diagnoses but are delayed in their presentation. There are many limitations to using these endpoints of resuscitation in isolation. However, due to their ease of acquisition, they form the basis of basic patient assessment and should be supplemented by other elements to be discussed in the following sections.

Recommendation: Heart rate, blood pressure, and urine output should be monitored in all patients who are undergoing resuscitation. These endpoints must be used in context of the individual patient and their limitations considered thoroughly.

Serum lactate

Serum lactate is a biomarker of global tissue malperfusion. Lactic acidosis is the most common type of metabolic acidosis present in hospitalized patients. Assuming normal cellular respiration, abnormal lactate levels can be assumed to be based on abnormal oxygen delivery. When poor oxygen delivery is due to hypovolemia and/or low cardiac output, lactate can be used to guide resuscitative efforts.

Serum lactate is a component of many resuscitative algorithms including the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and the sepsis3 pathways as described by the Society of Critical Care Medicine. The optimal frequency in which to follow serum lactate is unclear. Every 6 hours until normal has been well described but newer, point-of-care devices allow for a much higher frequency, the value of which is yet to be seen definitively in the literature. Initial serum lactate in the setting of septic shock and its rate of clearance are strongly predictive of survival.

Recommendation: Serum lactate should be followed serially during a resuscitation until normalized. The frequency of these serial assessments should be no longer than every 6 hours but where appropriate, higher frequencies may be beneficial. Serum lactate should not be used in isolation.

### Blood lactate monitoring in critically ill patients: a systematic health technology assessment [^345b44f1]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To decide whether the use of blood lactate monitoring in critical care practice is appropriate. We performed a systematic health technology assessment as blood lactate monitoring has been implemented widely but its clinical value in critically ill patients has never been evaluated properly.

Data Source

PubMed, other databases, and citation review.

Study Selection

We searched for lactate combined with critically ill patients as the target patient population. Two reviewers independently selected studies based on relevance for the following questions: Does lactate measurement: 1) perform well in a laboratory setting? 2) provide information in a number of clinical situations? 3) relate to metabolic acidosis? 4) increase workers' confidence? 5) alter therapeutic decisions? 6) result in benefit to patients? 7) result in similar benefits in your own setting? 8) result in benefits which are worth the extra costs?

Data Extraction and Synthesis

We concluded that blood lactate measurement in critically ill patients: 1) is accurate in terms of measurement technique but adequate understanding of the (an)aerobic etiology is required for its correct interpretation; 2) provides not only diagnostic but also important prognostic information; 3) should be measured directly instead of estimated from other acid-base variables; 4) has an unknown effect on healthcare workers' confidence; 5) can alter therapeutic decisions; 6) could potentially improve patient outcome when combined with a treatment algorithm to optimize oxygen delivery, but this has only been shown indirectly; 7) is likely to have similar benefits in critical care settings worldwide; and 8) has an unknown cost-effectiveness.

Conclusions

The use of blood lactate monitoring has a place in risk-stratification in critically ill patients, but it is unknown whether the routine use of lactate as a resuscitation end point improves outcome. This warrants randomized controlled studies on the efficacy of lactate-directed therapy.

Statistical Analysis

To describe population characteristics, we summarized categorical variables as percentages and continuous variables as mean (SD) if normally distributed and median (interquartile range) if non-normally distributed. We compared differences between groups (Sarnat stages 2 and 3; favorable and unfavorable outcome), using the χ 2 test for categorical variables, t test for continuous normally distributed variables, and Wilcoxon for continuous non-normally distributed variables. To study the association of initial blood lactate levels and maximal blood lactate levels with unfavorable versus favorable outcome, we used logistic regression and adjusted for Sarnat stage 3 versus 2 as proxy for severity. We did not impute missing values and excluded participants with missing values.

Data were analyzed with Stata 17 (StataCorp), and graphs were done using Stata 17 and Microsoft Excel (2016 MSO Version 2208). We followed STROBE reporting guidelines.

### Even mild hyperlactatemia is associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients [^9cbec0c3]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

We found that a significant percentage (47.5%) of critically ill patients who had lactate measured within 24 hours of ICU admission had an admitting lactate level of ≤ 2 m M, with overall hospital mortality of 30%. It has been reported that 24% to 34% of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock have lactate levels within the reference range. Trzeciak et al. evaluated 1,177 patients with primary or secondary diagnosis of infection and had serum lactate measured and found that most (70.3%) patients had lactate of 0.0 to 2.0 m M.

The evidence linking lactate within the reference range (0.01 to 2.0 m M) to mortality is also limited. We found that relative hyperlactatemia was an independent predictor of both hospital and ICU mortality. Nichol et al. in their prospective observational study of 7,155 consecutive critically ill patients, found that increased admission lactate within the reference range was independently associated with increased hospital mortality in general critically ill patients. Trzeciak et al. found that patients with infections and lactate < 2 m M had a mortality of 15% compared with 25% for patients with lactate 2.1 to 3.9 m M and 38% for those with lactate ≥ 4 mM (P < 0.001). In our study, we found that a lactate of 1.35 m M was the best cutoff threshold to discriminate between survivors and nonsurvivors among critically ill patients who had lactate within the reference range. Interestingly, this cutoff threshold was similar in patients with sepsis and also in patients with shock. This may be of significant importance in identifying severe sepsis early, which is one of the main targets of sepsis-management quality-improvement initiatives.
