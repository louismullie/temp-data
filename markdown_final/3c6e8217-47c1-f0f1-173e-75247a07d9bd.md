## Question

If i suspect lactose free diarrhea and bicarbonate came low what should i do

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do when they suspect lactose-free diarrhea and the serum bicarbonate is low. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the terminology and whether "lactose-free diarrhea" means osmotic diarrhea from non-lactose carbohydrates or something else. Then, I should verify what a low bicarbonate implies diagnostically and whether it changes the workup. Next, I will review the differential for chronic diarrhea and decide which tests are most appropriate now. After that, I should consider empiric dietary and medical strategies while awaiting results. Finally, I will outline red flags, follow-up, and when to escalate to colonoscopy or specialty referral, making sure each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because I need to ensure we are not conflating lactose malabsorption with other carbohydrate malabsorption or secretory diarrheas. "Lactose-free diarrhea" is not a standard term; it likely refers to diarrhea that persists despite avoiding lactose, which pushes me to consider other osmotic sources such as fructose, sorbitol, mannitol, FODMAPs, or secretory causes like bile acid diarrhea, microscopic colitis, or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, rather than assuming lactose is the driver when it has already been removed from the diet [^d831b51f] [^71bdac81] [^cd618621].

> Wait, let me verify what a low serum bicarbonate means in this context. A low bicarbonate typically reflects metabolic acidosis, which is not expected in straightforward lactose malabsorption; lactose maldigestion produces fermentation and gas with relatively little net acid loss, so a low bicarbonate should prompt me to look for processes with bicarbonate wasting or organic acid generation, such as congenital chloride diarrhea, congenital sodium diarrhea, or other secretory diarrheas, and to reassess for ongoing stool losses or an alternative diagnosis rather than attributing symptoms to lactose when lactose has been excluded [^ce44bfde] [^bd1d86e4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should construct a prioritized differential. In a patient with persistent diarrhea and low bicarbonate, I need to consider secretory diarrheas including bile acid diarrhea, microscopic colitis, and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, as well as carbohydrate malabsorption beyond lactose such as fructose or FODMAP intolerance, and less common entities like congenital diarrheas or post-infectious IBS, while remembering that many patients have overlapping functional features that amplify symptoms even with modest osmotic loads [^cd618621] [^71bdac81] [^30d4d9a4].

> I will now examine the immediate diagnostic steps, but I should confirm which tests are most informative now. Given persistent diarrhea and low bicarbonate, I should obtain stool studies to characterize the diarrhea as osmotic versus secretory and to look for fat malabsorption, including stool sodium and potassium to calculate the osmotic gap, and fecal elastase to screen for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency; I should also check celiac serology if not already done, and consider fecal calprotectin if inflammatory disease is a concern, while reserving breath testing for later if dietary trials fail or if specific carbohydrate malabsorption remains suspected [^9e2b7da1] [^3bc9e7c0] [^71bdac81].

> Let me think about empiric management while awaiting results, because I need to balance symptom control with diagnostic clarity. I should initiate a structured, time-limited dietary trial that removes common non-lactose fermentable carbohydrates such as fructose, sorbitol, mannitol, and other FODMAPs for about 2 weeks, then reintroduce systematically to identify triggers; this approach is supported as a first-line, cost-effective strategy for suspected carbohydrate intolerance, with breath testing reserved for refractory cases or when the history strongly suggests a specific sugar [^71bdac81] [^30d4d9a4].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist despite a low-FODMAP approach or if the stool studies suggest fat malabsorption. I should double-check for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency with fecal elastase, and if low, initiate a trial of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy; I need to remember that a therapeutic response to enzymes does not by itself confirm EPI, so objective testing should precede long-term therapy to avoid masking other diagnoses or delaying correct treatment [^9e2b7da1] [^7935ba0e].

> Next, I should review when to escalate structural evaluation. If diarrhea persists beyond about 4–6 weeks, or if there are alarm features such as weight loss, anemia, nocturnal symptoms, or blood in stool, I should arrange colonoscopy with random biopsies to evaluate for microscopic colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or other organic pathology; in parallel, I should consider testing for bile acid diarrhea with SeHCAT or serum C4 if available, or an empiric trial of a bile acid sequestrant when testing is not accessible, because BAD is a common, treatable cause of chronic watery diarrhea [^3bc9e7c0] [^cd618621] [^1ab915c0].

> I need to ensure supportive care is optimized while the workup proceeds. For symptomatic control of watery diarrhea, loperamide can be considered in adults without inflammatory features, titrated carefully to effect and tolerability; in patients with IBS-D features, guidelines support loperamide as a first-line agent, though some guidance advises caution with continuous use and emphasizes individualized risk–benefit discussion [^8940e933] [^d7ecb933] [^ad87407a].

> Let me reconsider the role of breath testing, because I should confirm whether it adds value now. Routine hydrogen breath testing for lactose is not recommended in IBS or undifferentiated chronic diarrhea, and given lactose has already been removed, testing for other carbohydrates should be reserved for patients who fail dietary trials or have a highly suggestive history; if pursued, I should use validated protocols and interpret results in the context of transit and microbiome variability to avoid false positives or negatives [^707ed0ec] [^7a174b1c] [^fc072cb6].

> I should confirm follow-up and safety netting. Within 2–4 weeks, I will reassess symptoms, diet adherence, and any new red flags; if the patient improves on a low-FODMAP diet, I will guide gradual, stepwise reintroduction to define tolerance thresholds and ensure nutritional adequacy, whereas if there is no improvement, I will proceed with colonoscopy and targeted testing for bile acid diarrhea, EPI, and other organic causes, adjusting the plan based on results and response to therapy [^71bdac81] [^3bc9e7c0] [^cd618621].

> In summary, I should not anchor on lactose when the patient is already lactose-free; instead, I will treat the low bicarbonate as a clue to ongoing bicarbonate losses or a secretory process, pursue stool characterization and fecal elastase, implement a structured low-FODMAP trial with careful reintroduction, and escalate to colonoscopy and BAD testing if symptoms persist or alarms emerge, aligning each step with guideline-based care and the patient's risk profile [^d831b51f] [^71bdac81] [^3bc9e7c0] [^cd618621].

If you suspect lactose-free diarrhea and the bicarbonate is low, **evaluate for alternative osmotic or secretory causes** such as fructose or sorbitol malabsorption, bile acid diarrhea, or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^d831b51f] [^cd618621] [^9e2b7da1]. Low bicarbonate suggests **metabolic acidosis** from ongoing bicarbonate losses or an acid-producing process, not lactose malabsorption [^ce44bfde]. Order stool electrolytes with an osmotic gap, fecal elastase, and consider breath tests for fructose/sorbitol or SIBO if symptoms persist [^71bdac81] [^fc072cb6] [^abd170ba]. Manage with targeted dietary changes, treat identified causes, and correct acid-base disturbances as needed [^7435f64f] [^bd1d86e4].

## Interpretation of low bicarbonate in lactose-free diarrhea

Low serum bicarbonate indicates **metabolic acidosis**, which is not expected in isolated lactose malabsorption; lactose intolerance typically causes osmotic diarrhea without significant acid-base disturbance [^157021c0]. Low bicarbonate suggests ongoing bicarbonate losses or an acid-producing process, such as:

- **Bicarbonate losses**: chronic diarrhea from secretory causes (e.g. bile acid diarrhea, congenital diarrheas) or pancreatic bicarbonate wasting [^ce44bfde] [^82745743].
- **Acid production**: fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrates (e.g. fructose, sorbitol) producing short-chain fatty acids and lowering bicarbonate [^notfound].
- **Renal or endocrine causes**: renal tubular acidosis, adrenal disorders, or other metabolic conditions [^cf67938f].

---

## Differential diagnosis of lactose-free diarrhea with low bicarbonate

When lactose has been excluded and bicarbonate is low, **consider**:

| **Category** | **Conditions** |
|-|-|
| Osmotic diarrhea | - Fructose malabsorption <br/> - Sorbitol malabsorption <br/> - Sucrase-isomaltase deficiency <br/> - Magnesium-containing antacids [^notfound] |
| Secretory diarrhea | - Bile acid diarrhea <br/> - Microscopic colitis <br/> - Infectious diarrhea (post-infectious IBS) <br/> - Neuroendocrine tumors (e.g. carcinoid, VIPoma) [^cd618621] [^e44ddca8] |
| Malabsorption syndromes | - Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency <br/> - Celiac disease <br/> - Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) [^9e2b7da1] [^abd170ba] |
| Congenital diarrheas | - Congenital sodium diarrhea <br/> - Congenital chloride diarrhea (metabolic alkalosis more typical) [^ce44bfde] |
| Renal/endocrine | - Renal tubular acidosis <br/> - Adrenal insufficiency <br/> - Diabetic ketoacidosis [^cf67938f] |

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

A **structured evaluation** is essential:

- **Confirm lactose exclusion**: ensure strict lactose avoidance during evaluation [^notfound].
- **Stool studies**: obtain stool electrolytes (Na, K) to calculate the osmotic gap; a gap > 50 mOsm/kg suggests osmotic diarrhea, while < 50 mOsm/kg suggests secretory diarrhea [^notfound].
- **Fecal elastase**: test for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, especially if steatorrhea or weight loss is present [^9e2b7da1].
- **Breath tests**: consider fructose/sorbitol breath tests if osmotic diarrhea is suspected; consider SIBO breath testing if risk factors are present (e.g. prior surgery, motility disorders) [^71bdac81] [^abd170ba].
- **Colonoscopy**: consider if symptoms persist > 4 weeks or if microscopic colitis or IBD is suspected [^3bc9e7c0].
- **Blood tests**: evaluate for celiac disease, thyroid dysfunction, and metabolic/endocrine causes as indicated [^3bc9e7c0].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **identified cause**:

- **Osmotic diarrhea**: implement dietary restriction of the offending carbohydrate (e.g. low-FODMAP diet) and consider enzyme replacement if indicated (e.g. sucrase-isomaltase) [^71bdac81] [^24946c2e].
- **Secretory diarrhea**: treat the underlying cause (e.g. bile acid sequestrants for bile acid diarrhea, anti-inflammatory therapy for microscopic colitis, antibiotics for SIBO) [^8381b7f4] [^0ae617aa] [^abd170ba].
- **Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency**: initiate pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) [^notfound].
- **Metabolic acidosis**: correct the acid-base disturbance with oral bicarbonate supplementation or treat the underlying cause as indicated [^bd1d86e4].

---

## Clinical implications and prognosis

Persistent diarrhea with low bicarbonate can lead to **electrolyte disturbances, dehydration, and growth failure** if untreated. Prognosis depends on the underlying cause and response to therapy; most osmotic and secretory diarrheas improve with targeted treatment, whereas congenital or structural causes may require long-term management [^ce44bfde].

---

Low bicarbonate in lactose-free diarrhea signals **metabolic acidosis** from bicarbonate losses or acid production; **evaluate for alternative osmotic/secretory causes** and correct the acid-base disturbance to prevent complications.

When should feeding be initiated following rehydration — recommendations and evidence: Human milk feeding should be continued in infants and children throughout the diarrheal episode (strong, low), and resumption of an age-appropriate usual diet is recommended during or immediately after the rehydration process is completed (strong, low). Evidence includes that early feeding (within 12 hours of beginning rehydration) was as safe and effective as later feeding among children aged < 6 years old with acute diarrhea, and a meta-analysis of 33 trials involving children < 5 years of age found that a lactose-free diet reduced the duration of diarrhea by an average of 18 hours and reduced treatment failure by one half. Although the BRAT diet and avoidance of dairy are commonly recommended, supporting data for those interventions are limited, and instructing patients to refrain from eating solid food for 24 hours does not appear to be useful.

### Lactose intolerance… [^94f3a63b]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

If lactase enzymes are absent or deficient, unabsorbed sugars osmotically attract fluid into the bowel lumen. The fluid influx into the bowel is approximately triple the predicted amount based on the osmolality of the sugar content alone, because the intestine cannot maintain a high electrochemical gradient between contents and blood. 1 In addition to increasing the volume and fluidity of the gastrointestinal contents, unabsorbed lactose entering the colon is affected by bacteria. Fermentation produces gas and results in the cleavage of lactose into monosaccharides. These monosaccharides cannot be absorbed by the colonic mucosa, thus increasing osmotic pressure and drawing more fluid into the bowel. In lactase-deficient patients, some of the carbohydrates reaching the colon can be metabolized by bacteria into short-chain fatty acids and absorbed, but the net result of ingestion of lactose is a substantial rise in fluid and gas in the bowel.

Clinical Features Hypolactasia results in up to 75 percent of dietary lactose passing unaltered through the small intestine into the colon, where it is rapidly metabolized by colonic bacteria, producing excessive fluid and gas in the bowel. 4 The symptoms patients experience vary, however, according to the quantity of lactose ingested and patients' ability to digest lactose. 1 Ingestion of small to moderate amounts of lactose usually produces bloating, cramps, and flatulence but not diarrhea. Ingestion of larger amounts of lactose, a faster gastric emptying time, and faster intestinal transit time all contribute to more severe symptoms. Conversely, increased lactase activity in the small intestine reduces symptoms. Other foods and the presence of suitable microflora in the colon can cause patients to be more symptomatic. Diagnosis Diagnosis of lactose intolerance can usually be made on the basis of the history, supported by dietary manipulation.

Diagnostic tests range from changes in breath hydrogen levels or serum glucose levels after ingestion of standard doses of lactose to biopsy of the small bowel. 9 A rise in breath hydrogen concentration greater than 20 ppm over baseline after lactose ingestion suggests hypolactasia. The lactose breath hydrogen test is positive in 90 percent of patients with lactose malabsorption. The amount of lactose used for the breath hydrogen test is not physiologic. 11, 12 Dairy products should not be totally eliminated because they provide key nutrients such as calcium, vitamins A and D, riboflavin, and phosphorus. 12 Diary products provide approximately 75 percent of the calcium available in the U. S. food supply.

Food protein–induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) — chronic presentation includes a severe pattern with regular ingestion of the offending food causing intermittent but progressive vomiting and diarrhea (occasionally with blood) with possible dehydration and metabolic acidosis, and a milder pattern with lower doses (eg, solid foods or food allergens in breast milk) causing intermittent vomiting and/or diarrhea with poor weight gain/failure to thrive without dehydration or metabolic acidosis; the most important diagnostic criterion is resolution within days after elimination with acute recurrence when reintroduced, with vomiting in 1–4 h and diarrhea in 24 h (usually 5–10 h), and without confirmatory challenge the diagnosis remains presumptive.

These guidelines deal with clinical assessment in primary and secondary care of a patient with diarrhoea, the exclusion of cancer or inflammation, and detecting common disorders such as bile acid diarrhoea, microscopic colitis, lactose malabsorption or post radiation diarrhoea, together with rarer causes of malabsorption and surgical disorders as outlined in figure 1. Options for therapy are not dealt with as it is beyond the remit of this guideline, nor has the cost effectiveness of investigations been addressed due to paucity of available evidence.

Summary of all recommendations

We recommend the following investigation algorithm based on the clinical differential diagnosis outlined in figure 1.

Dietary carbohydrate intolerance and diagnostic approach — In patients with disorders of gut–brain interaction (DGBIs), "fructose intolerance was more common — seen in 60% of patients — and was higher than lactose intolerance (51%), and its prevalence was similar across all major types of DGBIs, except IBS-C". The "simplest and most economically sound way to diagnose any food intolerance is usually a dietary restriction of short duration (2 weeks), with resolution of symptoms as a positive predictor". Breath testing, "which measures hydrogen, methane, and CO2, is a better low-cost option, albeit reserved for patients refractory to dietary restrictions first and suspected lactose, fructose, or sucrose intolerances".

### Differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea: an algorithm to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea from other organic gastrointestinal diseases, with special focus on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^fcdfd1d3]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

EXOCRINE PANCREATIC INSUFFICIENCY

Although most commonly associated with diseases of the exocrine pancreas, EPI is also caused by a number of extrapancreatic diseases. Approximately 80% of children with cystic fibrosis develop EPI within the first 2 years of life, and between 10% and 30% of patients with mild and 85% of patients with severe chronic pancreatitis will develop EPI. Among patients with pancreatic cancer, ~72% will develop EPI (this becomes 3.36 times more frequent if the tumor is located in the head of the pancreas rather than in the body or tail of the pancreas). In patients with pancreatic disease, the low levels of secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bicarbonate are caused by loss of function of the parenchyma and/or obstruction of the main pancreatic duct.

Patients with EPI have a reduced quantity or activity of pancreatic enzymes in the intestinal lumen, which results in failure to digest food normally. The most clinically relevant feature of EPI is inadequate fat digestion; for diarrhea to develop, the quantity and quality of ingested food overcomes the digestive ability of the exocrine pancreas. The prevalence of symptoms in patients with EPI is highly variable, owing mainly to different dietary habits and dietary restrictions. In clinical studies of patients with confirmed EPI, the frequency of clinically overt steatorrhea (fatty/oily loose stools) varied from 23% to 70% in chronic pancreatitis, 46% in pancreatic cancer before surgery, and 15% in cystic fibrosis. It is necessary to obtain a detailed patient history because dietary restrictions are important confounding factors: for example, low fat intake, perhaps as a means of managing symptoms, may impede a diagnosis of EPI because a patient consuming a diet low in fat may be asymptomatic.

### Update on lactose malabsorption and intolerance: pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management [^21999f7e]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

In many clinical studies, only a minority of patients with LI on HBT report satisfactory improvement in symptoms after treatment to reduce intake of dairy products or supplement lactase. Moreover, it remains unclear, to what extent the therapy itself and conditioning of patient expectations contribute to outcome. Lack of improvement can also be due to the presence of functional bowel disorders, which are present in many patients referred for investigation. These patients are sensitive to various nutrients, mechanical and chemical stimuli and, therefore, rarely respond to restriction of dairy products alone.

IBS patients develop symptoms after ingestion of a range of poorly absorbed, fermentable carbohydrates (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs)) that includes but is not restricted to lactose even in LM patients. A low-FODMAP diet improves abdominal symptoms in 50%–80% of IBS patients. This dietary therapy requires commitment from the patient and is best delivered by professional dietician. Identification of factors predicting dietary outcome would improve compliance and cost-effectiveness of this intervention; however, in a large clinical study neither clinical presentation nor HBT results (high dose lactose 50 g or fructose 35 g) predicted response to the low-FODMAP diet. The response to an intermediate dose of a representative, non-absorbable FODMAP (eg, lactulose 20 g) that rarely c symptoms in health, but often induces bloating, abdominal pain and diarrhea in FGID patients may improve the ability of HBT to identify individuals that respond to this dietary intervention. Alternatively, bioassays to identify saccharolytic bacteria and/or fermentation capacity in faecal samples might be developed that predict outcome of lactose (or FODMAP) restriction in patients.

### Rational investigations in irritable bowel syndrome [^3bc9e7c0]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder which accounts for a substantial proportion of a gastroenterologist's time in the outpatient clinic. However, there is variability in approaches to diagnosis and investigation between physicians, dependent on expertise. Many patients express disappointment over the lack of a patient-centred approach. Consequently, there have been calls for the care of patients with IBS to be standardised, a process which aims to promote high-quality and high-value care. Making an early diagnosis, based on a clinical assessment of symptoms, while limiting use of investigations, are key tenets of this process. Exhaustive investigation to exclude all organic pathology is unnecessary, and may be counterproductive. Routine blood tests in suspected IBS have low yield, but are an acceptable part of routine practice. All patients should have coeliac serology tested, regardless of their predominant stool form. Patients with diarrhoea should have a faecal calprotectin measured, and should proceed to colonoscopy to exclude inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) if this is positive. Beyond this, the need for investigations should be made on a case-by-case basis, contingent on the reporting of known risk factors for organic pathology. Colonoscopy should be considered in any patient with alarm features for colorectal cancer, and in those whose clinical features are suggestive of microscopic colitis. A 23-seleno-25-homotaurocholic acid (SeHCAT) scan should be considered in patients with IBS-D, a third of whom may actually have bile acid diarrhoea. There is no role for routine hydrogen breath tests for lactose malabsorption or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Food protein–induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) — chronic phenotype and OFC interpretation: General criteria are provided for patients with chronic FPIES, but given the paucity of published reports of chronic FPIES, specific major and minor criteria could not be established at this time. For severe chronic FPIES, regular ingestion of the offending food (eg, infant formula) leads to intermittent but progressive vomiting and diarrhea (occasionally with blood) sometimes with dehydration and metabolic acidosis, whereas milder chronic FPIES from lower doses (eg, solid foods or food allergens in breast milk) causes intermittent vomiting and/or diarrhea with poor weight gain/FTT but without dehydration or metabolic acidosis. It is important to recognize 2 distinct hallmarks of chronic FPIES: asymptomatic status and normal growth when the trigger food is eliminated and recurrence of repetitive FPIES symptoms on reintroduction, and criteria for interpreting OFC results differ in the degree of neutrophilia and remove stool laboratory findings.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British society of gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^3d24f967]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

This illustrates a key underlying flaw of breath testing in isolation: that transit time is assumed rather than measured. The result of this assumption is that fast orocaecal transit can confound interpretation of an early hydrogen peak, a circumstance that is more likely after intestinal resection. This issue has been demonstrated in high-quality physiological and clinical studies with both lactulose and glucose.

The methodological problems and performance of hydrogen breath testing mean that it may add little when SBBO is suspected. A positive test will reinforce the clinician's prior view that the cause may be SBBO; a negative test will not exclude the diagnosis as a possibility. It is not clear that such an intermediate investigative step is necessary or of value. It would be reasonable to test for SBBO in patients with diarrhoea and a low to moderate pretest probability of SBBO. However, where the pretest probability is high — for example, in those with anatomical abnormalities such as dilation, diverticulosis, prior small bowel surgery or pseudo-obstruction — the most practical approach would be to proceed straight to an empirical antibiotic trial.

### Update on lactose malabsorption and intolerance: pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management [^18f5fa1e]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Testing for lactose intolerance

The major limitation of the genetic, enzymatic and gaxilose tests is that LM is common in healthy individuals, and a positive test does not confirm that symptoms are caused by this condition. For this reason, in our practice, HBT is the method of choice because reasonably reliable information about digestive function and patient symptoms are obtained.

The diagnosis of LI requires appropriate testing of symptoms using validated questionnaires designed for the purpose. A National Institute of Health consensus conference defined LI as 'the onset of GI symptoms following a blinded, single-dose challenge of ingested lactose by an individual with LM, which are not observed when the person ingests an indistinguishable placebo', thus supporting the case for blinded testing of symptoms. Although rarely performed outside clinical studies, blinded testing might be useful since in clinical practice, the correlation between self-reported symptoms of LI and objective findings on tests for lactose digestion is low. Indeed, among individuals referred for HBT, about half of those with normal lactose digestion report abdominal discomfort after an unblinded lactose challenge. Further, intolerance to dairy products is reported by 20% of all individualsand up to 70% of IBS patients in European populations with low rates of genetic LNP.

A 'blinded multiple dose challenge' would provide clarity not only regarding lactose digestion but also identify the amount of lactose that individuals could 'safely' consume (figure 6). Moreover, in subjects with known LNP, these could be performed at patients' homes with a negative control, low and intermediate lactose challenge (eg, 12.5 and 25 g, corresponding to 250 and 500 mL milk, respectively). This could help educate patients because, in real life, it is self-reported intolerance and not the objective results of testing that best predicts food choices. However, to the best of our knowledge, blinded home-based testing has not been tested in routine clinical practice. The need for a well-accepted, practical and cost-effective investigation of food intolerance that predicts the outcome of dietary therapy is a key clinical challenge in functional GI disorders. The ability to predict the outcome of dietary therapy would be the measure for an appropriate symptom assessment.

### Using breath tests wisely in a gastroenterology practice: an evidence-based review of indications and pitfalls in interpretation [^1d820794]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Breath tests are a simple and safe alternative to more invasive investigation strategies for many gastroenterological conditions. Both the hydrogen breath tests and the new 13C stable radioisotope breath tests are nonradioactive and safe in children and pregnancy. The range of diseases that can be identified include Helicobacter pylori infection, lactose and fructose intolerance, bacterial overgrowth, bile salt wastage, pancreatic insufficiency, liver dysfunction, and abnormal small bowel transit. In this review, the physiology supporting these tests and the principles of normal gas dynamics in the gut are briefly reviewed and then related to the test preparation and interpretation in two parts: 1) detection of H. pylori and 2) small bowel, pancreatic, and hepatobiliary disorders. A MEDLINE search reviewing all English language abstracts from 1966 to March, 2001 was performed, with an additional review of abstracts from major national meetings from 1997 to 2001. Using the information from this review, the performance characteristics of the various tests were detailed, and an attempt is made to provide some literature-based guidance regarding their indications and limitations. The interpretation of "flat" breath tests and the selective use of methane collection and colonic alkalinization are discussed. Breath tests are valuable tools that are, in general, underutilized in evaluating dyspepsia and functional bloating and diarrhea, as well as suspected malabsorption, including lactose intolerance.

Diet-Induced Diarrheas

Nutrient-specific induced diarrhea

■

Carbohydrate malabsorption

Selective carbohydrate-induced diarrheas result from genetic defects of enzymes involved in digestion of complex carbohydrates and disaccharides or from defects in monosaccharide absorption. Diet-induced diarrhea, gas, and abdominal distention are common clinical features in affected patients. The degree of the clinical symptoms is proportional to the degree to which the offending carbohydrate's dietary load exceeds the intestine's nutrient-specific absorptive capacity. Elimination and stepwise introduction of specific carbohydrates with resolution and then a resumption of diarrhea when challenged is an efficient clinical tool to diagnose this group of disorders. Genetic testing provides a definitive diagnosis. Dietary elimination (or reduction) of the malabsorbed carbohydrate is the definite treatment approach (Table 2).

Introduction

Lactose metabolism continuous to fascinate anthropologists, geneticists, physiologists and clinicians. Studying the mechanisms of lactose digestion and intolerance has provided insights not only into dietary causes of functional intestinal symptoms but also into human evolution and nutrition, culture and lifestyle (box 1). Recent evidence has demonstrated the impact of lactose digestion on the human microbiota and general health. Considering these issues has raised possible concerns of a dairy-free diet. This review will emphasise recent developments in the clinical diagnosis and management of this condition (box 2).

FODMAP, fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide and monosaccharide and polyols.

These observations are similar to those in post-infective IBSand provide insight into the pathophysiological basis not only of food intolerance but, more generally, functional GI symptoms. IBS is a heterogenous condition; however, symptoms related to intake of food items with poorly absorbed, fermentable carbohydrates such as lactose are reported by up to 70% of patients with this diagnosis. Patients with LI and IBS complain of similar symptoms, have high rates of psychological comorbidity and markers of an activated innate mucosal immune system. Moreover, both respond to similar dietary interventions (see below). Together, this evidence suggests a common pathological basis in which a susceptible individual with a sensitive ('irritable') bowel develops symptoms when exposed even to a modest stimulus, such as low–moderate doses of lactose (figure 3).

### Systematic review: effective management strategies for lactose intolerance [^96a9408e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Lactose intolerance resulting in gastrointestinal symptoms is a common health concern. Diagnosis and management of this condition remain unclear.

Purpose

To assess the maximum tolerable dose of lactose and interventions for reducing symptoms of lactose intolerance among persons with lactose intolerance and malabsorption.

Data Sources

Multiple electronic databases, including MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library, for trials published in English from 1967 through November 2009.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials of individuals with lactose intolerance or malabsorption.

Data Extraction

Three investigators independently reviewed articles, extracted data, and assessed study quality.

Data Synthesis

36 unique randomized studies (26 on lactase- or lactose-hydrolyzed milk supplements, lactose-reduced milk, or tolerable doses of lactose; 7 on probiotics; 2 on incremental lactose administration for colonic adaptation; and 1 on another agent) met inclusion criteria. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that 12 to 15 g of lactose (approximately 1 cup of milk) is well tolerated by most adults. Evidence was insufficient that lactose-reduced solution or milk with a lactose content of 0 to 2 g, compared with greater than 12 g, is effective in reducing symptoms of lactose intolerance. Evidence for probiotics, colonic adaptation, and other agents was also insufficient.

Limitations

Most studies evaluated persons with lactose malabsorption rather than lactose intolerance. Variation in enrollment criteria, outcome reporting, and the composition and dosing of studied agents precluded pooling of results and limited interpretation.

Conclusion

Most individuals with presumed lactose intolerance or malabsorption can tolerate 12 to 15 g of lactose. Additional studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of lactose intolerance treatment.

### Omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate (omeprazole / bicarbonate) [^554821ee]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Presence of Gastric Malignancy

In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). In older patients, also consider an endoscopy.

5.2 Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis

Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) has been observed in patients taking PPIs and may occur at any point during PPI therapy. Patients may present with varying signs and symptoms from symptomatic hypersensitivity reactions to non-specific symptoms of decreased renal function (e.g., malaise, nausea and anorexia). In reported case series, some patients were diagnosed on biopsy and in the absence of extra-renal manifestations (e.g., fever, rash or arthralgia). Discontinue omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate and evaluate patients with suspected acute TIN [see Contraindications (4)].

5.3 Sodium Bicarbonate Buffer Content

Each 20 mg and 40 mg omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate capsule contains 1,100 mg (13 mEq) of sodium bicarbonate. The total content of sodium in each capsule is 304 mg.

Chronic administration of bicarbonate with calcium or milk can cause milk-alkali syndrome. Chronic use of sodium bicarbonate may lead to systemic alkalosis, and increased sodium intake can produce edema and weight gain.

The sodium content of omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate products should be taken into consideration when administering to patients on a sodium-restricted diet or those at risk for developing congestive heart failure.

Avoid omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate in patients with Bartter's syndrome, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and problems with acid-base balance.

5.4 Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea

Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British society of gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^3b00e6c5]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Only patients who remain undiagnosed after extensive traditional investigation and failed medical therapy should be considered for manometry studies. In the future non-invasive MRI may find a role in the diagnosis of diarrhoeal conditions. Recent studies have shown that this technique can provide comprehensive measurements of both motility and transit and can identify specific abnormalities in patients with diarrhoea-predominant IBS.

Recommendations

If functional bowel disease or IBS-diarrhoea is suspected, we recommend that bile acid diarrhoea should be excluded with either 75 SeHCAT testing or fasting serum C4 (7α hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one) levels. A test and treat approach is recommended as opposed to blind empirical therapy unless no diagnostic test is available (Grade of evidence level 1, Strength of recommendation strong).
Patients with very low 75 SeHCAT values are most likely to have a response to treatment with bile acid sequestrants. We recommend this is tried if the 75 SeHCAT value is < 15% or the fasting serum C4 is raised above defined laboratory values (Grade of evidence level 2, Strength of recommendation strong).
We recommend colonic biopsies to exclude microscopic colitis. These should be at least from the left side (not rectal) and, as microscopic colitis can be patchy, right-side biopsies may improve diagnostic yield (Grade of evidence level 1, Strength of recommendation strong).
Both glucose and lactulose hydrogen breath tests have poor sensitivity and specificity and are not recommended for the diagnosis of small bowel bacterial overgrowth (Grade of evidence level 2, Strength of recommendation strong).
The utility of concurrent hydrogen and methane breath testing with measurements of orocaecal transit time could reduce a false positive diagnosis due to variability in intestinal transit, but has not been subject to definitive clinical study hence cannot be recommended (Grade of evidence level 4, Strength of recommendation strong).
We recommend investigating for intestinal transit with manometry only if there is clinical suspicion and failure to respond to therapy (Grade of evidence level 4, Strength of recommendation strong).

Epidemiology

A recent meta-analysis estimated the prevalence of LM worldwide at 68% with higher rates reported for genetic tests than hydrogen breath tests (HBTs).LM is lowest in Nordic countries (< 5% in Denmark) and highest in Korean and Han Chinese populations (approaches 100%). Large variations in LM are seen on a regional level (figure 2), reflecting the underlying genetic heritage and prevalence of primary LD in these populations. Testing for LI is more complex and would require standardised hydrogen breath testing in large, carefully selected populations and, for this reason, the prevalence of LI is unknown.

### Bicarbonate therapy in severe metabolic acidosis [^bd1d86e4]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

The utility of bicarbonate administration to patients with severe metabolic acidosis remains controversial. Chronic bicarbonate replacement is obviously indicated for patients who continue to lose bicarbonate in the ambulatory setting, particularly patients with renal tubular acidosis syndromes or diarrhea. In patients with acute lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis, lactate and ketone bodies can be converted back to bicarbonate if the clinical situation improves. For these patients, therapy must be individualized. In general, bicarbonate should be given at an arterial blood pH of ≤ 7.0. The amount given should be what is calculated to bring the pH up to 7.2. The urge to give bicarbonate to a patient with severe acidemia is apt to be all but irresistible. Intervention should be restrained, however, unless the clinical situation clearly suggests benefit. Here we discuss the pros and cons of bicarbonate therapy for patients with severe metabolic acidosis.

### Hyperglycemia in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors: key clinical challenges and multidisciplinary consensus recommendations [^35ecfaf8]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Management

As DKA in patients with CIADM is common and life-threatening, we recommend all patients suspected to have CIADM be tested for capillary ketones, and if elevated or if serum bicarbonate is < 16 mmol/L without alternative cause, they should be referred to the hospital for workup of potential DKA. DKA management often requires intensive care admission for close metabolic monitoring, fluid and electrolyte replacement, and insulin infusion.

Patients with CIADM have absolute and fulminant beta cell failure as indicated by persistently low C-peptide on follow-up, and therefore should remain on lifelong insulin therapy. The lack of residual beta cell function in case series has led to higher levels of glycemic variability and more difficult glycemic control in a population often already burdened with comorbidities. We recommend all patients with CIADM be under the care of an endocrinology service to provide initial education and stabilization. We usually prescribe once daily long-acting insulin (eg, insulin glargine) starting at 0.2–0.3 units/kg/day (usually higher doses with higher starting body weight) plus fast-acting insulin to be given three times daily with meals (eg, insulin aspart) at 0.05–0.1 units/kg/meal.

Patients with CIADM should be considered eligible for supportive technologies available to those with type 1 diabetes, including insulin pump therapy and CGM. All patients with CIADM should also receive sick day management education, including hypoglycemia management, stress dosing, ketone monitoring, and DKA education. Patients with type 1 diabetes may benefit from diabetes education around sick day management and DKA if this has not occurred in the preceding 5 years.

Glucose targets should be tailored to the individual patient. In general, a glucose target of 5–10 mmol/L is reasonable; however, more flexible targets are appropriate if the patient is elderly, palliative, or experiencing frequent unpredictable hypoglycemia.

Case series suggest an under-recognized proportion of patients with CIADM have concurrent pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Fecal elastase can be tested in CIADM patients, in particular in those with symptoms of gastrointestinal malabsorption and if low replacement with pancreatic enzymes (eg, Creon 25 000 units with main meals) may be appropriate to improve these symptoms.

### Intestinal microbiota and diet in IBS: causes, consequences, or epiphenomena? [^72b9fec2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Evolving from previous studies on lactose and fructose intolerance, a more generalized approach of intolerance to poorly absorbed and rapidly fermented carbohydrates has been introduced: FODMAPS, including fermentable oligo-, di- and monosaccharides and polyols. Both retrospective and prospective open studies have shown reduced symptoms after introduction of a low-FODMAP diet in IBS patients with suspected or proven fructose or lactose malabsorption. These findings are confirmed by randomized controlled trials, showing a significant improvement of overall symptoms, abdominal pain and bloating, in patients with bloating and/or diarrhea and in small (n = 15−30) unselected IBS patient groups. One study showed recurrence of symptoms on re-challenge with fructose and/or fructans. Involvement of gas production is supported by findings that IBS patients produced more hydrogen relative to healthy controls and lacked an increased methane production on a high vs. low-FODMAP diet. However, it should be noted that the long-term benefit of a low-FODMAP approach in large (unselected) patient groups is unclear, especially considering its invasiveness, which requires strict guidance by a dietician, and the potential risks of, for example, reduced fiber intake and changes in microbiota composition and activity. Furthermore, randomized controlled trials are needed to prove whether it is superior to other dietary interventions (e.g. lactose or fructose reduction) or general dietary advice (e.g. the NICE guidelines). Finally, the FODMAP levels vary between studies, countries, and products, which should be taken into account when interpreting study results and considering low-FODMAP diets.

### Update on lactose malabsorption and intolerance: pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management [^30d4d9a4]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Lactose intolerance and IBS

The relationship of LI and IBS has been extensively studied in a South Chinese population with near 100% LNP on genetic testing. A double-blinded, randomised, cross-over comparison of lactose tolerance at 10, 20 and 40 g lactose was performed in IBS patients with diarrhoea (IBS-D) and healthy controls. There was a very strong correlation between the appearance of hydrogen gas in the breath and reports of bloating, pain and other symptoms in patients with lactose intolerance. However, the correlation between the amount of hydrogen gas in the breath and the severity of symptoms was much weaker. Consistent with preliminary findings in a European population, a key observation was that the risk of symptoms and the severity of symptoms were greatly increased in IBS patients, especially at the low to moderate doses found in the normal diet. It is well known that many patients with functional GI disorders have psychological comorbidity and are hypersensitive to dietary and physical stimuli that affect the digestive tract. Further work demonstrated that anxiety, visceral hypersensitivity (defined by rectal barostat) and high levels of gas production on breath tests all increased the severity of abdominal symptoms after ingestion of 20 g lactose. Moreover, mucosal biopsies from the ileum and colon showed increased numbers of mast cells and intraepithelial lymphocytes in lactose-sensitive patients and showed that the release of inflammatory cytokines (eg, tumour necrosis factor) after lactose intake was higher in this group than controls.

Box 2
Clinical relevance of lactose intolerance

Lactose intolerance is defined as symptoms on lactose exposure in individuals with lactose malabsorption.
Most individuals with lactose malabsorption tolerate a dose of at least 12 g lactose (corresponding to 250 mL of milk) without problems. Larger doses may be tolerated if consumed with food or spread over a whole day.
Symptoms of lactose intolerance depend on the strength of the stimulus (ie, lactose dose) and the presence of visceral hypersensitivity, as observed in many patients with IBS.
Treatment options for lactose intolerance include a low-lactose diet, oral lactase enzyme replacement, prebiotics that produce bacterial lactase in the colon and, potentially, prebiotics that adapt the colonic microbiota.
Intolerance of low–moderate lactose doses often indicates the presence of IBS. Such individuals are sensitive to a range of poorly absorbed, fermentable foods ('FODMAPs'). Effective dietary treatment in this group requires not a low-lactose but a low-FODMAP diet.

### Algorithms or biomarkers in patients with lower DGBI? [^9527dd1e]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Several organizations have proposed guidelines or clinical decision tools for the management of patients with disorders of gut-brain interactions (DGBI) affecting the lower digestive tract including irritable bowel syndrome and chronic idiopathic constipation. Such algorithms are based on sequential therapeutic trials and modifying the treatment strategy based on efficacy and adverse events.

Purpose

The aims of this review are to evaluate the evidence for efficacy of second- and third-line pharmacotherapies and to assess the evidence for the alternative option to manage subgroups of patients with symptoms suggestive of lower DGBI based on diagnostic tests or documented dysfunctions. The preeminent tests to identify such subgroups that present with symptoms that overlap with lower DGBI are detailed: digital rectal examination as well as anorectal manometry and balloon expulsion for evacuation disorders, detailed measurements of colonic transit, and diagnosis of bile acid diarrhea or carbohydrate malabsorption based on biochemical measurements. The review also addresses the cost implications of screening to exclude alternative diagnoses and the costs of therapy associated with the therapeutic options following an algorithmic approach to treatment from the perspective of society, insurer, or patient. Finally, the costs of the diagnostic tests to identify actionable biomarkers and the evidence of efficacy of individualized therapy based on formal diagnosis or documentation of abnormal functions are detailed in the review.

### Update on lactose malabsorption and intolerance: pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management [^d484534c]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Lactose intolerance and quality of life

Like other functional GI disorders, LI is not a trivial condition but has a negative impact on quality of life and nutrition. Anxiety increases the risk of symptoms ('intolerance') after lactose ingestion, but the fear that food will trigger bloating, pain and diarrhoea is also a cause of anxiety. Indeed, in studies, not only patients with LI but also those with self-diagnosed LI who do not have the condition describe a lower quality of life than individuals without concerns about food intolerance. This anxiety generalises to other foods, and patients with LI often describe intolerance to a range of products, especially those known to cause bloating (eg, legumes and dried fruit). As a result, individuals might adopt a restrictive diet that could impact on health in a variety of ways. In severe cases, this form of behaviour is termed avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder by DSM-5, a form of eating disorder that is associated with weight loss but not with body dysmorphia.

Figure 6
Symptoms in individuals with lactose malabsorption depend on lactose dose and visceral hypersensitivity. A population of Chinese individuals (100% primary lactase non-persistence) including HV with no history of abdominal symptoms and individuals with IBS-D was tested three times with different lactose dosages (10, 20 and 40 g) in a blinded fashion. The likelihood of a clinically positive HBT was higher in individuals with IBS-D for the low and the intermediate lactose dose. HBT, hydrogen breath test; HV, healthy volunteers; IBS-D, diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. (Source: Adapted from Yang et al.)

Figure 7
Results of a hydrogen breath test of an individual with lactose intolerance with simultaneous assessment symptoms and H₂ levels, indicating lactose fermentation by the microbiota. An H₂ increase by ≥ 20 ppm over baseline indicates lactose malabsorption. When ¹³C-labelled lactose is administered, ¹³CO₂ levels indicate absorption and metabolisation of ¹³C-labelled lactose by the subject. Patient reports of abdominal symptoms subsequent to increases in these markers is diagnostic of lactose intolerance.

The lactose tolerance test measures glucose in plasma at different times (e.g. 0, 30, 60, 120 min) after ingestion of 50 g lactose. Although the test does not require complex or expensive equipment, its invasive nature (multiple blood samples) limits its utility. Use of capillary blood measurements with portable glucose metres makes the test less invasive but does not offer the same diagnostic accuracy as measurements in venous blood.

The gaxilose test involves the administration of the lactase substrate gaxilose (4-galactosylxylose) with measurement of D-xylose in urine or blood. Conceptually, gaxilose measurements are ideal for assessment of intestinal lactase since activity over the entire small intestine is measured. In a manufacturer-sponsored trial, the diagnostic accuracy of gaxilose tests (0.93) was higher than HBT (0.85) or lactose tolerance tests (0.79) in comparison to duodenal biopsies. However, this was not confirmed in an independent study when the genetic test (LCT-13'910:C/T) was used as reference.

### The association between initial serum bicarbonate levels and the management of dehydrated children in the emergency department: a retrospective review [^8b707ea4]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

There is no consensus in the current literature on the relevance of serum bicarbonate levels, cutoff benchmarks and the management of dehydration; therefore, this study aims to explore whether an association can be established between initial serum bicarbonate levels and the subsequent management of children between the ages of 0 to 36 months presenting to the emergency department (ED) with dehydration.

Methods

The study is a single center, retrospective review of 335 charts of children between 0 and 36 months of age presenting to the ED of an urban academic tertiary hospital between June 2014 and June 2016 with a medical history suggestive of dehydration and documented serum bicarbonate levels during their visits.

Results

A total of 310 charts were analyzed. No significant difference was found between mean serum bicarbonate levels of admitted and discharged patients (18.82 mmol/L vs 18.75 mmol/L; P = 0.89). Children with serum bicarbonate levels below 15 mmol/L were significantly more likely to receive a fluid bolus (P = 0.00) in the ED but neither the length of stay in the ED (P = 0.07) nor in the hospital (P = 0.41) was affected. Bounce backs within 7 days of discharge were not associated with serum bicarbonate levels at first presentation, but rather with a shorter duration of diarrhea (P = 0.013).

Conclusions

Initial serum bicarbonate level of dehydrated children does not appear to be associated with the severity of dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea and the patients' management in the ED or the hospital. Initial serum bicarbonate is associated with the decision to administer fluid boluses and potential bounce back.

5.1 Presence of Gastric Malignancy

In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate capsules does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). In older patients, also consider an endoscopy.

5.2 Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis

Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) has been observed in patients taking PPIs and may occur at any point during PPI therapy. Patients may present with varying signs and symptoms from symptomatic hypersensitivity reactions to non-specific symptoms of decreased renal function (e.g., malaise, nausea and anorexia). In reported case series, some patients were diagnosed on biopsy and in the absence of extra-renal manifestations (e.g., fever, rash or arthralgia). Discontinue Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate capsules and evaluate patients with suspected acute TIN [see Contraindications (4)].

5.3 Sodium Bicarbonate Buffer Content

Each 20 mg and 40 mg of Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsule contains, 1,100 mg (13 mEq) of sodium bicarbonate. The total content of sodium in each capsule is 304 mg.

Chronic administration of bicarbonate with calcium or milk can cause milk-alkali syndrome. Chronic use of sodium bicarbonate may lead to systemic alkalosis, and increased sodium intake can produce edema and weight gain.

The sodium content of Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate products should be taken into consideration when administering to patients on a sodium-restricted diet or those at risk for developing congestive heart failure.

Avoid Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate capsules in patients with Bartter's syndrome, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and problems with acid-base balance.

5.4 Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea

Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate capsules may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients.

This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.

### Update on lactose malabsorption and intolerance: pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management [^fc072cb6]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Tests for lactase enzymatic activities on intestinal biopsies will detect primary and secondary LM. While an endoscopy with sedation is not indicated for this purpose, this test can be performed if endoscopy is indicated for other reasons. It should be noted that lactase activity is patchy and more than a single biopsy may be required for optimal test accuracy.

The lactose HBT measures the excretion of hydrogen in expiratory air after an oral challenge with a standard dose of lactose. As hydrogen is not produced by mammalian enzymes, its presence indicates contact of the sugar with bacteria indicating LM, although small intestinal bacterial overgrowth cannot be excluded. In clinical practice, an intermediate lactose dosage of 20–25 g may be optimal. Smaller amounts of lactose lack sensitivity for LM. Larger amounts used in epidemiological studies (eg, 40–50 g, figure 6) induce symptoms even in healthy individuals with LM that tolerate the amount of lactose present in normal diets (see below). A baseline H₂ value < 20 ppm is a requirement for a reliable test and an increase ≥ 20 ppm within 3 hours is diagnostic of LM. Reducing observation time impairs sensitivity; however, only four measurements (0, 90, 120, 180 min) are required for valid results. An H₂-non-producing microbiota can lead to false-negative HBT. In some of these individuals, methanogenic bacteria (eg, Methanobrevibacter smithii) convert hydrogen to methane (CH₄) in a 4:1 ratio resulting in lower H₂ excretion and a lower fraction of positive tests. Simultaneous assessment of methane can partially overcome this limitation. Therefore, even though the increase in CH₄ is often low (< 20 ppm) and not correlated to symptoms, combined H₂/CH₄-measurements are recommended by some authors. A more reliable approach involves the use of ¹³C-lactose with simultaneous breath measurements of ¹³CO₂ as a marker of lactose digestion and H₂ as a marker of LM (figure 7); however, this technique is not available outside specialist centers.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^1ec6be5f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

IDSA infectious diarrhea — prevention and management notes that avoiding dehydration by ensuring adequate fluid and electrolyte intake for replacement and maintenance is the mainstay of diarrheal illness management. People with diarrhea should refrain from recreational water activities, food preparation or service, and sexual activities while symptomatic. Increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents and risk of worsening illness (such as diarrhea associated with C. difficile) can result from antimicrobial and antimotility drug use and highlight the need for appropriate use of these interventions. The burden of acute gastroenteritis has been reduced since implementation of 2 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–licensed rotavirus vaccines, recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in 2006 and 2008, and clinically significant disease and hospitalization and office visits have been decreased in infants who have received a rotavirus vaccine as well as in adults through community protection.

### Management of diarrhea in patients with carcinoid syndrome [^e44ddca8]. Pancreas (2019). Medium credibility.

Differential Diagnosis

In assessing a patient with suspected CS diarrhea, it is important to differentiate the GI symptoms of NETs from the diarrhea, abdominal pain, and dyspepsia related to other causes (eg, irritable bowel syndrome) by eliciting a thorough patient history that details age, sleep patterns, and nonspecific symptoms. Unfortunately, the literature on the differential diagnosis of CS diarrhea is limited. Diarrhea in patients with NETs is secretory, typically causing large-volume stools, with no osmotic gap between serum and stool, compared with malabsorptive diarrhea in other GI diseases. It may disturb sleep and is associated with bleeding, fever, weight loss, and persistent severe pain. Other causes of secretory diarrhea (eg, bile acid-induced diarrhea, medications, infections, and metabolic causes, including diabetes mellitus) should be ruled out. Inquiry about ingested laxatives and osmotic agents such as fructose and artificial sweeteners, which are common contributors to diarrhea in general, is important (Table 2).

TABLE 2
Practical Considerations for Noninfectious Chronic Diarrhea in Patients with Neuroendocrine Tumors

Diarrhea associated with CS tends to be watery after the first 1 or 2 movements, and the frequency of bowel movements can range from 2 to 5 in a day to more than 20, which can be extremely debilitating and deleterious to QoL. The presence of watery diarrhea, in association with cutaneous facial flushing (especially when associated with evidence of elevated serotonin blood levels), and radiographic evidence of malignancy is almost always diagnostic of CS diarrhea. Pellagra secondary to niacin depletion has been reported in patients with CS. Although biochemical niacin deficiency is not uncommon, clinical manifestations of pellagra, including diarrhea, are rare but could contribute to CS in some patients.

Ongoing diarrhea after initiation of therapy with selective somatostatin analogues (SSAs) is common and most commonly due to incompletely controlled CS. In such circumstances, the diarrhea retains the characteristics of the diarrhea prior to initiation of therapy but occurs less frequently.

Introduction

An estimated 4000 million cases of diarrhoea occurred worldwide in 1996, resulting in 2.5 million deaths.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for acute diarrhoea in adults living in resource-rich countries? What are the effects of treatments for acute mild-to-moderate diarrhoea in adults from resource-rich countries traveling to resource-poor countries? What are the effects of treatments for acute mild-to-moderate diarrhoea in adults living in resource-poor countries? What are the effects of treatments for acute severe diarrhoea in adults living in resource-poor countries? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to January 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 71 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, antimotility agents, antisecretory agents, bismuth subsalicylate, diet, intravenous rehydration, nasogastric tube rehydration, and oral rehydration solutions (amino acid oral rehydration solution, bicarbonate oral rehydration solution, reduced osmolarity oral rehydration solution, rice-based oral rehydration solution, standard oral rehydration solution).

Ancillary management — antimotility, antinausea, and antiemetic agents: Ancillary treatment with antimotility, antinausea, or antiemetic agents can be considered once the patient is adequately hydrated, but their use is not a substitute for fluid and electrolyte therapy (weak, low). Antimotility drugs (eg, loperamide) should not be given to children < 18 years of age with acute diarrhea (strong, moderate); loperamide may be given to immunocompetent adults with acute watery diarrhea (weak, moderate), but should be avoided at any age in suspected or proven cases where toxic megacolon may result in inflammatory diarrhea or diarrhea with fever (strong, low). An antinausea and antiemetic (eg, ondansetron) may be given to facilitate tolerance of oral rehydration in children > 4 years of age and in adolescents with acute gastroenteritis associated with vomiting (weak, moderate). During acute gastroenteritis, more children receiving ondansetron, compared with placebo, had resolution of vomiting and ondansetron reduced the immediate need for hospitalization or intravenous rehydration; however, ondansetron did not decrease hospitalization rates at 72 hours after discharge and diarrhea was reported as a side effect. A recommendation cannot be made for the routine use of antiemetic agents for acute gastroenteritis in children < 4 years of age or in adults; bismuth subsalicylate is mildly effective, and racecadotril reduces stool volume but is not available in North America.

### Diet management in congenital diarrheas and enteropathies-general concepts and disease-specific approach, a narrative review [^ce44bfde]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Congenital sodium diarrheas

Congenital sodium diarrheas (CSD) are a group of diseases with a similar diarrheal phenotype caused by impaired intestinal Na + absorption and characterized by high-fecal sodium loss, serum hyponatremia, and metabolic acidosis. CSD is a heterogeneous group of disorders, and this heterogenicity is observed genetically and clinically. Biallelic mutations in NHE3 / SLC9A3 (MIM #), a sodium hydrogen antiporter, and gain of function autosomal dominant mutation in GUCY2C (MIM #), an apical receptor activating cGMP, cause nonsyndromic CSD, whereas syndromic CSD results from SPINT2 mutations (MIM #).

Patients with CSD have watery electrolyte transport diarrhea, abdominal distension, and dilated fluid-filled bowel loops. The condition can go undiagnosed initially because the stools are voluminous and resemble urine. The large stool volume is responsible for progressive weight loss and dehydration. Stool sodium is very high, and the acid-base aberration in CSD is metabolic acidosis as opposed to the metabolic alkalosis in CCD. Chloride fecal loss, in addition to sodium losses, can be found in patients with GUCY2C mutation due to the downstream effect of the mutated protein on NHE3 and CFTR. Urine sodium will be low when body fluid status is uncorrected. Fractional sodium excretion is a more accurate marker of sodium status because it is independent of urine flow. Progressive weight loss and dehydration are common at disease onset, and acute renal failure may develop in patients with delayed diagnosis. Inflammatory bowel disease has been sporadically reported in patients with GUCY2C and NHE3 mutations.

### Update on lactose malabsorption and intolerance: pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management [^ade4b574]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Outlook

Primary genetic LP and non-persistence are common in healthy humans; however, ingestion of milk by individuals with LD leads to LM and, in susceptible patients, to symptoms of lactose intolerance. Diagnosis is based on detection either of the genetic mutation, loss of lactase activity in the enteric mucosa or evidence of malabsorption by breath tests. However, the association between self-reported LI, objective findings of tests and clinical outcome of dietary intervention is variable. Recent studies have provided important new insight into the complex relationship between LD, LM and symptom generation. This work has shed light on the important issue of food intolerance as a cause of symptoms in IBS and other functional GI disorders.

The development of a well-accepted, practical and cost-effective investigation of food intolerance that predicts the outcome of dietary therapy is one of the biggest clinical challenges in the field of functional GI disorders. Understanding the biological mechanism for food intolerance will help clinicians make a definitive diagnosis and guide rational dietary and medical management. Ongoing studies will provide high-quality evidence to document the clinical outcome, cost-effectiveness and long-term effects of these strategies.

A survey of US gastroenterologists published in 2018 also indicated that more than half (52.6%) of patients with IBS 'usually' or 'almost always' tried to self-manage symptoms before seeking care from a specialist. Gastroenterologists stated that diets 'usually' or 'almost always' tried by patients included trial and error (50%), reduced lactose (33%), gluten-free (24%), low-fat (6%), and low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs; 2%). More than half of survey respondents indicated that dietary modification was a primary management strategy for IBS; providers reported 'usually' or 'almost always' recommending low-FODMAP (77%), high-fiber (45%), reduced-lactose (45%), low-fat (18%), and gluten-free (12%) diets. Gastroenterologists reported that they considered a low FODMAP diet to be 'very effective' (20%) or 'somewhat effective' (65%) for their patients. Results of a meta-analysis of two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with IBS [n = 111; subtype(s) not specified] showed that patients with a previous response to a gluten-free diet who were then randomly assigned to receive a diet 'spiked' with gluten were more likely to experience a worsening of global IBS symptoms compared with patients assigned to continue a gluten-free diet [relative risk (RR) = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.1–1.6], although results were not significant. A RCT of 45 patients with IBS-D reported that those given a gluten-containing diet (n = 22) for 4 weeks had significantly more bowel movements per day compared with patients adhering to a gluten-free diet (n = 23; p = 0.04). Further, alterations in small intestinal barrier function were greater in patients receiving a gluten-containing diet than in those assigned to a gluten-free diet, as determined by the total urinary mannitol excretion (p = 0.03) and lactulose to mannitol ratio (p = 0.001). Overall, these study findings suggest that gluten, in particular, may be an exacerbating factor in the pathophysiology of IBS-D.

### Infectious diarrhea: IDSA updates guidelines for diagnosis and… [^7a5d09e9]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Diagnostic testing is not routinely recommended in patients with uncomplicated traveler's diarrhea.
- If diarrhea is accompanied by fever, bloody stools, abdominal cramping, or signs of sepsis, stool should be tested for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, Clostridium difficile, and STEC. Patients with fever or bloody diarrhea should be evaluated for enteropathogens for which antimicrobial agents may be beneficial, including Salmonella enterica, Shigella, and Campylobacter. Identifying these bacteria can avoid unnecessary antibiotic therapy and procedures such as colonoscopy, abdominal surgery, or ulcerative colitis treatment. Additionally, stool tests that are negative for infectious pathogens increase suspicion for a noninfectious cause. All patients with diarrhea should be assessed for dehydration.

Dehydration increases the risk of serious illness, especially in very young and very old patients. Early detection of Shiga toxin–producing. Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, Clostridium difficile, and STEC. Blood cultures should be performed in infants younger than three months and in patients with signs of septicemia or suspected enteric fever, patients with certain high-risk conditions, and patients who have traveled to endemic areas or had contact with travelers from endemic areas who have a fever of unknown etiology. Diagnostic testing is not routinely recommended in patients with uncomplicated traveler's diarrhea unless treatment is needed. However, those with diarrhea lasting 14 days or more should be tested for intestinal parasitic infection, and those who were treated with an antimicrobial within the preceding eight to 12 weeks should be tested for C. difficile infection.

Gastrointestinal tract disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease and postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome, should be considered. Empiric antibacterial therapy should be considered for patients who are immunocompromised and have bloody diarrhea or severe illness. However, empiric treatment of bloody diarrhea is not recommended in immunocompetent patients while waiting for test results unless the patient is an infant younger than three months and a bacterial etiology is suspected, the patient has a fever documented in a health care setting, abdominal pain, and bacillary dysentery presumably caused by.

PERT is effective for treating EPI (below). Patients with nonspecific symptoms, such as bloating, excess gas, and foul-smelling or floating stools may not have some improvement in these symptoms while taking PERT, but these symptoms are nonspecific and symptomatic changes may be a placebo effect or masking other disorders, such as celiac disease, causing delays in a correct diagnosis. Appropriate testing (eg, fecal elastase) should be suggested before initiating therapy with PERT.

### Update on lactose malabsorption and intolerance: pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management [^157021c0]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Lactose intolerance

Lactose malabsorption (LM) is a necessary precondition for lactose intolerance (LI). However, the two must not be confused and the causes of symptoms must be considered separately. Many individuals with LM have no symptoms after ingestion of a standard serving of dairy products (table 1) whereas others develop symptoms ('intolerance') such as abdominal pain, borborygmi (rumbling tummy) and bloating after lactose intake (figure 1). The onset of these symptoms is strongly correlated to the appearance of hydrogen gas during breath tests. Further, undigested lactose in the small intestine lead to osmotic trapping of water and the osmotic load in the colon is increased about eightfold by fermentation of lactose to SCFA. Diarrhoea will result if the respective load of lactose exceeds the capacity of the colonic microbiota for fermentation or the SCFA load exceeds the colon capacity for resorption.

The likelihood of developing symptoms after lactose ingestion is multifactorial (figure 3). Extrinsic factors include the amount of lactose ingested and whether dairy products are ingested with other foods that affect intestinal transit and the rate of lactose delivery to the colon. Intrinsic factors include expression of lactase at the brush border of the small intestine, history of GI disorders or abdominal surgery and the composition of the intestinal microbiome. When incubated in vitro with lactose, faecal samples from lactose-intolerant subjects mediated faster and higher production of SCFA than samples from lactose-tolerant subjects. However, an impact of SCFA on symptoms has not been directly demonstrated in humans. Further, in the anaerobic environment of the intestinal tract, generation of reducing equivalents result in rapid hydrogen production, and in several clinical studies, the amount of gas production correlated with the presence and severity of intestinal symptoms. Other patient factors not directly related to lactose digestion are also associated with LI. These include the presence of anxiety disorders, high levels of psychosocial stress and the presence of functional GI disorders such as IBS (figures 3 and 4).

### Omeprazole (omeprazole / sodium bicarbonate) [^49721186]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1 Presence of Gastric Malignancy

In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate for oral suspension does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). In older patients, also consider an endoscopy.

5.2 Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis

Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) has been observed in patients taking PPIs and may occur at any point during PPI therapy. Patients may present with varying signs and symptoms from symptomatic hypersensitivity reactions to non-specific symptoms of decreased renal function (e.g., malaise, nausea and anorexia). In reported case series, some patients were diagnosed on biopsy and in the absence of extra-renal manifestations (e.g., fever, rash or arthralgia).

Discontinue omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate for oral suspension and evaluate patients with suspected acute TIN [see Contraindications (4)].

5.3 Sodium Bicarbonate Buffer Content

Each 20 mg and 40 mg packet of Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate for Oral Suspension contains 1,680 mg (20 mEq) of sodium bicarbonate. The total content of sodium in each packet is 460 mg.

Chronic administration of bicarbonate with calcium or milk can cause milk-alkali syndrome. Chronic use of sodium bicarbonate may lead to systemic alkalosis, and increased sodium intake can produce edema and weight gain.

The sodium content of omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate products should be taken into consideration when administering to patients on a sodium-restricted diet or those at risk for developing congestive heart failure.

Avoid Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate in patients with Bartter's syndrome, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and problems with acid-base balance.

5.4 Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea

Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate for oral suspension may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.

### Pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of chronic watery diarrhea [^ed28163f]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic watery diarrhea poses a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge and is often a disabling condition for patients. Although acute diarrhea is likely to be caused by infection, the causes of chronic diarrhea (> 4 weeks in duration) are more elusive. We review the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic diarrhea. Drawing on recent insights into the molecular mechanisms of intestinal epithelial transport and barrier function, we discuss how diarrhea can result from a decrease in luminal solute absorption, an increase in secretion, or both, as well as derangements in barrier properties. We also describe the various extraepithelial factors that activate diarrheal mechanisms. Finally, clinical evaluation and tests used in the assessment of patients presenting with chronic diarrhea are reviewed, and an algorithm guiding therapeutic decisions and pharmacotherapy is presented.

### Pharmacological management of diarrhea [^df1da3b7]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

According to the World Health Organization, there are approximately 2 billion annual cases of diarrhea worldwide. Diarrhea is the leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years and kills 1.5 million children each year. It is especially prevalent in the developing world, where mortality is related to dehydration, electrolyte disturbance, and the resultant acidosis, and in 2001, it accounted for 1.78 million deaths (3.7% of total deaths) in low- and middle-income countries. However, diarrhea is also a common problem in the developed world, with 211 million to 375 million episodes of infectious diarrheal illnesses in the United States annually, resulting in 73 million physician consultations, 1.8 million hospitalizations, and 3100 deaths. Furthermore, 4% to 5% of the Western population suffers from chronic diarrhea. Given the high prevalence of diarrhea, research has been directed at learning more about the cellular mechanisms underlying diarrheal illnesses in order to develop new medications directed at novel cellular targets. These cellular mechanisms and targets are discussed in this article.

6.1 Fat malabsorption

Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency can lead to malabsorption (or more correctly maldigestion) and diarrhoea due to impairment of pancreatic enzyme and bicarbonate secretion. In adults, this is usually the result of chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic carcinoma or pancreatic surgery. Maldigestion of fat can result in steatorrhoea and weight loss but may not be clinically apparent. Steatorrhoea can be caused by small bowel malabsorption and clinical assessment of steatorrhoea (eg, by stool inspection) is unreliable. Symptoms of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency usually develop 10–15 years after first symptoms of chronic pancreatitis and when secretion of lipase and other pancreatic enzymes is reduced to < 10% of normal values. The diagnosis of advanced chronic pancreatitis in patients presenting with diarrhoea is often suggested by the clinical history and confirmed with imaging. A number of recent guidelines outline the current strategies for diagnosing chronic pancreatitis. There are international variations in practice depending on the availability of various modalities such as endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and direct pancreatic function tests. However, there is a broad agreement that invasive direct pancreatic function testing has become largely redundant in routine clinical practice, replaced by indirect pancreatic function testing and imaging. It is also recognised that there is currently no ideal test to diagnose chronic pancreatitis in early/mild disease.

### Effectiveness of three commonly used transition phase diets in the inpatient management of children with severe acute malnutrition: a pilot randomized controlled trial in Malawi [^0415fcff]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this study is the first to do a head-to-head comparison of the three most commonly used dietary regimens after initial stabilization of severely malnourished children. The results from our pilot study do not support the hypothesis that nutritional rehabilitation strategy with the highest carbohydrate content is associated with a higher percentage of patients with an acidic stool.

Studies have shown that diarrhea is very prevalent in severely malnourished children and is associated with worse clinical outcome. In low-resourced countries diarrhea is often thought to be associated with intestinal infections. In addition, malnutrition itself has also been associated with impaired integrity and absorptive function of the intestine. Studies have indicated that carbohydrate malabsorption in general and lactose intolerance specifically is prevalent in children with SAM. Based on small-bowel biopsies, reduced levels of dissacharidases, such as lactase, have been observed in children with SAM. In addition, monosacharide malabsorption has also been found in children with SAM. Malabsorption of these carbohydrates is well known to induce osmotic diarrhea, but only a few studies have focused on the possible relation between diet composition and diarrhea in children with SAM.

### Lactose avoidance for young children with acute diarrhoea [^9e3b1d20]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Young children with acute diarrhoea, typically due to infectious gastroenteritis, may temporarily stop producing lactase, the intestinal enzyme that digests lactose. This means they may not digest lactose, the main sugar in milk, and this may worsen or prolong the diarrhoeal illness. However, there is uncertainty whether avoiding lactose-containing milk or milk products helps young children recover from acute diarrhoea more quickly.

Objectives

To assess if avoiding or reducing intake of lactose-containing milk or milk products shortens the duration and severity of illness in young children with acute diarrhoea. We also sought other indicators of morbidity and overall mortality.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (14 May 2013), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) published in The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2013), MEDLINE (1996 to 14 May 2013), EMBASE (1974 to 14 May 2013), and LILACS (1982 to 14 May 2013), and the reference lists of potentially relevant trials, key conference proceedings, and wrote to individuals and organizations in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials that assessed the effects of avoiding or reducing exposure to lactose in young children under five years with acute diarrhoea.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data using the standard methods of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group, and two review authors independently evaluated trial quality and data extraction. Continuous outcomes were compared using mean difference (MD), and dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio (RR). We presented all results with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 33 trials enrolling 2973 children with acute diarrhoea. Twenty-nine trials were exclusively conducted on inpatients, all from high- or middle-income countries. Fifteen trials included children aged below 12 months, and 22 excluded children who were being breast-fed. Compared to lactose-containing milk, milk products, or foodstuffs, lactose-free products may reduce the duration of diarrhoea by an average of about 18 hours (MD -17.77, 95% CI -25.32 to -10.21, 16 trials, 1467 participants, low quality evidence). Lactose-free products probably also reduce treatment failure (defined variously as continued or worsening diarrhoea or vomiting, the need for additional rehydration therapy, or continuing weight loss) by around a half (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.68, 18 trials, 1470 participants, moderate quality evidence). Diluted lactose-containing milk has not been shown to reduce the duration of diarrhoea compared to undiluted milk or milk products (five trials, 417 participants, low quality evidence), but may reduce the risk of treatment failure (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.94, nine trials, 687 participants, low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

In young children with acute diarrhoea who are not predominantly breast-fed, change to a lactose-free diet may result in earlier resolution of acute diarrhoea and reduce treatment failure. Diluting lactose-containing formulas may also have some benefits but further trials are required to have confidence in this finding. There are no trials from low-income countries, where mortality for diarrhoea is high, and malnutrition is more common.

### Omeprazole sodium bicarbonate (not applicable) [^9ad5c3fb]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

5.4 Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) Deficiency

Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) caused by hypo-or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed.

5.5 Buffer Content

Each omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate capsule contains 1100 mg (13 mEq) of sodium bicarbonate. The total content of sodium in each capsule is 304 mg.

The sodium content of omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate products should be taken into consideration when administering to patients on a sodium restricted diet.

Because omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate products contain sodium bicarbonate, they should be used with caution in patients with Bartter's syndrome, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and problems with acid-base balance. Long-term administration of bicarbonate with calcium or milk can cause milk-alkali syndrome.

Chronic use of sodium bicarbonate may lead to systemic alkalosis and increased sodium intake can produce edema and weight increase.

5.6 Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea

Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2)]

Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.

5.7 Interaction with Clopidogrel

Avoid concomitant use of omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate with clopidogrel. Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is entirely due to an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by use with concomitant medications, such as omeprazole, that interfere with CYP2C19 activity. Concomitant use of clopidogrel with 80 mg omeprazole reduces the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel, even when administered 12 hours apart. When using omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate, consider alternative anti-platelet therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.5) and Pharmacokinetics (12.3)]
