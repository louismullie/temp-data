## Question

why should I get a cervical x-ray in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis prior to surgery

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why a cervical spine X-ray should be obtained before surgery in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the prevalence and pattern of cervical disease in RA and how often it is silent. Then, I should verify the specific instability patterns that change perioperative risk. Next, I will review the anesthetic and positioning hazards and how imaging mitigates them. After that, I need to check the radiographic thresholds that mandate surgical planning or urgent referral. Finally, I will consider the role of dynamic views, when to escalate to CT/MRI, and how modern biologics influence screening yield and timing of surgery, before synthesizing a practical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the disease burden and its clinical silence. Cervical spine involvement is common in RA, with reports ranging from roughly 43% to 86% depending on cohorts and imaging, and many patients are asymptomatic or have nonspecific pain, so I cannot rely on symptoms alone to exclude instability [^111H3awr] [^112FtPSh]. Wait, let me verify a striking clinical signal: in a cohort of RA patients awaiting orthopedic surgery, 44% had cervical subluxation or prior fusion, and a substantial fraction were asymptomatic, underscoring the need for routine screening before any operative procedure that involves airway management or positioning [^112FtPSh].

> I will now examine the instability patterns that change perioperative risk. The three classic RA cervical lesions are atlantoaxial subluxation, vertical translocation (cranial settling), and subaxial subluxation; each can compromise the cord and alter biomechanics during intubation, prone positioning, or traction, so I need to ensure I screen for all three on appropriate radiographs [^111hqj4C] [^111H3awr]. Hold on, I should verify that these patterns are indeed the ones linked to myelopathy and sudden death in RA cohorts, which they are, reinforcing the preoperative imperative to detect them early [^1126H5XX].

> Next, I should review the anesthetic and positioning hazards. Patients with atlantoaxial instability can experience worsening subluxation during neck extension for intubation, reducing the space available for the cord and risking neurologic injury; fluoroscopic studies show that a protrusion head position can reduce the anterior atlantodental interval and increase the posterior space, but this is not a substitute for preoperative identification and planning [^112j2UyW]. Let me consider the broader context: RA is explicitly listed as a condition for which standard trauma clearance rules like NEXUS do not apply, reflecting heightened baseline risk and the need for dedicated cervical imaging before any elective surgery with airway manipulation [^114UDZn5].

> I need to check the radiographic thresholds that trigger action. For atlantoaxial subluxation, an atlantodental interval greater than 3 mm on flexion is abnormal, and values around or above 5 mm indicate higher risk. A posterior atlantodental interval of 14 mm or less predicts cord compromise and paralysis risk, so I should flag these urgently [^111hqj4C] [^1131gDqn]. For vertical translocation, odontoid migration 5 mm or more above McGregor's line is concerning. For subaxial disease, translation of 3 mm or more or canal diameter less than 14 mm warrants escalation and surgical planning rather than routine anesthesia [^111hqj4C]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a posterior atlantodental interval less than 14 mm was the main instability marker. Hold on, I should verify that the anterior atlantodental interval greater than 3 mm is the instability threshold, whereas the posterior interval less than 14 mm predicts paralysis, which corrects my earlier phrasing and aligns with the literature [^111hqj4C] [^1131gDqn].

> Let me think about the imaging protocol. Dynamic flexion–extension lateral radiographs are essential because instability may be occult on neutral films. Dynamic views can reveal reducible or irreducible subluxation and better define the space available for the cord, directly informing intubation strategy and intraoperative positioning [^111wxjWf]. I should confirm that standard trauma guidance supports dynamic studies when instability is suspected and the patient is cooperative, which it does, reinforcing the role of flexion–extension X-rays in this RA preoperative context [^115W7VzU].

> But wait, what if plain films are equivocal or I need more detail for surgical planning. CT delineates erosions, pannus, and osseous anatomy for screw trajectories, while MRI best visualizes cord compression, pannus, and neural element involvement; both are appropriate next steps when radiographs are abnormal or neurologic deficits are present, and MRI is preferred when myelopathy is suspected or prior to definitive cervical spine surgery [^111hqj4C] [^111H3awr]. Hold on, I should verify guideline alignment: contemporary trauma and spine guidelines prioritize CT for bony definition and MRI for neural assessment when instability is suspected, which maps onto this RA preoperative pathway [^112nJRE5] [^111F8xFa].

> I should double-check how modern therapy changes screening yield. Even in optimally treated cohorts, cervical deformity remains prevalent at 10 years, with about 40% developing at least mild AAS and/or SAS, and about 7% developing significant AAS, so I cannot assume biologic control eliminates the need for preoperative cervical films [^1143mT8c]. Let me reconsider whether longer infliximab duration reduces cervical deformity; yes, observational data suggest an approximately 11% reduction in odds of deformity per additional year of infliximab exposure, but this complements rather than replaces preoperative screening because established deformities can persist or progress despite biologics [^113gxydb] [^1135rNMs].

> Next, I should review the consequences of missing instability. Severe cervical involvement in RA correlates with reduced survival and high risks of neurologic decline. Cohort data show high mortality in RA with cervical subluxations, and although operated patients in some series had worse crude survival than nonoperated, this reflected selection bias, with surgery improving local symptoms and likely altering the trajectory in high-risk patients when done before severe myelopathy [^1126H5XX]. I need to ensure I also note that Ranawat class IIIB patients have particularly dismal outcomes, arguing for earlier intervention rather than late salvage, which further justifies preoperative detection and planning [^116AY1LD].

> Let me synthesize the practical recommendation. Preoperative cervical spine radiographs, including neutral lateral and flexion–extension views, should be obtained in all RA patients undergoing surgery to screen for atlantoaxial, vertical, and subaxial instability that may be asymptomatic yet pose life-threatening risks during airway management and positioning; if instability is identified or films are inadequate, escalate to CT for bony detail and MRI for cord assessment, and coordinate surgical planning or urgent referral before proceeding with elective anesthesia [^116whM8j]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — this does not mean every patient needs surgery, but it does mean anesthesia and positioning plans must be individualized to mitigate instability risk, and only imaging can reliably uncover these lesions before it is too late to plan safely [^111wxjWf] [^112FtPSh].

---

Preoperative cervical X-rays are essential in RA patients because **cervical instability is common and often silent** [^111H3awr], posing risks of **neurologic injury during intubation and positioning** [^112j2UyW]. Early detection of atlantoaxial or subaxial subluxation [^111hqj4C] allows for **safe anesthesia planning** [^112j2UyW], avoidance of high-risk positions, and timely surgical stabilization to prevent irreversible myelopathy or death [^1126H5XX]. Routine flexion–extension radiographs are recommended for all RA patients undergoing surgery, regardless of symptoms [^116whM8j], to ensure **perioperative safety**.

---

## Prevalence and clinical significance of cervical spine involvement in RA

Cervical spine involvement is **common in RA**, with up to 86% of patients demonstrating radiographic evidence of cervical disease [^111H3awr]. The three primary patterns of instability are:

- **Atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS)**: The most common, with a prevalence of 12–20% [^114pCG87] [^114gqEa3] [^1112chcx].
- **Vertical subluxation (VS)**: Cranial settling or basilar invagination, occurring in 7–29% of patients [^notfound].
- **Subaxial subluxation (SAS)**: Less common but significant, occurring in 7–22% of patients [^notfound].

These instabilities can lead to **severe complications**, including spinal cord compression, myelopathy, and even sudden death [^1126H5XX]. Importantly, many patients with cervical instability are **asymptomatic or have subtle symptoms** [^112FtPSh], making clinical detection unreliable without imaging [^111wxjWf].

---

## Risks associated with cervical instability during surgery

Patients with cervical instability face **significant perioperative risks**, particularly during anesthesia and positioning:

- **Neurologic injury**: Intubation and positioning can exacerbate existing instability, leading to spinal cord compression and neurologic deficits [^113A216A].
- **Cardiovascular complications**: Autonomic dysfunction from spinal cord compression can cause hemodynamic instability [^notfound].
- **Mortality**: Severe cervical instability is associated with increased mortality, particularly in untreated or undertreated cases [^111GTsK9].

---

## Specific radiographic findings and their clinical implications

Preoperative cervical X-rays provide **critical information** about the extent and severity of cervical instability. Key radiographic parameters include:

| **Radiographic parameter** | **Clinical implication** |
|-|-|
| Atlantodental interval (ADI) > 3 mm | Indicates atlantoaxial instability, increasing risk of spinal cord compression [^1148Qkri] |
| Posterior atlantodental interval (PADI) < 14 mm | Predicts risk of paralysis and neurologic injury [^1131gDqn] |
| Ranawat value < 13 mm | Indicates vertical subluxation, associated with severe neurologic compromise [^113AKPDh] |
| Subaxial canal diameter < 14 mm | Suggests significant subaxial stenosis, increasing risk of myelopathy [^111hqj4C] |

---

These findings **guide surgical planning**, anesthesia management, and the decision to proceed with cervical stabilization prior to elective orthopedic procedures [^114N1VPW].

---

## Guidelines and recommendations for preoperative cervical spine imaging

Current guidelines and expert consensus **strongly recommend routine preoperative cervical spine imaging** for patients with RA:

- **Flexion–extension radiographs**: Recommended for all RA patients undergoing surgery, regardless of symptoms, to detect dynamic instability [^notfound].
- **MRI**: Indicated when neurologic deficits are present or when radiographs show significant instability, to assess spinal cord compression and soft tissue involvement [^111hqj4C].
- **CT**: Useful for detailed bony assessment, particularly in complex deformities or when surgical intervention is planned [^116whM8j].

---

## Impact of preoperative cervical spine imaging on surgical outcomes

Preoperative cervical spine imaging **significantly improves surgical outcomes** by:

- **Preventing neurologic injury**: Early detection of instability allows for appropriate anesthesia and positioning strategies, reducing the risk of intraoperative spinal cord injury [^112j2UyW].
- **Facilitating surgical planning**: Identifying the need for cervical stabilization prior to elective orthopedic procedures ensures optimal patient safety and outcomes [^112FtPSh].
- **Reducing mortality**: Timely intervention for cervical instability reduces the risk of fatal complications associated with severe cervical disease [^1126H5XX].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Preoperative cervical spine X-rays are **essential in patients with RA** to detect asymptomatic cervical instability, guide anesthesia and surgical planning, and prevent catastrophic neurologic complications. Given the high prevalence of cervical involvement and the potential for severe outcomes, routine preoperative imaging is a critical component of perioperative care in RA patients [^112FtPSh].

### Relationship between the morphology of the atlanto-occipital joint and the radiographic results in patients with atlanto-axial subluxation due to rheumatoid arthritis [^114ZhBJD]. European Spine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

The upper cervical spine is a common focus of destruction from rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Atlanto-axial subluxation (AAS) presents with marked frequency among patients with instability. However, there are occasional patients who show no motion between the occipital bone and atlas on a dynamic cervical radiograph in AAS patients. This study investigated the morphology of the atlanto-occipital joint (AOJ) in AAS patients due to RA using computed tomography, and examined the relationship between its morphology and other radiographic results. Twenty-six consecutive patients with AAS due to RA treated by surgery were reviewed. The subjects included 18 females and 8 males. The average patient age was 59.3 years. The mean duration of RA was 14.3 years. In all the patients, the AOJ was morphologically evaluated using sagittal reconstruction view on computed tomography before surgery. Moreover, the ADI value was investigated at the neutral and maximal flexion position, and atlanto-axial angle (AAA) at the neutral position in preoperative lateral cervical radiographs. The morphology of the AOJ on a CT sagittal reconstruction view was classified into three types as follows: a normal type which showed a maintenance of the joint space, a narrow type which showed a disappearance of the joint space and a fused type which showed the fusion of the AOJ. The pre-operative CT sagittal reconstruction image of the AOJ demonstrated a normal type bilaterally in six cases (Group A). In 15 cases (Group B), CT image demonstrated narrowing on at least one side of the AOJ. In five cases (Group C), CT images demonstrated fusion on at least one side of the AOJ. The average ADI value at the flexion position was 10.7 mm in Group A, 11.7 mm in Group B, and 12.6 mm in Group C. There was no significant difference among those groups. The average ADI value at the neutral position before surgery was 2.8 mm in Group A, 5.9 mm in Group B, and 10.4 mm in Group C. There was no significant difference between Group A and B (P > 0.105), and Groups B and C (P > 0.032), however, there was a significant difference between Groups A and C (P < 0.004). The average AAA value was 25.3 degrees in Group A, 19.3 degrees in Group B and 3.4 degrees in Group C. There was no significant difference between Groups A and B (P > 0.230), however, there was a significant difference between Groups A and C (P < 0.002), and Groups B and C (P < 0.007). This study showed that fusion or ankylosis of the AOJ induced an enlargement of the ADI and anterior inclination of the atlas in the neutral position, despite the fact that normal findings of AOJ showed a slight displacement of the atlas to axis in RA patients showing AAS involvement. This morphology may progress to SAS and VS due to AOJ after atlanto-axial arthrodesis.

### Cervical spine surgery in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: longterm mortality and its determinants [^115Fdp7g]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS) is a frequent manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The instability of the craniocervical junction caused by AAS is a potentially fatal condition and may require surgical treatment. Systemic manifestations associated with RA may increase the risk of perioperative complications. We evaluated the longterm mortality and its determinants in RA patients with AAS after cervical spine surgery.

Methods

A retrospective study of consecutive patients treated at Kuopio University Hospital between 1994 and 1998. Preoperative risk factors, neurological impairment using the Ranawat classification, perioperative course, functional outcome, and survival status were evaluated.

Results

During the study period 86 rheumatoid patients with AAS underwent cervical spine surgery. The mean followup time was 7.5 years (range 5.0–9.8). During the followup, 32 patients (37%) died. The mean survival time after surgery was 7.2 years (95% CI 6.7–8.0). Seven patients experienced postoperative complications. Age, AAS other than horizontal, and occurrence of complications were independent predictors of mortality. In two-thirds of the patients there was relief or decrease of pain, and the functional capacity improved. Neurological deficits subsided in 53% of cases.

Conclusion

Patients with RA should be actively studied for AAS or other cervical instability, even when cervical symptoms are minor. Attention should be paid to perioperative management of these patients. Surgical treatment may not decrease the mortality of patients with RA, but it may result in more symptom-free life-years.

Physical examination of the neck to diagnose AO and AA pain

The AA joint complex accounts for 60% of cervical rotational movement The pivot articulation occurs between the odontoid process of the axis and the ring formed by the transverse ligament of the atlas and the anterior arch. Common historical and physical examination findings of AA dysfunction include limited ROM during rotation as well as flexion and extension depending on the extent of tectorial membrane impairment. In more advanced cases, examination signs can include severely restricted rotation and lateral flexion of the cervical spine to the affected side, crepitus, prominent tenderness at the occipito–cervical junction, craniocervical kyphosis, and torticollis. The presence of gait abnormalities, radicular symptoms, and audiovisual symptoms are unlikely to be related to isolated AO or AA dysfunction.

Although the AO and AA joints can be visualized on imaging, including plain radiographs, imaging cannot confirm the origin of pain. Normal imaging does not rule out arthropathy and radiographic joint abnormalities are incapable of identifying a painful joint. For example, in a study involving 400 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 45.8% had radiographic evidence of AA involvement but only 45.4% of those individuals had neck pain Paradoxically, greater AA joint ventral subluxation was associated with less pain. Alternative imaging including bone window CT views of the AA joint, MRI, or cervical myelography may be needed to rule out concomitant alternative cervical spine pathology.

Recommendations

In summary, there are no pathognomonic historical signs or physical examinations that can reliably predict response to AA or AO joint blocks in individuals with chronic neck pain. AA and AO joint pain typically manifest in the C1, C2, or trigeminal nerve distribution, with AA pain having more reproducible and consistent symptoms than AO joint pain. We conclude that history and physical examination cannot reliably identify painful AO or AA joints, but can guide injection decisions which could confirm the AO and AA joints as pain generators: grade C recommendation, low level of certainty.

### Relevant incidence of cervical arthritis in patients with erosive seropositive rheumatoid arthritis even today [^11168cJC]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

This paper aims to investigate adherence to, and outcome of, radiographic screening of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for cervical involvement, given the availability of state of the art disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) and biological therapies.

Methods

Cervical screening results and clinical information were obtained from the charts of 395 consecutive patients with rheumatoid arthritis who attended an academic rheumatology outpatient clinic in a 3-month interval. This sample was combined with eight patients who underwent C1-C2 fusion at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery.

Results

Reports on cervical spine x-ray films were not found in the charts of 67 patients (17%), including 21 (8%) of the 257 patients with a disease duration of ≥ 5 years. Nevertheless, 17 (7%) of these 257 patients had an increased atlantodental distance. An additional 4 RA patients of the Department of Orthopaedics were added for a total of 21 patients with cervical arthritis, 13 of whom had no cervical symptoms. All 21 patients with cervical arthritis had erosive peripheral arthritis with at least 10 years of disease duration, and were positive for rheumatoid factor. Almost half of these patients were not under adequate DMARD therapy when cervical instability was diagnosed, and none were on biological response modifiers.

Conclusions

Screening for cervical arthritis is still of importance, especially in patients with erosive seropositive disease. In view of the documented incidence, adherence to screening protocols was disappointing.

### Radiographic assessment of the cervical spine in symptomatic trauma patients [^115W7VzU]. Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

Standards

A three-view cervical spine series (anteroposterior, lateral, and odontoid views) is recommended for radiographic evaluation of the cervical spine in patients who are symptomatic after traumatic injury. This should be supplemented with computed tomography (CT) to further define areas that are suspicious or not well visualized on the plain cervical x-rays.

Guidelines

There is insufficient evidence to support treatment guidelines.

Options

It is recommended that cervical spine immobilization in awake patients with neck pain or tenderness and normal cervical spine x-rays (including supplemental CT as necessary) be discontinued after either a) normal and adequate dynamic flexion/extension radiographs, or b) a normal magnetic resonance imaging study is obtained within 48 hours of injury. Cervical spine immobilization in obtunded patients with normal cervical spine x-rays (including supplemental CT as necessary) may be discontinued a) after dynamic flexion/extension studies performed under fluoroscopic guidance, or b) after a normal magnetic resonance imaging study is obtained within 48 hours of injury, or c) at the discretion of the treating physician.

### Surgical management of cervical degenerative disease: the evidence related to indications, impact, and outcome [^113wVG7Q]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2009). Medium credibility.

AANS/CNS therapeutic effectiveness classification and recommendation levels define Class I as evidence provided by one or more well-designed randomized controlled clinical trials, including overview (meta-analyses) of such trials; Class II as evidence provided by well-designed observational studies with concurrent controls (e.g. case control and cohort studies); and Class III as evidence provided by expert opinion, case series, case reports and studies with historical controls. Level I comprises generally accepted principles for patient management, which reflect a high degree of clinical certainty (usually this requires class I evidence which directly addresses the clinical questions or overwhelming class II evidence when circumstances preclude randomized clinical trials); Level II comprises recommendations for patient management which reflect clinical certainty (usually this requires class II evidence or a strong consensus of class III evidence); and Level III comprises other strategies for patient management for which the clinical utility is uncertain (inconclusive or conflicting evidence or opinion).

### Predictors of paralysis in the rheumatoid cervical spine in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty [^1131gDqn]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Rheumatoid arthritis is sometimes associated with radiographic evidence of instability of the cervical spine, most commonly an abnormal subluxation between vertebrae. When this instability compromises the space that is available for the spinal cord, it may be predictive of paralysis. However, the prevalence of radiographic signs of instability that are predictive of paralysis among patients with nonspinal orthopaedic manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown.

Methods

Radiographs of the cervical spine of patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had undergone total joint arthroplasty over a five-year period were retrospectively reviewed. The radiographs were evaluated for predictors of paralysis (a posterior atlantodental interval of < 14 mm or a subaxial space available for the cord measuring < 14 mm) and were compared with traditional parameters of instability (an anterior atlantodental interval of > 3 mm or subaxial subluxation of > 3 mm).

Results

Forty-nine of the sixty-five patients who were identified had flexion and extension lateral radiographs available for review. Only one of these patients had a posterior atlantodental interval of < 14 mm, and only three had a space available for the cord that measured < 14 mm at one level or more. In comparison, twenty patients had radiographic evidence of instability on the basis of traditional parameters.

Conclusions

Although nearly one-half of the patients in the present study had radiographic evidence of cervical instability on the basis of traditional measurements, only four patients (8%) had a radiographic finding that was predictive of paralysis. Thus, while radiographic evidence of cervical instability was not infrequent in this population of patients who underwent total joint arthroplasty for rheumatoid arthritis, radiographic predictors of paralysis were much less common.

### Incidence and aggravation of cervical spine instabilities in rheumatoid arthritis: a prospective minimum 5-year follow-up study of patients initially without cervical involvement [^1148Qkri]. Spine (2012). Low credibility.

Study Design

A prospective minimum 5-year follow-up study of the cervical spine in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) initially without cervical involvement.

Objective

To clarify the incidence and aggravation of cervical spine instabilities and their predictive risk factors in patients with RA.

Summary Of Background Data

Many reports have shown the progression of cervical spine involvement in RA. However, few articles have described comprehensive evaluation of its prognostic factors.

Methods

A total of 140 patients with "definite" or "classical" RA initially without cervical involvement were prospectively followed for more than 5 years. Radiographical cervical findings were classified into 3 instabilities: atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS: atlantodental interval > 3 mm), vertical subluxation (VS: Ranawat value < 13 mm), and subaxial subluxation (SAS: irreducible translation ≥ 2 mm). "Severe" extents were defined as AAS with atlantodental interval 10 mm or more, VS with Ranawat value 10 mm or less, and SAS with translation 4 mm or more or at multiple levels. Incidence of these developments and predictors for "severe" instabilities were investigated.

Results

During 6.0 ± 0.5 years, 43.6% of 140 patients developed cervical instabilities: AAS in 32.1%, VS in 11.4%, and SAS in 16.4% with some combinations. "Severe" instabilities were exhibited in 12.9% of patients: AAS in 3.6%, VS in 6.4%, and SAS in 5.0%. Furthermore, 4.3% presented canal stenosis, with 13 mm or less space available for the spinal cord (SAC) due to "severe" AAS or "severe" VS in 2.9% and 12 mm or less SAC due to "severe" SAS in 2.1%. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified corticosteroid administration, mutilating changes at baseline, and the development of nonmutilating into mutilating changes during the follow-up period correlated with "severe" instabilities (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

A minimum 5-year follow-up reveals the occurrence of cervical instabilities in 43.6%, "severe" aggravation in 12.9%, and decreased SAC in 4.3% of patients with RA. Characteristics of severe disease activity-established mutilating changes, progressive development into mutilating changes, and potentially concomitant corticosteroid treatment-are indicators for poor prognosis of the cervical spine in RA.

### Predictive risk factors of cervical spine instabilities in rheumatoid arthritis: a prospective multicenter over 10-year cohort study [^113AKPDh]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Design

A prospective multicenter cohort study for more than 10 years of outpatients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Objective

To identify predictive risk factors of cervical spine instabilities, which may induce compression myelopathy in patients with RA.

Summary Of Background Data

Many reports described the natural course of cervical spine involvement in RA. Only a few studies, however, conducted comprehensive evaluation of its prognostic factors.

Methods

Cervical spine instability was radiographically defined as atlantoaxial subluxation with the atlantodental interval greater than 3 mm, vertical subluxation (VS) with the Ranawat value less than 13 mm, and subaxial subluxation with irreducible translation of 2mm or higher. The "severe" category of instability was defined as atlantoaxial subluxation with the atlantodental interval of 10mm or lower, vertical subluxation with the Ranawat value of 10mm or higher, and subaxial subluxation with translation of 4 mm or higher or at multiple levels. Of 503 "definite" or "classical" patients with RA without baseline "severe" instability, 143 were prospectively followed throughout for more than 10 years. The Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to determine predictors for the development of "severe" instabilities. To exclude biases from the low follow-up rate, similar assessments were performed in 223 patients followed for more than 5 years from baseline.

Results

The incidence of cervical spine instabilities and "severe" instabilities significantly increased during more than 10 years in both 143 and 223 cohorts (all P < 0.01). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models found that baseline mutilating changes (hazard ratio [HR] = 19.15, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 3.96–92.58, P < 0.01), corticosteroid administration (HR = 4.00, 95% CI = 1.76–9.11, P < 0.01), and previous joint surgery (HR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.01–3.93, P = 0.048) correlated with the progression to "severe" instability in 143 cases and also in 223 cases (HR = 8.12, 95% CI = 2.22–29.64, P < 0.01; HR = 3.31, 95% CI = 1.68–6.53, P < 0.01; and HR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.16–3.69, P = 0.014, respectively).

Conclusion

Established mutilating changes, concomitant corticosteroid treatment, and previous joint surgery are relatively robust indicators for a poor prognosis of the cervical spine in patients with RA, based on the consistency in more than 10-year analysis of two different settings.

### Clinical output of the rheumatoid cervical spine in patients with mutilating-type joint involvement: for better activities of daily living and longer survival [^111GTsK9]. Spine (2010). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective study.

Objective

To gain an insight for the final clinical output of surgically managed cervical lesions in seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with mutilating-type joint involvement (mutilating-RA patients), these patients was followed up until either death or complete bedridden.

Summary Of Background Data

There has been no study reporting the final clinical output of surgically managed cervical lesion in mutilating-RA patients. In our previous study, we reported short- to middle-term result of such patient. The present study further traced those patients and reports the final clinical output.

Methods

Seventeen seropositive mutilating-RA patients extracted from 504 RA patients were enrolled. Eleven patients underwent surgical treatments, whereas six patients did not. All patients, who underwent operation, have received occipitocervical or occipitocervicothoracic fusion. Neck pain, neurological symptoms and ADL score were completely followed up (i.e., follow-up period > 10 years).

Results

The six patients of non-operated group worsened ADL score and resulted in either complete bedridden or death within 3 years. Contrary, 11 operated patients either improved or maintained ADL until their death. Survival rate in 6.2 years was 0% in non-operated group and 27% in operated group, respectively. The present study suggests that the seropositive mutilating-RA patients worsen cervical lesions once they become affected, and are likely to lose their ADL activity.

Conclusion

Once seropositive mutilating-RA patients develop major spinal involvement(s), they are likely to undergo a life-threatening stage of the disease during the next 5–10 years. Surgical intervention is advocated not only to treat the neurological compromise but also to sustain their ADL levels during end stage of disease. The sustained ADL, in turn, may contribute to the longevity of these patients by preventing other major life-threatening events.

### A case of cervical spine meningioma following etanercept use in a patient with RA [^113kYkdM]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Background

A 70-year-old female with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was administered etanercept to treat active disease that persisted despite therapy with conventional DMARDs. After 18 months of etanercept therapy, her RA symptoms had improved; however, she developed quadriparesis. She presented to a specialist rheumatology clinic with weakness and numbness in her arms and legs; she also had difficulty in standing up and walking.

Investigations

Physical examination, neurological examination, nerve conduction studies, measurement of serum inflammatory markers and autoantibodies, MRI of the cranium and cervical spine, and X-rays of the chest and hands.

Diagnosis

The patient underwent neurosurgery to resect a 1 x 2 cm mass in the cervical spine at C6-C7. Histopathologic examination of the excised mass revealed it to be a meningioma.

Management

Etanercept was discontinued because of a possible association between the drug and development of meningioma; however, shortly afterwards the patient experienced a flare of RA symptoms. High-dose NSAIDs and prednisolone were administered, but the patient died because of gastric perforation. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature of meningioma developing following use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitor therapy, and the first to suggest a cause-effect relationship.

### Posterior fusion of the subaxial cervical spine: indications and techniques [^113gE8Wb]. Neurosurgical Focus (2001). Low credibility.

The biomechanical stability of the subaxial cervical spine (C3–7) can be compromised by numerous pathological processes, and the restoration of stability may ultimately require fusion and placement of rigid internal fixation devices. A posterior fusion and stabilization procedure is often used to treat cervical instability secondary to traumatic injury, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, neoplastic disease, infections, and previous laminectomy. Numerous techniques and advances in spinal instrumentation have evolved over the last 30 years. The authors review the indications and the various methods for stabilizing and fusing the subaxial cervical spine via posterior approaches.

### Changing trends in cervical spine fusions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^1126GZeP]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective data analysis.

Objective

To compare the trends in primary cervical spine fusion procedures in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) against those in the general population.

Summary Of Background Data

RA severely impacts multiple joints in the body and can result in substantial deformity and functional impairment. Cervical spine involvement is common. In the past decade, treatment for RA has changed substantially with the introduction of biologically based, disease-modifying antirheumatic medications. Recent literature has shown decreasing rates of total joint arthroplasty in patients with RA.

Methods

Cases of cervical spine fusion in the general population and in patients with RA were identified from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1992 through 2008. US population counts were obtained from the Census Bureau. Data were analyzed with computer software (significance, P < 0.05 for all analyses). Linear regression models were used to describe national rates of cervical spine fusion in patients with and without RA.

Results

There was a marked increase in the number of cervical fusion procedures in the studied population. Over time, the incidence of atlantoaxial fusion increased in the general population (P < 0.01) and decreased in patients with RA (P < 0.01). Compared with the general population, patients with RA had a significantly lower rate of increase in the incidence of posterior cervical fusion (P < 0.01) and a significantly higher rate of increase in the incidence of anterior cervical fusion (P < 0.01).

Conclusion

In the US, the absolute number of primary cervical fusion procedures from 1992 through 2008 increased in the general population and in patients with RA. However, the patients with RA had a significantly lower incidence of undergoing atlantoaxial and posterior cervical surgical procedures than did the general population.

### Initial closed reduction of cervical spinal fracture-dislocation injuries [^114CGDzK]. Neurosurgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cervical spine injury, more specifically with respect to cervical imaging, MRI, AANS/CNS 2013 guidelines recommend to obtain MRI in patients with cervical spine fracture-dislocation injuries who cannot be examined during closed reduction because of altered mental status, or before either anterior or posterior surgical procedures when closed reduction has failed.

### Infliximab use and cervical spine deformity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^1129cy8p]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

Over the past decades, the incidence of surgery for rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-associated cervical spine deformity decreased. Infliximab has been observed as a protective treatment for joint damage in hands and feet; yet, the protective association between infliximab and the cervical spine has been uncertain.

Methods

Duration of infliximab use during 10 years of follow-up was evaluated in patients with new-onset RA (case control study using data from the BeSt Trial). Missing values on the exposure were imputed using last observation carried forward. Lateral X-rays at 5-year and 10-year follow-ups were assessed for atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS) and subaxial subluxation (SAS). Multiple logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender, baseline Disease Activity Score (DAS44), ACPA-positivity and rheumatoid factor-positivity were used to estimate ORs and their 95% CIs. Mediation analysis was performed to evaluate whether a potential association was mediated via mean DAS44.

Results

Cervical deformity (AAS and/or SAS > 2 mm) was observed in 108 (40%) of 272 patients. There was an 11% reduction in odds for cervical spine deformity (OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81 to 0.98; p = 0.02) for every 1-year increase in duration of infliximab use. Mediation analysis could not reveal an influence of DAS44 on the association between infliximab use and cervical spine outcomes.

Conclusions

There was evidence of a beneficial association between longer duration of use of infliximab and cervical spine deformity after 10 years follow-up. Thus, it is important to balance the favourable effects of infliximab use for the joints and possibly the cervical spine with the potential adverse events of this medication when used continuously.

### Cervical spine involvement in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis-MRI follow-up study [^111qAZ2h]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Our study, in agreement with others, illustrates the importance of LROM as a leading clinical sign of cervical spine arthritis: AA and AD joints were most often affected and these joints account for the major mobility of the cervical spine. Whereas LROM was found in all 13 patients at the time of diagnosis, while only a minority complained of pain indicating that patient history is not a sufficient criterion for cervical spine involvement; a thorough clinical examination is mandatory at every visit. A study based on x-ray findings confirmed a high percentage of asymptomatic patients. While pain improved sufficiently under treatment, LROM was still present in 9 of our patients at follow-up. This persistence of LROM which has been described by others is indicative of severe long-term skeletal sequelae.

We believe that patients with osseous changes like ankylosis, erosion or narrowing of the spinal canal at cranio-cervical junction should be advised to restrict excessive or sports activities involving the cervical spine. Narrowing of spinal canal at the cranio-cervical junction caused by hypertrophy of the dens was diagnosed in 4 patients at follow-up. Fortunately none of our patients developed neurological deficit, a poor prognostic factor in rheumatoid arthritis of adulthood: of 21 patients with myelopathy all became bedridden within three years of onset/diagnosis and one third died. In rheumatoid arthritis with symptomatic cervical spine involvement there is also a strong correlation between the development of neurological dysfunction and MRI identification of atlanto-axial spinal canal stenosis. Consequently in cases with neurological symptoms and/or basilar impression, a multidisciplinary approach with experienced MRI investigators and neurosurgeons seems reasonable, and such neurological findings are clearly of utmost importance to anesthetists, where intubation may be necessary for painful interventions such as joint injections or MRI under sedation.

### Bone scan with SPECT / CT demonstrated C1 to C2 involvement in rheumatic arthritis [^116whM8j]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 2
CT for C spines showed vertical atlantoaxial subluxation (A, arrowhead) and bony erosions (B, arrow). Note the anterior arch of C1 at Clark station II and the dens projects through the inferior margin of the foramen magnum. RA is an arthropathy with chronic diarthrodial joint inflammation. A complex series of inflammatory neovascularization including increased capillary permeability, perfusion of plasma proteins into the synovial stroma, and infiltration of cellular elements, as a result of polyarthritis and synovial thickening with progressive joint damage, bone erosion, cartilage destruction, and deformity. Although inflammatory arthritis of the small joints of the hands and feet is a common clinical manifestation, C spine involvement reportedly ranges 43% to 86%, – probably the intense synovitis involved in the joints, progressing to bone erosion and ligament laxity, and toward deterioration. The most characteristic lesions are subluxations, including anterior, vertical, and subaxial subluxations. The atlas-axis (C1 and C2) articulation is a prime disease target. Cervical spine involvement can manifest as pain in the neck and head. In more advanced cases, it may initiate neurological defects, muscle weakness, and even death. Precise diagnostics (including imaging) make patients receive proper qualification for surgery and early diagnosis possible. Routine plain radiographs are recommended for screening cervical instabilities in patients with RA. A CT scan is the diagnostic choice for bony evaluation by providing more details regarding visualization of erosions, anatomy, and the presence of ankylosis and pseudarthrosis, whereas MRI is the most sensitive modality for detecting C spine involvement in RA. Advantages of bone scan for evaluating multiple joint problems include its high sensitivity, good accessibility, low cost, and the possibility of whole-body imaging. Therefore, a bone scan is more sensitive in reflecting disease activity than clinical and radiographic evaluations. For focal abnormal uptake lesions detected on a planar bone scan, SPECT/CT may improve the diagnostic accuracy and contribute to the understanding of disease status in rheumatic diseases. Vertical subluxation is also known as cranial settling, basilar impression, atlantoaxial impaction, and superior migration of the odontoid. In the sagittal plane, the Clark station criterion divides the odontoid process into 3 equal parts, "stations", and determines the level at which the anterior arch of C1 falls. Station II, defined as the anterior arch of C1, falls at the middle third of the odontoid. This is the first case in the literature presenting C1 to C2 involvement in RA shown by bone scan with SPECT/CT.

### Subaxial subluxation after atlantoaxial transarticular screw fixation in rheumatoid patients [^1167MjY1]. European Spine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

The most common cervical abnormality associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is atlantoaxial subluxation, and atlantoaxial transarticular screw fixation has proved to be one of the most reliable, stable fixation techniques for treating atlantoaxial subluxation. Following C1-C2 fixation, however, subaxial subluxation reportedly can bring about neurological deterioration and require secondary operative interventions. Rheumatoid patients appear to have a higher risk, but there has been no systematic comparison between rheumatoid and non-rheumatoid patients. Contributing radiological factors to the subluxation have also not been evaluated. The objective of this study was to evaluate subaxial subluxation after atlantoaxial transarticular screw fixation in patients with and without RA and to find contributing factors. Forty-three patients who submitted to atlantoaxial transarticular screw fixation without any concomitant operation were followed up for more than 1 year. Subaxial subluxation and related radiological factors were evaluated by functional X-ray measurements. Statistical analyses showed that aggravations of subluxation of 2.5 mm or greater were more likely to occur in RA patients than in non-RA patients over an average of 4.2 years of follow-up, and postoperative subluxation occurred in the anterior direction in the upper cervical spine. X-ray evaluations revealed that such patients had a significantly smaller postoperative C2-C7 angle, and that the postoperative AA angle correlated negatively with this. Furthermore, anterior subluxation aggravation was significantly correlated with the perioperative atlantoaxial and C2-C7 angle changes, and these two changes were strongly correlated to each other. In conclusion, after atlantoaxial transarticular screw fixation, rheumatoid patients have a greater risk of developing subaxial subluxations. The increase of the atlantoaxial angel at the operation can lead to a decrease in the C2-C7 angle, followed by anterior subluxation of the upper cervical spine and possibly neurological deterioration.

Regarding specific circumstances for cervical spine injury, more specifically with respect to patients with spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (evaluation), AANS/CNS 2013 guidelines recommend to obtain flexion-extension radiographs in the acute setting and at late follow-up to assess spinal stability in patients with spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality, even in the presence of an MRI negative for extraneural injury.

### Cervical spine involvement in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis-MRI follow-up study [^115UJh1N]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In contrast to adult rheumatoid arthritis, where numerous studies have shown a high prevalence of involvement of the cervical spine, few studies have been published examining this entity in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Nearly all of the studies have used conventional radiographs as the diagnostic standard. In a comparative study magnetic-resonance imagining (MRI) showed a higher sensitivity than plain radiographs and computed tomography in diagnosing cervical spine arthritis, but reports on cross-sectional MRI findings in JIA with cervical spine involvement are rare. Follow-up studies combining clinical and MRI findings are not reported for cervical spine arthritis. Only one recent study followed clinical disease activity and MRI findings of knee involvement in JIA and in conclusion recommended MRI as a responsive outcome measure to evaluate disease activity.

The aim of our retrospective study was to describe and compare MRI and clinical findings at the onset and follow-up of cervical spine arthritis in JIA patients.

### Selective cervical spine radiography in blunt trauma: methodology of the national emergency X-radiography utilization study (NEXUS) [^114UDZn5]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (1998). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "NEXUS criteria for cervical spine imaging" for cervical spine injury.

The NEXUS criteria for cervical spine imaging is a clinical decision rule used to help determine whether patients with trauma need imaging to rule out cervical spine injury. NEXUS stands for National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study. This calculator is applicable to patients who have experienced blunt trauma and are at risk for cervical spine injury.

The clinical utility of the NEXUS criteria is to reduce unnecessary imaging, thereby minimizing radiation exposure and healthcare costs. It helps clinicians decide if a patient needs radiographic evaluation (X-ray, CT scan, or MRI) for potential cervical spine injury.

The NEXUS criteria should not be used in patients with penetrating trauma, patients with known vertebral disease (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis), patients with prior cervical spine surgery, or patients who are not fully alert or have an altered level of consciousness. It also should not be used in patients with focal neurologic deficit or in those with severe distracting injuries.

The NEXUS criteria for cervical spine imaging is designed to evaluate whether imaging is necessary by assessing five clinical factors. These factors, each posed as a yes/no question, help ascertain the risk of cervical spine injuries such as fractures or dislocations. The five inputs considered are:

- Focal neurologic deficit
- Midline spinal tenderness
- Altered mental status
- Intoxication
- Distracting injury present

Each affirmative response contributes a score of 1, while negative responses contribute a score of 0. The overall score, ranging from 0 to 5, is calculated by adding up the scores from all five factors.

For computing the score:

- **Focal neurologic deficit**: assigns 1 point if true
- **Midline spinal tenderness**: assigns 1 point if true
- **Altered mental status**: assigns 1 point if true
- **Intoxication**: assigns 1 point if true
- **Distracting injury present**: assigns 1 point if true

The total score is then interpreted to determine the necessity of cervical spine imaging:

- A total score of 0 suggests a low risk of cervical spine fracture or dislocation, indicating that imaging is not required.
- A total score of 1 or higher indicates a high risk, suggesting that imaging should be considered to rule out injury.

### Infliximab use and cervical spine deformity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^1152vcvu]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Because the decrease in interventions for RA-associated cervical spine deformity coincided with the introduction of biologicals, it is possible that biologicals such as infliximab have a protective effect on cervical spine deformity. Literature provides us with mixed efficacy of infliximab to prevent deformity in the cervical spine. We hypothesise that an increase in duration of infliximab is associated with a lower incidence of cervical spine deformity.

Therefore, this research aimed to study the association between the duration of infliximab use and the incidence of cervical spine deformity after a 10-year follow-up period.

### Computer-assisted screw insertion for cervical disorders in rheumatoid arthritis [^115CzxV4]. European Spine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

To reconstruct highly destructed unstable rheumatoid arthritis (RA) cervical lesions, the authors have been using C1/2 transarticular and cervical pedicle screw fixations. Pedicle screw fixation and C1/2 transarticular screw fixation are biomechanically superior to other fixation techniques for RA patients. However, due to severe spinal deformity and small anatomical size of the vertebra, including the lateral mass and pedicle, in the most RA cervical lesions, these screw fixation procedures are technically demanding and pose the potential risk of neurovascular injuries. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and safety of cervical pedicle screw insertion to the deformed, fragile, and small RA spine lesions using computer-assisted image-guidance systems. A frameless, stereotactic image-guidance system that is CT-based, and optoelectronic was used for correct screw placement. A total of 21 patients (16 females, 5 males) with cervical disorders due to RA were surgically treated using the image-guidance system. Postoperative computerized tomography and plane X-ray was used to determine the accuracy of the screw placement. Neural and vascular complications associated with screw insertion and postoperative neural recovery were evaluated. Postoperative radiological evaluations revealed that only 1 (2.1%; C4) of 48 screws inserted into the cervical pedicle had perforated the vertebral artery canal more than 25% (critical breach). However, no neurovascular complications were observed. According to Ranawat's classification, 9 patients remained the same, and 12 patients showed improvement. Instrumentation failure, loss of reduction, or nonunion was not observed at the final follow-up (average 49.5 months; range 24–96 months). In this study, the authors demonstrated that image-guidance systems could be applied safely to the cervical lesions caused by RA. Image-guidance systems are useful tools in preoperative planning and in transarticular or transpedicular screw placement in the cervical spine of RA patients.

### Surgical treatment of the rheumatoid cervical spine in patients aged 70 years or older [^113PfuLd]. Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether surgery is appropriate for elderly rheumatoid arthritis patients who are already approaching their statistical life expectancy.

Patients and Methods

The subjects were 10 patients who underwent cervical spine surgery for rheumatoid arthritis at an age of over 70 yr. The pain grade and neurological deficit class according to Ranawat, peri-operative complications, causes of death and pre-operative cardiopulmonary function were assessed.

Results

Good pain relief was achieved. Relief of pain enabled the patients, who could not sit up even in bed because of intolerable neck pain, to ride in a wheel chair without using a neck collar. Only one death was related to surgery. Pre-operative cardiopulmonary function was not significantly different compared with that of elderly patients undergoing other surgical procedures.

Conclusion

Surgery is a valuable option for the management of elderly patients with rheumatoid cervical spine since it can improve the quality of life.

### Buprenorphine management in the perioperative period: educational review and recommendations from a multisociety expert panel [^115dn4V8]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Cervical facet joint pain — radiological findings and correlation with pain and prognostic blocks or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) outcomes: To relate imaging to painful facet joints or outcomes of intra-articular blocks, medial branch blocks (MBB), or RFA, radiological findings must be compared with patient-reported pain outcomes, and degenerative imaging changes do not always correlate with symptoms. Research to date has not found a strong association between cervical spondylosis on x-rays and clinical pain symptoms; in a retrospective case–control study, 653 patients with neck pain imaged by cervical spine x-ray were compared with 365 asymptomatic patients, and there were no significant associations between pain locations or stiffness and pathologic x-ray findings. Computed tomography (CT) represents a more sensitive imaging modality for cervical facet pathology and may reveal abnormalities in asymptomatic individuals, with one study finding a 33% prevalence of cervical facet arthritis in patients scanned for non-spinal pain; a retrospective series also included 215 patients with cervical spondylotic degenerative disease.

### Cervical spine radiographs in the trauma patient… [^1174YACi]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Although cervical spine radiographs are almost routine in many emergency departments, not all trauma patients with a significant injury must have radiographs, even if they arrive at the emergency department on a backboard and wearing a cervical collar. This article reviews the proper use of cervical spine radiographs in the trauma patient. Low-risk criteria have been defined that can be used to exclude cervical spine fractures, based on the patient's history and physical examination. Some concern has been expressed about case reports suggesting that "occult" cervical spine fractures will be missed if asymptomatic trauma patients do not undergo radiography of the cervical spine. 10 On review, however, most of the reported cases did not meet the low-risk criteria in Table 1. Attention to these criteria can substantially reduce the use of cervical spine radiographs.

Cervical Spine Series and Computed Tomography Once the decision is made to proceed with a radiographic evaluation, the proper views must be obtained. The single portable cross-table lateral radiograph, which is sometimes obtained in the trauma room, should be abandoned. This view is insufficient to exclude a cervical spine fracture and frequently must be repeated in the radiographic department. Any film series that does not include these three views and that does not visualize all seven cervical vertebrae and the junction of C7-T1 is inadequate. The patient should be maintained in cervical immobilization, and plain films should be repeated or computed tomographic scans obtained until all vertebrae are clearly visible. The importance of obtaining all of these views and visualizing all of the vertebrae cannot be overemphasized.

While some missed cervical fractures, subluxations and dislocations are the result of film misinterpretation, the most frequent cause of overlooked injury is an inadequate film series. Table 2]) and the cervical films show no evidence of instability or fracture, flexion-extension views should be obtained. 17, 19 These radiographs should only be obtained in conscious patients who are able to cooperate. Only active motion should be allowed, with the patient limiting the motion of the neck based on the occurrence of pain. Under no circumstance should cervical spine flexion and extension be forced, since force may result in cord injury. should be more than 13 mm wide on the lateral view. Anything less than this suggests that spinal cord compromise may be impending. Next, the predental space — the space between the odontoid process and the anterior portion of the ring of C1.

### Inflammation, bone loss and fracture risk in spondyloarthritis [^111oyb73]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Fractures in AS

Patients with AS have an increased risk of vertebral fractures. A case–control study of 53 108 patients with fractures using the Swedish National Hospital Discharge Register concluded that the risk of fractures was higher in AS than in rheumatoid arthritis, with the largest increase for vertebral fracture (odd ratios (OR) 7.1 and 2.7 for AS and RA, respectively). The prevalence of vertebral fractures is highly variable in different studies, up to 30%. These data are unexpected in a disease affecting a young population, predominantly males. Actually, the definition of a vertebral fracture varies among studies, and three different vertebral complications must be considered.

Spinal fractures in AS

Spinal fractures can occur in patients with an ankylosed spine, even after a minor trauma. They can be transdiscal through the syndesmophytes, or transvertebral, involving the posterior arch. They can be located at the cervical spine, which is never involved in typical osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Neurological complications of variable degrees, sometimes severe, are usual in these fractures. Moreover, the capacity of healing is poor, and pseudoarthrosis with instability can occur, leading to surgery in most of the cases. Unstable cervical fractures are the most frequent, as they are located at the junction between the fused thoracic spine and the mobile head. In such patients, the C7-T1 junction must be analysed carefully. The thoracic hyperkyphosis exposes the patients to a hyperextension trauma of the neck in case of a fall. Patients with a bamboo spine have a high risk of such fractures, because of the calcifications of the spinal longitudinal ligaments and disuse osteoporosis of the vertebral bodies related to immobility. They must be carefully evaluated, as it is sometimes difficult to differentiate between pain from fracture and pain from a flare-up of the inflammatory disease. A retrospective study showed that 60% of cervical spine fractures in AS were undetectable on initial X-rays; CT is more sensitive than radiographs. A prospective 22-year cohort study recently showed that the occurrence of spinal fractures in AS, mainly cervical fractures, has an increased occurrence. One potential explanation is that patients with a bamboo spine can have an increasing level of physical activity and thus a greater risk for injuries, because of pain relief related to effective treatment (TNF blockers) of the disease.

### Cervical spine involvement in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis-MRI follow-up study [^117RE46o]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

In adult rheumatoid arthritis controversy exists as to whether to perform conventional radiographs or MRI for diagnosis of cervical spine arthritis. Studies on imaging procedures in childhood report low sensitivity of radiography: in one study 15 of 29 patients revealed limited cervical spine motion whereas there was radiographic evidence of atlanto-axial subluxation in only 5. In another study of 20 patients, 65% had soft tissue involvement, pannus formation or erosions on the surface of atlanto-axial joints while only 20% had erosions on plain x-ray views. Given the severity of changes seen in our patients at the onset of disease and the high prevalence of structural cervical spine changes, we would advocate MRI as the procedure of choice for the diagnosis and follow-up of cervical spine involvement in JIA. Only this technique enables a visualization of synovial thickening, increased joint fluid, spinal cord, brainstem and the relationship between occiput, atlas and axis. With projection radiography it would probably not have been possible to monitor the extent of spinal involvement in our patients including those with multiple joint involvement. Moreover MRI reduces radiation exposure, which is especially important in young children. Clearly not all JIA patients need an MR examination of the cervical spine: patients with persistent oligoarthritis do not, or only rarely, develop cervical spine disease, however in polyarticular disease cervical spine involvement is frequent both in rheumatoid factor positive and negative patients. Hence we would recommend MR imaging in the following situations: (1) signs and symptoms of cervical spine involvement, (2) rheumatoid factor positive and (3) rheumatoid factor negative polyarthritis or extended oligoarthritis with recalcitrant disease necessitating intensive therapy. In cases with narrowing of the spinal canal at cranio-cervical junction or clinically worsening courses, we would recommend control MRI in 6–9 monthly intervals (in milder cases 12 monthly) in order to consider options for treatment intensification.

### High mortality rate in rheumatoid arthritis with subluxation of the cervical spine: a cohort study of operated and nonoperated patients [^1126H5XX]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

In a prospective cohort study 532 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and subluxations of the cervical spine were consecutively collected during 1974–1999.

Objective

The aims of the study were to assess important factors affecting the mortality rate and the timing of surgical intervention.

Summary Of Background Data

The average follow-up time from the first visit to death or to the end of the study was 8.5 (SD, 5.7) years. Of the 217 operated patients 144 (66%) died, and of the 315 nonoperated patients 137 (43%) died.

Methods

Patients were selected for operative intervention based on anterior, vertical and subaxial subluxations, pain, and/or cervical neurology. Survival analyses were used for comparisons between patients with RA and the normal population, and between the operated and those treated conservatively.

Results

The survival rate for all RA patients was significantly reduced when compared with average survival in Norway (P < 0.001). The operated group had a significantly lower survival rate than the nonoperated group. In patients with severe instability of the cervical spine, the defined selection criteria for surgical intervention were specific. By comparison of calculated propensity scores, the operated and nonoperated groups were too different to be directly comparable. After surgery only 11 patients (5%) experienced residual pain in the neck or neurologic symptoms. None of these patients were alive at the end of the study, signifying that residual pain or neurologic symptoms are poor prognostic signs (P = 0.015). In the operated group, anterior subluxation and vertical settling greater than the lower indication limits did not have a significant influence on the survival rate, but there was a reduced survival for patients with subaxial subluxations. A clear association was found between increased vertical settling and sudden death.

Conclusion

RA with neck involvement is a progressive and serious condition with reduced lifetime expectancy. Hence, our interpretation is that operative intervention improves local symptoms and most likely changes the condition from worse to better by increasing lifetime expectancy in high risk patients. Since the per- and postoperative complications are few, a changed attitude toward more liberal indications for earlier surgery may reduce the symptoms and the mortality rate even more.

### Cervical spine arthritis as initial manifestation in juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a multicenter retrospective study [^116dyFCV]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Imaging features

A plain radiograph (X-ray) was obtained as the initial imaging study in all patients (Fig. 1 A, B). Abnormal findings were observed in four of the nine patients, including anterior atlanto-axial subluxation in three cases and nonspecific irregularities in the shape of the C2 and C3 vertebrae in one. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was subsequently performed in all patients, revealing C1–C2 synovial pannus formation in all cases (Fig. 1 C, D). Additional MRI findings included interapophyseal joint synovitis in 2 out of 9 patients and bone marrow edema in the C2, C3, and C4 vertebrae in one patient. MRI confirmed the presence of C1–C2 instability and anterior atlanto-axial subluxation in the three patients previously identified by radiography.

Computed tomography (CT) was performed in three patients, two of whom showed structural lesions, including erosions and atlanto-axial subluxation. One patient who underwent both MRI and CT presented vertebral erosions accompanied by bone edema. Bone scintigraphy was conducted in two patients — one at diagnosis and the other three months after disease onset. The first showed increased tracer uptake in the C1 and C2 vertebrae, while the second exhibited uptake only in the left knee, with no cervical spine involvement.

Rheumatoid patients' atlantoaxial joints are prone to inflammation, subluxation, and dislocation. Formation of pannus around the dens of C2 as well as dens invagination into the foramen magnum might lead to craniocervical stenosis and subsequently to myelopathy of the bulbospinal junction. Many approaches are available for dens pathologies in rheumatoid arthritis including transoral release or extreme lateral. Currently, treatment shifts from transoral release and posterior fusion toward solely posterior fusion, as it has been proven that craniocervical fixation leads to pannus resolution at follow-up visits. As craniocervical dislocation in RA patients is often precipitated by trauma, its management shares some similarities with post-traumatic patients: for both, levels of fusion are most often C1-C2, followed by occiput-C2. Precise insertion of the screws is of a paramount importance. Failure to notice a high-riding vertebral artery preoperatively at the planning stage may lead to choosing a risky method of craniocervical fusion, ultimately ending up in injuring the VA, massive blood loss, and neurological deficits. Recently, a detailed guide for clinical decision-making was provided, which facilitates choice of fusion method depending on the side of dominance of VA and whether HRVA is unilateral or bilateral. In ipsilateral HRVA and dominant VA, it is recommended to either avoid transarticular/transpedicular screw or proceed only with spinal navigation.

### Radiographic assessment [^1144nW4p]. Neurosurgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cervical spine injury, more specifically with respect to cervical imaging, radiography, AANS/CNS 2013 guidelines recommend to obtain a 3-view cervical spine X-ray (anteroposterior, lateral, and odontoid views) in patients with symptoms of suspected cervical spinal cord injury if CT is unavailable. Obtain a follow-up CT (when it becomes available) if necessary to further define areas suspicious or not well visualized on plain cervical X-rays.

### Outcome of cervical spine surgery in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^116AY1LD]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Cervical spine instability in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may lead to cervical myelopathy or occipital neuralgia, or both. Morbidity and mortality in patients with RA treated with cervical spine surgery during two years of follow up were evaluated.

Methods

Between 1992 and 1996 55 patients with RA underwent cervical spine surgery because of occipital neuralgia or cervical myelopathy, or both. Patients were classified according to the Ranawat criteria for pain and neurological assessment before operation and three months and two years postoperatively. For occipital neuralgia a successful operation was defined as complete relief of pain and for cervical myelopathy as neurological improvement.

Results

Occipital neuralgia was present in 17 patients, cervical myelopathy in 14 patients, and 24 had both. Surgical treatment in the patients with symptoms of occipital neuralgia who were still alive two years after surgery was successful in 18/29 (62%). In the surviving patients with cervical myelopathy neurological improvement of at least one Ranawat class was seen in 16/24 (67%). Postoperative mortality within six weeks was 3/51 (6%). Within two years after the operation 14 /51 (27%) of the patients had died; in most patients the cause of death was not related to surgery. The highest mortality (50%) was found in the group of six patients with quadriparesis and very poor functional capacity (Ranawat IIIB).

Conclusion

Cervical spine surgery in patients with RA performed because of occipital neuralgia or cervical myelopathy, or both, is successful in most patients who are alive two years after surgery. However, the mortality rate during these two years is relatively high, which seems to be largely related to the severity of the underlying disease and not to the surgery itself.

### The rheumatoid cervical spine: signs of instability on plain cervical radiographs [^111wxjWf]. Clinical Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

The cervical spine is a common focus of destruction from rheumatoid arthritis, second only to the metacarpophalangeal joints. Joint, bone and ligament damage in the cervical spine leads to subluxations which can cause cervical cord compression resulting in paralysis and even sudden death. Because many patients with significant subluxations are asymptomatic, the radiologist plays a key role in recognizing the clinically important clues to instability on plain radiographs of the cervical spine-often difficult in rheumatoid arthritis when the bony landmarks are osteoporotic or eroded. This review focuses on the signs of instability on plain radiographs of the cervical spine, using diagrams and clinical examples to illustrate methods of identifying significant subluxations in rheumatoid arthritis.

### Does age affect surgical outcomes in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy? Results from the prospective multicenter AOSpine international study on 479 patients [^112FqACS]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Subjects

Between October 2007 and January 2011, 479 patients with symptomatic DCM were prospectively enrolled in the AOSpine CSM-International study at 16 global institutions. Participating sites were either academic centres or high volume private practices and all had the resources necessary to conduct prospective clinical research, adequate subject availability and experienced research personnel. Investigators were orthopaedic surgeons or neurosurgeons who specialised in treating disorders of the spine.

Patients were asked to participate in this study if they were referred for surgical consultation and if they satisfied the following inclusion criteria: (1) aged 18 years or older; (2) presenting with symptomatic DCM with at least one clinical sign of myelopathy; (3) image-evidence of cervical spinal cord compression on MRI or CT; and (4) no previous cervical spine surgery. Patients were included in this study if they had myelopathy due to spondylosis, hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum, OPLL, disc herniation, subluxation or a combination of these degenerative changes. Patients were excluded if they were asymptomatic or diagnosed with active infection, neoplastic disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or concomitant lumbar stenosis.

Surgical techniques

At their respective sites, all patients underwent surgical decompression of the cervical spinal cord. For each case, the attending surgeon decided what approach to use, the number of levels to decompress and whether or not to use fusion or instrumentation. Anterior surgeries included cervical discectomy and/or corpectomy with or without fusion. Patients treated posteriorly underwent either laminectomy with or without fusion or laminoplasty. A minority of patients was treated with a two-stage circumferential surgery.

Data collection

Extensive data were collected for each participating subject, including demographic information, disease causation, medical history and current comorbidities, symptomatology, surgical summary and level of impairment and disability. Each subject was neurologically examined at baseline and 24 months postoperatively and evaluated using a variety of functional and quality of life outcome measures, including the Neck Disability Index (NDI), SF-36, the Nurick and the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) scales. In addition, each attending surgeon was required to record all adverse events throughout the study period. A central panel of investigators classified each event as related to surgery, related to myelopathy or unrelated. Perioperative complications were defined as surgery-related events occurring within 30 days of surgery.

### Infliximab use and cervical spine deformity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^112SXfpD]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study was one of the first to study cervical deformity in early onset RA patients during a long period of follow-up, where there was strict monitoring of infliximab use. After adjustment for the potential confounders including age, gender, DAS44 at baseline, ACPA-status and RF-status, there was strong evidence of a protective association between increased duration of infliximab and cervical spine deformity of all types, after 10 years. This could be a potential explanation for the decrease in surgical interventions for cervical deformity over the past decades, as described in the literature.

Kaito et al report that the use of infliximab can halt the incidence of de novo cervical spine lesions, while the use of infliximab does not halt progression once cervical spine deformity has developed in RA patients. Kanayama et al described that progression can be less severe in patients who used infliximab. These studies further underscore the protective effect of infliximab for the cervical spine in RA. While it was not possible to study progression in the current study, the results are in agreement with the study of Kanayama et al and Kaito et al on the efficacy of infliximab.

Takahashi et al, however, were not able to show the effect of biologics on the lowered prevalence of cervical spine deformity compared with previous reports before the approval of biologicals. Takahashi et al studied the difference in biological use between patients who developed AAS, SAS or VT and those who did not develop deformity. A subset of their data containing 84 patients was used for this analysis, of whom only 22 patients used biologics. It could be possible that the difference between this study and the current study is a lack of power.

Infliximab was not freely prescribed in this population of patients but dictated by predefined treatment strategies. This led to a strict regimen in which patients who demonstrated higher DAS44 were more likely to receive infliximab. It is remarkable that a lower OR for cervical spine deformity was observed in the group of long-term infliximab users, who were the patients with higher inflammation values and more RA activity. So, our results might be an underestimation of the true effect of infliximab on cervical spine deformity; if infliximab would not have been terminated on decrease in systemic inflammation parameters, cervical spine deformity may have been even less.

### Inflammatory arthritides of the spine: surgical versus nonsurgical treatment [^115p9rGf]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis are disorders that cause marked alterations in the structure and function of the axial skeleton. Ankylosing spondylitis causes calcification of spinal structures causing limited motion. Rheumatoid arthritis causes synovial hypertrophy, joint destruction, and spinal instability. Surgical therapy for patients with ankylosing spondylitis corrects angular deformities with spinal osteotomies, and stabilization for spinal fractures. Spinal operative therapy for rheumatoid arthritis concentrates on correction of abnormal motion in the cervical spine. Advances in the medical therapy of spondyloarthritis have resulted in control of the inflammation of the axial skeleton halting the damage to spinal structures. The new biologic therapies for ankylosing spondylitis prevent progression of disease. Similarly, these same biologic therapies can also control the progression of rheumatoid arthritis including the cervical spine. The new medical therapies are very effective in preventing joint damage. The need for surgical intervention for patients with ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis will become a rare event in the setting of the new medical therapies for these inflammatory arthropathies.

### Mortality associated with cervical spine disorders: a population-based study of 1666 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who died in Finland in 1989 [^115UzNVS]. Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the mortality associated with cervical spine deformities in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) based on national data.

Methods

The role of rheumatoid disorders of the cervical spine as a cause of death was studied in 1666 subjects who died in Finland in 1989 and had been entitled under the national sickness insurance scheme to receive reimbursed medication for RA. Death certificates and certificates for drug reimbursement of these 1666 patients and the clinical files of 853 patients were examined for the mention of cervical spine disorders. Thereafter, the cervical spine radiographs and detailed clinical histories of patients with diagnosed cervical spine disorder were evaluated separately.

Results

According to the official death certificates, cervical spine disorder was not an underlying, contributory or immediate cause of death in any of these patients. Cervical spine abnormalities had been diagnosed only in 38/853 (4.5%) patients. Cervical spine radiographs from 33 patients were available for examination, and in 17 patients cervical spine deformities were found to be severe enough to be a potential cause of fatal complications. Among these 17 cases, four sudden and four postoperative deaths were recorded (one after cervical spine operation) and three patients were suffering from quadriparesis or paraparesis at the time of death. Among the other 16 patients with cervical spine radiographs, the cervical deformities were less severe and their death histories differed from those of the group with more severe deformities.

Conclusions

Cervical spine disorders in RA should be diagnosed early and treated actively to prevent severe and potentially fatal complications. Deaths caused by these disorders are rare, but they should be remembered when the death certificates are written.

### Cervical spine involvement in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis-MRI follow-up study [^1126CEzc]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

MRI allows the direct visualization of synovitis and joint effusion, it shows bone marrow edema and erosions before they become visible on radiographs. Especially in joints that are not accessible to sonography, it is therefore most suitable to detect early signs of arthritis. To date there are no studies documenting the clinical course and MRI follow-up of cervical spine arthritis in JIA. However, this specific manifestation of JIA is important to monitor as it may lead to permanent restriction of cervical spine movements and may considerably impair a patient's quality of life.

Our study shows that cervical spine arthritis is a serious and persistent manifestation of JIA with severe skeletal sequelae as shown by an increase in number of patients and number of anatomical sites with ankylosis, erosions and narrowing of cranio-cervical junction at follow-up. This is crucial and may include therapeutic implications, particularly because almost all of our patients needed treatment with biologic agents, including most of them requiring therapy intensification due to the diagnosis of cervical spine arthritis. This corroborates the findings of Lee who found that the use of TNF-α inhibitors was an independent risk factor of structural spinal damage. Furthermore, our study shows that MRI specific findings like hyperintensities, enhancement and malalignments allow early diagnosis -as indicated by a median disease duration of 1.7 years after diagnosis of JIA - and that these changes often decrease under therapy while in some patients osseous changes increase. The latter is highlighted by the fact that 6 out of 13 patients (46%) showed ankylosis, erosions or narrowing of the spinal canal at the CCJ after a median disease durationof cervical spine arthritis of 2.1 years. Other studies reported spinal changes only after a median disease duration of 6–24 years using conventional radiography. Although different imaging techniques, disease characteristics (eg. rheumatoid factor positivity) and duration of disease hamper direct comparison of published results, we think that MRI with its high sensitivity to synovial abnormalities and adjacent bone marrow edema allows diagnosis of cervical spine arthritis earlier than other imaging modalities. This view is supported by the fact that most malalignments were reversible under therapy, probably indicating that these MRI changes are precursors of radiographically documented fixed subluxations. Hence it might be prudent to monitor MRI findings indicative of arthritis in order not to miss transition into irreversible damage like ankylosis, erosions and narrowing of the spinal canal at the cranio-cervical junction.

Intra-articular steroids for AO and AA joint injections

AO and AA IA steroid injections have been reported to be therapeutic interventions for pain emanating from these joints since the late 1980s. Subsequently, evidence supporting this modality has come primarily from case reports and series and retrospective studies. Very few of these studies reported administration of a separate diagnostic IA injection with LA prior to the administration of a therapeutic injection with steroid More recently, prospective observational studies and RCTs have been performed to identify whether IA steroid injections have superior efficacy to non-steroid (LA or saline) IA injections. The current body of available literature has provided modest evidence that is generally supportive of the use and effectiveness of IA steroid AA and AO injections in the treatment of a variety of different patient populations including: cervicogenic and occipital headache, chronic neck and head pain, and pain due to inflammatory disease of the AO and/or AA joints No studies or review articles have been published regarding which type of steroid (short-acting, long-acting, particulate vs non-particulate) should be used for AO and AA joint injections. (tables 11] and 12)

Only two studies have used a prospective randomized design with a comparative/control arm to determine potential efficacy differences between AO or AA injections with and without steroids. In the study by Hetta et al, patients with rheumatoid arthritis and AA inflammation and pain were randomized to either AA injections with LA and steroid or LA and normal saline. All patients were maintained on a standardized regimen of oral steroids and immunosuppressive therapy during the study. The authors reported that patients who received LA and steroid AA injections experienced statistically significantly greater reductions in numerical pain scores and improvements in physical functioning as measured by the Neck Disability Index at 3-month follow-up. They determined that the LA and steroid group had MRI-confirmed resolution of the inflammation observed pre-procedure compared with the LA and saline group. Shin et al performed a randomized prospective study investigating the comparative effectiveness of AO joint LA and steroid injection versus AO joint pulsed RF. The findings in this study showed no superiority of one modality compared with the other; however, both groups experienced significant within-group reductions in numerical pain score ratings over 6 months.

### Rheumatoid arthritis in the cervical spine [^111hqj4C]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2005). Low credibility.

The cervical spine often becomes involved early in the course of rheumatoid arthritis, leading to three different patterns of instability: atlantoaxial subluxation, atlantoaxial impaction, and subaxial subluxation. Although radiographic changes are common, the prevalence of neurologic injury is relatively low. The primary goal of treatment is to prevent permanent neurologic injury while avoiding potentially dangerous and unnecessary surgery. Strategies include patient education, lifestyle modification, regular radiographic follow-up, and early surgical intervention, when indicated. Magnetic resonance imaging is indicated when neurologic deficit (myelopathy) occurs or when plain radiographs show atlantoaxial subluxation with a posterior atlantodental interval ≤ 14 mm, any degree of atlantoaxial impaction, or subaxial stenosis with a canal diameter ≤ 14 mm. Surgery should be considered promptly for any of the following: progressive neurologic deficit, chronic neck pain in the setting of radiographic instability that does not respond to nonnarcotic pain medication, any degree of atlantoaxial impaction or cord stenosis, a posterior atlantodental interval ≤ 14 mm, atlantoaxial impaction represented by odontoid migration ≥ 5 mm rostral to McGregor's line, sagittal canal diameter < 14 mm, or a cervicomedullary angle < 135 degrees.

### Infliximab use and cervical spine deformity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^116QMiD4]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

The clinical consequences of prescribing infliximab chronically to prevent cervical spine deformity, however, are debatable as the use of this medication can lead to toxicity and adverse effects when used for prolonged periods of time. The adverse effects scored in the current patient cohort did not reveal deleterious effects in those who used infliximab for a longer duration, but the total number of included patients is too limited to draw firm conclusions. Therefore, the optimal regimen to use infliximab to prevent cervical deformity cannot be determined yet.

Our study had some limitations. First, it would have been optimal if we had X-rays in flexion, extension and neutral position of all patients at baseline, 5-year and 10-year follow-up. Second, X-rays were occasionally challenging to interpret and quantify. The X-rays were made in the workflow of a study aiming at clinical parameters, and the evaluations were not done instantly. In daily practice, if an X-ray of the cervical spine in RA patients was performed, it was evaluated carefully and, if difficult to interpret, taken again. That would have yielded more qualitative X-rays in some cases and a better follow-up over the years. Furthermore, the exclusions of patients who missed their 10-year follow-up X-ray after their 5-year X-ray demonstrated no deformity are possibly inducing some selection bias. This could lead to underestimation of the true presence of deformity. Fortunately, the incidence of the latter occurrence was low. Also, because of the long follow-up period, there were some missing data in this study. However, we used imputation in the form of last observation carried forward until the end of the study period for these missing datapoints. While we think this method best fits our data and the type of data imputed, this may introduce some bias.

Despite these limitations, our study had several strengths. This study had a long follow-up duration of 10 years, where patients with early-onset RA were followed and assessed at quarterly intervals. In addition, we performed multiple imputation for missing DAS44 values, we adjusted for multiple possible confounding variables and performed a mediation analysis for DAS44 during 10-year follow-up.

### Risk factors associated with aggravation of cervical spine lesions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a retrospective longitudinal cohort study [^114H2JyS]. Spine (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Design

A retrospective cohort study.

Objective

To examine factors related to severe aggravation of preexisting cervical lesions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) under current pharmacologic treatments with biologics.

Summary Of Background Data

Advanced RA cervical lesions carry a risk of irreversible damage to the spinal cord; however, risk factors for aggravation are unclear after the use of biologics became more popular.

Methods

Of 166 patients with preexisting cervical lesions at baseline, 87 who had cervical X-ray images taken at baseline and at the final visit (with an interval of more than 1yr) were evaluated retrospectively. Aggravated instabilities determined at the final visit, were defined as follows: atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS) = atlantodental interval ≧ 10mm; vertebral subluxation (VS) = a Ranawat value < 10mm; and subaxial subluxation (SAS) = an anterior vertebral slip ≧ 4mm or a multilevel slip ≧ 2mm. Patients were divided into two groups based on the radiographic results: severe aggravation and non-severe aggravation. Explanatory variables were gender, age of RA onset, duration of disease, average observation period, Disease Activity Score 28 based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) at baseline, drug treatment history, presence of mutilating deformities in the hands, presence of RA-related joint surgery, and the prevalence of each cervical lesion at baseline.

Results

The severe group comprised 14 patients (16.1%). There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to demographic data. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that preexisting SAS lesions (odds ratio: 7.59, 95% confidence interval: 1.16–49.6) and no history of biologic treatment (odds ratio, 0.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.17–0.58) were associated with aggravation.

Conclusion

Preexisting SAS lesions were associated with aggravation. Meanwhile, biologics may be effective at preventing aggravation. Level of Evidence: 3.

Physical examination of the neck to diagnose AO and AA pain

The AA joint complex accounts for 60% of cervical rotational movement. The pivot articulation occurs between the odontoid process of the axis and the ring formed by the transverse ligament of the atlas and the anterior arch. Common historical and physical examination findings of AA dysfunction include limited ROM during rotation as well as flexion and extension depending on the extent of tectorial membrane impairment. In more advanced cases, examination signs can include severely restricted rotation and lateral flexion of the cervical spine to the affected side, crepitus, prominent tenderness at the occipito–cervical junction, craniocervical kyphosis, and torticollis. The presence of gait abnormalities, radicular symptoms, and audiovisual symptoms are unlikely to be related to isolated AO or AA dysfunction.

Although the AO and AA joints can be visualized on imaging, including plain radiographs, imaging cannot confirm the origin of pain. Normal imaging does not rule out arthropathy and radiographic joint abnormalities are incapable of identifying a painful joint. For example, in a study involving 400 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 45.8% had radiographic evidence of AA involvement but only 45.4% of those individuals had neck pain. Paradoxically, greater AA joint ventral subluxation was associated with less pain. Alternative imaging including bone window CT views of the AA joint, MRI, or cervical myelography may be needed to rule out concomitant alternative cervical spine pathology.

Recommendations

In summary, there are no pathognomonic historical signs or physical examinations that can reliably predict response to AA or AO joint blocks in individuals with chronic neck pain. AA and AO joint pain typically manifest in the C1, C2, or trigeminal nerve distribution, with AA pain having more reproducible and consistent symptoms than AO joint pain. We conclude that history and physical examination cannot reliably identify painful AO or AA joints, but can guide injection decisions which could confirm the AO and AA joints as pain generators: grade C recommendation, low level of certainty.

### Imaging characteristics of nonrheumatoid arthritis patients with retro-odontoid pseudotumor: a multicenter case-control study [^111fNTig]. Spine (2024). Medium credibility.

Histopathologically, ROP is composed of inflammatory cells and fibrous and granulation tissues. There is substantial evidence regarding AAS and soft tissue proliferative changes at the atlantoaxial junction associated with RA; however, the need for upper cervical spine surgery has reduced dramatically with advances in the nonsurgical treatment of RA. On the other hand, considering the pathogenesis of ROP which primarily involves degenerative changes in surrounding structures, the number of patients with ROP is expected to increase in an aging society. In addition, the idea that global alignment, including the thoracolumbar spine, influences cervical spine alignment is becoming more common and has been corroborated in numerous reports. An increase in the number of cases with ROP is anticipated in an aging population, which may be triggered by deformities of the thoracolumbar spine; therefore, evaluating the alignment of the entire spine is essential.

The common treatment options for ROP include direct resection, C1 laminectomy without fusion, occiput–cervical (O-C) fusion, and atlantoaxial (C1–C2) arthrodesis. C1 laminectomy without fusion is considered suitable for patients without upper cervical spine instability, while fixation is recommended in cases of instability. Notably, several studies have reported resolution of the ROP after fixation. However, patients with ROP have a high degree of degeneration of the middle and lower cervical spine, and fixation of the upper cervical spine may result in dysphagia. In particular, a decrease in the O-C2 angle is known to cause dysphagia; hence, caution is advised during fixation.

There is a lack of definitive diagnostic criteria for ROP. Histologically, a soft tissue proliferative thickness of ≥ 3 mm is reported to be abnormal, with some studies defining ROP thickness as ≥ 3 mm or ≥ 5 mm. Since there are no clinically applicable methods to define ROP size, in this retrospective study, we defined "ROP" cases as patients who underwent upper cervical spine surgery due to ROP and those who had surgery on the middle and lower cervical spine for CSM were categorized as "CSM controls". Nevertheless, based on our ROC analysis, we propose a 6.05 mm soft tissue thickness posterior to the dental process as the cutoff value for considering surgery in patients with ROP. If the soft tissue thickness exceeds this value, the patient is likely to develop spinal cord compression symptoms, requiring surgery. This value may be helpful in ascertaining surgical indications for ROP.

### Infliximab use and cervical spine deformity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^114WAnnE]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disease, which most commonly affects the large joints and smaller, peripheral joints in hands and feet. According to European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) guidelines, treatment strategy is recommended to be based on disease activity, safety issues and other patient factors. While practice differs between specialists and countries, in the Netherlands, treatment strategy is mostly based on Disease Activity Score (DAS28) or DAS44. The aim of treatment is to attain remission or low disease activity.

DAS44 has conventionally been described to have a very strong correlation with incidence and progression of damage to joints of hands and feet. Patients with high DAS44 often have more joint damage and bone erosions. Therefore, lowering DAS44 is an important goal of treatment in the Netherlands.

Treatment strategies for RA have drastically changed in the late 1990s, when biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) such as infliximab, a tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor, were introduced as a treatment modality. These medications have been proven to be effective in preventing RA-associated peripheral joint damage. While the treatment strategy is often still based on DAS44, it was even reported that structural joint damage remained absent in patients treated with TNF inhibitors such as infliximab, regardless of the DAS44 values. This led to the presence of patients with only minor to no joint damage, even though DAS44 was increased repeatedly.

Except from the peripheral joints, RA can also affect the cervical spine. The cervical vertebrae are stabilised by joints, intervertebral discs and an intricate network of ligaments. RA can cause laxity of these ligaments, which in turn can lead to subluxation of vertebral bodies and instability. This can lead to atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS) and vertical translocation (VT) in the upper cervical spine and to subaxial subluxation (SAS) in the subaxial spine. These deformities can lead to severe cervical myelopathy and may give an urge for surgery to prevent severe and life-threatening symptoms.

### Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with an increased risk of postoperative infection and revision surgery in elderly patients undergoing anterior cervical fusion [^115huEBn]. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective review.

Objective

To identify the incidence and analyze the risk of postoperative complications amongst elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis undergoing anterior cervical fusion.

Summary Of Background Data

Previous studies have reported elevated risks of postoperative complications for patients with rheumatoid arthritis undergoing orthopedic procedures. However, little is known about the risk of postoperative complications in rheumatoid arthritis patients after spine surgery.

Methods

A commercially available database was queried for all Medicare patients 65 years of age and older undergoing one- or two-level primary anterior cervical fusion surgeries from 2005 to 2013. Complications, hospitalization costs, and length of stay were queried. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the odds ratio for each complication adjusted for age, sex, and Charlson Comorbidity Index.

Results

A total of 6067 patients with a history of rheumatoid arthritis and 113,187 controls were identified. Significantly higher incidences of major medical complications (7.5% vs. 5.9%, P < 0.001), postoperative infections (2.6% vs. 1.5%, P < 0.001), and revision surgery (1.1% vs. 0.6%, P < 0.001) were observed amongst the rheumatoid arthritis cohort. Significantly greater average cost of hospitalization ($17,622 vs. $12,489, P < 0.001) and average length of stay (3.13 vs. 2.08 days, P < 0.001) were also observed.

Conclusion

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis undergoing anterior cervical fusion face increased risks of postoperative infection and revision surgery compared to normal controls. This information is valuable for preoperative counseling and risk stratification.

Cervical protection and conservative management

If there is no spinal cord compression, Gallium-67 inflammation scan may be considered for a comprehensive assessment of axial skeletal inflammation. Additionally, the scan rules out severe cervical inflammation which contradicts the use of cervical halter traction. Cervical inflammation can be controlled by glucocorticoids for short-term treatment to avoid growth disturbance. In our present patients, they did not have severe cervical inflammation that required heavy dosing of anti-inflammatory agents. Therefore, treatments for these patients can follow the ERA guideline recommendations, particularly regarding the use of biologics. Moreover, according to our results, most ERA patients with sacroiliitis had cervical collar protection and no post-treatment neurologic abnormalities were reported in all patients. Despite the use of cervical collar, cervical fusion and persisting ankylosis were found in two ERA patients with sacroiliitis. Notably, various methods of cervical tractions have been reported for the restoration of atlantoaxial alignment, in addition to cervical collar. However, there has been no consistent rationale for each of these methods and no consensus on the duration of halter traction in the literature. We suggest the use of cervical collar in the daytime and halter traction at night for promoting patient compliance after discharge. At outpatient clinic follow-ups, radiographs in open-mouth views may be used for evaluating the restoration of cervical alignment and assessing C1-C2 symmetry (Fig. 4). For recurrent or irreducible atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation, internal fixation and fusion have been recommended. Special attention is necessary for airway management in ERA patients with C1-C2 subluxation due to the risk of life-threatening neurologic injury from worsened subluxation during airway maneuvers, particularly during anesthesia.

### Atlantoaxial subluxation in different intraoperative head positions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^112j2UyW]. Anesthesiology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Disorders of the cervical spine are often observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the best head position for RA patients with atlantoaxial subluxation in the perioperative period is unknown. This study investigated head position during general anesthesia for the patients with RA and proven atlantoaxial subluxation.

Methods

During anesthesia of patients with RA and proven atlantoaxial subluxation, the authors used fluoroscopy to obtain a lateral view of the upper cervical spine in four different positions: the mask position, the intubation position, the flat pillow position, and the protrusion position. Copies of the still fluoroscopic images were used to determine the anterior atlantodental interval, the posterior atlantodental interval, and the angle of atlas and axis (C1-C2 angle).

Results

The anterior atlantodental interval was significantly smaller in the protrusion position (2.3 mm) than in the flat pillow position (5.1 mm) (P < 0.05). The posterior atlantodental interval was significantly greater in the protrusion position (18.9 mm) than in the flat pillow position (16.2 mm) (P < 0.05). The C1-C2 angle was, on average, 9.3 degrees greater in the protrusion position than in the flat pillow position (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

This study showed that the protrusion position using a flat pillow and a donut-shaped pillow during general anesthesia reduced the anterior atlantodental interval and increased the posterior atlantodental interval in RA patients with atlantoaxial subluxation. This suggests that the protrusion position, which involves support of the upper cervical spine and extension at the craniocervical junction, might be advantageous for these patients.

### Infliximab use and cervical spine deformity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^116htzQS]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Cases of cervical spine deformity ascertainment versus controls

No baseline cervical spine radiographs were available. Lateral X-rays of the cervical spine were collected at 5-year and 10-year follow-up.

Radiological cervical deformity parameters (AAS, SAS and VT) were evaluated on lateral X-rays by two researchers (ABL-V and CLAV-L), both blinded for patient characteristics. Agreement was reached in close cooperation, after independent scoring. The readers did not know any of the characteristics or the timing of the study relative to study initiation, in order to optimise independent readings. If a dynamic X-ray was performed (flexion/extension), AAS was scored separately on these radiographs.

The primary outcome, cervical spine deformity of all types (mild, moderate, and severe), was defined as the presence of AAS and/or SAS > 2 mm. AAS was defined as a distance of more than 2 mm between the odontoid peg and the anterior arch of C1 in neutral position. SAS was concluded to be present in case a listhesis of more than 2 mm existed in neutral position. The secondary outcome was AAS ≥ 3 mm in flexion on dynamic X-ray, which included moderate and severe cervical spine deformity. The third outcome was AAS ≥ 5 mm in flexion or neutral position, which included severe cervical spine deformity. VT was present if the tip of the odontoid peg exceeded the line of McGregor. Controls were derived from the same population that gave rise to the cases. As for the controls, no cervical spine deformity was present.

If an X-ray was missing at 10-year follow-up and AAS, VT or SAS was present at 5-year follow-up, it was scored to be also present at 10-year follow-up. For the AAS ≥ 3 mm in flexion and severe AAS groups, if a flexion X-ray was missing at 10-year follow-up and AAS was not present at 5 years, the patient was not included in the subanalysis for these groups.

Reported adverse effects

During the 10-year follow-up period, side effects known to possibly occur in infliximab use, such as the development of malignancy and/or serious infection, were reported. Hence, descriptive analyses were conducted.

### An observational study of patient-rated outcome after atlantoaxial fusion in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis [^111mJhZY]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Fusion is used to address several types of abnormality of the atlantoaxial segment. Traditionally, outcome has been assessed by achieving solid bony union. Recently, however, patient-rated outcome instruments have been increasingly used, although these may be influenced by concomitant comorbidity.

Questions/Purposes

We therefore asked whether patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with its associated comorbidity, had worse self-rated outcomes after C1–2 fusion than patients with osteoarthritis (OA).

Patients and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed all 30 (23 OA and seven RA) prospectively followed patients in our local Spine Registry (part of the Spine Society of Europe Spine Tango Registry) who had undergone C1–2 fusion. Before surgery and 3 and 12 months later, patients completed the multidimensional Core Outcome Measures Index (COMI) questionnaire. Global outcome and satisfaction with treatment were also assessed.

Results

We found no group differences for duration of operation, blood loss, or perioperative surgical or general complications. Compared with the OA group, the RA group showed a better baseline COMI score and less improvement in the COMI from preoperatively to 12 months followup. However, the proportion of "good" global scores at 12 months followup was similarly high in both groups (87% OA and 86% RA) as was satisfaction (96% for OA versus 86% for RA).

Conclusions

Symptoms and impairment were less severe in the RA group at baseline and showed less improvement after surgery, but the proportion of "good global outcomes" was similar in both groups, and the great majority of patients in both groups were satisfied with their treatment.

### Infliximab use and cervical spine deformity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^113gxydb]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Over the past decades, the incidence of surgery for rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-associated cervical spine deformity decreased. Infliximab has been observed as a protective treatment for joint damage in hands and feet; yet, the protective association between infliximab and the cervical spine has been uncertain.

Methods

Duration of infliximab use during 10 years of follow-up was evaluated in patients with new-onset RA (case control study using data from the BeSt Trial). Missing values on the exposure were imputed using last observation carried forward. Lateral X-rays at 5-year and 10-year follow-ups were assessed for atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS) and subaxial subluxation (SAS). Multiple logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender, baseline Disease Activity Score (DAS44), ACPA-positivity and rheumatoid factor-positivity were used to estimate ORs and their 95% CIs. Mediation analysis was performed to evaluate whether a potential association was mediated via mean DAS44.

Results

Cervical deformity (AAS and/or SAS > 2mm) was observed in 108 (40%) of 272 patients. There was an 11% reduction in odds for cervical spine deformity (OR: 0.89, 95%CI: 0.81 to 0.98; p = 0.02) for every 1-year increase in duration of infliximab use. Mediation analysis could not reveal an influence of DAS44 on the association between infliximab use and cervical spine outcomes.

Conclusions

There was evidence of a beneficial association between longer duration of use of infliximab and cervical spine deformity after 10 years follow-up. Thus, it is important to balance the favourable effects of infliximab use for the joints and possibly the cervical spine with the potential adverse events of this medication when used continuously.

### C1-C2 subluxation in enthesitis-related arthritis: two case reports and literature review of ten cases [^114LQbZF]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

To decrease the risk of fusion, early recognition and treatment of C1-C2 subluxation in ERA are essential. In our literature review, half of the ERA patients were treated surgically for cervical fusion. An ERA patient had undergone chiropractic neck manipulation before undergoing surgical treatment for cervical fusion, prior to the recognition of subluxation. Chiropractic neck manipulation is probably unsafe for ERA patients, particularly those experiencing neck symptoms. In fact, atlantoaxial instability is an absolute contraindication of chiropractic neck manipulation. In another case of ERA with sacroiliitis who was treated surgically for cervical fusion, neck pain and stiffness were also not immediately recognized as a possibility of C1-C2 subluxation manifestations. Notably, studies have shown that early recognition and treatment of C1-C2 subluxation were associated with favorable outcomes in terms of higher subluxation reduction and lower recurrences, regardless of treatment modalities.

In conclusion, C1-C2 subluxation is a rare association of ERA that may progress to permanent fusion if left untreated. When ERA patients present with torticollis and neck pain, C1-C2 subluxation cannot be ruled out. Since radiographs are limited by low sensitivity, cervical spine CT can be used to confirm the diagnosis of C1-C2 subluxation. Initial management of C1-C2 subluxation in ERA should be focused on protecting the cervical spine and ruling out spinal cord compression. After severe cervical inflammation is ruled out, cervical halter traction can be used to restore cervical alignment. Early recognition and treatment of C1-C2 subluxation in ERA are crucial for minimizing the risk of complications.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for spinal cord protection: 2024 update [^113masVP]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cervical spine injury:

- **Definition**: Cervical spine injury is a traumatic disruption of the cervical vertebrae, intervertebral discs, or cervical spine ligaments, which can result in spinal cord compression or transection leading to transient or permanent loss of motor, sensory, and autonomic functions.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of cervical spine injury involves the initial mechanical trauma, which can cause spinal cord compression, transection, or both. This is followed by a secondary injury phase characterized by spinal cord ischemia, edema, and hemorrhage. The extent of the injury depends on the severity of the trauma and the level of the spinal cord affected.
- **Epidemiology**: The annual incidence of traumatic cervical spine injury in Western populations is reported at 4–17 per 100,000 person-years. Spinal cord injuries in the US are reported to represent 3% of hospital trauma admissions.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for cervical spine injury include high-energy trauma, such as motor vehicle accidents and falls from height, as well as certain medical conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Other risk factors include violence, alcohol use, diving, and sports-related injuries.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of cervical spine injury can vary widely. Initial presentation often includes neck pain, stiffness, and tenderness, along with neurological deficits such as weakness or numbness in the limbs. In severe cases, the condition can progress to quadriplegia, respiratory failure, and autonomic dysfunction. Patients can also have associated injuries, such as head trauma, atlanto-occipital dissociation, occipital condyle fracture, anterior subluxation, facet joint dislocation, spinal epidural hematoma, and vertebral artery injury.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of cervical spine injury is generally poor for complete spinal cord injuries. During the initial hospital stay, over 50% of patients with spinal cord injury develop multisystem complications. The 30-day mortality rate is reported to be 9.4%. Early surgical intervention can help decrease the instantaneous death risk, especially in early surgery.

### The association between disease activity score and rheumatoid arthritis-associated cervical deformity: radiological evaluation of the BeSt trial [^1143mT8c]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The authors' objective was to evaluate the association of the Disease Activity Score (DAS) with cervical spine deformity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients during 10-year optimal treatment of systemic disease.

Methods

The authors evaluated radiological and 10-year follow-up (FU) data of the BeSt (BehandelStrategien) trial. In 272 RA patients, atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS), presence of vertical translocation (VT), and subaxial subluxation (SAS) were evaluated. The associations of these deformities with DAS, self-assessed health (determined with the Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ]), and erosions of the hands and feet (Sharp-Van der Heijde score) were studied.

Results

After 10 years of FU, AAS (> 2 mm neutral position) was observed in 62 patients (23%), AAS (≥ 3 mm in flexion) in 24%, AAS (≥ 5 mm in flexion) in 7%, VT did not occur, and SAS was present in 60 patients (22%). In total, 135 patients (50%) were in remission (DAS < 1.6) at 10 years of FU. No association could be established between AAS and DAS. Patients with cervical spine deformity (AAS > 2 mm and/or SAS) at 10 years had a higher HAQ score at 10 years than patients without cervical spine deformity (HAQ scores of 0.65 and 0.51, respectively, p = 0.04; 95% CI -0.29 to 0.00).

Conclusions

Even though 50% of patients were in remission after 10 years and the BeSt trial was designed to optimize treatment, 40% of patients developed at least mild RA-associated cervical spine deformity and 7% developed significant AAS. This indicates that even in this era of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologicals, cervical deformity is prevalent among patients with RA and should not be neglected in patient treatment plans and information.

### Infliximab use and cervical spine deformity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^115iEtGE]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

After 10 years, 62 of 272 patients (23%) had AAS of more than 2 mm in neutral position. Of the 272 patients, 60 (22%) had SAS. No patients had VT above the line of McGregor. In total, 108 of 272 patients (40%) had cervical spine deformity of any kind on neutral X-ray. In this latter group of patients, the mean age at baseline was 55.2 ± 12.7 years, 60% were females, 69% were RF positive and 68% were ACPA positive. This was comparable to the demographic data of the patients without cervical spine deformity, except for age; at 10-year follow-up, patients with cervical spine deformity appeared older (55.2 (± 12.7) years) than patients without cervical spine deformity (50.6 (± 11.2) years) (table 1).

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of rheumatoid arthritis patients with or without cervical spine deformity at 10-year follow-up

An X-ray in flexion was available for 109 patients, of whom 26 (24%) demonstrated AAS ≥ 3 mm in flexion. Two of these patients demonstrated AAS ≥ 5 mm in flexion. Additionally, on the neutral X-rays, six patients demonstrated an AAS ≥ 5 mm. Consequently, a total of eight patients (3%) had AAS ≥ 5 mm in flexion and/or neutral position (severe AAS).

Infliximab use

Of the 272 patients included in the analysis, 144 patients (53%) used infliximab at least once during the 10-year follow-up. The median duration of infliximab use was 9 months (IQR 0–30 months).

At the 10-year follow-up, 51 out of 108 (47%) cases of cervical spine deformity (AAS and/or SAS > 2 mm) used infliximab at any time during follow-up, which was lower than 93 out of the 164 (57%) controls without cervical spine deformity. Moreover, the median duration of infliximab use among the cases of cervical deformity at 10 years of follow-up was 0 months (IQR 0–19.5), which was shorter than the median of the control patients without cervical spine deformity: 9 months (IQR 0–43.5).

### Radiological cervical spine involvement in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a cross sectional study [^114gqEa3]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the frequency and the severity of radiological cervical spine involvement in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Methods

We investigated 165 consecutive unselected patients with RA who fulfilled the revised American College of Rheumatology criteria for RA. All patients had a complete physical and laboratory evaluation. Patients had a radiological evaluation that included hand and wrist radiographs, as well as cervical spine radiographs in anteroposterior, lateral, and lateral in full flexion views. Hand radiographs were evaluated according to the Larsen criteria, while cervical radiographs were evaluated according to Winfield classification.

Results

There were 143 women and 22 men, with a mean age of 59.6 ± 12.5 and disease duration 12.3 ± 13.9 years. Positive rheumatoid factor was found in 63.6% of patients. One hundred forty-six patients presented radiological findings related to cervical spine involvement: atlantoaxial subluxations were found in 20.6% and erosions of the odontoid process in 2.4%; none presented vertical subluxation. Subaxial subluxations were found in 43.6%, disc space narrowing at C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5 levels in 66.1%, and vertebral plate sclerosis and erosions in 43.6%.

Conclusion

Cervical spine radiological involvement is a frequent finding in our patients with RA, but the severity of the disease is rather mild, possibly related to the ethnic background.

### Prevalence and associated factors of anterior atlantoaxial luxation in a nation-wide sample of rheumatoid arthritis patients [^114pCG87]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the prevalence of anterior atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and to analyse its association with disease markers.

Methods

Cross-sectional analysis of a cohort of RA patients randomly selected from the clinical registries of 34 centres. AAS, defined as an atlantoaxial displacement in cervical spine X-rays greater than 3 mm on flexion films, was actively searched for. Bivariate and multivariate analysis was performed to examine its association with clinical, functional, and treatment variables.

Results

AAS was found in 88 out of 736 patients with available cervical radiographs, (prevalence and 95% confidence interval [CI]: 12% [9.7–14.2]). The presence of AAS was highly associated with a Larsen score (0–150) over 50 (OR and 95% CI: 5.31 [2.68–10.55]), RA duration of more than 10 years (4.48 [2.70–7.44]), disease onset before age 50 (4.15 [2.42–7.12]), eye involvement (3.93 [1.63–9.46]), and previous RA related surgery (3.90 [2.46–6.19]). No association was found with rheumatoid factor. Multivariate analysis showed that a disease onset before the age of 50, the number of previous DMARD, and, above all, a Larsen score greater than 50 were important independent factors associated with AAS. There is a 33% increased risk for AAS every 10 units up in the Larsen score.

Conclusion

AAS is frequent in RA patients, particularly in those with markers of erosive disease.

### The declining incidence of cervical spine surgery in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a single-surgeon series and literature review [^116qjeRE]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

With an increasing number of disease-modifying drugs available to manage rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spine surgeons have anecdotally noted decreased rates of cervical spine surgical procedures in this population. Although these medications have been shown to mitigate RA progression and its systemic effects on joint destruction, there are currently no large-scale studies of RA patients that suggest the use of these disease-modifying drugs has truly coincided with a decline in cervical spine surgery.

Methods

Patients with RA who underwent cervical spinal fusion from 1998 to 2021 performed by the senior author were retrospectively reviewed. The cohort was stratified into 3 categories based on procedure level: 1) occipitocervical, 2) atlantoaxial, and 3) subaxial. The number of surgical procedures per year in each subgroup was evaluated to determine treatment trends over time. National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS) data on both RA and non-RA patients who underwent cervical fusion were analyzed to assess for surgical trends over time and for differences in likelihood of surgical intervention between RA and non-RA patients over the epoch.

Results

From 1998 to 2021, the number of overall cervical fusions performed in RA patients significantly declined (-0.13 procedures/year, p = 0.01) in this cohort, despite an overall significant increase in cervical fusions in non-RA patients over the same period. NIS analysis of cervical fusions across all patients similarly demonstrated a significant increase in cervical fusions over the same epoch (19,278 cases/year, p < 0.0001). When normalized for changes in population size, the incidence of new surgical procedures was lower in patients with RA regardless of surgical technique. Anterior cervical fusion was the most common approach used over the epoch in both RA and non-RA patients; correspondingly, RA patients were significantly less likely to undergo anterior cervical fusion (OR 0.655, 95% CI -0.4504 to -0.3972, p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

At the authors' institution, there was a clear decline in the number of cervical fusions performed to treat the 3 most common forms of cervical spine pathology in RA patients (basilar impression, atlantoaxial instability, and subaxial cervical deformity). Although national trends suggest an increase in total cervical fusions in both RA and non-RA patients, the incidence of new procedures in patients with RA was significantly lower than in patients without RA, which supports the anecdotal results of spine surgeons nationally.

### Cervical spine involvement in rheumatoid arthritis – a systematic review [^1112chcx]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic chronic inflammatory disorder that can compromise the cervical spine in up to 80% of the cases. The most common radiological presentations of cervical involvement are atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS), cranial settling and subaxial subluxation (SAS). We performed a systematic review in the PubMed Database of articles published later 2005 to evaluate the prevalence, progression and risk factors for cervical spine involvement in RA patients. Articles were classified according to their level of evidence. Our literature review reported a wide range in the prevalence of cervical spine disease, probably explained by the different studied populations and disease characteristics. Uncontrolled RA is probably the main risk factor for developing a spinal instability. Adequate treatment with DMARD and BA can prevent development of cervical instabilities but did not avoid progression of a pre-existing injury. MRI is the best radiological method for diagnosis cervical spine involvement. AAS is the most common form of RA. Long term radiological follow-up is necessary to diagnosis patients with late instabilities and monitoring progression of diagnosed injuries.

### Cervical spine manifestations in patients with inflammatory arthritides [^114N1VPW]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2013). Medium credibility.

The cervical spine can frequently become involved in patients with rheumatologic disorders, as a result of either the rheumatologic disease itself or age-associated degenerative processes that can also occur in the rest of the population. Awareness of the increased risk of cervical spine manifestations in patients with rheumatologic disorders enables early recognition and initiation of the appropriate treatment regimen. For example, patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) often have spinal instability which, if left untreated, can lead to neurological deficits. Biologic agents are effective in slowing the progression of the skeletal abnormality as well as for treating the RA, and this approach is often sufficient. However, early surgical intervention is recommended for patients with RA who develop neurologic deficits, as conservative approaches have limited effectiveness in this group. Spinal stability should be the primary surgical objective. For patients with ankylosing spondylitis, cervical spine surgery might be required either for fracture repair or to correct severe kyphosis. Understanding each condition's specific cervical spine manifestation and its natural history can help to clarify the appropriate indications for and timing of surgery to maximize patients' outcomes and limit complications.

### Stable reconstruction using halo vest for unstable upper cervical spine and occipitocervical instability [^111N62wJ]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Upper cervical or occipitocervical disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis present as atlantoaxial subluxation, vertical subluxation of the axis, and subaxial subluxation, which produce myelopathy and severe pain. In such cases, occipitocervical reconstruction surgery may be indicated, and several reports have described reduction of subluxation by fixing the halo vest before this surgery.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of using the halo vest before the surgery for unstable upper cervical spine and for occipitocervical instability.

Methods

Twenty-eight patients (9 men and 19 women; mean age, 61.8 years at surgery) who presented with atlantoaxial or occipitocervical fusion were studied. In all cases, the halo vest was fixed in the conscious condition, and subluxation was reduced before the surgery. The mean follow-up period was 45 months. Roentgenologic measurement and clinical evaluation were performed before the surgery and at the final follow-up.

Results

Using the halo vest resulted in significant reductions in the atlantodental interval, the space available for the spinal cord, and the Ranawat value (p < 0.05), and these were maintained until the final follow-up. The mean Japanese Orthopedic Association score significantly improved from 9.5 before surgery to 12.2 at the final follow-up (p = 0.01). Nineteen cases (68%) improved by more than 1 grade by Ranawat's classification after surgery and 16 cases (57%) maintained the same at the follow-up visit.

Conclusion

Conscious preoperative reduction using the halo vest for occipitocervical disorders is a useful and safe technique.

### Risk of the high-riding variant of vertebral arteries at C2 is increased over twofold in rheumatoid arthritis: a meta-analysis [^111NwSrh]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) might lead to atlantoaxial instability requiring transpedicular or transarticular fusion. High-riding vertebral artery (HRVA) puts patients at risk of injuring the vessel. RA is hypothesized to increase a risk of HRVA. However, to date, no relative risk (RR) has been calculated in order to quantitatively determine a true impact of RA as its risk factor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to do so. All major databases were scanned for cohort studies combining words "rheumatoid arthritis" and "high-riding vertebral artery" or synonyms. RA patients were qualified into the exposed group (group A), whereas non-RA subjects into the unexposed group (group B). Risk of bias was explored by means of Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. MOOSE checklist was followed to ensure correct structure. Fixed-effects model (inverse variance) was employed. Four studies with a total of 308 subjects were included in meta-analysis. One hundred twenty-five subjects were in group A; 183 subjects were in group B. Mean age in group A was 62,1 years, whereas in group B 59,9 years. The highest risk of bias regarded "comparability" domain, whereas the lowest pertained to "selection" domain. The mean relative risk of HRVA in group A (RA) as compared with group B (non-RA) was as follows: RR = 2,11 (95% CI 1,47–3,05), I² = 15,19%, Cochrane Q = 3,54 with overall estimate significance of p < 0,001. Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with over twofold risk of developing HRVA, and therefore, vertebral arteries should be meticulously examined preoperatively before performing craniocervical fusion in every RA patient.

### High prevalence of asymptomatic cervical spine subluxation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis waiting for orthopaedic surgery [^112FtPSh]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the prevalence of cervical spine subluxation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis waiting for orthopaedic surgery, and symptoms that might be associated with the disorders.

Methods

194 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were referred for orthopaedic surgery at Jyväskylä Central Hospital, 154 (79%) of whom volunteered for the present study including clinical examination, laboratory tests, radiographs of the cervical spine, hands, and feet, and self report questionnaires. Definition of anterior atlantoaxial subluxation (aAAS) was > 3 mm and of subaxial subluxation (SAS) ≥ 3 mm. Atlantoaxial impaction (AAI) was analysed following to the Sakaguchi-Kauppi method.

Results

67 patients (44%) had cervical spine subluxation or previous surgical fusion. The prevalence of aAAS, AAI, SAS, or previous fusion was 27 (18%), 24 (16%), 29 (19%), and 8 (5%), respectively; 69% of patients with cervical spine subluxations (those with fusions excluded) reported neck pain, compared with 65% of patients without subluxations (p = 0.71). The prevalence of occipital, temporal, retro-orbital, and radicular pain in upper extremities was similar in patients with or without cervical spine subluxations (54% v 43%; 17% v 31%; 25% v 24%; 47% v 48%, respectively). However, patients with subluxations were older, had longer disease duration, more active disease, poorer function according to the Health Assessment Questionnaire, and had more often erosive disease.

Conclusions

Asymptomatic cervical spine subluxation is common in patients with rheumatoid arthritis waiting for orthopaedic surgery. Regardless of symptoms, the possibility of cervical spine subluxation in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis should be considered in preoperative evaluation.

### Cervical spine manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis: a review [^111H3awr]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a progressive autoimmune inflammatory disease affecting 1% of the population with three times as many women as men. As many as 86% of patients suffering from RA have cervical spine involvement. Synovial inflammation in the cervical spine causes instability and injuries including atlantoaxial subluxation, retroodontoid pannus formation, cranial settling, and subaxial subluxation. While many patients with cervical spine involvement are asymptomatic, symptomatic patients often present with nonspecific symptoms resulting from inflammation and additional secondary symptoms that are due to compression of the brainstem, cranial nerves, vertebral artery, and spinal cord. Radiographs are the imaging modality used most often, while MRI and CT are used for assessment of neural element involvement and surgical planning. Multiple classification systems exist. Early diagnosis and treatment of cervical spine involvement is critical. Surgical management is indicated when patients experience symptoms from cervical involvement that result in biomechanical instability and, or a neurological deficit. Atlantoaxial instability managed with atlantoaxial fusion, retroodontoid pannus with neural element compression is managed with posterior decompression and atlantoaxial fusion or occipitocervical fusion. Cranial settling is managed can be managed with anterior decompression and posterior fusion or with dorsal only approaches. Subaxial subluxation is managed with circumferential fusion or posterior only decompression and fusion. Patients with atlantoaxial instability have better functional and neurologic outcomes. RA patients have higher complication rates and more frequent need for revision surgery than the general population of spine surgery patients.

### Positivity rates and subsequent patient dispositions after utilisation of cervical spine imaging referral guidelines in Singapore [^111RDA6A]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Most of the patients in the CT cervical spine cohort were admitted to either orthopaedics or other medical specialties for further medical care. The remaining patients were treated and discharged, referred to specialists for further assessment, or admitted to the observation ward of the ED. Similar to the X-ray cervical spine group, there were also a few patients who wished to be discharged from the hospital despite the advice of the clinicians (Discharged, At Own Risk). Most patients in the CT cohort with inappropriate imaging (or indicated only in specific circumstances) had hospital admissions for conditions unrelated to the cervical spine. Electronic Supplemental Material Table 3 illustrates the patient disposition based on imaging recommendations.

The respective imaging referral guidelines recommended a test as a better imaging alternative to a cervical spine X-ray in 78.9% (ACR AC), 60.8% (ESR iGuide), and 80.6% (RCR iRefer) of cases. The number of cases in which the best imaging tests were available to replace the CT cervical spine was smaller, at 0.7% and 2%, as recommended by ESR iGuide and RCR iRefer, respectively. Table 4 summarises the best imaging tests available for replacement.

### Rheumatoid arthritis of the cervical spine: current techniques for management [^112UShT2]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The incidence of rheumatoid arthritis in the European and North American population is significant. Rheumatoid arthritis can result in serious damage to the cervical spine and the central neuraxis, ranging from mild instability to myelopathy and death. Aggressive conservative care should be established early. The treating physician should not be lulled into a false sense of security by reports suggesting that cervical subluxations are typically asymptomatic [76–78]. Gradual spinal cord compression can result in severe neurologic deficits that may be irreversible despite appropriate surgical intervention when applied too late. [figure: see text] The treatment of rheumatoid disease in the cervical spine is challenging. Many details must be considered when diagnosing and attempting to institute a treatment plan, particularly surgical treatment. The pathomechanics may result in either instability or ankylosis. The superimposed deformities may be either fixed or mobile. The algorithm suggested by the authors can be used to navigate through the numerous details that must be considered to formulate a reasonable surgical plan. Although these patients are [figure: see text] frail, an "aggressive" surgical solution applied in a timely fashion yields better results than an incomplete or inappropriate surgical solution applied too late. When surgical intervention is anticipated, it should be performed before the development of severe myelopathy. Patients who progress to a Ranawat III-B status have a much higher morbidity and mortality rate associated with surgical intervention than do patients who ambulate. Although considered aggressive by some, "prophylactic" stabilization and fusion of a [figure: see text] relatively flexible, moderately deformed spine before the onset of severe neurologic symptoms may be reasonable. This approach ultimately may serve the patient better than "observation" if the patient is slowly drifting into a severe spinal deformity or shows signs of early myelopathy or paraparesis.

### Lumbar fusion outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^112gJopQ]. European Spine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Although outcomes after cervical fusion in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients are widely published, outcomes of lumbar fusion in RA patients has not been reported. Nineteen patients with RA, identified using ICD-9 and CPT codes, who underwent instrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion were matched for age, gender, smoking status, date, and level of surgery to a contemporaneous non-RA group. Medical records and radiographs were reviewed by the primary author who had no role in the treatment of these patients. The average age was 64 years in the RA group and 65 years in the non-RA group. The male to female ratio was 2:17 and 1:18, respectively. There were three smokers and two diabetics in each group. An average of 1.5 levels was fused in each group. Average follow-up was 24 and 27 months, respectively. In the RA group, 15 patients were taking DMARDs with 7 of those also taking oral steroids; 4 patients were taking NSAIDs only. There were seven complications (37%) in the RA group versus four (21%) in the non-RA group; wound infections in three patients (16%) in the RA group versus one (5%) in the non-RA group; and non-union in two patients (11%) in the RA group versus three (16%) in the non-RA group. Clinical outcomes were similar between the two groups with 74% of patients achieving good to excellent results in the RA group compared to 63% in the non-RA group (p = 0.692). Surgeons and their RA patients who undergo an instrumented lumbar fusion can expect a slightly higher complication rate than patients without RA which may be related to osteopenia and immunosuppression.

### The use of traction methods to correct severe cervical deformity in rheumatoid arthritis patients: a report of five cases [^115tsKzE]. Spine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Design

A case series is presented.

Objectives

To describe the methods of correction used in this study for flexible severe cervical deformity, and to report the results in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Summary Of Background Data

Long-standing rheumatoid arthritis can lead to severe cervical deformity, causing significant functional deficits and poor cosmesis. Information on the use of traction combined with surgical stabilization to achieve correction of flexible deformity in rheumatoid patients is sparse in the English literature.

Methods

A review of five cases, including pertinent history, physical examination, radiographic evaluation, traction techniques, surgical stabilization, and outcomes, was conducted.

Results

Excellent correction of deformity and radiographic union were achieved in all the patients. One patient had minimal loss of correction after surgery and thereafter remained stable. Pin tract infections were the only significant complication.

Conclusions

Severe cervical flexible deformity in rheumatoid patients can cause significant disability and can be treated successfully with a combination of traction techniques and surgical stabilization.

### Effect of a reduction of the atlanto-axial angle on the cranio-cervical and subaxial angles following atlanto-axial arthrodesis in rheumatoid arthritis [^1121HZZx]. European Spine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

We retrospectively investigated the radiographic findings in patients with atlanto-axial subluxation (AAS) due to rheumatoid arthritis, and clarified the effect of reduction of the atlanto-axial angle (AAA) on the cranio-cervical and subaxial angles.

Methods

Forty-one patients, consisting of 29 females and 12 males, with AAS treated by surgery were reviewed. The average patient age at surgery was 61.0 years, and the average follow-up period was 4.0 years. We investigated the AAA at the neutral position in lateral cervical radiographs before surgery and at the last follow-up. In addition, we also investigated the clivo-axial angle (CAA) and the subaxial angle (SAA) at the neutral position before and after surgery.

Results

Due to pre-operative AAA, the patients were classified into three groups as follows: (1) the kyphotic group (K group), (2) the neutral group (N group), and (3) the lordotic group (L group). The average AAA values at the neutral position in the K group before and after surgery were 6.0° and 18.1°, respectively (P < 0.001). In the N group 19.7° and 21.7°, respectively (P < 0.05), and in the L group 31.6° and 27.0°, respectively (P < 0.01). However, no significant differences in the average CAA values were found before and after surgery in all groups. Furthermore, no significant differences in the SAA values were seen before and after surgery in all groups.

Conclusions

A proper reduction of the AAA did not affect the cranial angles or induce kyphotic malalignment of the subaxial region after atlanto-axial arthrodesis. However, if we can obtain a significant and large reduction of AAA in patients showing kyphosis before surgery, then this reduction will be offset in the atlanto-occipital joint and we should therefore pay special attention to its morphology after surgery.

### A clinical practice guideline for the management of acute spinal cord injury: introduction, rationale, and scope [^113tQQed]. Global Spine Journal (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cervical spine injury, more specifically with respect to cervical imaging, MRI, AOSpine 2017 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining MRI in adult patients with acute spinal cord injury before surgical intervention, when feasible, to facilitate improved clinical decision-making.

### Utility of flexion-extension radiographs in evaluating the degenerative cervical spine [^1122ykjG]. Spine (2007). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort of 258 consecutive patients.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to determine the: (1) percentage of flexion-extension radiographs that revealed pathology not appreciated on neutral radiographs in the nontrauma population, and (2) frequency that these views led to a change in the management of these patients.

Summary Of Background Data

The utility of flexion-extension radiographs in the evaluation of the spine trauma or preoperative patient is well accepted, but the role of dynamic radiographs in the degenerative population is not well defined.

Methods

Consecutive patients presenting with axial cervical, upper extremity radicular, or myelopathic symptoms underwent upright anteroposterior, neutral lateral, and flexion-extension lateral radiographs. Patients with recent trauma, rheumatoid arthritis, prior cervical fracture, prior cervical surgery, inadequate radiographs, or congenital anomalies were excluded. Three observers reviewed all radiographs after determining the best measurement method by a priori analysis of interobserver reliability.

Results

Listhesis was observed on 23 of the neutral lateral images; 6 of these were found to have changes between flexion and extension (2–4 mm). Two patients (1%) had spondylolisthesis on flexion-extension radiographs not visualized on neutral lateral radiographs. A subsequent review of these patients' charts revealed no change in management based on these findings.

Conclusions

Cervical flexion-extension radiographs are a method of assessing potential instability. In the degenerative population studied here, 1% had spondylolisthesis noted only on the flexion-extension images, and 3% had a change in spondylolisthesis. None of these, however, led to a changes in clinical management. These data, in conjunction with the extra cost and radiation exposure associated with additional views, led us to no longer regard dynamic radiographs as a useful part of the initial imaging for the patient with degenerative cervical conditions.

### Infliximab use and cervical spine deformity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^1135rNMs]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, there was evidence of a protective association between longer duration of infliximab use and cervical spine deformity after 10 years follow-up. Hence, it becomes important to balance the possible favourable effects of infliximab use for the cervical spine with the potential side effects of the long-term use of this medication. It is important to note that the use of bDMARDs such as infliximab is deeply embedded in treatment guidelines of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the EULAR.

### Rheumatoid arthritis of the craniovertebral junction [^117JNJ3i]. Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory disease involving the spine. It has a predilection for involving the craniocervical spine. Despite widespread involvement of the cervical spine with RA, few patients need surgery. The 3 major spinal manifestations of RA in the cervical spine are basilar invagination, atlantoaxial instability, and subaxial subluxations. Surgical management of RA involving the craniovertebral junction remains a challenge despite a decline in severe cases and an improvement in surgical techniques.

Methods

We conducted an exhaustive review of English-language publications discussing RA involving the craniovertebral junction. We paid special attention to publications detailing modern surgical management of these conditions. In addition, we outline our own surgical experience with such patients.

Results

We discuss alternative surgical methods for treating basilar invagination, atlantoaxial instability, and concurrent subaxial subluxations. We detail our surgical technique for transoral odontoidectomy, occipital cervical fusion, and atlantoaxial fusion. We detail the use of spinal surgical navigation in both of these procedures.

Conclusion

Surgical management of RA remains a challenging field. There clearly has been a decrease in cases of mutilating RA involving the craniovertebral junction. Surgical techniques for managing these conditions have steadily improved.

### Radiological evaluation of cervical spine involvement in rheumatoid arthritis [^116MmBC5]. Neurosurgical Focus (2015). Low credibility.

Cervical spine involvement commonly occurs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), especially those with inadequate treatment or severe disease forms. The most common site affected by RA is the atlantoaxial joint, potentially resulting in atlantoaxial instability, with cervical pain and neurological deficits. The second most common site of involvement is the subaxial cervical spine, often with subluxation, resulting in nerve root or spinal cord compression. In this paper, the authors review the most commonly used plain radiographic criteria to diagnose cervical instabilities seen with RA. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of cervical CT and MRI in the setting of cervical involvement in RA.
