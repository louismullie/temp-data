## Question

What is the blood pressure target in an 85 year old female?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal blood pressure target for an 85-year-old woman. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how age and frailty modify risk–benefit for BP lowering. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for patients aged 85 and older. Next, I will review randomized and meta-analytic evidence for older adults, including SPRINT and related analyses. After that, I need to check for conflicting data and potential J-curves in the very old. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, individualized target and monitoring plan, including thresholds for initiation, titration, and de-escalation, and note special situations like diabetes and limited life expectancy.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and baseline risk. At 85, the prevalence of hypertension is very high, isolated systolic hypertension predominates, baroreflex sensitivity is reduced, and vulnerability to orthostatic hypotension and injurious falls increases, so any BP target must be individualized to frailty, cognition, and functional status rather than age alone [^11343EY8] [^112t2sif]. I should double-check that contemporary guidelines explicitly call for personalized, more lenient targets in those aged 85 and older, which the 2024 ESC does recommend, emphasizing shared decision-making and frailty screening before intensification [^116RZYXB] [^112t2sif].

> Next, I should review guideline-concordant targets for the very elderly. The 2024 ESC advises considering more lenient BP targets, such as less than 140 mmHg systolic, in patients aged 85 years or older, and to initiate pharmacotherapy at or above 140/90 mmHg only under close monitoring of tolerance, with even higher thresholds considered in those with limited life expectancy or significant frailty [^116RZYXB] [^1155uwuZ]. The 2023 ESH guidance for those aged 80 years and older recommends a primary goal of 140–150 mmHg systolic and less than 80 mmHg diastolic, with consideration of 130–139 mmHg only if well tolerated and diastolic is not already below 70 mmHg, and it advises against aiming for systolic less than 120 mmHg or diastolic less than 70 mmHg during treatment [^112tWhSR] [^111cEkaP] [^113jJnHm]. Hold on, I should verify that both societies align on avoiding excessive lowering in the very old; yes, both caution against overly aggressive targets in this age stratum [^116RZYXB] [^112tWhSR].

> I will now examine the randomized evidence in older adults to ensure these recommendations are evidence-based. In SPRINT, adults aged 75 years and older randomized to an intensive systolic target less than 120 mmHg had significantly fewer cardiovascular events and lower all-cause mortality than those targeted to less than 140 mmHg, with no significant increase in serious adverse events overall, though with more hypotension, syncope, electrolyte abnormalities, and acute kidney injury in the intensive arm, which is clinically meaningful in the very old [^115c8puE]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude: the hazard ratio for the primary composite outcome was 0.66 and for all-cause mortality 0.67, supporting benefit of intensive control in appropriately selected older adults, albeit with close monitoring for adverse effects [^114uhsuM].

> But wait, what if the benefit–risk balance shifts beyond age 80 or in frailty. Meta-analytic data suggest that relative cardiovascular risk reduction from BP lowering is at least as large or larger in older adults compared with younger, yet absolute benefit must be weighed against falls, cognitive effects, and polypharmacy, and frail older adults are underrepresented in trials, limiting generalizability [^111N6w76] [^111FqMUf]. I should confirm that guidelines acknowledge this gap; yes, both ESC and ESH emphasize individualized targets and careful monitoring in the oldest old and in those with frailty or limited life expectancy [^116RZYXB] [^112t2sif].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "lower is always better" in the very old. Observational cohorts, such as the Berlin Initiative Study in patients over 80, reported a U-shaped association with higher mortality when on-treatment systolic BP was below 140 mmHg, particularly below 130 mmHg, raising concern for excessive lowering in some octogenarians, though confounding by comorbidity and reverse causation is likely and these data should be interpreted cautiously alongside randomized evidence [^115c8puE]. Let me reconsider: this potential J-curve does not negate SPRINT's benefits in selected elders, but it reinforces the need to individualize targets and avoid pushing below 130 mmHg in frail or multimorbid patients unless clearly tolerated and beneficial [^115c8puE] [^114uhsuM].

> Next, I should review initiation thresholds in the very elderly to ensure I am not over-treating mild elevations. The 2024 ESC suggests initiating pharmacotherapy at or above 140/90 mmHg in those aged 85 or older only under close monitoring of tolerance, and to consider higher thresholds in those with limited life expectancy or moderate-to-severe frailty, aligning with a "start low, go slow" approach in this population [^1155uwuZ] [^11494kgs]. I need to ensure I also incorporate ESH's caution about low diastolic pressure; if diastolic is already below 70 mmHg, I should be more conservative with systolic lowering to avoid cerebral hypoperfusion and ischemia [^111cEkaP].

> Let me synthesize a practical, individualized target for an 85-year-old woman. For most relatively fit, community-dwelling 85-year-olds, a reasonable initial target is systolic 140–150 mmHg with diastolic less than 80 mmHg, reassessing tolerance and orthostatic symptoms at each visit, and if well tolerated without dizziness, falls, or renal injury, cautiously considering 130–139 mmHg systolic while avoiding diastolic below 70 mmHg and never targeting systolic below 120 mmHg in routine practice [^112tWhSR] [^111cEkaP] [^113jJnHm]. I should confirm that this aligns with both European guidance and the principle of shared decision-making emphasized by ESC 2024, which it does [^116RZYXB] [^112t2sif].

> I need to ensure special circumstances are addressed. If she has diabetes, the Endocrine Society recommends a target of 140/90 mmHg for most adults aged 65–85, with consideration of 130/80 mmHg only in selected high-risk subgroups and with vigilant monitoring for orthostatic hypotension and adverse effects, which tempers enthusiasm for intensive targets in the very old with multimorbidity [^117AC23N] [^1179RtRe]. If she has limited life expectancy or significant frailty, I should adopt more lenient targets, often less than 150 mmHg systolic, and prioritize symptom control and quality of life over aggressive risk reduction, consistent with ESC guidance for personalized targets in these settings [^116RZYXB] [^11494kgs].

> Next, I should review implementation details to minimize harm. I will start with low doses and titrate slowly, favoring agents with low orthostatic liability and avoiding beta-blockers or alpha-blockers unless there is a compelling indication, while screening for frailty and orthostatic hypotension at baseline and follow-up, and using home or ambulatory monitoring to distinguish white-coat effects and guide safe titration [^115kUczg] [^112RfEMp] [^112t2sif]. Wait, let me verify that both ESH and ESC endorse careful measurement and frailty assessment; yes, both emphasize accurate measurement modalities and geriatric assessment to individualize therapy in the oldest old [^116RZYXB] [^112t2sif].

> I should double-check safety boundaries and when to de-escalate. If diastolic falls below 70 mmHg, if there are recurrent falls, syncope, cognitive decline, or eGFR declines by more than 30% from baseline, I should relax the systolic target toward 140–150 mmHg or reduce therapy, consistent with ESH cautions and ESC's emphasis on tolerability and patient-centered outcomes in the very elderly [^111cEkaP] [^116RZYXB]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines discourage aiming below 120/70 in this group; yes, ESH explicitly advises against targeting systolic less than 120 mmHg or diastolic less than 70 mmHg during treatment in older adults [^113jJnHm].

> Final recommendation: For an 85-year-old woman with hypertension, I recommend a primary systolic target of 140–150 mmHg with diastolic less than 80 mmHg, reassessing tolerance and orthostatic symptoms at each visit, and if she remains fit, asymptomatic, and treatment is well tolerated, cautiously considering 130–139 mmHg while avoiding diastolic below 70 mmHg and never targeting systolic below 120 mmHg; initiate pharmacotherapy at or above 140/90 mmHg only under close monitoring, and adopt more lenient thresholds if frailty or limited life expectancy is present, all within a shared decision-making framework that prioritizes function and quality of life [^112tWhSR] [^116RZYXB] [^1155uwuZ] [^113jJnHm].

---

For an 85-year-old woman with hypertension, the recommended blood pressure target is **< 150/90 mmHg** [^113ZHxDo] if tolerated, with initiation of therapy at ≥ 160/90 mmHg [^113mgeNz]. If she is frail, has limited life expectancy, or experiences orthostatic hypotension, a more lenient target of **< 160/90 mmHg** is reasonable [^notfound]. Avoid **SBP < 130 mmHg** or **DBP < 70 mmHg** due to increased risks of falls, cognitive decline, and renal injury [^113jJnHm] [^114uhsuM]. Individualize targets based on tolerance, comorbidities, and patient preferences, and monitor closely for adverse effects [^112t2sif].

---

## Evidence-based blood pressure targets

Several **guidelines and studies** provide evidence-based recommendations for BP targets in older adults:

- **ACP/AAFP guidelines**: For adults aged ≥ 60 years, initiate pharmacologic treatment when SBP is persistently ≥ 150 mmHg, targeting < 150 mmHg to reduce stroke, cardiac events, and possibly mortality [^113ZHxDo].

- **ESH 2023 guidelines**: For patients aged ≥ 80 years, target SBP 140–150 mmHg and DBP < 80 mmHg; consider 130–139 mmHg only if well tolerated and DBP is not < 70 mmHg [^112tWhSR] [^111cEkaP].

- **ESC 2024 guidelines**: Personalize targets; consider more lenient targets (e.g. < 140/90 mmHg) in patients aged ≥ 85 years or with limited lifespan [^116RZYXB] [^11494kgs].

- **SPRINT trial**: Intensive BP lowering (SBP < 120 mmHg) reduced cardiovascular events and mortality in adults ≥ 75 years, but increased risks of hypotension, syncope, and renal injury [^114uhsuM].

---

## Risks and benefits of intensive blood pressure control

Intensive BP control offers cardiovascular benefits but also poses **risks** in older adults:

| **Benefits** | **Risks** |
|-|-|
| Reduced cardiovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure) [^114uhsuM] | Increased risk of hypotension, syncope, falls [^notfound] |
| Potential reduction in all-cause mortality [^114uhsuM] | Higher incidence of renal injury, electrolyte abnormalities [^114uhsuM] |
| Improved cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk patients [^1134cQHE] | Cognitive decline, functional impairment [^notfound] |

---

Given these risks, **individualized targets** are essential, balancing cardiovascular benefits with potential harms [^112t2sif].

---

## Clinical factors influencing blood pressure targets

Several **patient-specific factors** should guide BP target selection:

- **Frailty**: Frail patients may benefit from more lenient targets (e.g. < 160/90 mmHg) to avoid hypotension, falls, and cognitive decline [^1179RtRe].

- **Comorbidities**: Consider cardiovascular disease, diabetes, renal impairment, and cognitive status when setting targets [^111UNTsb].

- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Avoid aggressive BP lowering in patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension [^115BTsVb].

- **Patient preferences**: Engage in shared decision-making to align targets with patient values and goals [^112t2sif].

---

## Recommended blood pressure target for an 85-year-old female

Considering current evidence and guidelines, the **recommended BP target** for an 85-year-old female is:

- **General target**: < 150/90 mmHg if tolerated [^117H73sr].

- **Lenient target**: < 160/90 mmHg if frail, limited life expectancy, or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension [^notfound].

- **Avoid**: SBP < 130 mmHg or DBP < 70 mmHg due to increased risks of falls, cognitive decline, and renal injury [^113jJnHm] [^1173Daym].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of therapy

Regular **monitoring and adjustment** are critical:

- **Home blood pressure monitoring**: Encourage home BP monitoring to guide therapy adjustments [^1162FcYi].

- **Regular follow-up**: Monitor for adverse effects, orthostatic hypotension, renal function, and cognitive status [^112j6vuh].

- **Medication review**: Periodically review and adjust antihypertensive regimens based on tolerance and patient preferences [^11768XSv].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

The recommended BP target for an 85-year-old female is **< 150/90 mmHg** if tolerated, with more lenient targets (e.g. < 160/90 mmHg) for frail patients or those with limited life expectancy. Avoid **SBP < 130 mmHg** or **DBP < 70 mmHg**. Individualize targets based on comorbidities, frailty, orthostatic hypotension, and patient preferences, and monitor closely for adverse effects.

### Does the benefit from treating to lower blood pressure targets vary with age? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111N6w76]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Recommendations differ regarding how blood pressure targets should vary with age. Crucial to this controversy is whether treatment benefit varies with age.

Methods

Systematic searches were conducted for trials randomizing treatment in intensive arms to the recommended SBP targets: 120–140mmHg. Head-to-head meta-analyses and meta-regression were conducted.

Results

Sixteen trials met criteria. Relative to higher targets, lower targets reduced cardiovascular events, but treatment benefit differed significantly among trials due to patient age. Treatment significantly benefited older patients (mean age 77, SD = 72–81), relative risk (RR) = 0.77 (0.61,0.97), P = 0.025, but not younger patients (mean age 61, SD = 53–70), RR = 0.90 (0.78,1.03), P = 0.121, even though the latter had much greater statistical power. The (RR in 80 year olds)/(RR in 55 year olds) = 0.68 (0.47,0.97), P = 0.036. Though statistically nonsignificant, corresponding trends for more specific outcomes favored older patients: Coronary artery disease 0.80, stroke 0.85, heart failure 0.54, and total mortality 0.76. For adverse effects this trend was 0.86 (0.33,2.26). The number needed to treat to lower targets to prevent one cardiovascular event over 10 years in eight populations declined with age by 94%+.

Conclusion

In these novel results, for both RR and absolute risk, treating to SBPs of 120–140mmHg versus higher targets benefited older patients more than younger patients without an age-related increase in the RR for adverse effects. Nonetheless, because all clinical trials excluded the most frail older patients, clinicians must consider individual patient characteristics such as frailty, autonomy, and cognitive ability when choosing blood pressure targets.

### What should be the target blood pressure for this older patient with hypertension? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^115HjVeL]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Hypertension is prevalent and the most important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Controversy exists regarding the optimum threshold above which to begin antihypertensive therapy and the optimum target blood pressure once medication is begun. This controversy is particularly true for older patients, who may be more likely to benefit from treatment because of their higher risk for cardiovascular events, but may also be more at risk for adverse effects of treatment. Two guidelines published in 2017 address this issue. The American College of Physicians/American Academy of Family Physicians guideline recommends initiating antihypertensive therapy for older patients (aged 60 years or older) if systolic blood pressure is 150 mm Hg or higher and to treat to the same target. They recommend a lower threshold for starting treatment and a lower target systolic blood pressure (140 mm Hg) for patients with cerebrovascular disease and potentially those at high risk for cardiovascular events. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline, which is based primarily on SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), advises a target systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg for community-dwelling ambulatory patients aged 65 years or older. This article presents the case of a 79-year-old man who is contemplating antihypertensive therapy. Two experts discuss the optimal approach for the patient and suggest how to apply the 2 guidelines to his care.

Treating complications — blood pressure targets in older adults with diabetes: In patients aged 65 to 85 years with diabetes, we recommend a target blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease outcomes, stroke, and progressive chronic kidney disease. Technical remark: Patients in certain high-risk groups could be considered for lower blood pressure targets (130/80 mm Hg), such as those with previous stroke or progressing chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and/or albuminuria).

### A 91-year-old woman with difficult-to-control hypertension: a clinical review [^11343EY8]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hypertension is common among people older than 65 years, affecting nearly two-thirds of men and three-fourths of women by age 75 years. Treatment goals and medication selection for this population may differ from those for younger patients.

Objective

To discuss the presentation, pathophysiology, and optimal treatment of hypertension among elderly persons.

Evidence Review

MEDLINE was searched from 1990 to 2013. A hand search of bibliographies from guidelines and review articles from 2000 to 2013 was also used to identify studies of hypertension treatment in patients older than 65 years.

Findings

Hypertension in elderly people differs from that in younger people in that (1) hypertension is predominantly systolic because of vascular stiffness; (2) it is associated with reduced baroreflex sensitivity, which increases blood pressure variability and vulnerability to hypotension during common daily activities; (3) it is associated with cognitive and functional decline as well as adverse cardiovascular outcomes; and (4) hypertension may be beneficial in frail people older than 85 years. Treatment of healthy patients up to age 85 years with most antihypertensive medications reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and possibly cognitive and functional decline.

Conclusion and Relevance

Although patients in their 90s have not been studied, any ambulatory and independent patient older than 80 years should have multiple blood pressure measurements taken during their usual daily activities, and if these show persistent hypertension, these patients should be treated judiciously.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to goals of treatment, BP targets, general population, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider setting personalized and more lenient BP targets (such as < 140 mmHg) in patients meeting the following criteria:

- age ≥ 85 years.

### What is the evidence base for diagnosing hypertension and for subsequent blood pressure treatment targets in the prevention of cardiovascular disease? [^115h53Kg]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Current target recommendations

NICE reviewed three systematic reviews and 27 prognostic studies to develop their current treatment threshold recommendations. The cut-off points for ABPM were set lower than those for clinic BP. Evidence for these thresholds came largely from work comparing clinic BP and ABPM to cardiovascular outcomes. The Pressioni Arteriose Monitorate e Loro Associazioni (PAMELA) trial was a landmark study in this area and the authors predicted that a clinic BP of 140/90 mmHg was equivalent to a 24-hour ABPM of 125/80 mmHg or a daytime ABPM of 130/85 mmHg. However, this work was based on prognostic thresholds and there is very little evidence for comparable treatment targets between ABPM and clinic BP. As discussed above, Head et al. analysed clinic BP and ABPM measurements from patients referred to hypertension clinics across Australia. The treatment target recommendations for ABPM and SMBP (Table 1) from the NICE guidelines are largely based on this work.

Table 1
Comparison of recommendations for diagnostic and treatment thresholds between NICE, ESH, JNC and CHEP guidelines

Abbreviations: OBPM office blood pressure measurement, ABPM ambulatory blood pressure measurement, HBPM home blood pressure measurement, CKD chronic kidney disease

NICE suggests an ABPM treatment target of < 135/85 mmHg for patients below 80 years of age and an ABPM target of < 145/85 mmHg for those patients over 80 years. Currently, they are the only guidelines to specify a common treatment and management threshold for ABPM with the same thresholds assumed for home BP monitoring.

The ESH 2013 guidelines suggest a target of < 140 mmHg for all patients under 80 years of age and a diagnostic target of < 90 mmHg. Diabetic patients should be treated to a diastolic target of < 85 mmHg. Patients over 80 years with a systolic BP ≥ 160 mmHg should be treated to a target between 140 and 150 mmHg according to the evidence.

The recent JNC 8 guideline recommended treating those between 18 and 60 years old to a target of 140/90 mmHg. However, for those patients above 60 years, they recommended a systolic treatment target of < 150 mmHg. This caused some controversy, but the committee argued that evidence from the trials they had considered found little benefit of tighter control leading to better outcomes. However, many countered that these recommendations were based on a very small number of trials which passed the rigorous screening process, excluding evidence from meta-analysis, and meaning that this recommendation was almost entirely based on expert opinion.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^114FFvZw]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — blood pressure targets: In patients (≥ 65 years), SBP should be targeted to between 130 and 140 mmHg and diastolic BP (DBP) to < 80 mmHg, and treated SBP should not be targeted to < 120 mmHg. The guideline specifies a target range because the lower safety boundary assumes greater importance when BP is targeted to lower levels, and when SBP is lowered to < 120 mmHg in patients included in randomized controlled trials (older and higher-risk patients with comorbidities and cardiovascular disease), the risk of harm appears to increase and outweigh the benefits.

### Controversies in hypertension II: the optimal target blood pressure [^116oo4Xi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The optimal target blood pressure in the treatment of hypertension is undefined. Whether more intense therapy is better than standard, typically < 140/90 mm Hg, is controversial. The most recent American guidelines recommend ≤ 130/80 mm Hg for essentially all adults. There have been at least 28 trials targeting more versus less intensive therapy, including 13 aimed at reducing cardiovascular events and mortality, 11 restricted to patients with chronic kidney disease, and 4 with surrogate endpoints. We review these trials in a narrative fashion due to significant heterogeneity in targets chosen, populations studied, and primary endpoints. Most were negative, although some showed significant benefit to more intense therapy. When determining the optimal pressure for an individual patient, additional factors should be considered, including age, frailty, polypharmacy, baseline blood pressure, and the diastolic blood pressure J-curve. We discuss these modifying factors in detail. Whereas the tenet "lower is better" is generally true, one size does not fit all, and blood pressure control must be individualized.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to elderly patients, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating BP-lowering treatment in patients aged ≥ 85 years or with clinically significant moderate-to-severe frailty or limited predicted lifespan (< 3 years) only from ≥ 140/90 mmHg under close monitoring of treatment tolerance.

### Do we AGREE on the targets of antihypertensive drug treatment in older adults: a systematic review of guidelines on primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases [^114crCvZ]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension is the worldwide leading predisposing condition for disease burden, and as the most important modifiable risk factor, its management forms an essential pillar of primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Globally, hypertension is prevalent in roughly one in four adults and steadily rises with age. For example, data from the Framingham Heart Study showed that more than 90% of the normotensive participants between 55 and 65 years developed hypertension, emphasizing the need for a thoughtful treatment strategy. Nevertheless, an international analysis of health surveys estimated that the proportion of hypertensive adults between 35 and 85 years receiving antihypertensive drug therapy ranges from 29.0% to 80.5%.

Only during the last three decades randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that pharmacological treatment of hypertension in older adults is beneficial. Although those studies included octogenarians, frail older adults are largely underrepresented as many of them are excluded from trials due to their comorbidities. To date, no interventional studies specific to antihypertensive treatment in older frail individuals have been conducted. Several population-based cohort studies, in contrast, have shown that low blood pressure (BP) under antihypertensive drug treatment, especially in older adults with frailty or other complex health problems, is associated with higher all-cause mortality rates. Despite the high quality of the available evidence, translation into clinical guidance for the heterogeneous population of older adults is challenging.

In the current discussion on hypertension management in older adults, the clinical problem is not only when to start, but predominantly how low the target BP needs to be. This intensity and thereby numerical target of antihypertensive drug therapy is set on the balance between cardiovascular risk reduction and chance of side effects. Recent trial evidence favours intensive treatment for most patients; however, frail older adults seem to be at higher risk for both cardiovascular events and severe side effects of antihypertensive drug therapy, resulting in an unclear net benefit.

Because translation of the available evidence concerning primary cardiovascular prevention into clinical guidance for older adults is challenging, insight into the actual guidelines about hypertension management will contribute to the present debate. Therefore, the primary aim of this review was to provide a systematic, cross-continental and present-day overview of the thresholds and targets of antihypertensive drug treatment in older adults recommended in the currently used guidelines. A secondary aim was to explore the potential relationships between the advised targets and guideline characteristics, including methodological quality, continent of origin, intended users and the guideline committee's selection of evidence supporting the recommended targets.

### Treatment blood pressure targets for hypertension [^115tJF58]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors need to know what blood pressure (BP) target they should try to achieve. The standard of clinical practice for some time has been ≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg. New guidelines are recommending BP targets lower than this standard. It is not known whether attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard reduces mortality and morbidity.

Objectives

To determine if lower BP targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard BP targets (≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (1966–2008), EMBASE (1980–2008), and CENTRAL (up to June 2008); references from review articles, clinical guidelines, and clinical trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing patients randomized to lower or to standard BP targets and providing data on any of the primary outcomes below.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers (JAA, MIP) independently assessed the included trials and data entry. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; total cardiovascular events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure and end stage renal disease. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean systolic and diastolic BP and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Main Results

No trials comparing different systolic BP targets were found. Seven trials (22,089 subjects) comparing different diastolic BP targets were included. Despite a -4/-3 mmHg greater achieved reduction in systolic/diastolic BP, p < 0.001, attempting to achieve "lower targets" instead of "standard targets" did not change total mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86–1.15), myocardial infarction (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74–1.09), stroke (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79–1.25), congestive heart failure (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59–1.32), major cardiovascular events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83–1.07), or end-stage renal disease (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.81–1.27). The net health effect of lower targets cannot be fully assessed due to lack of information regarding all total serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse effects in 6 of 7 trials. A sensitivity analysis in diabetic patients and in patients with chronic renal disease also did not show a reduction in any of the mortality and morbidity outcomes with lower targets as compared to standard targets.

Authors' Conclusions

Treating patients to lower than standard BP targets, ≤ 140–160/90–100 mmHg, does not reduce mortality or morbidity. Because guidelines are recommending even lower targets for diabetes mellitus and chronic renal disease, we are currently conducting systematic reviews in those groups of patients.

### The goal of blood pressure in the hypertensive patient with diabetes is defined: now the challenge is go from recommendations to practice [^1174iNNw]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2014). Low credibility.

The HOT trial included a prespecified subgroup analysis in 1,501 diabetic subjects (age: 61.5 years; baseline BP: 170/105 mmHg), randomized to three different DBP targets: 90, 85, and 80 mmHg. Achieved BP was 144/85, 141/83, and 140/81 mmHg in the three target groups, respectively. A target of 80 mmHg significantly reduced both major cardiovascular event rates (11.9/1,000 person-years; RR 0.49; 95% CI, 0.29–0.81) and cardiovascular mortality (3.7/1,000 person-years; RR 0.33; 95% CI, 0.14–0.78) compared with a target of 90 mmHg (24.4/1,000 person-years and 11.1/1,000 person-years, respectively).

### 2014 hypertension recommendations from the eighth Joint National Committee panel members raise concerns for elderly black and female populations [^111df3yT]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

A report from panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee titled "2014 Evidence-Based Guideline for the Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults" has garnered much attention due to its major change in recommendations for hypertension treatment for patients ≥ 60 years of age and for their treatment goal. In response, certain groups have opposed the decision to initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower blood pressure (BP) at systolic BP ≥ 150 mm Hg and treat to a goal systolic BP of < 150 mm Hg in the general population age ≥ 60 years. This paper contains 3 sections-an introduction followed by the opinions of 2 writing groups-outlining objections to or support of maintaining this proposed strategy in certain at-risk populations, namely African Americans, women, and the elderly. Several authors argue for maintaining current targets, as opposed to adopting the new recommendations, to allow for optimal treatment for older women and African Americans, helping to close sex and race/ethnicity gaps in cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.

Office blood pressure treatment targets in hypertensive patients — It is recommended that the first objective of treatment should be to lower BP to < 140/90 mmHg in all patients and that, if the treatment is well tolerated, treated BP values should be targeted to 130/80 mmHg or lower in most patients. In patients < 65 years receiving BP-lowering drugs, it is recommended that SBP should be lowered to a BP range of 120–129 mmHg in most patients. In older patients (aged ≥ 65 years) receiving BP-lowering drugs, it is recommended that SBP should be targeted to a BP range of 130–139 mmHg, with close monitoring of adverse effects. These BP targets are recommended for patients at any level of CV risk and in patients with and without established CVD. A DBP target of < 80 mmHg should be considered for all hypertensive patients, independent of the level of risk and comorbidities.

### Targets for body fat, blood pressure, lipids, and glucose-lowering interventions in healthy older people [^113hcDKE]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions.

In the absence of information, ESH/ESC guidelines suggest starting treatment in healthy older patients with BP values between 140 and 160 mmHg when there is the presence of target organ damage or associated clinical conditions capable of increasing the cardiovascular risk profile of the individual. As far as treatment targets are concerned, the recommendation is to avoid, particularly in very old people, a drastic lowering of BP. These reductions are capable of doing harm to a fragile patient such as the aged individual. It remains unclear whether the target systolic BP should be the same for patients ranging from 65 to 80 years as it is for patients over the age of 80 years.

### Is 60 the new 80 in hypertension? [^114use8x]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Since the release of the "2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)", much controversy has ensued over the appropriate systolic blood pressure goal for those over the age of 60 years. This guideline suggested liberalizing the target for this population to < 150 mmHg, moving away from previous guidelines suggesting a target of < 140 mmHg. While some national quality measures have accepted the new relaxed blood pressure goal, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology have not. Recently published data show that millions of adults over 60 years of age would be classified as controlled using a threshold of < 150 mmHg, but not with a target of < 140 mmHg. In addition, emerging randomized trial evidence suggests that targeting a systolic blood pressure well below 140 mmHg is beneficial in older adults. In light of the improved health and vitality of older adults, and the steady decline in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality over recent decades, we do not think it is in good judgment to liberalize the treatment target in adults less than 80 years of age.

### Targeting a systolic blood pressure of… [^11324dSk]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this updated meta-analysis provides strong evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of intensive BP control (SBP, < 130 mmHg) in patients with hypertension aged ≥ 75 years. Our findings argue against the use of higher BP targets in the absence of compelling contraindications, and support a more unified approach to BP management across age groups. Future guidelines should consider retiring arbitrary age thresholds in favor of individualized, risk-based decision making that acknowledges the growing heterogeneity of the older adult population. Further studies are warranted to define optimal BP targets in frail, institutionalized, or cognitively impaired individuals, who remain underrepresented in the existing evidence.

Background

This is the first update of this review first published in 2009. When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors usually try to achieve a blood pressure target. That target is the blood pressure value below which the optimal clinical benefit is supposedly obtained. "The lower the better" approach that guided the treatment of elevated blood pressure for many years was challenged during the last decade due to lack of evidence from randomised trials supporting that strategy. For that reason, the standard blood pressure target in clinical practice during the last years has been less than 140/90 mm Hg for the general population of patients with elevated blood pressure. However, new trials published in recent years have reintroduced the idea of trying to achieve lower blood pressure targets. Therefore, it is important to know whether the benefits outweigh harms when attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard target.

Objectives

The primary objective was to determine if lower blood pressure targets (any target less than or equal to 135/85 mm Hg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard blood pressure targets (less than or equal to 140/ 90 mm Hg) for the treatment of patients with chronic arterial hypertension. The secondary objectives were: to determine if there is a change in mean achieved systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP associated with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets" in patients with chronic arterial hypertension; and to determine if there is a change in withdrawals due to adverse events with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets", in patients with elevated blood pressure.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to May 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2019, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing patients allocated to lower or to standard blood pressure targets (see above).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (JAA, VL) independently assessed the included trials and extracted data. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, end stage renal disease, and other serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean SBP and DBP, withdrawals due to adverse effects, and mean number of antihypertensive drugs used. We assessed the risk of bias of each trial using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: This update includes 11 RCTs involving 38,688 participants with a mean follow-up of 3.7 years. This represents 7 new RCTs compared with the original version. At baseline the mean weighted age was 63.1 years and the mean weighted blood pressure was 155/91 mm Hg. Lower targets do not reduce total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05; 11 trials, 38,688 participants; high-certainty evidence) and do not reduce total serious adverse events (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.08; 6 trials, 18,165 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This means that the benefits of lower targets do not outweigh the harms as compared to standard blood pressure targets. Lower targets may reduce myocardial infarction (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.96; 6 trials, 18,938 participants, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 0.4%, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 250 over 3.7 years) and congestive heart failure (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.92; 5 trials, 15,859 participants, ARR 0.6%, NNTB 167 over 3.7 years) (low-certainty for both outcomes). Reduction in myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure was not reflected in total serious adverse events. This may be due to an increase in other serious adverse events (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.59; 6 trials. 18,938 participants, absolute risk increase (ARI) 3%, number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 33 over four years) (low-certainty evidence). Participants assigned to a "lower" target received one additional antihypertensive medication and achieved a significantly lower mean SBP (122.8 mm Hg versus 135.0 mm Hg, and a lower mean DBP (82.0 mm Hg versus 85.2 mm Hg, than those assigned to "standard target".

Authors' Conclusions

For the general population of persons with elevated blood pressure, the benefits of trying to achieve a lower blood pressure target rather than a standard target (≤ 140/90 mm Hg) do not outweigh the harms associated with that intervention. Further research is needed to see if some groups of patients would benefit or be harmed by lower targets. The results of this review are primarily applicable to older people with moderate to high cardiovascular risk. They may not be applicable to other populations.

### Targeting a systolic blood pressure of… [^114hwDPq]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Recent clinical trials have raised important questions regarding optimal blood pressure (BP) targets in older adults with hypertension. In the 2019 Japanese Society of Hypertension guidelines, a systolic BP (SBP) target of < 140 mmHg is recommended for individuals aged ≥ 75 years. However, subsequent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown potential cardiovascular and mortality benefits associated with strict BP targets. We conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intensive SBP control (< 130 mmHg) compared with less intensive control (≥ 130 mmHg) in patients with hypertension aged ≥ 75 years. We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Ichushi Web for publications up to May 30, 2024, supplemented by manual searches. Seven RCTs that met predefined eligibility criteria were included in the final meta-analysis. Among patients aged ≥ 75 years, intensive SBP lowering was associated with significantly reduced risks of composite cardiovascular events (risk ratio [RR]: 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.40–0.94, p = 0.03), all-cause mortality (RR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.56–0.93, p = 0.01), and cardiovascular mortality (RR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.35–0.88, p = 0.01), with no increase in serious adverse events (RR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.93–1.08, p = 0.97). Stroke incidence did not differ significantly between groups. Similar results were observed when the analysis was expanded to include studies that enrolled participants aged ≥ 70 years. These findings support the safety and clinical benefits of targeting an SBP of < 130 mmHg in older adults with hypertension.

### Moving toward a consensus: comparison of the 2023 ESH and 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guidelines [^111UNTsb]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

BP grade classifications and definitions did not change between the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/ESH guideline and updated 2023 ESH guideline. As a result, significant differences in BP classification and definition of hypertension between guidelines remain, with ACC/AHA using "stages" and ESH using "grades" for BP categorization (Figure 1). ESH defines hypertension as BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg, while ACC/AHA uses a threshold of ≥ 130/80 mm Hg. ESH classifies systolic BP between 130 and 139 mm Hg or diastolic ranges between 85 and 89 mm Hg as "high-normal" BP, while ACC/AHA guideline defines this as "stage 1" hypertension.

Recommendations on BP treatment targets also differ. For most patients, the ACC/AHA guideline recommends treating to a BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg. The ESH, on the other hand, recommends tailoring treatment based on age, clinical comorbidities, and patient-specific tolerance. For adults between ages 18 and 64 years, the ESH guideline recommends a BP target < 130/80 mm Hg, similar to what is recommended by the ACC/AHA guideline. However, the ESH guideline recommends higher targets for older patients. For adults aged 65 to 79 years, ESH recommends targeting BP < 140/80 mm Hg, but notes that if tolerated by the patient, a target of < 130/80 mm Hg should be used. The threshold for very old patients (≥ 80 years old) is even higher, targeting SBP between 140 and 150 mmHg. For special populations including hypertensive patients with CKD, the ESH guideline recommends treatment to a higher BP target of < 140/90 mm Hg compared to the recommended ACC/AHA BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg. For other comorbidities including diabetes, CAD, cerebrovascular disease, both guidelines recommend the same BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg. While significant differences still exist between the guidelines, for high-risk patients and individuals between ages 18 and 79 years old, there is consensus to achieve BP goal < 130/80 mm Hg.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^115xdVCE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the third update of the review first published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if lower blood pressure targets (systolic/diastolic 135/85 mmHg or less) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity compared with standard blood pressure targets (140 mmHg to 160mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, we used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was January 2022. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with more than 50 participants per group that provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (135/85 mmHg or less) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (140 mmHg to 160 mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less). Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs that involved 9595 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). Six of seven RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies was blinded to participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensive drugs to reach a specific blood pressure goal. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all trials. Hence, we assessed all trials at high risk of performance bias and low risk of detection bias. We also considered other issues, such as early termination of studies and subgroups of participants not predefined, to downgrade the certainty of the evidence. We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23; 7 studies, 9595 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Similarly, we found there may be little to no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure (CHF)) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about withdrawals due to adverse effects. However, studies suggest more participants may withdraw due to adverse effects in the lower target group (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; 3 studies, 801 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were lower in the lower target group (systolic: mean difference (MD) -8.77 mmHg, 95% CI -12.82 to -4.73; 7 studies, 8657 participants; diastolic: MD -4.50 mmHg, 95% CI -6.35 to -2.65; 6 studies, 8546 participants). More drugs were needed in the lower target group (MD 0.56, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.96; 5 studies, 7910 participants), but blood pressure targets at one year were achieved more frequently in the standard target group (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.23; 7 studies, 8699 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality and cardiovascular mortality between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower compared to a standard blood pressure target. There may also be little to no difference in serious adverse events or total cardiovascular events. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on withdrawals due to adverse effects, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. Several trials are still ongoing, which may provide an important input to this topic in the near future.

Target blood pressure values in elderly patients

According to recent guidelines, treatment of hypertension in patients aged over 80 years should be initiated when BP is ≥ 160/ ≥ 90 mmHg (see Table 2). The 2018 European Guidelines recommend a BP treatment target of < 130/ < 80 mmHg in patients under 65 years of age. The DBP target is generally < 80 mmHg regardless of age or comorbidities. In contrast to previous guidelines, the current guidelines recommend that SBP should be targeted to a BP range of 130–139 mmHg. These recommendations are based on evidence indicating that the lowest risk of CV events (especially cardiovascular death and congestive heart failure) is observed at these values. The 2018 European Guidelines emphasize that these values may even be applied to patients over 80 years, provided that an SBP between 130 and 140 mmHg is well tolerated.

Table 2
Office blood pressure thresholds for treatment.

The Berlin Initiative Study examined the influence of BP lowering in patients older than 70 years. The study included 1628 patients with a mean age of 81 years who were treated with antihypertensive drugs (636 exhibited normalized BP < 140/ < 90 mmHg). Patients with a BP < 140/90 mmHg had a 26% higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.26; 95% CI 1.04–1.54) than those whose BP above. The relative risk was further increased by 40% in patients ≥ 80 years (HR 1.40; 95% CI 1.12–1.74), and likewise in patients with previous CV events (HR 1.61; 95% CI 1.14–2.27). However, this risk amplification was not observed in patients between 70 and 79 years (HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.54–1.27). The increased risk in the elderly was particularly influenced by SBP values < 130 mmHg (Fig. 8). The association between SBP and mortality demonstrated in a U-shaped curve using 140 mmHg as reference. There was an increased risk with lower SBP values that reached statistical significance at 125 mmHg, while the numerically increased risk with higher SBP values did not reach statistical significance.

### Debate on the 2025 guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: new blood pressure targets, lower is better-and possible [^117CAWRS]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines has now released the long-awaited 2025 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/AANP/AAPA/ABC/ACCP/ACPM/AGS/AMA/ASPC/NMA/PCNA/SGIM Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults. Since the previous version, which had been in place for 8 years, meta-analyses and several treat-to-target trials investigating lower versus standard blood pressure targets have been published. Based on these, the 2025 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommends in adults with confirmed hypertension, an office blood pressure goal of < 130/80 mmHg, with encouragement to further reduce systolic blood pressure to < 120 mmHg. Here, we set out why we support these lower blood pressure targets and outline strategies to achieve them.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^113QhbJd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the second update of the review first published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard blood pressure targets (140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg or less) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to November 2019: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982), along with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs with more than 50 participants per group that provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (135/85 mmHg or less) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg or less). Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that involved 9484 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). All RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies was blinded to participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensives to reach a specific blood pressure goal. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all trials. Hence, we assessed all trials at high risk of performance bias and low risk of detection bias. Other issues such as early termination of studies and subgroups of participants not predefined were also considered to downgrade the quality evidence. We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-quality evidence) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, we found there may be little to no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 6 studies, 9484 participants; low-quality evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 6 studies, 9484 participants; low-quality evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about withdrawals due to adverse effects. However, studies suggest more participants may withdraw due to adverse effects in the lower target group (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; 2 studies, 690 participants; very low-quality evidence). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were lower in the lower target group (systolic: mean difference (MD) -8.90 mmHg, 95% CI -13.24 to -4.56; 6 studies, 8546 participants; diastolic: MD -4.50 mmHg, 95% CI -6.35 to -2.65; 6 studies, 8546 participants). More drugs were needed in the lower target group (MD 0.56, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.96; 5 studies, 7910 participants), but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.24; 6 studies, 8588 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality and cardiovascular mortality between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower compared to a standard blood pressure target. There may also be little to no difference in serious adverse events or total cardiovascular events. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on withdrawals due to adverse effects, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. Several trials are still ongoing, which may provide an important input to this topic in the near future.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^1135WgQD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if 'lower' blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with 'standard' blood pressure targets (≤ 140 to 160/ 90 to 100 mmHg) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to February 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature Database (from 1982) and contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with more than 50 participants per group and at least six months follow-up. Trial reports needed to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions were lower target for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (≤ 135/85 mmHg) compared with standard target for blood pressure (≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg). Participants were adults with documented hypertension or who were receiving treatment for hypertension and cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that involved a total of 9795 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). Five RCTs provided individual patient data for 6775 participants. We found no change in total mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.22) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.21; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, no differences were found in serious adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11; low-quality evidence). There was a reduction in fatal and non fatal cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization or death from congestive heart failure) with the lower target (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.98; ARR 1.6% over 3.7 years; low-quality evidence). There were more participant withdrawals due to adverse effects in the lower target arm (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; very low-quality evidence). Blood pressures were lower in the lower' target group by 9.5/4.9 mmHg. More drugs were needed in the lower target group but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group.

Authors' Conclusions

No evidence of a difference in total mortality and serious adverse events was found between treating to a lower or to a standard blood pressure target in people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease. This suggests no net health benefit from a lower systolic blood pressure target despite the small absolute reduction in total cardiovascular serious adverse events. There was very limited evidence on adverse events, which lead to high uncertainty. At present there is insufficient evidence to justify lower blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. More trials are needed to answer this question.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^115z4TP1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

JNC 8 Recommendations 2 to 5

In all persons < 60 years or in persons > 18 years (and either those younger or older than 60 years with either diabetes or CKD), initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower SBP ≥ 140 or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and treat to a goal BP of < 140/90 mm Hg.

Basis of Recommendation

There is broader agreement between the professional societies on how to treat younger patients with hypertension. While most studies examined adults > 30 years, JNC 8 extends the same target to those aged 18 to 30 years. More support can be found for DBP versus SBP goals among younger adults with hypertension, especially in the Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) trial. 34 This trial randomized 18 790 hypertensive patients (aged 50 to 80 years) with baseline DBP 100 to 115 mm Hg into 3 groups based on target DBP ≤ 90, ≤ 85, or ≤ 80 mm Hg.

The main goal of this study was to assess the association between these 3 target DBPs and major CVD events (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death). There was little difference in event rates between the 3 groups, except that the rate of MI was reduced in the 2 lower DBP target groups compared with the DBP ≤ 90 mm Hg group. Further subgroup analyses of patients with diabetes demonstrated fewer major CVD events, fewer strokes, and reduced cardiovascular mortality in the lowest BP treatment target group, while those with prior CVD had a significant reduction in stroke across the 3 groups. 34

While all 3 groups in HOT achieved a mean DBP < 90 mm Hg, the lowest risk of cardiovascular mortality was seen at 85.6 mm Hg and the lowest rate of CVD events was seen at 82.6 mm Hg. Based on this trial, everyone with hypertension under the JNC 8 guidelines has a DBP goal of < 90 mm Hg. There is less evidence supporting an SBP target of < 140 mm Hg in this group of patients. However, in trials like HOT, even though DBP was being targeted, SBP also fell at least 25 mm Hg in all 3 groups. 34 Indeed, given SPRINT suggests clinical benefit for an SBP target of 120 mm Hg among higher risk persons < 60 years, it is likely that forthcoming guidelines may even reduce this SBP target to a threshold lower than 140. However, the DBP values in the intensive therapy arm of SPRINT are not currently known.

### Higher blood pressure targets for hypertension in older adults [^114EkVCh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an update of the original Cochrane review, published in 2017. Eight out of 10 major antihypertensive trials in adults, 65 years of age or older, attempted to achieve a target systolic blood pressure (BP) of < 160 mmHg. Collectively, these trials demonstrated cardiovascular benefit for treatment, compared to no treatment, for older adults with BP > 160 mmHg. However, an even lower BP target of < 140 mmHg is commonly applied to all age groups. Yet the risk and benefit of antihypertensive therapy can be expected to vary across populations, and some observational evidence suggests that older adults who are frail might have better health outcomes with less aggressive BP lowering. Current clinical practice guidelines are inconsistent in target BP recommendations for older adults, with systolic BP targets ranging from < 130 mmHg to < 150 mmHg. The 2017 review did not find compelling evidence of a reduction in any of the primary outcomes, including all-cause mortality, stroke, or total serious cardiovascular adverse events, comparing a lower BP target to a higher BP target in older adults with hypertension. It is important to update this review to explore if new evidence exists to determine whether older adults might do just as well, better, or worse with less aggressive pharmacotherapy for hypertension.

Objectives

To assess the effects of a less aggressive blood pressure target (in the range of < 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg), compared to a conventional or more aggressive BP target (of < 140/90 mmHg or lower) in hypertensive adults, 65 years of age or older.

Search Methods

For this update, Cochrane Hypertension's Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to June 2024: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, and Embase Ovid, and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials. We also contacted authors of relevant papers requesting information on further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials of hypertensive older adults (≥ 65 years) that spanned at least one year, and reported the effect on mortality and morbidity of a higher or lower systolic or diastolic BP treatment target. Higher BP targets ranged from systolic BP < 150 to 160 mmHg or diastolic BP < 95 to 105 mmHg; lower BP targets were 140/90 mmHg or lower, measured in an ambulatory, home, or office setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and certainty of the evidence, and extracted data. We combined data for dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, we used mean difference (MD). Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, institutionalisation, and serious cardio-renal vascular adverse events. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, non-cardiovascular mortality, unplanned hospitalisation, each component of cardiovascular serious adverse events separately (including cerebrovascular disease, cardiac disease, vascular disease, and renal failure), total serious adverse events, total minor adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse effects, systolic BP achieved, and diastolic BP achieved.

Main Results

With the addition of one new trial, we included four trials in this updated review (16,732 older adults with a mean age of 70.3 years). Of these, one trial used a combined systolic and diastolic BP target and compared a higher target of < 150/90 mmHg to a lower target of < 140/90 mmHg, and two trials utilised a purely systolic BP target, and compared a systolic BP < 150 mmHg (1 trial) and a systolic BP < 160 mmHg (1 trial), to a systolic BP < 140 mmHg. The fourth and newest trial also utilised a systolic BP target, but also introduced a lower limit for systolic BP. It compared systolic BP in the target range of 130 to 150 mmHg to a lower target range of 110 to 130 mmHg. The evidence shows that treatment to the lower BP target over two to four years may result in little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.37; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; low-certainty evidence), but the lower BP target does reduce stroke (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.67; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; high-certainty evidence), and likely reduces total serious cardiovascular adverse events (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.45; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Adverse effects were not available from all trials, but the lower BP target likely does not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.33; 3 studies, 16,008 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

When comparing a higher BP target, in the range of < 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg, to a lower BP target of 140/90 or lower, over two to four years of follow-up, there is high-certainty evidence that the lower BP target reduces stroke, and moderate-certainty evidence that the lower BP target likely reduces serious cardiovascular events. The effect on all-cause mortality is unclear (low-certainty evidence), and the lower BP target likely does not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects (moderate-certainty evidence). Although additional research is warranted in those who are 80 years of age and older, and those who are frail (in whom risks and benefits may differ), conventional BP targets may be appropriate for the majority of older adults.

### Blood pressure targets for hypertension in older adults [^113ZCV8W]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Eight out of 10 major antihypertensive trials in older adults attempted to achieve a target systolic blood pressure (BP) less than 160 mmHg. Collectively these trials demonstrated benefit for treatment, as compared to no treatment, for an older adult with BP greater than 160 mmHg. However an even lower BP target of less than 140 mmHg is commonly applied to all age groups. At the present time it is not known whether a lower or higher BP target is associated with better cardiovascular outcomes in older adults.

Objectives

To assess the effects of a higher (less than 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg) BP target compared to the lower BP target of less than 140/90 mmHg in hypertensive adults 65 years of age or older.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to February 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials, of at least one year's duration, conducted on hypertensive adults aged 65 years or older, which report the effect on mortality and morbidity of a higher systolic or diastolic BP treatment target (whether ambulatory, home, or office measurements) in the range of systolic BP less than 150 to 160 mmHg or diastolic BP less than 95 to 105 mmHg as compared to a lower BP treatment target of less than 140/90 mmHg or lower.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We combined data for dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and for continuous outcomes we used mean difference (MD). Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, institutionalisation, and cardiovascular serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, non-cardiovascular mortality, unplanned hospitalisation, each component of cardiovascular serious adverse events separately (including cerebrovascular disease, cardiac disease, vascular disease, and renal failure), total serious adverse events, total minor adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse effects, systolic BP achieved, and diastolic BP achieved.

Main Results

We found and included three unblinded randomised trials in 8221 older adults (mean age 74.8 years), in which higher BP targets of less than 150/90 mmHg (two trials) and less than 160/90 mmHg (one trial) were compared to a lower target of less than 140/90 mmHg. Treatment to the two different BP targets over two to four years failed to produce a difference in any of our primary outcomes, including all-cause mortality (RR 1.24 95% CI 0.99 to 1.54), stroke (RR 1.25 95% CI 0.94 to 1.67) and total cardiovascular serious adverse events (RR 1.19 95% CI 0.98 to 1.45). However, the 95% confidence intervals of these outcomes suggest the lower BP target is probably not worse, and might offer a clinically important benefit. We judged all comparisons to be based on low-quality evidence. Data on adverse effects were not available from all trials and not different, including total serious adverse events, total minor adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

At the present time there is insufficient evidence to know whether a higher BP target (less than150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg) or a lower BP target (less than 140/90 mmHg) is better for older adults with high BP. Additional good-quality trials assessing BP targets in this population are needed.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^1173Daym]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Older patients with hypertension (defined as aged ≥ 65 years) — trial evidence and treatment target recommendations are as follows: The SPRINT trial included a high proportion of patients over the age of 75 years (n = 2636) and with more intensive BP-lowering treatment (mean achieved BP = 124/62 mmHg) significantly reduced major CV events, heart failure, and all-cause death (all by > 30%) compared with standard treatment targeting SBP to < 140 mmHg; because automated office BP measurement was used, the SBP of 124 mmHg most probably reflects a conventional office SBP range of 130–139 mmHg. The HYVET trial suggested benefit when treating to an SBP target of < 150 mmHg (achieving a mean SBP of 144 mmHg) in the very old (> 80 years). Based on these data, we recommend that in older patients treated for hypertension, BP should be lowered to < 140/90 mmHg, but not below an SBP of 130 mmHg, and the impact of BP-lowering on the well-being of the patient should be closely monitored.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^115RaCrb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of the review published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if 'lower' blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with 'standard' blood pressure targets (≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to February 2018: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982), along with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included more than 50 participants per group and provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (≤ 135/85 mmHg) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg). Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that involved a total of 9484 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). All RCTs provided individual participant data. We found no change in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, we found no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; low-quality evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; low-quality evidence). Studies reported more participant withdrawals due to adverse effects in the lower target arm (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; very low-quality evidence). Blood pressures were lower in the lower target group by 8.9/4.5 mmHg. More drugs were needed in the lower target group, but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence of a difference in total mortality, serious adverse events, or total cardiovascular events between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower or to a standard blood pressure target. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on adverse events, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. More trials are needed to examine this topic.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^117H73sr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

JNC 8 Recommendation 1

In the general population aged ≥ 60 years, initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower BP at systolic BP (SBP) ≥ 150 mm Hg or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg and treat to a goal SBP < 150 mm Hg and goal DBP < 90 mm Hg.

Basis of Recommendation

This first recommendation is based on several RCTs evaluating treatment of SBP to < 140 mm Hg versus a more liberal target (140–160 mm Hg) in patients > 65 years of age. 9, 10 In the Japanese Trial to Assess Optimal Systolic Blood Pressure in Elderly Hypertensive Patients (JATOS), 4418 patients between the ages of 65 and 85 were randomized to SBP treatment goal < 140 mm Hg versus 140 to < 160 mm Hg. Despite the fact that the intensive treatment group achieved a significantly lower BP (136/75 mm Hg versus 146/78 mm Hg), the primary end point of combined CVD and renal failure did not differ significantly between the 2 groups.

One limitation of this trial, however, is that it was only powered to detect a 40% relative risk reduction (or an absolute risk reduction from 5% to 3%) in the primary end point. While a 10/3–mm Hg reduction in BP is substantial, it may not be sufficient to achieve a 40% reduction in CVD or renal failure. Also, these patients were followed for only 2 years and the main treatment drug was a long‐acting calcium channel blocker (CCB). Diuretics, widely considered first line along with CCBs in most professional society guidelines, were used in only 12% of the patients. 7, 11, 12, 13 While not reaching statistical significance, subgroup analysis suggested that intensive treatment goals may be beneficial in patients < 75 years old while adopting a more liberal strategy may be safer in those ≥ 75 years old. 10

Individualized SBP target selection — original wording and risk groups emphasize tailoring to patient risk. The original wording states "An SBP target of less than 140 mm Hg is a reasonable goal for some patients with increased cardiovascular risk" and "Clinicians should individually assess cardiovascular risk for patients", with increased risk including persons with known vascular disease, most patients with diabetes, and older persons with chronic kidney disease with "estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 45 mL/min per 1.73 m²", as well as those with metabolic syndrome and older persons.

### Blood pressure and the new ACC / AHA hypertension guidelines [^115GPRbD]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines cover virtually all aspects of the diagnosis, evaluation, monitoring, secondary causes as well as drug and non-drug treatment of hypertension. Substantial and appropriate emphasis has been given to the strategies necessary for accurate measurement of blood pressure in any setting where valid blood pressure measurements are desired. Most "errors" made during blood pressure measurement bias readings upwards resulting in over-diagnosis of hypertension and, amongst those already on drug therapy, underestimating the true magnitude of blood pressure lowering resulting in over-treatment. Hypertension is diagnosed when blood pressure is consistently ≥ 130 and/or ≥ 80 mm Hg. However, the majority of patients with hypertension between 130–139/80–89 mm Hg (stage 1 hypertension) do not qualify for immediate drug therapy. The guideline breaks new ground with some of its recommendations. Absolute cardiovascular risk is utilized, for the first time, to determine high-risk status when BP 130–139/80–89 mm Hg (Stage 1 hypertension) and high-risk patient characteristics/co-morbidities are absent including age 65 and older, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, known cardiovascular disease; high-risk individuals initiate drug therapy when BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg. The exception amongst high-risk individuals is for secondary stroke prevention in drug naïve individuals as drug therapy is initiated when blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. Non-high risk individuals will initiate drug therapy when BP is ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. Irrespective of blood pressure threshold for initiation of drug therapy, the target BP is minimally < 130/80 mm Hg in most. However, target BP is < 130 systolic amongst those 65 and older as the committee made no recommendation for a DBP target. Treatment should be initiated with two drugs having complementary mechanisms of action when blood pressure is > 20/10 mm Hg above goal.

### Barriers to achieving blood pressure treatment targets in elderly hypertensive individuals [^111V9hnP]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

High blood pressure (BP) is highly prevalent among the elderly, and even with pharmacological therapy BP is difficult to control to guideline recommended levels. Although poor compliance to therapy is associated with less BP control, little is known regarding other barriers to attaining on-treatment target BP. This study examined factors associated with achieving on-treatment target BP in 6010 hypertensive participants aged 65–84 years from the Second Australian National Blood Pressure study. Participants were followed for a median of 4.1 years, with BP monitored every 6 months. 'Target BP' was defined as a reduction of systolic/diastolic BP of at least 20/10 mm Hg and BP < 160/90 mm Hg from randomization in two consecutive follow-up visits. Cox regression was used to identify factors associated with achieving target BP from a number of baseline and in-study factors. Mean BP at randomization was 168/91 mm Hg and patients had a median of 9 (range: 2–20) study visits. Target BP was achieved in 50% of patients. Demographic factors associated with achieving target BP were male gender, living in a regional area; and clinical factors included history of antihypertensive therapy, increased plasma creatinine, lower pretreatment pulse pressure and in-study use of multiple BP-lowering drugs. Those aged > 80 years and seeking care from multiple doctors (hazard ratio 0.40, 95% confidence interval 0.36–0.45, P < 0.001) were less likely to achieve target BP. These findings identify clinical markers that can be targeted for intervention, but also demographic factors related to service delivery, which may provide further opportunity for achieving better BP control in hypertensive elderly.

7 CONCLUSION

As Americans are living longer, there will be an increasing burden of HTN in the growing population of elderly patients. While lifestyle changes have the potential to mitigate this, adoption of healthy practices have been lagging in the US population. Education and awareness programs in community centers, place of worship (temples, churches, synagogues and mosques), and businesses, such as the barber shop initiatives will continue to have impact. Screening for blood pressure elevation, improving access to care, and adoption of guideline driven management are keys to reducing the impact of HTN in our elderly patients. Further research is needed in this population, since most clinical trials include a small proportion of persons over age 85 years old. Such trial can help solidify the current recommendations to use > 130/80 after lifestyle intervention as the threshold for initiation of therapy and < 130/80 at the target of therapy.

Blood pressure threshold for initiating treatment in aged subjects.

As far as a BP threshold for treatment initiation is concerned, the European Society of Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology (ESH/ESC) guidelines recommend BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg as values at which the antihypertensive pharmacological approach has to be started in older hypertensives, resembling the recommended threshold in young and middle-age patients, as emphasized in the reappraisal guidelines document recently issued by the ESH. However, this recommendation is not supported by any trial result. There have been no clinical studies published with the aim of determining the effects of antihypertensive treatment on morbidity and mortality in elderly patients with systolic and diastolic BP values ranging from 140 to 160 mmHg and 90 to 95 mmHg, respectively. In the absence of any trial-based evidence, the decision to initiate a BP-lowering treatment in the aged hypertensive patients showing a grade 1 hypertensive state is based on the detection of one or more of the following conditions: associated clinical conditions that increase "per se" total CV risk, such as obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome; target organ damage at the level of the heart, large vessels (particularly carotid arteries), and kidney (including microalbuminuria); previous CV events (myocardial infarction, stroke) or concomitant CVD (angina, heart failure, renal insufficiency, etc.); and a high or a very high CV risk profile.

Importance

The appropriate treatment target for systolic blood pressure (SBP) in older patients with hypertension remains uncertain.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of intensive (< 120 mm Hg) compared with standard (< 140 mm Hg) SBP targets in persons aged 75 years or older with hypertension but without diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A multicenter, randomized clinical trial of patients aged 75 years or older who participated in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT). Recruitment began on October 20, 2010, and follow-up ended on August 20, 2015.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to an SBP target of less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment group, n = 1317) or an SBP target of less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment group, n = 1319).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary cardiovascular disease outcome was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome not resulting in a myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal acute decompensated heart failure, and death from cardiovascular causes. All-cause mortality was a secondary outcome.

Results

Among 2636 participants (mean age, 79.9 years; 37.9% women), 2510 (95.2%) provided complete follow-up data. At a median follow-up of 3.14 years, there was a significantly lower rate of the primary composite outcome (102 events in the intensive treatment group vs 148 events in the standard treatment group; hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 [95% CI, 0.51–0.85]) and all-cause mortality (73 deaths vs 107 deaths, respectively; HR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.49–0.91]). The overall rate of serious adverse events was not different between treatment groups (48.4% in the intensive treatment group vs 48.3% in the standard treatment group; HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.89–1.11]). Absolute rates of hypotension were 2.4% in the intensive treatment group vs 1.4% in the standard treatment group (HR, 1.71 [95% CI, 0.97–3.09]), 3.0% vs 2.4%, respectively, for syncope (HR, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.76–2.00]), 4.0% vs 2.7% for electrolyte abnormalities (HR, 1.51 [95% CI, 0.99–2.33]), 5.5% vs 4.0% for acute kidney injury (HR, 1.41 [95% CI, 0.98–2.04]), and 4.9% vs 5.5% for injurious falls (HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.65–1.29]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among ambulatory adults aged 75 years or older, treating to an SBP target of less than 120 mm Hg compared with an SBP target of less than 140 mm Hg resulted in significantly lower rates of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and death from any cause.

### Age-stratified and blood-pressure-stratified effects of blood-pressure-lowering pharmacotherapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and death: an individual participant-level data meta-analysis [^111FqMUf]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Health-related quality of life and prevention of harms might be of equal or even greater importance to older people than prevention of fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular events. However, to our knowledge, no randomised comparisons exist to suggest that a fixed level of blood pressure reduction in older individuals causes more harm than benefit in older people. For instance, in a subgroup analysis of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), the total serious adverse event rates were similar in the two study groups. Several other age-stratified analyses of RCTs and their meta-analyses have also shown no worsening in functional status, physical wellbeing, or quality of life in older people. Concerns about worsening cognitive function in older people and low blood pressure have been raised in some observational studies but are likely to be due to reverse causationand have not been substantiated in a randomised trial thus far. Planned BPLTTC projects are investigating some of those questions in greater detail.

Our study represents the most detailed analysis of blood-pressure-lowering treatment effect by age and blood pressure to date. However, our study has several limitations, which should be taken into account when interpreting our results. Our effect estimates for people aged 85 years and older at randomisation (mean age 90 years at the end of the trial) were uncertain because of the comparatively smaller number of participants developing the main outcome compared with other age groups in the study. Relatedly, because of the typically restricted eligibility criteria of RCTs, other groups such as those with a high multimorbidity and polypharmacy burden, frail individuals, and individuals living in institutions have been under-represented. The generalisability of the findings to these highly relevant and growing patient groups remains uncertain. Future studies such as ATEMPT (the Anti-hypertensive Treatment Evaluation in Multimorbid and Polymedicated patients Trial; ISRCTN17647940) shall address those limitations and investigate treatment effects on several additional patient-important outcomes. We acknowledge that clinical decisions cannot be deferred until such evidence emerges. However, in the absence of any strong evidence for excess harms from randomised studies, we believe that it is appropriate for patients who are on blood-pressure-lowering pharmacotherapy to continue receiving such treatment if well-tolerated and when prevention of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events remains of importance.

For older adults (≥ 65 years of age) with hypertension and a high burden of comorbidity and limited life expectancy, using clinical judgment, patient preference, and a team-based approach to assess risk/benefit is reasonable for decisions on BP-lowering intensity and antihypertensive drug choice (COR IIa, LOE C-EO).

Office BP Treatment Targets

Both the ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH recommend lower BP treatment targets compared with the goals advised in previous guidelines. The ACC/AHA recommends SBP/DBP < 130/80 mm Hg as a general treatment target, if tolerated (Tables 6–8). For older adults (≥ 65 years), who are noninstitutionalized, ambulatory, and community dwelling, the target is SBP < 130 mm Hg, if tolerated. For older adults with a high burden of comorbidity and limited life expectancy, treatment decisions should be based on clinical judgment, patient preference, and a team-based assessment of risk/benefit. The ESC/ESH recommends target ranges but recognizes that the optimal and tolerated targets for individuals will differ. The initial SBP/DBP target is < 140/90 mm Hg for all adults with hypertension. Provided the treatment is well tolerated, targeting to 130/80 mm Hg is recommended, with subsequent efforts to achieve a lower BP in those 18 to 65 years of age. An exception to the general rule is that the SBP target in adults with hypertension and CKD should be < 140 to 130 mm Hg. The ESC/ESH advises against specifically targeting SBP to < 120 mm Hg for adults, but acknowledges that this may be achieved in some treated patients without adverse effects. A key emphasis, especially in older and frailer patients, is to tailor the treatment to achieve the best BP possible within the target range, while monitoring for adverse effects. The optimal DBP target is defined as 70 to 79 mm Hg for all patients, but the emphasis is on controlling SBP, even when DBP is below these levels, provided the treatment is tolerated.

### Do we AGREE on the targets of antihypertensive drug treatment in older adults: a systematic review of guidelines on primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases [^115hFcMn]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The subject of antihypertensive drug treatment in older adults is well addressed in current international guidelines for primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. The ongoing scientific and clinical debate concerning how low the target of treatment needs to be, however, is reflected in an inconsistency of recommendations across guidelines especially for adults aged 80 years and older. This inconsistency is independent of methodological quality, originating continent, intended users and supporting evidence of the guideline.

Clinical practice guidelines are developed to standardize treatment, but currently challenge physicians to exercise very active reading and clinical judgement in a complex medical context, especially when treating a frail older adult. In order to accommodate clinical judgement in geriatric cardiovascular prevention, it would be helpful if guidelines defined targets more on base of biological aspects of ageing such as frailty rather than merely on base of chronological age alone. Research that incorporates this heterogeneity in older persons will possibly lead to more uniform guidelines on hypertension management in old age.

### The impact of JNC-VI guidelines on treatment recommendations in the US population [^115XhywC]. Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Using epidemiological and clinical trial evidence, the sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-VI) updated previous guidelines to suggest that in addition to blood pressure, decisions on initial treatment should emphasize absolute cardiovascular disease risk. We estimated the impact of using cardiovascular disease risk on treatment recommendations for the US population using data from 16 527 participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In the US population ≥ 20 years of age, 36% (62 million) had high-normal blood pressure or greater (systolic/diastolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mm Hg/ ≥ 85 mm Hg) or were taking antihypertensive medication. Of this population, 5.1% (3.2 million) were stratified into risk group A (no cardiovascular disease risk factors or prevalent cardiovascular disease), 66.3% (41.4 million) into risk group B (≥ 1 major risk factor), and 28.6% (17.9 million) into risk group C (diabetes mellitus, clinical cardiovascular disease, target organ damage). Also, 26% of this group (16.2 million) had high-normal blood pressure and were in risk groups A or B, a context in which vigorous lifestyle modification is recommended in the JNC-VI guidelines. Additionally, 11% (7.0 million) had high-normal blood pressure (systolic/diastolic, 130 to 139 mm Hg/85 to 89 mm Hg, respectively) or stage-1 hypertension (140 to 159 mm Hg/90 to 99 mm Hg), and at least 1 factor, placing them in risk group C, but they were not currently on antihypertensive medication. JNC-VI, but not previous JNC guidelines, specifically recommends drug therapy as initial treatment for these patients. We conclude that JNC-VI refines cardiovascular risk and enfranchises more Americans to undertake more aggressive risk reduction maneuvers.

American College of Physicians (ACP) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) guideline correction — Recommendation 3 now states that ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians consider initiating or intensifying pharmacologic treatment in some adults aged 60 years or older at high cardiovascular risk, based on individualized assessment, to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg to reduce the risk for stroke or cardiac events; accompanying text notes that an SBP target of less than 140 mm Hg is a reasonable goal for some patients with increased cardiovascular risk, that pooled results of all studies showed no statistically significant reductions in mortality, cardiac events, or stroke, but that a single large, high quality study (SPRINT) found benefits across all outcomes in high risk individuals without diabetes, and that target selection depends on comorbidity, treatment burden, adverse event risk, and cost.

Blood pressure control in healthy older subjects

Meta-analyses of data collected over the past 20 years from several randomized clinical trials have conclusively shown that antihypertensive drugs are effective in reducing fatal and nonfatal CV events in hypertensive patients of all ages including the elderly. The beneficial effects of treatment, particularly on CV morbidity, have recently been documented also in patients ≥ 80 years of age recruited for the HYpertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET) and in the1-year open-label treatment extension substudy of the same trial. The benefits of treatment were detectable with the different drug classes recommended by the latest guidelines for the management of hypertension in the general population and in the elderly as well. These benefits were detectable in both systodiastolic and isolated systolic hypertensive states, i.e. in a high cardiovascular risk condition typical of elderly people characterized by an elevated pulse pressure value. We can conclude that the BP-lowering effects of antihypertensive treatment are associated with a reduction in CV events in aged hypertensive patients as well. These beneficial effects can be detected independently for both of the classes of drug(s) used to reduce BP, and they are recommended for the systolic or systodiastolic type of elevated BP.

Despite the evidence collected over the years on the beneficial effects of high BP treatment in the old population, two major issues related to the BP-lowering intervention in the old and very old hypertensive patients are still unresolved. The first issue is the lower limit for initiating antihypertensive therapy and the second issue is defining the BP goal to be achieved during treatment. These two issues will be separately addressed in the following paragraphs.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older to higher versus lower blood pressure targets: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians [^112JCKBz]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) jointly developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations based on the benefits and harms of higher versus lower blood pressure targets for the treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older.

Methods

This guideline is based on a systematic review of published randomized, controlled trials for primary outcomes and observational studies for harms only (identified through EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, and ClinicalTrials.gov), from database inception through January 2015. The MEDLINE search was updated through September 2016. Evaluated outcomes included all-cause mortality, morbidity and mortality related to stroke, major cardiac events (fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death), and harms. This guideline grades the evidence and recommendations using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) method.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes all adults aged 60 years or older with hypertension.

Recommendation 1

ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians initiate treatment in adults aged 60 years or older with systolic blood pressure persistently at or above 150 mm Hg to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less than 150 mm Hg to reduce the risk for mortality, stroke, and cardiac events. (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians select the treatment goals for adults aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion of the benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets with the patient.

Recommendation 2

ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians consider initiating or intensifying pharmacologic treatment in adults aged 60 years or older with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg to reduce the risk for recurrent stroke. (Grade: weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians select the treatment goals for adults aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion of the benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets with the patient.

Recommendation 3

ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians consider initiating or intensifying pharmacologic treatment in some adults aged 60 years or older at high cardiovascular risk, based on individualized assessment, to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg to reduce the risk for stroke or cardiac events. (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians select the treatment goals for adults aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion of the benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets with the patient.

Quality assessment

The quality appraisal by AGREE domain scores for each individual guideline is provided in Appendix 3, available in Age and Ageing online. The domains ' Scope and Purpose' and ' Clarity of Presentation' were assigned the highest overall median scores of 68% (range 28–100%) and 86% (range 42–97%) respectively. The domain ' Editorial Independence' was assigned the lowest median score of 33% (range 0–100%). The domains ' Rigor of Development' and ' Applicability', both scoring 34%, were as well generally underreported.

Five guidelines scored ≥ 50% on all six domains and were overall of very good quality. The weighted mean domain score of an additional nine guidelines was ≥ 50%. Those 14 guidelines together were labelled as of moderate-to-high quality. An overview of the advised target values of antihypertensive drug therapy in context of chronological age in these 14 guidelines is summarized in Figure 2a. The advised targets of the other 20 guidelines are displayed in Figure 2b. While approximately more than 60% of the guidelines in Figure 2b suggest to target < 140 and < 150 mmHg in older adults respectively below and above the age of 80 years, the guidelines of moderate-to-high quality are less consistent. In this subset of rigorously developed guidelines, targets of < 150 mmHg (43%), < 140 mmHg (36%), < 130 mmHg (7%), and, < 120 mmHg (14%) were advised in the oldest old.

Continent of origin and intended users

An overview of the advised target values of SBP according to the continent of origin of the corresponding guideline is summarized in Figure 3(1). When grouped per continent of origin, all guidelines showed variation in the advised targets for adults above the age of 80 years, most predominant in North American guidelines. The same variation was seen when categorized by intended users (Figure 3(2)).

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension guidelines — gaps in evidence delineate research priorities across screening, measurement, cardiovascular (CV) risk prediction, and treatment questions. The page lists unresolved questions including the optimal population screening programme for detecting hypertension; the optimal method to measure blood pressure (BP) in atrial fibrillation (AF); the incremental benefit for CV risk prediction of adding out-of-office BP using home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to office BP measurement; the incremental benefit, over the Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) system, of measures of hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD) in reclassifying CV risk; the optimal BP treatment targets according to HBPM and ABPM; the outcome benefits associated with antihypertensive treatment in patients with resistant hypertension; the benefits of BP treatment for patients with BP in the high–normal range; what baseline level of CV risk predicts treatment benefit; the need for more data on the benefits of BP treatment in the very elderly and the influence of frailty; and outcome-based comparison between treatments guided by BP control and by HMOD reductions, especially in younger patients.

Pharmacological Treatment

Most patients with hypertension in Canada were prescribed an antihypertensive medication (80.5%; 95% CI, 80.3%-80.7%), compared with only half of participants defined by the ACC/AHA guidelines (51.0%; 95% CI, 50.8%-51.2%) (Table 2). Older adults (age ≥ 65 years) with hypertension, when compared with younger individuals (age 18–64 years), were more likely to receive prescriptions for antihypertensive drugs (82.8%; 95% CI, 82.5%-83.0% vs 77.1%; 95% CI, 76.7%-77.4%, respectively). Within the high-risk group, nearly all (92.9%; 95% CI, 92.7%-93.1%) Canadian patients with an existing diagnosis of hypertension received a prescription for an antihypertensive medication, but the proportion of treated patients decreased to 85.8% (95% CI, 85.5%-86.0%) when the ACC/AHA diagnostic and treatment thresholds were applied.

Blood Pressure Control

Overall, the proportion of patients achieving BP targets was higher in the Canadian cohort (58.2%; 95% CI, 57.9%-58.4%) than in the ACC/AHA cohort (41.1%; 95% CI, 41.0%-41.3%) (Table 2). Among those prescribed an antihypertensive medication, BP control rates remained higher in the Canadian cohort (59.5%; 95% CI, 59.2%-59.8%) compared with the ACC/AHA group (43.5%; 95% CI, 43.2%-43.7%). Less than 10% of patients who were reclassified as having high BP with the ACC/AHA guidelines but were not previously considered to have hypertension had BP levels above the suggested ACC/AHA treatment targets, and thus potentially eligible for treatment initiation or intensification. Younger adults (age 18–64 years) were slightly more likely to achieve target BP control compared with those older than 65 years. In high-risk individuals, BP control was achieved by a larger proportion of patients in the Canadian group (60.1%; 95% CI, 59.8%-60.5%) compared with the ACC/AHA (42.0%; 95% CI, 41.7%-42.4%).

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older to higher versus lower blood pressure targets: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians [^116WhaLQ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Benefits of treating higher versus lower BP targets in older adults indicate that across all trials treating high BP in older adults was beneficial, but most evidence came from patients with moderate or severe hypertension (SBP > 160 mm Hg) at baseline who with treatment achieved SBP targets greater than 140 mm Hg; among those with baseline SBP of 160 mm Hg or greater who achieved a target SBP less than 150 mm Hg, moderate-quality evidence showed a reduction in all-cause mortality, although not quite statistically significant (relative risk [RR], 0.93 [95% CI, 0.85 to 1.00]; absolute risk reduction [ARR], 1.13), with high-quality evidence showing reductions in stroke (RR, 0.77 [CI, 0.64 to 0.91]; ARR, 0.92) and cardiac events (RR, 0.83 [CI, 0.71 to 0.96]; ARR, 0.72); in studies with lower SBP targets (< 140 mm Hg), low-quality evidence showed no statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality (RR, 0.93 [CI, 0.75 to 1.14]; ARR, 0.21), cardiac events (RR, 0.91 [CI, 0.77 to 1.08]; ARR, 0.35), or stroke (RR, 0.86 [CI, 0.64 to 1.01]; ARR, 0.19) compared with higher BP targets, noting many studies did not achieve the targeted BP and had little difference between intensive treatment and control groups.

### 2023 ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension the task force for the management of arterial hypertension of the European Society of Hypertension: endorsed by the international society of hypertension (ISH) and the European renal association (ERA) [^1169vq6x]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to elderly patients, ESH 2023 guidelines recommend to lower SBP to 140–150 mmHg as the primary goal of treatment in 65–79 years old patients with isolated systolic HTN.
Consider lowering office SBP to 130–139 mmHg if well tolerated, albeit cautiously if DBP is already < 70 mmHg.
Consider using all major drug classes in older patients with isolated systolic HTN because of the frequent coexistence of compelling indications and the need for combination therapy to control SBP.
Initiate treatment with a two-drug combination in most non-frail older patients with isolated systolic HTN.

### Hypertension in adults over 60… [^113MDY5g]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

The guideline, Treatment of Hypertension in Adults Over Age 60 to Higher vs. Lower Targets, was developed by the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians. The AAFP continues its endorsement of the JNC8 guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults. These recommendations are consistent with JNC8 and should be used to augment its guidance.

### Hypertension-clinical practice guideline… [^1143A9Rk]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

The 2022 Blood Pressure Targets in Adults With Hypertension: A Clinical Practice Guideline From the AAFP, was developed by the American Academy of Family Physicians and approved by the Board of Directors in July 2022. The guideline was then published in the American Family Physician. These recommendations are provided only as assistance for physicians making clinical decisions regarding the care of their patients. As such, they cannot substitute for the individual judgment brought to each clinical situation by the patient's family physician. As with all clinical reference resources, they reflect the best understanding of the science of medicine at the time of publication, but they should be used with the clear understanding that continued research may result in new knowledge and recommendations. These recommendations are only one element in the complex process of improving the health of America. To be effective, the recommendations must be implemented.

### Blood pressure targets in adults with hypertension… [^116UsXhy]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 1: The American Academy of Family Physicians strongly recommends clinicians treat adults who have hypertension to a standard blood pressure target to reduce the risk of all cause and cardiovascular mortality. Treating to a lower blood pressure target did not provide additional benefit at preventing mortality; however, a lower blood pressure target could be considered based on clinical assessment and patient preferences and values. Recommendation 2: The AAFP recommends clinicians consider treating adults who have hypertension to a lower blood pressure target to reduce risk of myocardial infarction.

Although treatment to a standard blood pressure target reduced the risk of myocardial infarction, there was a small additional benefit observed with a lower blood pressure target. There was no observed additional benefit in preventing stroke with the lower blood pressure target. Recommendations RECOMMENDATION 1 The AAFP strongly recommends clinicians treat adults who have hypertension to a standard blood pressure target to reduce the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Treating to a lower blood pressure target does not provide additional benefit at preventing mortality; however, a lower blood pressure target could be considered based on patient preferences and values.

RECOMMENDATION 2 The AAFP recommends clinicians consider treating adults who have hypertension to a lower blood pressure target to reduce risk of myocardial infarction. Although treatment to a standard blood pressure target reduced the risk of myocardial infarction, there was a small additional benefit observed with a lower blood pressure target. There was no observed additional benefit in preventing stroke with the lower blood pressure target. Moderate-quality evidence showed treating adults who have hypertension to a lower blood pressure target further reduced the risk of myocardial infarction. In the included systematic review, eight RCTs evaluated the incidence of myocardial infarction in patients treated with a lower target compared with those with a standard target.
