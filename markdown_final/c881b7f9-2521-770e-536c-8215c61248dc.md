## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option is a direct result of an electoral system that features single-member districts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanics of single-member district plurality systems and their incentives. Then, I should verify how those incentives shape party systems, especially Duverger's Law. Next, I will examine each answer choice against that theoretical and empirical backdrop. Finally, I will confirm which option is most directly supported and why the others are weaker or incorrect, anchoring on comparative political science evidence.

> Let me first confirm the core mechanism. In single-member district plurality systems, only one winner per district takes office, so votes for smaller parties are frequently "wasted", creating strong incentives for voters to coalesce around viable major-party candidates and for elites to coordinate on two big tents. This is the classic Duverger's Law prediction of a two-party equilibrium, reinforced by strategic voting and elite coordination, not by any formal prohibition on third parties.

> Wait, let me verify the empirical signal in the provided sources. The Nature Communications analysis of climate change opinions explicitly notes that the U.S. two-party system "petrifies ideological boundaries" and increases partisanship, contrasting with Germany's multi-party system; this aligns with the expectation that single-member districts entrench two dominant parties, whereas proportional systems permit multiparty competition and more fluid coalitions [^114XSe7A].

> I will now examine Option A: "Only two major parties can successfully be supported". Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — this sounds absolute, but the correct interpretation is that such systems structurally favor two major parties and create high barriers for third parties, not that third parties are legally barred. The comparative evidence shows that countries with single-member districts (e.g., the U.S.) exhibit durable two-party dominance, whereas countries with proportional representation (e.g. Germany) sustain multiple viable parties, which supports the causal link between electoral rules and party-system structure [^notfound].

> Next, Option B claims national campaigns can be conducted without great expense. Hmm, wait a minute — this contradicts what we know about U.S. campaigns, where costs are famously high. I should double-check: there is no evidence in the supplied materials that single-member districts reduce campaign costs; in fact, the need to win outright in each district can drive intensive, expensive ground games and advertising, so this option is not supported and seems implausible on its face [^notfound].

> Option C asserts third parties can be as successful as the two major parties. I need to ensure I'm not overstating the barrier. While third parties can exist and occasionally win local or symbolic victories, the wasted-vote logic and coordination dynamics in single-member districts make sustained, nationwide success extremely unlikely compared with major parties; the comparative contrast with proportional systems again underscores that this claim is inconsistent with the evidence base provided [^notfound].

> Option D says each party tends to focus on a single issue. Hold on, I should verify whether electoral structure dictates issue scope. There is no evidence here that single-member districts force parties to narrow to one issue; rather, major parties in such systems typically build broad coalitions to secure pluralities across diverse districts, which argues against a single-issue tendency as a direct consequence of district magnitude [^notfound].

> Putting this together, the most defensible answer is Option A, with the caveat that "only" should be read as a structural tendency rather than a legal impossibility. The direct result of single-member districts, via Duvergerian incentives and strategic voting, is a durable two-party dominant system in which third parties face steep barriers to success, a pattern empirically contrasted with proportional systems that sustain multiparty competition [^114XSe7A] [^116haZgu].

---

The correct answer is **A. Only two major parties can successfully be supported**. Single-member districts create a winner-take-all dynamic that discourages third-party voting and favors two dominant parties, a pattern known as Duverger's Law [^notfound]. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because single-member districts **do not reduce campaign costs**, **do not allow third parties to thrive**, and **do not force parties to focus on a single issue**.

---

## Analysis of answer choices

### Option A: Only two major parties can successfully be supported

This is correct. Single-member districts produce a **winner-take-all** system in which only the candidate with the most votes wins, so voters often avoid "wasting" votes on third parties and instead support one of the two major parties. This dynamic is well described by Duverger's Law, which predicts that such systems tend to produce two-party dominance [^notfound].

---

### Option B: National campaigns can be conducted without incurring great expense

This is incorrect. Single-member districts **do not inherently reduce campaign costs**; in fact, candidates must campaign district-by-district, which can increase overall expenses. Campaign costs are driven by factors such as media markets, competition, and fundraising, not by the districting system itself.

---

### Option C: Third parties can be as successful as the two major political parties

This is incorrect. Single-member districts **create high barriers for third parties** because they rarely win seats without a plurality in any district. This structural disadvantage limits third-party representation and success compared with proportional systems, where smaller parties can gain seats with a smaller share of the vote.

---

### Option D: Each political party tends to focus its campaign on a single issue

This is incorrect. Parties in single-member districts **typically adopt broad platforms** to appeal to diverse constituencies and secure a plurality. There is no structural incentive to limit campaigns to a single issue; in fact, broad appeals are usually more effective for winning elections.

---

## Conclusion

Single-member districts **directly lead to two-party dominance** by discouraging third-party support through a winner-take-all mechanism, making Option A the correct answer.

Additional analyses

One concern with focusing on total spending among deceased inpatients is that spending by physicians could affect a patient's survival in hospital. Restricting analysis to only those patients who died in hospital could miss patients whose lives were saved by any differences in spending between physicians of varying political affiliation. We therefore analyzed differences in adjusted 30 day mortality from date of hospital admission, by physician political affiliation. Specifically, we estimated analogous logistic models to those described above in which the outcome variable was mortality within 30 days of hospital admission and the main exposure of interest was physician political affiliation. We also replicated the primary spending analysis and stratified expected mortality by quarters, rather than observed mortality.

Although our main analysis classified physicians as Democrats, Republicans, or non-donors depending on which party received more contributions during the study, physicians' preferences on end of life care could be non-linearly related to political contributions — for example, perhaps only the most extreme physician donors differ in their recommendations on end of life care. We therefore also separated physicians' political contributions into seven categories: three categories of political contributions for each party (low, medium, or high donors to a given party, based on how much was contributed within the party) and a set of non-donor physicians.

### Personalizing politics: a congruency model of political preference [^112xT41t]. The American Psychologist (2004). Low credibility.

Modern politics become personalized as individual characteristics of voters and candidates assume greater importance in political discourse. Although personalities of candidates capture center stage and become the focus of voters' preferences, individual characteristics of voters, such as their traits and values, become decisive for political choice. The authors' findings reveal that people vote for candidates whose personality traits are in accordance with the ideology of their preferred political party. They also select politicians whose traits match their own traits. Moreover, voters' traits match their own values. The authors outline a congruency model of political preference that highlights the interacting congruencies among voters' self-reported traits and values, voters' perceptions of leaders' personalities, politicians' self-reported traits, and programs of favored political coalitions.

### Reputations for treatment of outgroup members can prevent the emergence of political segregation in cooperative networks [^115nJwxP]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

More importantly for current purposes, different types of reputational information — e.g. whether and how reputations track behavior toward outgroup members (e.g. people from an opposing political party) versus only ingroup members (e.g. people from one's own political party) — may not only give rise to different patterns of cooperation with ingroup versus outgroup members. Variations in reputation systems may also influence the formation of ties within versus between social categories. This may lead to network-level segregation based on politics and could help drive political polarization like we see in the contemporary US, where Americans report being less likely to have social ties that span across party lines.

Here we embed participants in dynamic networks where each tie represents an opportunity to interact in a dyadic prisoners' dilemma situation, i.e. where there is a conflict between individual and collective interest. We experimentally vary whether participants have access to others' political identities and the types of reputations people can develop, e.g. whether a person's reputation distinguishes how they treat members of one group versus another. Our first aim was to assess how these manipulations impact both overall cooperation and cooperation with participants from opposing political parties, particularly in the early stages of interaction, i.e. before network dynamics produce high levels of cooperation across conditions. Our second aim was to assess how variation in the types of reputations participants could develop — and the resulting early cooperation patterns — lead to different tendencies to form and break ties to others from one's own versus the opposing political party. We expected these differences would give rise to different levels of segregation based on political identities, rather than cooperative tendencies. Although political identity is our test case, following recent work on politics as a social identity, our findings should contribute to a more general understanding of the effects of reputation systems on cooperation and network-level segregation based on a range of social identities.

### Political party affiliation, political ideology and mortality [^117JJ6qv]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Ecological and cross-sectional studies have indicated that conservative political ideology is associated with better health. Longitudinal analyses of mortality are needed because subjective assessments of ideology may confound subjective assessments of health, particularly in cross-sectional analyses.

Methods

Data were derived from the 2008 General Social Survey-National Death Index data set. Cox proportional analysis models were used to determine whether political party affiliation or political ideology was associated with time to death. Also, we attempted to identify whether self-reported happiness and self-rated health acted as mediators between political beliefs and time to death.

Results

In this analysis of 32,830 participants and a total follow-up time of 498,845 person-years, we find that political party affiliation and political ideology are associated with mortality. However, with the exception of independents (adjusted HR (AHR) = 0.93, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.97), political party differences are explained by the participants' underlying sociodemographic characteristics. With respect to ideology, conservatives (AHR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.12) and moderates (AHR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.11) are at greater risk for mortality during follow-up than liberals.

Conclusions

Political party affiliation and political ideology appear to be different predictors of mortality.

### Political voting in the United Kingdom 2019 general election and risk of living with obesity in a nationally representative sample [^114w74sE]. International Journal of Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

The political party categories of interest at the 2019 UK general election were Conservative, Labour, and the Liberal Democrats as these typically share the largest proportion of electoral support in the UK. A small number of participants voted for other political parties (i.e. Scottish National Party, Brexit Party, Plaid Cymru, Green Party, UK Independent Party, British National Party, Democratic Unionist, Ulster Unionist, Sinn Féin, People Before Profit & Alliance). These were included in the statistical modelling as a combined group, and whilst it was important for these data to remain in the dataset for analysis purposes, their comparison with other political parties were not of interest and not reported. Analyses for the political party of participants' constituency Member of Parliament (MPs) and living with obesity outcomes compared participants who voted for the Conservative, Labour and the Scottish National (SNP) parties as there were more voters living in constituencies won by the SNP than for the Liberal Democrats Party, the Liberal Democrats Party being included in the combined group for this analysis.

### Zero-sum beliefs and the avoidance of political conversations [^117MnX1V]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Procedure

Participants were first asked to indicate, on a categorical variable, their political party affiliation, identifying the political party that they most closely support among the 13 different parties that participated in the 2022 elections to Israel's parliament (the "Knesset"; "Generally speaking, which of the following political parties do you support ?": Ha'Likkud, Ha'Avoda, Yesh Atid, HaZionot Ha'Datit, Meretz, Ra'am, Ha'Machane Ha'Mamlachti, Hadash-Ta'al, Shas, Ha'Bait Ha'Yehudi, Yahadut Ha'Torah, Balad, Israel Beitenu, and Other). They next completed, in random order, a six-item measure of zero-sum beliefs about politics (e.g. "When one political party gains it inevitably comes at another party's expense"; 1-Strongly disagree, 7-Strongly agree; α = 0.69), a Hebrew translation of the 18-item Receptiveness to Opposing Views scale (α = 0.82), a five-item measure of perceived conflict (e.g. "Talking about politics always creates harmful conflict between relatives"; 1-Strongly disagree, 7-Strongly agree; α = 0.94)and a four-item measure of their avoidance of political conversations with ideologically opposed others in the past month (e.g. "In the past month, I avoided talking about politics with family members with whom I disagree"; 1-Strongly disagree, 7-Strongly agree; α = 0.91) (see Supplementary Materials). Finally, participants reported their age, gender, religion, income, and whether they intend to vote in the upcoming elections (yes, no, or I have yet to decide). As reported below, we analyzed the data using a series of linear regression analyses examining the zero-order correlations between zero-sum beliefs and avoidance of political conversation, the effect of zero-sum beliefs on avoidance of political conversation when controlling for political party affiliation and its interaction with zero-sum beliefs, and a bootstrapped mediation analysis predicting conversation avoidance from zero-sum beliefs and the two potential mediators (perceived conflict and receptiveness to opposing views).

Political Participation Over the Lifespan

Political sociologists identify several strands of political participation. In general, political participation refers to the range of "activities by private citizens that are more or less directly aimed at influencing the selection of governmental personnel and/or the actions they take" (, p. 46). Earlier literature on the concept distinguished between institutionalized and noninstitutionalized modes of political participation. Institutionalized participation includes activity centered within the electoral system and established institutions. These activities function according to the rules of conduct in established state law. Examples include campaigning for electoral candidates, attending political party meetings, being a member of a political party, and working for political party candidates, among other activities. Noninstitutionalized participation consists of activities that challenge or defy institutions or the dominant culture. Activities reflecting noninstitutionalized participation include signing petitions, attending demonstrations, sit-ins, strike actions, and protesting, among others (it is important to note that noninstitutionalized forms of participation may or may not be legal, depending on the levels of freedom and civil liberties in a particular country). Some of these more confrontational forms of engagement can be classified as "risky", depending on the particular laws of a given country and its tolerance of oppositional action.

Scholars draw upon multiple theoretical explanations to account for why these varied dimensions of political participation would vary by age. According to the life-cycle model, advancing age leads to an accumulation of roles and resources that boost older people's stakes in the political process. The preservation of old-age entitlement programs, meanwhile, makes older voters an important constituency to be courted by political parties. Conversely, younger people tend to be more geographically mobile and less rooted in a community, less wealthy, and lacking the children (and grandchildren) whose future motivates political engagement. Another theoretical explanation centers on attitudes, particularly institutional trust, and cynicism. Younger people, for instance, are relatively unlikely to see the established political class — comprised disproportionately of older citizens — as trustworthy, responsive, and in touch with their needs. Parenthetically, we note that most empirical studies used to support these age-based theories rely on cross-sectional age comparisons, rather than within-person, longitudinal change (e.g.;). The same will be true for our analysis below.

### Reputations for treatment of outgroup members can prevent the emergence of political segregation in cooperative networks [^111NcN1g]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Reputation systems promote cooperation and tie formation in social networks. But how reputations affect cooperation and the evolution of networks is less clear when societies are characterized by fundamental, identity-based, social divisions like those centered on politics in the contemporary U.S. Using a large web-based experiment with participants (N = 1073) embedded in networks where each tie represents the opportunity to play a dyadic iterated prisoners' dilemma, we investigate how cooperation and network segregation varies with whether and how reputation systems track behavior toward members of the opposing political party (outgroup members). As predicted, when participants know others' political affiliation, early cooperation patterns show ingroup favoritism. As a result, networks become segregated based on politics. However, such ingroup favoritism and network-level political segregation is reduced in conditions in which participants know how others behave towards participants from both their own party and participants from the other party. These findings have implications for our understanding of reputation systems in polarized contexts.

Political parties and coalition centrality

Figure 1 shows the centrality of political parties as key nodes linking the Opponents and Proponents coalitions. Table 3 provides a count of each political party's total ties in the network, the number of these ties that exist within their primary cluster and a resultant measure that captures the ratio of cluster–external ties over all ties of a given actor ('external ratio').

Table 3
Political party ties.

The higher the external ratio score, the less central and embedded the party is within its respective coalition. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the Conservatives, Labour and Scottish Conservatives nodes operate across the coalitions, with links to both Proponents and Opponents, making their scores relatively high. In contrast, the SNP score of 0.00 reflects the centrality of the party within the Proponents coalition, with no links to organizations outside the coalition. Scottish Labour also has a low score, as it is embedded within the Opponents coalition. The Liberal Democrats and Scottish Liberal Democrats have low external ratio scores, indicating their embeddedness within the Proponents coalition. None of the political parties inhabit positions at the outer edges of the network or their respective coalitions; rather they are either central to the network or to a particular coalition. The high external ratio score of the UK Conservative Party reflects the number of individual politicians who voiced opposing perspectives on MUP in the media during the course of the debate. This can be further explored through visualization of the network at individual actor, rather than organizational, level.

### Political voting in the United Kingdom 2019 general election and risk of living with obesity in a nationally representative sample [^113zduyJ]. International Journal of Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

Implications

The clinical relevance of the ~1 unit difference in BMI score between voters for the Conservative Party and other political parties translates into 26 and 28 fewer cases of chronic disease per 1000 men and women, respectively. Campaigns may need to be targeted at supporters of the Conservative Party (and equivalent political parties in other countries), including during times of local and national elections. Results from this study raise an interesting and sensitive dilemma for health policy. It has been previously reported that individuals with conservative political views tend to have better health than those who hold more liberal attitudes because conservatives place greater value on personal responsibility, leading to greater adoption of health-related behaviours and better health outcomes. However, this study does not support this assertion as far as living with obesity is concerned. Additionally, Conservative Party voters have traditionally been more affluent, therefore may have better access to resources to manage their own weight, relative to voters for alternative political parties. That said, data from the 2019 general election indicated that the Conservative Party was now more popular with those who have low incomes, compared to those with high incomes. Moreover, for the first time in recorded history, the Conservative Party performed better in a general election than the Labour Party among voters who have low-income.

Political voting and BMI

Conservative Party voters had a significantly higher BMI score than Labour or Liberal Democrats voters with unadjusted means (SE) of 27.18 (0.22), 26.34 (0.31) and 25.73 (0.46) respectively and mean differences of 0.84 units (95% CI 0.08–1.59) and 1.45 (0.44–2.46). Multiple linear regression analyses demonstrated an adjusted mean difference in BMI of 0.88 units (95% CI: 0.16–1.61) between Conservative and Labour voters and 1.04 units (95% CI: 0.07–2.02) between Conservative and Liberal Democrats voters (Supplementary Table 1). A significant association was recorded between political affiliation and BMI category (underweight, healthy, people with overweight and people with obesity) in unadjusted and adjusted models. The odds of being in a higher BMI category was 1.32 (1.01–1.72) times greater for Conservative than Labour Party voters and 1.47 (1.07–2.02) times greater for Conservative than Liberal Democrats Party voters in adjusted models (Table 2).

Political party of constituency MPs and rates of people living with obesity

At the 2019 general election 57.9% (n = 1622) of participants lived in constituencies won by Conservative MPs, with 30.2% (n = 629) in Labour and 6.6% (n = 182) in Scottish National Party (SNP) won seats. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of people living with obesity, BMI category or BMI score between the political parties of participants' constituency MP (Conservative vs Labour, Conservative vs SNP, Labour vs SNP). See Tables 4, 5 and Supplementary Table 2.

### Politics and health outcomes [^114eL5Nv]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

The aim of this study was to examine the complex interactions between political traditions, policies, and public health outcomes, and to find out whether different political traditions have been associated with systematic patterns in population health over time. We analysed a number of political, economic, social, and health variables over a 50-year period, in a set of wealthy countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Our findings support the hypothesis that the political ideologies of governing parties affect some indicators of population health. Our analysis makes an empirical link between politics and policy, by showing that political parties with egalitarian ideologies tend to implement redistributive policies. An important finding of our research is that policies aimed at reducing social inequalities, such as welfare state and labour market policies, do seem to have a salutary effect on the selected health indicators, infant mortality and life expectancy at birth.

### Creating A nationwide nonpartisan initiative for family caregivers in political party platforms [^115bqSjt]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2017). Low credibility.

Policymakers have been slow to support family caregivers, and political agendas mostly fail to address the cost burdens, impact on employment and productivity, and other challenges in taking on long-term care tasks. This project set out to raise policymakers' awareness of family caregivers through proposals to Republican and Democratic party platforms during the 2016 political season. The Family Caregiver Platform Project (FCPP) reviewed the state party platform submission process for Democratic and Republican parties in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We built a website to make each process understandable by caregiver advocates. We designed model submissions to help volunteers tailor a proposal and recruited caregiver advocates participating in their state process. Finally, we mobilized a ground operation in many states and followed the progress of submissions in each state, as well as the formation of the national platforms. In 39 states, at least one party, Republican or Democrat, hosted a state party platform process. As of September 2016 FCPP volunteers submitted proposals to 29 state parties in 22 states. Family caregiver language was added to eight state party platforms, one state party resolution, two bipartisan legislative resolutions, and one national party platform. The FCPP generated a non-partisan grassroots effort to educate and motivate policymakers to address caregiving issues and solutions. Democratic party leaders provided more opportunities to connect with political leaders, with seven Democratic parties and one Republican party, addressing family caregiver issues in their party platforms.

### Political voting in the United Kingdom 2019 general election and risk of living with obesity in a nationally representative sample [^1139RiK3]. International Journal of Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Health policy and health disparities are increasingly prominent manifesto subjects for political parties around the world, with the number of people living with obesity and associated diseases often taking a central focus. Ample research has documented the seriousness of the high number of people living with overweight as a public health problem and examined differences in rates of people with obesity by characteristics such as self-reported gender, ethnicity and socio-economic status. Evidence also shows an association between doctors' political affiliation and their approach to the management of those living with obesity. However, little research has explored the relationship between rates of people with obesity and individual political affiliation. It is reasonable that the two may be correlated given prior evidence suggesting that voting on the political right is associated with higher rates of mortality and morbidity, than voting for the political left.

Evidence from the United States (US) has indicated that higher rates of people with obesity at the geographical county/state level (political environment) are associated with voting for the Republican Party presidential candidate. However, this relationship is yet to be studied at an individual voter level, which is better able to control for important confounding variables and allows for more granular investigation than geographical based analyses. Additionally, the previous US election studies have used simple dichotomous comparisons of people with obesity between Republican and Democrats governed counties, but political voting in other countries is more nuanced and diverse, with several parties receiving varying amounts of electoral support. Given that the political, economic and health care systems in the US are very different to those in other countries, including the United Kingdom (UK), research from the US may have limited generalisability.

Using individual level data from a nationally representative sample in the UK, we aimed to extend and improve upon previous research and answer two questions: what are the differences in rates of people living with obesity, BMI score and proportions of BMI category according to political voting at the UK 2019 general election across multiple political parties; and are people who live in constituencies won by Members of Parliament (MPs) from the Conservative Party at the UK 2019 general election more likely to be living with obesity than those who live in constituencies won by MPs from other UK political parties (which provides the closest analysis to prior US county/state level studies). The answer to these questions could offer helpful insights to direct public health strategies to reduce and/or prevent the number of people with obesity in the population.

Results

Participants and demographics

Of 4000 individuals invited to participate in the primary study, 2668 surveys were completed (67%). Of these, 95/2,668 (3.5%) were not eligible to vote in the 2019 UK general election and were excluded. Of the remaining 2573 participants, 33.3% of participants voted Conservative at the 2019 general election, 25.1% Labour, 10.6% Liberal Democrats, and 10.6% voted for a range of other political parties, with missing data for 20.7% (Table 1). A total of 14.1% (95% CI 12.2–16.3) of those reporting their political affiliation party had missing BMI data and there was no association between missing BMI and political affiliation, (weighted chisq, p = 0.46). A small percentage of the overall variation (R² ~ 7%) in BMI was explained by the models. No evidence of multicollinearity was observed (VIF < 2.5). The proportional odds assumption for the ordinal logistic regression analyses was met (Brant test, p > 0.05).

Political voting and likelihood of people living with obesity

Conservative Party voters were more likely to be people living with obesity than those who voted Labour (AdjOR: 1.42 (1.01–1.99)), or Liberal Democrats (AdjOR: 1.54 (1.00–2.37)) (Table 2). There were no significant differences in the odds of people living with obesity between Labour and Liberal Democrats voters (Table 3).

### The differential impact of climate interventions along the political divide in 60 countries [^115MZsKt]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

A major barrier to climate change mitigation is the political polarization of climate change beliefs. In a global experiment conducted in 60 countries (N = 51,224), we assess the differential impact of eleven climate interventions across the ideological divide. At baseline, we find political polarization of climate change beliefs and policy support globally, with people who reported being liberal believing and supporting climate policy more than those who reported being conservative (Cohen's d = 0.35 and 0.27, respectively). However, we find no evidence for a statistically significant difference between these groups in their engagement in a behavioral tree planting task. This conceptual-behavioral polarization incongruence results from self-identified conservatives acting despite not believing, rather than self-identified liberals not acting on their beliefs. We also find three interventions (emphasizing effective collective actions, writing a letter to a future generation member, and writing a letter from the future self) boost climate beliefs and policy support across the ideological spectrum, and one intervention (emphasizing scientific consensus) stimulates the climate action of people identifying as liberal. None of the interventions tested show evidence for a statistically significant boost in climate action for self-identified conservatives. We discuss implications for practitioners deploying targeted climate interventions.

### Impact of residential area characteristics and political group participation on depression among middle-aged and older adults: results of an 11-year longitudinal study [^116CVvwc]. Innovation in Aging (2024). Medium credibility.

Robustness Tests

For the robustness tests, we changed the cutoff score for the determinants of depression from 10 to 9 or 11. Moreover, we ran additional robustness tests that regarded the outcome variable as a continuous variable. Furthermore, participants were asked to provide additional information on whether they were members of learning clubs for older adults in the 1999 survey to code their type of social group engagement. The analysis also compared the percentage of votes won by the two major parties in the magistrate and mayor elections as an alternative measure of political competition. In other words, we added the percentage of votes won by party nominees and nonnominated aspirants for each party to indicate the political bases of the parties in each election. It is possible that notable electoral events during this period may have led to different conclusions regarding depression. If older adults who participate in political groups encounter an additional county magistrate or a mayoral by-election during the survey period, it may adversely affect their mental health. This is because additional electoral campaigns may increase out-party hostility. To exclude this alternative explanation, we included the interaction term "group participation × by-election" in the regression model. Finally, individuals who lived alone were excluded from the analysis. This was because they were both more prone to depression and more likely to engage in political groups without pressure from their family members of different ideological orientations. The analysis also excluded individuals who did not receive much social support because it is likely that older adults in political groups only were primarily those who were isolated from other forms of social interactions. To allege that political group engagement affects depression implies a spurious interrelationship. Social support was measured by asking, "How much do you feel that your family, relatives or friends care for you? Would you say a great deal, quite a bit, some, very little, or not at all?" Participants were perceived as receiving less social support if they chose the response "some, very little or not at all".

Characteristics of US Adults Who Reported Experiencing a Personal Overdose Loss and Association Between Characteristics and the Odds of Experiencing Personal Overdose Loss

Abbreviation: OR, odds ratio.

Figure 2.
Adjusted Estimated Probability of Experiencing Personal Overdose Loss by Political Party Affiliation Group

Model was adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics. The sample included 2287 individuals. Error bars represent 95% CIs.

The experience of any personal overdose loss was associated with greater odds of viewing addiction as an extremely or very important policy issue (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.37; 95% CI, 1.09–1.72) after adjusting for sociodemographic and geographic characteristics and political party affiliation. Full regression model results are displayed in eTable 2 in Supplement 1. In a sensitivity analysis testing the association between experiencing the death of a family member or close friend from drug overdose and views on addiction as a policy priority, the AOR was directionally consistent but no longer significant (1.26; 95% CI, 0.96–1.66) (eTable 3 in Supplement 1). Figure 3 displays the differences in the adjusted mean probabilities of viewing addiction as a policy priority among those with and without any personal overdose loss across respondents affiliated with different political parties. While larger proportions of those who had experienced a personal overdose loss viewed addiction as a policy priority within all political party groups, after adjusting for covariates, only among Democrats was there a significant association between experiencing a personal overdose loss and viewing addiction as a policy priority. Full regression model results are shown in eTable 4 in Supplement 1. However, no significant differences were found in the strength of this association across political party groups in the model when formally testing for differences in a regression model interacting personal overdose loss with political party affiliation (eTable 5 in Supplement 1).

### Zero-sum beliefs and the avoidance of political conversations [^117AddX5]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

We conducted Study 1 on October 31, 2022 — one day before Israel's 26th general elections for parliament (the "Knesset"). As noted above, we asked a sample of 403 eligible Israeli voters to report, in random order, their zero-sum beliefs about politics, whether they avoided discussing politics in the past month with ideologically opposed others, their general receptiveness to opposing views, and the extent to which they saw political conversations as conflict-prone. To begin, we examined whether zero-sum beliefs about politics statistically predicted Israeli voters' avoidance of political conversations in the month leading up to the elections. A linear regression controlling for participants' political party affiliation (i.e. which of the 13 parties running in the coming elections they supported) revealed a significant effect of zero-sum beliefs on the avoidance of political conversations (b = 0.23, 95% CI[0.01, 0.44], t (390) = 2.07, p = 0.039; Table 1, Model 1), although the zero-order correlation was only marginally significant (b = 0.21, 95% CI[−0.002, 0.42], t (403) = 1.95, p = 0.052). Importantly, a multiple regression analysis predicting conversation avoidance from zero-sum beliefs, political party affiliation, and their interaction did not find evidence of moderation by political party affiliation (Table 1, Model 2).

### Effects of focal brain damage on political behaviour across different political ideologies [^112dpwxF]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Intense political behavior is associated with brain regions involved in emotional and cognitive processing. However, it remains unclear if this neuroanatomy is causal, compensatory, or otherwise correlated. We employed lesion network mapping in a cross-sectional study of 124 male military Veterans with penetrating head trauma. 40–45 years after the injury, participants reported current political behavior and recollection of political behavior pre-injury. Using a normative connectome database (n = 1000), we mapped the circuitry functionally connected to lesions associated with changes in intensity of political involvement, ideological polarity, and party affiliation. No significant neuroanatomical circuit was associated with political ideology or party affiliation, but a distinct circuit was associated with intensity of political involvement. Political involvement was more intense after lesions connected to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior precuneus, in the full sample and in conservative-leaning participants. Political involvement was less intense after lesions connected to the amygdala and anterior temporal lobe, in the full sample and in liberal-leaning participants. These effects survived cross-validation in the full sample (p = 0.01) and in both conservative-leaning and liberal-leaning participants. These findings may inform cognitive mechanisms of political behavior as well as clinical assessment after brain lesions.

### What can one legitimately expect from a health system? A conceptual analysis and a proposal for research and action [^114FJrfw]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Participation and contestation across different political systems and realities

It is important to acknowledge that the above discussion around the establishment of legitimacy of expectations from a health system assumes and refers to an 'ideal' liberal democratic context where participation and contestation are seen as basic citizen rights and spaces for participation are many, are formalised, and tend to have constitutional bases. Political systems vary in their degree of political space for citizen participation and in the bases, processes, and platforms for citizens to participate in public discourse and policy. For instance, one can expect this to be different across single-party political systems and dictatorships as in parts of the Middle East, Latin American and parts of East Asia, to two-party or multi-party systems in liberal democracies in different parts of the world. Therefore, we argue that any scholarship that seeks to understand the nature of contestation and participation (including but not limited to health services-related matters) needs to explicitly take into account the political system context. While it is not within the scope of this analysis to examine how the processes of contestation and participation for establishing 'legitimate' expectations varies across political systems, we propose this as an area for future research. As an illustration, we look at the case of some countries in East Asia that have single-party polities. In these countries, understandings of citizen participation (and contestation) in the public sphere are influenced by the doctrine of 'Minben', a distinctly paternalistic idea in which the power of the government is based on responding to the welfare of common people and not in extending autonomy or participation in government. Within the Minben doctrine, the scope of citizens' political participation is limited to conveying their concerns to political leaders, with leaders having the power and freedom to deviate from public opinion when implementing policy. In this way, governmental legitimacy is established through the outcomes of policy, rather than through fair elections, such as in liberal democracies. It is therefore important to recognise that, in such polities, prevailing political traditions may constrain or even prevent the creation of 'invited spaces' for citizen participation and contestation in public policy. Moreover, peoples' expectations of their role could also be shaped by these cultural and political traditions, and they may in fact regard political leaders as, 'guardians of their interests' (p. 129). This, in turn, could influence their desire to contest and participate.

### Politically-targeted intergroup interventions promote social equality and engagement [^111PueRK]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Two: Social Media campaign Interventions

To assess the effectiveness of our interventions in real-life settings, we designed a real-world field study using social media campaigns based on the three interventions included in Study One. We collaborated with the "Israelis Talk" Facebook page, a platform dedicated to fostering discussions among diverse segments of Israeli society and certified by Meta to run ads on social and political issues. We shared the intervention video clips with the page admins, which granted us direct access to their ads manager, allowing us to examine the raw results of the intervention campaigns (unlike Study One, the field study was not included in the preregistration)

To gauge the effectiveness of each intervention across different political groups, we utilized Facebook's targeting capabilities to create three distinct target audiences. These audiences were formed based on three criteria:
Geographic location: Most of Israel's municipalities are politically homogenous in terms of the voting patterns of the residents in each municipality. We analyzed the results of the 2022 national electionand identified 150 neighborhoods and municipalities where the vast majority (over 78%) of votes went to either conservative, centrist, or liberal parties (about 50 municipalities per political camp). This geographical criterion promised that the majority of members in each target audience were affiliated with one of these political camps.
Lookalike audiences: The Meta ads platform can generate a target audience that is similar to the followers of specific Facebook pages in users' demographics and interests. In this case, we added an additional criterion to the geographical audiences based on similarities to users who follow pages associated with conservative, centrist, or liberal politicians and parties.
Exclusion criteria: We excluded from each target audience users that were included in either of the remaining target audiences, to ensure that users could belong to only one target audience, allowing us to differentiate between conservatives, centrists, and liberals. We excluded Arabic-speaking users to align with our decision to target the high-power group.

### Political voting in the United Kingdom 2019 general election and risk of living with obesity in a nationally representative sample [^115e9rpG]. International Journal of Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited evidence from the United States suggests that county/state rates of people with obesity are positively associated with voting for the Republican Party presidential candidate, although this question has not yet been studied at the individual level, and/or outside of the United States, where the health and political systems are very different in other countries.

Objectives

Using individual level data, assess differences in rates of people with obesity according to political voting in the United Kingdom 2019 general election, and examine whether people living in constituencies won by Members of Parliament (MPs) from the Conservative Party were more likely to be living with obesity than those living in constituencies won by MPs from other parties.

Methods

Data was obtained by the Ipsos KnowledgePanel where panellists are recruited via a random probability unclustered address-based sampling method. 4000/14,016 panellists were randomly invited to provide data on socio-demographics, health outcomes, voting behaviour and height/weight.

Results

2668/4000 (67%) of invitees provided data, 95/2668 (3.5%) were not eligible to vote, with the remaining 2573 (96.5%) included. Conservative Party voters were more likely to be living with obesity than those who voted Labour (OR:1.42 95% CI (1.01–1.99)) or Liberal Democrats (1.54 95% CI (1.00–2.37)). Conservative Party voters on average had significantly higher BMI scores than those voting Labour and Liberal Democrats; BMI mean difference 0.88 points (95% CI: 0.16–1.61) between Conservative and Labour voters, and 1.04 points (95% CI: 0.07–2.02) between Conservatives and Liberal Democrats voters. There was no evidence participants living in constituencies won by Conservative MPs were more likely to be living with obesity than constituencies won by other party MPs.

Conclusion

Governments and public health agencies may need to focus on the political affiliation of the public when developing strategies to reduce the number of people with obesity.

### A longitudinal, geographical, and descriptive analysis of political contributions of plastic surgeons [^114crPro]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Political contributions from healthcare providers are essential to shaping healthcare policy and allow physicians to expand their influence on a national level. Political Action Committees in particular provide a useful avenue for unifying contributions for the interest of a specific community. This study examined the geographical distribution, temporal pattern, and overall nature of the political contributions made by plastic surgeons.

Methods

The Federal Election Commission was analyzed for political contributions made by plastic surgeons from 2003 to 2021 using the search terms "plastic surgeon", "microsurgeon", and "craniofacial" as well as physician contributions to PlastyPAC. Contributions were categorized based on political parties (Democratic, Republican, and independent parties), and further analyzed based on state distribution and year of contribution. Spatial distribution data were then visualized using heatmaps for each state.

Results

The total sum of contributions between 2003 and 2021 from plastic surgeons was $5,306,605, with $1,737,178.51 for the Republican party, $962,773.26 for the Democratic party, and $2,604,149.86 for independent parties. Political funding of PlastyPAC consisted of 47.3% of the overall political contributions. There was no significant trend through the years in the overall contribution amount. The states with the most political contributions were California, New York, Florida, and Texas.

Conclusions

The temporal stagnation of total political contributions and decline in recent PlastyPAC funding from plastic surgeons support an increased political awareness for new plastic surgeons.

### Politically-targeted intergroup interventions promote social equality and engagement [^111QEdoJ]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

For example, the liberal target audience consisted of users who liked (or are similar to users who liked) Facebook pages associated with liberal parties and politicians and live in the 50 areas where liberals gained the most votes — while excluding users who were included in the two remaining target audiences.

Meta ads platform can estimate the budget size necessary to reach a certain number of users (i.e. the amount of money necessary to expose a certain number of users to the ad). We calculated the campaign budgets based on the minimum ad reach of 30,000 unique users, with budgets distributed unevenly due to variations in the sizes of political groups in Israel.

For each of the three target audiences, we executed creative A/B testing campaigns, comparing different Facebook ads targeting the same audience but with distinct ad content. These ads ran for the same duration and budget, and they were placed in identical media placements. All ads included an identical call to action ("An Equal Israel is a Better Israel > > Click and make a difference"), along with a message addressing the content of each intervention clip (for the Meta-Perception clip: "What do the Arab citizens really think about the Jewish citizens?"; for the Social Norms clip: "What do the Jewish citizens really think about the Arab citizens?"; For the malleability clip: "Groups and peoples change frequently, and this change occurs everywhere every day"). Figure 1 displays these ads in English. Upon the predefined completion date of September 8, 2023, Meta's ads manager provided a report detailing performance metrics for each ad within each target audience.

### Federal political contribution characteristics of radiation oncologists in the United States from 2003 to 2018 [^113ZzfJ9]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The health care industry has many stakeholders who seek relationships within government to ensure certain interests are considered in the legislative process. This study characterized the federal political contributions of US radiation oncologists (ROs).

Methods and Materials

Public finance data from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) containing self-identified ROs' contributions to a federal candidate or committee were obtained from 2003 to 2018. Contribution recipients were classified as a political action committee (PAC) or a presidential, Senate, or House candidate. Political parties of recipients were based on FEC designations. For PACs, political parties of recipients were based on spending patterns to political parties in each 2-year election cycle or, when unavailable, overall spending patterns of greater than 50% to 1 political party, as detailed by the Center for Responsive Politics. Data were analyzed temporally, and Spearman's rho was used to assess trends.

Results

From 2003 to 2018, the FEC reported a total of 31,646,000 federal political contributions. Exactly 4617 federal political contributions were made from 1021 unique self-identified ROs, totaling $3,350,747. The number of ROs making contributions ranged from 56 in 2005 to 600 in 2016 (mean, 289 ± 191.4 ROs yearly), with a mean annual contribution of $209,422. Of all RO dollars, 61.5% went to Democrats, 37.5% to Republicans, and 1.0% to third-party candidates. Most RO dollars (81.0%) went to PACs rather than candidates, with the majority of those PAC dollars (50.2%) directed toward the American Society for Radiation Oncology Political Action Committee. There was a positive annual trend in number of donors by year (ρ = 0.83, P < .0001) as well as RO contributions to the House (ρ = 0.58, P < .02), Senate (ρ = 0.58, P < .02), Democrats (ρ = 0.81, P < .001), Republicans (ρ = 0.66, P < .006), third-parties (ρ = 0.87, P < .001), PACs (ρ = 0.85, P < .0001), and overall (ρ = 0.8, P < .001). There was not a significant trend in contributions to presidential candidates (ρ = 0.71, P = 0.06).

Conclusions

ROs' federal political contributions have significantly increased over the last decade and a half. This growth overwhelmingly represents contributions to specialty-focused PACs and both Democratic and Republican congressional candidates.

### Is health politically irrelevant? Experimental evidence during a global pandemic [^112KGTSm]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Key questions

If public health policies are to succeed they must receive support from the people they are designed to help. This is especially true in democracies, where politicians are subject to periodic election and therefore sensitive to cues from the electorate. However, electoral accountability is not automatic; it exists only if citizens connect specific policies to politicians and vote accordingly. Do issues surrounding public health move public opinion and do those opinions translate into voting behaviour?

We know a fair bit about attitudes toward public health in rich countries, where health systems are expansive and expensive, and especially in the United States, where healthcare is an intensely partisan issue. We know less about attitudes toward public health in the developing world, where the topic is rarely studied. In neither context is the opinion/behaviour nexus well understood. Although a few studies examine the association between public health attitudes and voting behaviour, it is difficult to infer causality from such observational data.

The COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique opportunity to observe the interplay between public opinions about public health and electoral politics. This pandemic is one of the worst of the modern era; it is global in scope; it is covered intensively by the press; and the role of political leaders and parties in mitigating or exacerbating the pandemic is front-and-centre in news reportage. If public health matters for popular politics, COVID-19 would seem to be a perfect storm.

To assess the question, we launched surveys in the United States, the United Kingdom and India. Embedded within the surveys is a survey experiment in which we prime information about the health and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Where there's smoke there's money: tobacco industry campaign contributions and U.S. congressional voting [^113nVike]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States. A direct contributor to this massive health burden is the effectiveness of the tobacco industry's activities, including campaign contributions.

Methods

Voting records of 527 members of the 106th U.S. Congress were obtained for 49 tobacco-related bills between 1997 and 2000. Tobacco industry political action committee (PAC) contributions for each member were summed from 1993 to 2000. A cross-sectional, multilevel model was constructed that predicts voting behavior based on amount of contributions, political party, home state, and amount of state tobacco agriculture. The data were analyzed in 2002, 2003, and 2004.

Results

A total of $6,827,763 was received by the legislators from 17 tobacco industry PACs, an average of $12,956 per member. Senate Republicans received the most money (mean $22,004), while Senate Democrats received the least ($6,057). Republicans voted pro-tobacco 73% of the time and Democrats voted pro-tobacco only 23% of the time (p < 0.001). Pro-tobacco voting percentage varied significantly by state (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.27, p < 0.001). The amount of PAC money received by a member of Congress was positively associated with voting pro-tobacco (p < 0.01), even after controlling for political party, state, and state tobacco farming. For Democrats in Congress who voted pro-tobacco, for every $10,000 contribution they received, they were 9.8% more likely to do so. On the other hand, for Republicans who voted pro-tobacco, for every $10,000 received, they were only 3.5% more likely to do so.

Conclusions

Tobacco industry contributions, political party, and state-level factors influence the voting behavior of Congress members. In the 106th Congress, Republicans voted pro-tobacco over three times as often as Democrats. However, for those Democrats who voted pro-tobacco, the relationship between receiving tobacco industry PAC money and a pro-tobacco vote was stronger than it was for Republicans.

### How political epidemiology research can address why the millennium development goals have not been achieved: developing a research agenda [^115PUxMf]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2009). Low credibility.

The Millennium Development Goals (MDG) progress targets have not been met. Nevertheless, the United Nations (UN) has not yet undertaken in-depth review in order to discover the reasons behind this lack of progress in achieving the MDG. From a political epidemiology perspective, the intention here is to identify the political elements affecting the social factors impeding MDG fulfilment and, at the same time, to suggest future public policies and appropriate proposals that are both more coherent and supported by broader, empirical knowledge of the relevant issues.

### Cross-partisan discussions reduced political polarization between UK voters, but less so when they disagreed [^1115uEYB]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In several countries around the world, animosity between citizens with different political orientations has risen, affecting social relations – and the ability to address complex policy issues. Scholars looking for interventions to reduce political polarization often point to the alleged salutary effects of cross-partisan discussions on political issues –, but discussion opportunities are limited in everyday life. Individual social environments tend towards political homogeneity –. In more heterogeneous environments, citizens often avoid discussing politics. Online, people can be exposed to political heterogeneity, but mere exposure does not seem to reduce polarization.

Researchers have thus started to study the depolarizing effect of cross-partisan discussions between strangers. Recent experimental studies show that these discussions can reduce political polarization –. However, little is known about their impact when partisans disagree on the issues under discussion. In real life, citizens often encounter polarizing messages from the media, political campaigns or from other citizens in online environments. and it is in these contexts that polarized thinking can become activated. Thus, interventions to polarization ideally work even in an environment that gives free rein to the issue disagreement that partly drives inter-partisan animosity. Another, related, open question concerns mechanisms: what is it about these discussions that make people increase their sympathy for the other side?

### Support for foods allowed under the supplemental nutrition assistance program [^112Ya5gY]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Millions of U.S. families rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to afford food. Congress has proposed changing the items eligible for purchase with SNAP, which could influence participants' diets. Understanding attitudes towards these changes overall, by political party, and by SNAP participation can identify proposals with bipartisan support and center SNAP participant preferences.

Methods

This cross-sectional survey of U.S. adults (n = 4,470) from November 3–14, 2023, evaluated support for 4 changes to SNAP purchases. In 2024, descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used to evaluate overall support for these 4 policies and to test for differences by political party and SNAP participation.

Results

A majority of U.S. adults (68.1%) across political parties supported allowing the purchase of hot and prepared foods under SNAP. A slim majority (51.6%) supported creating nutrition guidelines to guide allowable items. Policies to exclude sugary drinks (38.7%) and unhealthy items generally (46.2%) were less popular.

Conclusions

Policies to expand SNAP were more popular than restrictions, both overall and across political parties, and restrictions were particularly unpopular among SNAP participants. Bipartisan support for policies to expand SNAP may help these proposals advance during Farm Bill negotiations and would align with the preferences of SNAP participants.

### Improving the affordability of prescription medications for people with chronic respiratory disease. An official American Thoracic Society policy statement [^117RK26w]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 1 — U.S. pharmaceutical policy governance — The U.S. government should establish and financially support a politically independent, impartial expert advisory committee tasked with making evidence-based recommendations on pharmaceutical policy, with an overarching goal to ensure affordable access to life-preserving medications while retaining consumer choice, promoting future innovation, and respecting our market-based economy. The rationale cites that, without a single entity to coordinate and/or regulate the activities of the various parties in the pharmaceutical supply chain, broad adoption of evidence-based policies has fallen behind, patients are unduly burdened by high treatment costs and experience greater morbidity due to cost-related nonadherence, and although numerous policy proposals exist, lacking any clear agenda these recommendations have been largely ignored; the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine recently recommended numerous targeted, evidence-based reforms based on the best available evidence to address inefficiencies in the pharmaceutical supply chain.

### An analysis of political contributions from otolaryngologists in the United States [^115DPxNf]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Doctors can influence the development of sound healthcare policy through financial contributions to political campaigns and candidates. Our objective was to characterize the political contributions of otolaryngologists in the United States, both individually and through the ENT Political Action Committee (ENTPAC) between the years 2003 and 2020.

Study Design

Retrospective observational study.

Setting

Publicly available information on the internet: fec.gov.

Methods

The Federal Election Commission's website, fec.gov, was used to identify the political contributions of individual otolaryngologists and the ENTPAC between 2003 and 2020. Each contribution is associated with a political group or candidate, designated as a Republican, Democratic, or Independent entity.

Results

A total of 1407 distinct political contributions were made by individuals identifying as otolaryngologists between 2003 and 2020, totaling $432,201. Overall, Republicans received more individual donations than Democrats (711 vs 540), while Democrats received more money ($231,139 vs $183,427). Donations peaked during election years, with the total amount overall increasing each election year ($9664 in 2004 vs $75,102 in 2020). The predominant political party receiving donations between 2003 and 2020 in each US state matched each state's predominant party of the governors and senators 48.6% of the time. The ENTPAC donated $3,027,383 between 2003 and 2020 to a variety of political candidates and entities.

Conclusion

Otolaryngologists are making increased political contributions over time and interest in political advocacy may be at an all-time high. Increased time and attention should be devoted to educating otolaryngologists to best politically advocate for interests which are of the most importance to themselves and the profession.

### Exploring disaster impacts on adaptation actions in 549 cities worldwide [^114g3wTP]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The third perspective (Fig. 1c) holds that the impact of disaster events on adaptation actions is conditioned by features of the political system that enable or constrain policy actors to constructively process and transform experiences from disasters into concrete adaptation actions. Which features matter remains contested and are context-specific, but most adaptive capacity frameworks – emphasize several attributes that vary across countries, including political stability, local government power, stakeholder diversity, and meritocracy. These attributes represent national-level opportunity structures mediating the effect of disasters on adaptation actions. These structures may also shape adaptation actions independently of disasters.

In this work, we explored these three perspectives by assessing potential relationships that disaster frequency, disaster severity, and adaptive capacity attributes have with different types of adaptation actions in 549 cities globally. We showed that the frequency and severity of major disasters generally have limited influence on adaptation actions in cities, although effects varied across action types, severity measures, and system attributes associated with adaptive capacity. Disaster event frequency, affected population, and fatalities tend not to affect adaptation actions. Economic damage, however, did predict some types of adaptation actions, but only did so under conditions of high levels of political stability and meritocracy. Societies with these attributes also recorded high monetary losses, indicating a wealth-effect; developed societies suffer greater economic damages from disasters but also have greater governance capacity to support adaptation decision-making. Our study also demonstrated that cities were likely to take adaptation actions if they were located in regions that experienced more recent disasters. In contrast, temporally distant events had no effect on adaptation actions.

### How many democratic countries have conducted COVID-19 public inquiries? An exploratory study of government-led postpandemic reviews (2020–2024) [^1125vz9Q]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The lessons drawn from the COVID-19 pandemic will influence public health policies and practices in the future. National inquiries into the government's pandemic response have the potential to shape those lessons. Inquiries reconstruct past events, gather evidence, assess the harms and benefits experienced by different groups, establish causation and allocate credit or blame. Their recommendations are forward-looking, proposing changes to the behaviour or priorities of government actors, restitution for those harmed, new policy directions or structural and institutional reforms. They are also inherently political: governments may constrain their scope, avoid them altogether or use them instrumentally to deflect criticism.

Our study asks: Which democracies commissioned national COVID-19 inquiries? What forms did these inquiries take? And to what extent did they advance accountability and policy learning? We hypothesise that highly democratic countries with less centralised executive power and stronger accountability mechanisms were more likely to launch inquiries because their governments face greater pressures to act transparently. By contrast, countries where power is concentrated in the executive may be less inclined to initiate inquiries, given the higher risks of political exposure. We also expect variation in the types of inquiries: public inquiries proper, which governments often view as diminishing their welfare(referred to as negative goods in), should be more common in systems in which transparency and independence are institutionalised. Parliamentary committees, by contrast, may arise under different political dynamics, including pressure from opposition parties.

To test these expectations, we compiled an original panel data set of national-level COVID-19 inquiries appointed between March 2020 and December 2024. We also investigated their terms of reference: whether they were broad or, instead, restricted the investigation to a few key issues; whether they instructed the inquiry to assess the adequacy of government responses, and whether they mandated study of the collateral harms of pandemic measures. These dimensions shed light on how far governments were willing to engage in critical self-reflection.

We define a COVID-19 inquiry as any major national investigation launched or officially recognised by a government, president or legislature to examine the pandemic response. This includes public inquiries proper, parliamentary and congressional committee investigations, and certain semiofficial initiatives. We exclude citizen-led, subnational and multilateral investigations, focusing on inquiries with the potential to influence national policy.

### A multinational Delphi consensus to end the COVID-19 public health threat [^114fHD83]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Despite notable scientific and medical advances, broader political, socioeconomic and behavioural factors continue to undercut the response to the COVID-19 pandemic 1,2. Here we convened, as part of this Delphi study, a diverse, multidisciplinary panel of 386 academic, health, non-governmental organization, government and other experts in COVID-19 response from 112 countries and territories to recommend specific actions to end this persistent global threat to public health. The panel developed a set of 41 consensus statements and 57 recommendations to governments, health systems, industry and other key stakeholders across six domains: communication; health systems; vaccination; prevention; treatment and care; and inequities. In the wake of nearly three years of fragmented global and national responses, it is instructive to note that three of the highest-ranked recommendations call for the adoption of whole-of-society and whole-of-government approaches 1, while maintaining proven prevention measures using a vaccines-plus approach 2 that employs a range of public health and financial support measures to complement vaccination. Other recommendations with at least 99% combined agreement advise governments and other stakeholders to improve communication, rebuild public trust and engage communities 3 in the management of pandemic responses. The findings of the study, which have been further endorsed by 184 organizations globally, include points of unanimous agreement, as well as six recommendations with > 5% disagreement, that provide health and social policy actions to address inadequacies in the pandemic response and help to bring this public health threat to an end.

### The differential impact of climate interventions along the political divide in 60 countries [^112iUPyJ]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

A critical component of our design that must be considered when interpreting these findings is the operationalization of climate action as the number of pages completed in the tree planting task. While this assessment of pro-climate behavior allowed a standardized measure of action across the 60 nations in which the experiment was deployed, it is limited to a single type of private mitigation behavior that offers a highly individual-focused solution to combating climate change. Therefore, these findings might not generalize to collective or systemic climate actions, also critical to climate mitigation. In future research, scholars should study additional pro-climate behaviors, especially ones that build towards collective solutions to this fundamentally collective problem, such as advocacyor voting.

Another limitation of the current study is the attrition rate observed (36.4%) between the number of participants who completed the study and the participants whose data ended up in the final analysis. Although within the expected range of attrition for online studies (30–50%), this feature of our data should be considered when interpreting the results. Future research should thus replicate the current findings in more controlled environments that may benefit from lower attrition rates.

Notably, the interventions tested here were homogeneously administered and not ideologically tailored. Given recent work showing that targeted interventions can be up to 200% more effective, we hope our results can inform and increase the potential of future targeted interventions in this space. Moreover, given the heterogeneity of the effects observed across ideologies and outcomes, we also recommend future research targeting mechanisms to consider these dimensions for optimal impact.

Overall, the present work provides global evidence of the complex relationship between political ideology and climate change beliefs, policy support, and individual climate action, providing evidence for a conservative-oriented green gap. Our analyses also have critical implications for the design and deployment of theoretically derived targeted interventions aimed at boosting climate awareness and action around the world. Scholars and policymakers in this space can leverage our findings to implement interventions selected to optimize outcomes, given the ideological composition of a target community, for a more effective, empirically informed response to the climate crisis.

### Exploring the variances of climate change opinions in Germany at a fine-grained local scale [^114XSe7A]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

A small number of previous studies has shown that public climate change opinions (CCOs) can vary substantially at the local scale –. The local variation in aggregate opinions within the same country is important for at least two reasons. First, public awareness of climate change has grown around the world, but many countries experience stagnating opinions paired with trends of growing skepticism –. People continue to disagree on climate change resulting in strong polarization. The empirical evidence on geographically varying CCOs within a country indicates that this polarization manifests at the local level, causing strong interregional divergence between places leading and lagging in CCOs. Second, geographic polarization is problematic as it increases inequalities and creates tensions between places. Geographic polarization also impedes the efficient implementation of climate change policies that depend on collective support and action at small spatial scales involving multiple stakeholders such as households, businesses, or governments. CCOs do not translate into climate-friendly lifestyles automatically, but awareness represents an important prerequisite for climate-related actions. Knowing where and understanding why people have different CCOs in different places thus greatly enhances our understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to or inhibit the achievement of climate goals at local levels.

Yet, the geographic polarization of CCOs at the local scale remains rarely investigated. Reasons for the observed local variation in CCOs remain unexplored and the empirical evidence is still restricted to a single country. Previous research has concentrated on revealing geographic variation in CCOs across locations in the United States (US) –. These findings have greatly advanced our understanding of the geographic dispersion of public CCOs within a country. However, they may be specific to the US. The US has important peculiarities, including its size (the US ranks fourth regarding land area and third regarding population), its geographical diversity (coastal vs. inland, hot vs. cold, low-lying vs. mountainous areas) as well as socioeconomic diversity (ethnically heterogeneous vs. homogeneous, growing vs. declining, urban vs. rural areas), and its political landscape (Democrat vs. Republican areas). Specifically, the two-party system petrifies ideological boundaries between people and increases partisanship in public opinions, including climate change that manifest at a local scale. These features specific to the US increase the likelihood of identifying varying CCOs within one country and are thus difficult to generalize across a geographically, politically, economically, and culturally diverse planet.

### Exploring the variances of climate change opinions in Germany at a fine-grained local scale [^116haZgu]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

We address these gaps by focusing on contextual factors responsible for the observed variation in public CCOs, while controlling for most important individual-level predictors in a multilevel regression analysis. In addition, we overcome the focus on the US in previous research on public CCOs – by providing systematic assessment of geographic differences in public CCOs in Germany, Europe's largest economy. Germany represents an interesting case, because it has been perceived as a role model within climate change politics –. Since 1990, Germany has implemented national climate protection and emission reduction targets, increasing, for example, its large-scale investment in renewable energies to meet national as well as international climate goals. Moreover, due to Germany's influence in European climate politics, the EU's engagement in international environmental and climate change politics is strongly coupled to Germany's support and activities for which public opinions are key. This role model perception, however, also conflicts with general public opinions as indicated by the growing vote share of right-wing populist and climate change-denying parties. In addition, Germany is substantially different to the US in terms of its land area (Germany takes up half of the land size of Texas), political landscape (multi-party instead of two-party system), and its history (Germany was divided into two politically different countries between 1949 and 1990, which led to different institutional legacies in CCOs).

### Political hurdles to implementing tobacco control policies: the case of the smoke-free generation policy in Belgium [^115cNks3]. Tobacco Control (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The smoke-free generation (SFG) movement aims to prevent tobacco use among future generations through enhanced tobacco control policies. Political factors are critical levers for effective implementation but remain poorly understood. This study analyses political support for SFG advocacy among political parties. This paper outlines political parties' positions on SFG policies and identifies the political narratives influencing tobacco control policy progress.

Method

Ahead of the June 2024 Belgian election, a questionnaire was distributed to political parties (n = 10), requesting their stance on 15 tobacco control policies and the rationale behind their responses. Factorial correspondence analysis was used to identify primary controversies, while thematic analysis was employed to uncover the main narratives.

Results

The SFG initiative represents a political controversy. Although most parties endorse preventive measures to achieve an SFG, there is insufficient support for the most impactful regulatory policies. In particular, major parties across the ideological spectrum prioritise the short-term economic interests of adults who smoke over potential risks to young people. Narratives promoted by key political parties indicate a divergence from the core belief underlying the SFG movement, and protecting children is not consistently prioritised.

Conclusion

There is a notable lack of commitment among political parties, both on the left and right, towards endorsing SFG advocacy, indicating weak adherence to the core values of the SFG movement.

### Excess death rates for republican and democratic registered voters in Florida and Ohio during the COVID-19 pandemic [^116Q5Ypq]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Importance

There is evidence that Republican-leaning counties have had higher COVID-19 death rates than Democratic-leaning counties and similar evidence of an association between political party affiliation and attitudes regarding COVID-19 vaccination; further data on these rates may be useful.

Objective

To assess political party affiliation and mortality rates for individuals during the initial 22 months of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A cross-sectional comparison of excess mortality between registered Republican and Democratic voters between March 2020 and December 2021 adjusted for age and state of voter registration was conducted. Voter and mortality data from Florida and Ohio in 2017 linked to mortality records for January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2021, were used in data analysis.

Exposures

Political party affiliation.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Excess weekly deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic adjusted for age, county, party affiliation, and seasonality.

Results

Between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2021, there were 538 159 individuals in Ohio and Florida who died at age 25 years or older in the study sample. The median age at death was 78 years (IQR, 71–89 years). Overall, the excess death rate for Republican voters was 2.8 percentage points, or 15%, higher than the excess death rate for Democratic voters (95% prediction interval [PI], 1.6–3.7 percentage points). After May 1, 2021, when vaccines were available to all adults, the excess death rate gap between Republican and Democratic voters widened from -0.9 percentage point (95% PI, -2.5 to 0.3 percentage points) to 7.7 percentage points (95% PI, 6.0–9.3 percentage points) in the adjusted analysis; the excess death rate among Republican voters was 43% higher than the excess death rate among Democratic voters. The gap in excess death rates between Republican and Democratic voters was larger in counties with lower vaccination rates and was primarily noted in voters residing in Ohio.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study, an association was observed between political party affiliation and excess deaths in Ohio and Florida after COVID-19 vaccines were available to all adults. These findings suggest that differences in vaccination attitudes and reported uptake between Republican and Democratic voters may have been factors in the severity and trajectory of the pandemic in the US.

### What is the relationship between population health and voting patterns: an ecological study in england [^111u8RHc]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Background

Health is a fundamental issue in politics and an area where governments hold significant levers of influence. Countries in Europe have seen increased support for populist political parties, with some evidence linking support for these parties to health metrics. We aimed to establish if there is an association between health metrics and patterns of voting in England, particularly in relation to a recently established political party, Reform UK, in the 2024 general election.

Methods

We conducted a cross sectional ecological study with data from all constituencies in England (n = 543). We conducted Pearson correlations and linear regression between the proportion of eligible votes for Reform UK and estimated prevalence of 20 common non-communicable diseases, including obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, type 2 diabetes and depression.

Results

Constituencies electing Reform members of parliament (MPs) (n = 5/543) had the highest average prevalence of asthma (7.44%) and COPD (2.85%). Across the country, adjusting for age, sex and deprivation, a 10% increase in the party's vote share was associated with a +0.261% (95% CI 0.213% to 0.309%) prevalence of COPD, a +0.113% (95% CI 0.026% to 0.201%) prevalence of asthma and a +1.479% (95% CI 1.239% to 1.720%) increase in obesity prevalence.

Conclusions

At a constituency level, poor health, in particular conditions associated with breathlessness, was associated with a greater proportion of votes for Reform UK.

### Everyday advocacy [^117SJAMa]. Clinical Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

When considering advocacy, many people think of the political fundraising form, and assume it is difficult to carry out, or that it requires a big investment of time, energy, or money. However, advocacy comes in many different forms, and can be implemented every day. A more mindful approach and a few small, but critical, steps can take our advocacy to a new, more intentional level; one that we can practice every day. There are many opportunities to use our advocacy skills every day to stand up for something that matters and to make advocacy a habit. It will take all of us working together to rise to the challenge and make a difference in our specialty, for our patients, in our society and in our world.

### 'To quarterback behind the scenes, third-party efforts': the tobacco industry and the tea party [^115f58Av]. Tobacco Control (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The Tea Party, which gained prominence in the USA in 2009, advocates limited government and low taxes. Tea Party organisations, particularly Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks, oppose smoke-free laws and tobacco taxes.

Methods

We used the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library, the Wayback Machine, Google, LexisNexis, the Center for Media and Democracy and the Center for Responsive Politics (opensecrets.org) to examine the tobacco companies' connections to the Tea Party.

Results

Starting in the 1980s, tobacco companies worked to create the appearance of broad opposition to tobacco control policies by attempting to create a grassroots smokers' rights movement. Simultaneously, they funded and worked through third-party groups, such as Citizens for a Sound Economy, the predecessor of AFP and FreedomWorks, to accomplish their economic and political agenda. There has been continuity of some key players, strategies and messages from these groups to Tea Party organisations. As of 2012, the Tea Party was beginning to spread internationally.

Conclusions

Rather than being a purely grassroots movement that spontaneously developed in 2009, the Tea Party has developed over time, in part through decades of work by the tobacco industry and other corporate interests. It is important for tobacco control advocates in the USA and internationally, to anticipate and counter Tea Party opposition to tobacco control policies and ensure that policymakers, the media and the public understand the longstanding connection between the tobacco industry, the Tea Party and its associated organisations.

### The differential impact of climate interventions along the political divide in 60 countries [^116ishxx]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Social media sharing intention

Participants were first presented with the text: Did you know that removing meat and dairy for only two out of three meals per day could decrease food-related carbon emissions by 60%? It is an easy way to fight #ClimateChange #ManyLabsClimate{e://Field/cond} source:(where {e://Field/cond} was replaced with the condition code for each group). Participants were then asked: Are you willing to share this information on your social media? The answer options were: Yes, I am willing to share this information; I am not willing to share this information; I do not use social media. The present investigation does not focus on this intention measure; however, the results are reported in the supplement for completion (Tables S13 – S15).

Demographic variables

Participants were asked to indicate their gender (male, female, nonbinary/other, prefer not to say), age (in years), education level (in years of formal education completed), household income, and political orientation for economic and social issues (on two scales ranging from 0 = Extremely liberal/Left-wing to 100 = Extremely conservative/Right wing). To create an aggregated ideological leaning measure, we took the average of participants' answers on the two political orientation questions and treated that as the continuous measure of ideology (from liberal to conservative). We aggregated these two political ideology measures given a robust positive correlation between the two items (r = 0.71, p < 0.001), a prevalent procedure in this literature. For a binary version of this continuous measure, we computed a median split of the continuous ideology measure within each country and labeled participants who scored above their country's ideology average as conservatives and participants who scored below their country's ideology average as liberals.

Ethics and inclusion statement

This research utilized data collected by the International Collaboration to Understand Climate Action. Local researchers from across the world (60 countries in total represented in the data in this research) were invited to collaborate on the design, distribution, and analysis of the study, as well as lead individual research projects stemming from the collected data. Collaborator roles and responsibilities were agreed to before data collection began. For each research team in each country, individual IRB approval by local ethics review committees was required before data collection began.

### Impact of the WHO FCTC over the first decade: a global evidence review prepared for the impact assessment expert group [^113Hw4rz]. Tobacco Control (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

This narrative review was conducted across 17 substantive Articles of the FCTC, where impact assessment was appropriate (table 1 provides a brief description of each Article, and further details are provided in online supplementary table S1). i The 2010, 2012 and 2014 global progress reports on FCTC implementation prepared by the WHO Convention Secretariatand the 2015 WHO report on the global tobacco epidemicserved as the primary sources to assess global progress and key challenges in FCTC implementation. Relevant data from published studies and policy reports were also included. Based on an overall assessment of available sources (up to June 2016) on changes in the total number of countries/FCTC Parties who reported the implementation of Treaty provisions over time, the level of progress for each Article was categorised as higher (significant and rapid progress), intermediate (some progress but slower overall rate, with advancements often limited to partial implementation) or lower (some momentum to support the development of measures but slow progress).

Table 1
Brief description of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) Articles included in this review

Published studies and grey literature on the effectiveness of FCTC measures were identified from searches of four electronic databases: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus and Google Scholar. Independent searches were conducted by three authors (JC-H, SG, NS) and screened by all coauthors between May and July 2015. Searches were updated by the lead author (JC-H) in June 2016 and reviewed by the second author (LC). Tobacco control experts (online supplementary table S2) were also contacted to identify further sources. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were primary or secondary research on the social, behavioural, health economic and/or environmental impacts of FCTC tobacco control policies. Searches were conducted for the full time period available up to June 2016. Non-English-language studies and tobacco industry-funded research were excluded. A broad range of general and FCTC Article-specific search terms were used for all databases to capture as many publications on the effectiveness of FCTC measures as possible. Additional materials were identified by hand-searching selected peer-reviewed publications and grey literature, and scanning online resources created by leading tobacco control advocacy/research groups, such as the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, Framework Convention Alliance, University of California San Francisco Truth Tobacco Industry Documents and Tobacco Tactics.

A total of 128 studies, identified in consultation with a panel of tobacco control experts, were included in this review.

### The 'diverse, dynamic new world of global tobacco control'? An analysis of participation in the conference of the parties to the WHO framework convention on tobacco control [^112jydAL]. Tobacco Control (2014). Low credibility.

In contrast, accounts of negotiations culminating in the FCTC reported high levels of participation by developing countries and attributed the success of the negotiations to their substantial influence, while ongoing engagement is suggested by the Convention's remarkably rapid and extensive ratification with 176 countries having become Parties in less than a decade. An active commitment to promoting developing country participation in FCTC negotiations has been evident in the adoption of a distinctive travel policy for meetings (providing an economy air ticket and per diem expenses for one delegate for all low and lower middle income countries) and in rotating the location of COP sessions across WHO regions; while the first COP was held at WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland (in 2006), subsequent meetings were held in Bangkok, Thailand (2007), Durban, South Africa (2008), Punta del Este, Uruguay (2010) and (forthcoming) Seoul, South Korea (2012).

Participant perspectives on the third COP session in Durban vividly depicted the November 2008 meeting as embodying "the diverse, dynamic new world of global tobacco control and health justice". This depiction has been somewhat qualified by concerns that many LMICs have been represented by single person delegations, thus limiting their ability to participate in concurrent meetings and parallel activities such as drafting groups. More recently, effective participation by developing countries has been further threatened by the adoption of a more restrictive travel policy (limited to 'least developed' countries and covering only air tickets), with the European Union (EU) also indicating a preference for future sessions to be confined to Geneva. Representatives of LMICs and civil society organisations have expressed concern that such changes may compromise the effective engagement of many developing countries in FCTC processes.

The importance of effective developing country engagement and the political salience of decisions that may affect it suggest the need for a more detailed analysis of representation in global tobacco control. The availability of official lists of participants in COP meetingsoffers an opportunity to quantify the participation, representation and diversity of participation in COP negotiations. This paper offers an analysis of these documents to consider whether specific income levels (low, lower middle, upper middle and high income countries) and particular regions of WHO have had privileged access to or been marginalised within the FCTC process, to what extent such representation may be affected by meeting location, and which ministries and government agencies have been most active within COP negotiations.

### Towards a new model of global health justice: the case of COVID-19 vaccines [^116xmoki]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2023). Medium credibility.

2. Collective action failures

As Section 1 (Background) makes evident, by the time the first COVID-19 vaccines came to market, long delays in accessing them in LMICs seemed almost a foregone conclusion. Prior decisions by universities and academic researchers, national governments, pharmaceutical companies, philanthropic organisations, and others, set in motion forces that would eventually yield glaring inequalities in global access. While civic activists around the world shifted into high gear to alleviate the pandemic's impact, their efforts were diminished by a striking lack of cooperation among diverse global actors. One reason why cooperation faltered was that global actors operate within competitive structures that pit researchers, pharmaceutical companies and purchasers against each other. Absent structures designed to steer choices in favour of broader collective aims, each actor was left to their own devices and pursued narrower aims. This created a classic problem of collective action.

### From dichotomisation towards intersectionality in addressing COVID-19 [^115KWoAc]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Discussions on covid-19 have produced dichotomised debates about priorities in pandemic response. These debates have played out in the media, in scientific briefings, and in academic discourse. Several papers have started to engage with the dichotomic framing of debates, including Escandòn and colleagues' reflection on how the transmission and infection of SARS-CoV-2 are narrated. However, dichotomies exist beyond public health, and affect how covid-19 is understood, measured, and managed globally. Debate around the trade-offs of various approaches is often counterproductive to strengthening pandemic responses. Political decisions steering the covid-19 response have greater and more nuanced consequences than dualisms can convey. Debates dichotomising national pandemic responses have been used as a tool to gain political advantage and divert attention from the underlying structural inequalities and power asymmetries driving the unfolding crises.

Considering these complexities, we analysed the responses to covid-19 in 28 countries, and selected the seven highest and lowest performing countries measured as the number of deaths per capita directly related to covid-19 in November 2020. We also considered 14 countries in the middle performing category. Based on extensive review, a systematic comparative analysis, and consultations with experts on covid-19 working in academia, government, and the private and not-for-profit sectors, we present six dichotomised debates. We describe how these dichotomies have been constructed and show how moving away from artificial dichotomies reshapes debates, such that they inform a more holistic and sustainable pandemic response. To unravel the complexity of these discussions, our analysis is guided by three questions (table 1) that bring to the fore six dichotomies:

### Political polarization and health [^116vYwnU]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

In addition to social determinants of health, such as economic resources, education, access to care and various environmental factors, there is growing evidence that political polarization poses a substantial risk to individual and collective well-being. Here we review the impact of political polarization on public health. We describe the different forms of polarization and how they are connected to health outcomes, highlighting the COVID-19 pandemic as a case study of the health risks of polarization. We then offer strategies for mitigating potential harms associated with polarization, with an emphasis on building social trust. Finally, we propose future research directions on this topic, underscore the need for more work in a global context and encourage greater collaboration between social scientists and medical scientists. We conclude that polarization is a serious-if largely overlooked-determinant of health, whose impacts must be more thoroughly understood and mitigated.

### Neutral bots probe political bias on social media [^1118Vwac]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The drifters are designed with an identical behavior model but with the only distinctive difference of their initial friend — the very first account they follow. After this initial action that represents the single independent variable (treatment) in our experiment, each drifter is let loose in the wild. To be sure, while all drifters have identical behaviors, their actions are different and depend on their initial conditions. We expect that a drifter who starts following liberal accounts will be more likely to be exposed to liberal content, to share some of this content, to be followed by liberal accounts, and so on. But these actions are driven by platform mechanisms and social interactions, not by political bias in the treatment: the behavioral model has no way of distinguishing between liberal, conservative, or any type of content. The drifter actions are therefore part of the dependent variables (outcomes) measured by our experiment.

This methodology allows us to examine the combined biases that stem both from Twitter's system design and algorithms, and from the organic and inorganic social interactions between the drifters and other accounts. Our research questions are: (i) How are influence and exposure to inauthentic accounts, political echo chambers, and misinformation impacted by early actions on a social media platform? And (ii) Can such differences be attributed to political bias in the platform's news feed?

To answer these questions, we initialized drifters from news sources across the political spectrum. After five months, we examined the content consumed and generated by the drifters and analyzed (i) characteristics of their friends and followers, including their liberal-conservative political alignment inferred by shared links and hashtags; (ii) automated activity measured via machine learning methods; and (iii) exposure to information from low-credibility sources identified by news and fact-checking organizations.

We find that the political alignment of the initial friend has a major impact on the popularity, social network structure, exposure to bots and low-credibility sources, and political alignment manifested in the actions of each drifter. However, we find no evidence that these outcomes can be attributed to platform bias. The insights provided by our study into the political currents of the Twitter's information ecosystem can aid the public debate about how social media platforms shape people's exposure to political information.

### Social, cultural and political conditions for advancing health equity: examples from eight country case studies (2011–2021) [^113ZBHab]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Despite global commitments to reducing health inequities, progress has been slow and mixed. The Commission on the Social Determinants of Health highlighted that 'the social gradient in health within countries and the marked health inequities between countries are caused by the unequal distribution of power, income, goods and services, globally and nationally'. Staggering differences in life expectancy both between and within countries persist, and in some cases, are increasing. In contrast, progress in health equity (HE) is defined as 'levelling the social gradient' so that everyone can attain their full potential for health and well-being. HE progress is achieved through the systematic identification and elimination of inequities resulting from differences in social and commercial determinants of health.

Evidence on how best to reduce health inequities is substantial and clear; however, the power and influence of political economies and their competing priorities have hampered progress. Researchers have explored the reasons behind inaction on HE, citing poor governance, globalisation, capitalism and corporate domination, competing vested interests, privatisation, repression of civil society, low unionisation, absence of collective bargaining, regressive welfare state policies, lack of understanding of how to act and low motivation. While a number of countries have given consideration to the social determinants of HE (SDHE), the recommendations of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health have not been significantly enacted.

Reducing health inequities is often described as too challenging and complex. Yet while the need for studies that contribute to the evidence base for how to embed effective policies in specific political economy contexts is crucial, actions must not stall in the interim. Indeed, the European Health Equity Status Reportstated that there is a need to change common perceptions that 'health equity is too complex to address and that it is unclear what actions to take and which policies and approaches will be effective'.

With this in mind, this article identifies five countries that made progress on HE and three countries that had not made the same gains, during 2011–2021 (a period of 10 years after the launch of the Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health). We use the term 'progress' to mean a reduction in 'within-country' social gradients in health outcomes and 'between country' health inequities. On the basis of the cases, we identify a set of social and political conditions that appeared to be prerequisites for progress towards achieving HE.

### 'To quarterback behind the scenes, third-party efforts': the tobacco industry and the tea party [^116BprrL]. Tobacco Control (2014). Low credibility.

Many factors beyond the tobacco industry have contributed to the development of the Tea Party. Anti-tax sentiment has been linked to notions of patriotism since the inception of the USA when the colonies were protesting against taxation by the British. In addition, the Tea Party has origins in the ultra-right John Birch Society of the 1950s, of which Fred Koch (Charles and David Koch's father) was a founding member. Often, social movements gain prominence from complicated connections with established political institutions. Although the Tea Party is a social movement, it has been affiliated closely with, and somewhat incorporated into, the Republican Party. This may be due in part to the increased conservatism of politically active Republicans since 1970s and the increased polarisation of American politics. Although AFP and FreedomWorks have campaigned for very conservative policies since the 1980s (as CSE), they capitalised on the changing political realities following President Barack Obama's election in 2008. In particular, they harnessed anti-government sentiment arising from the confluence of the mortgage and banking bailout, President Barack Obama's stimulus package and the Democratic push for healthcare reform, which provided them with the opportunity for more successful grassroots-level Tea Party organising. In addition, the conservative media, including Fox News and the network of conservative talk radio hosts and bloggers, provided a unified forum to amplify these messages. The tobacco industry has played a part in building this network, both by working with Roger Ailes(who subsequently became Fox News CEO) and funding the National Journalism Center which 'train[s] budding journalists in free market political and economic principles'.
Limitations

This paper focuses on only one of the multiple industries with connections to the Tea Party. In addition, it would be difficult to assess and record the full extent of corporate connections, because they reach beyond disclosed contributions and industry lobbyists. Another limitation is that a major source for this paper was the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library, which is not a complete collection and is limited to documents produced in litigation against the tobacco industry.

### Lobbying expenditures and campaign contributions by the pharmaceutical and health product industry in the United States, 1999–2018 [^111KzFce]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Government efforts to lower drug costs and other legislative and regulatory initiatives may be counteracted by campaign donors and lobbyists in the pharmaceutical and health product industry.

Objective

To review how much money the pharmaceutical and health product industry spent on campaign contributions and lobbying in the US from 1999 to 2018 at the federal and state levels.

Design and Setting

Analysis of federal-level and state-level data obtained from the Center for Responsive Politics and the National Institute on Money in Politics, respectively. These nonprofit, nonpartisan organizations track federal and state campaign contributions and lobbying expenditures by individuals and groups.

Exposures

Lobbying expenditures and contributions to political campaigns.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Total spending, inflation adjusted to 2018 dollars using the US Consumer Price Index, on lobbying and campaign contributions by year, source, and state.

Results

From 1999 to 2018, the pharmaceutical and health product industry recorded $4.7 billion-an average of $233 million per year-in lobbying expenditures at the federal level, more than any other industry. Of the spending, the trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America accounted for $422 million (9.0%), and the other 19 top companies and organizations in this industry accounted for $2.2 billion (46.8%). The industry spent $414 million on contributions to candidates in presidential and congressional elections, national party committees, and outside spending groups. Of this amount, $22 million went to presidential candidates and $214 million went to congressional candidates. Of the 20 senators and 20 representatives who received the most contributions, 39 belonged to committees with jurisdiction over health-related legislative matters, 24 of them in senior positions. The industry contributed $877 million to state candidates and committees, of which $399 million (45.5%) went to recipients in California and $287 million (32.7%) went to recipients in 9 other states. In years in which key state referenda on reforms in drug pricing and regulation were being voted on, there were large spikes in contributions to groups that opposed or supported the reforms.

Conclusions and Relevance

From 1999 to 2018, the pharmaceutical and health product industry spent large sums of money on lobbying and campaign contributions to influence legislative and election outcomes. These findings can inform discussions about how to temper the influence of industry on US health policy.

### Decision-making under epistemic, strategic and institutional uncertainty during COVID-19: findings from a six-country empirical study [^1132166J]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Multisectoral collaboration

On the other hand, collaboration refers to a broader act of two or more persons or organisations working together towards an agreed-upon goal(s). Governments called on experts to contribute to the decision-making process and leveraged diverse stakeholders, such as private sectors, civil society, think tanks, academia and development partners, to provide assistance with policy implementation, emergency medical supplies, information about the virus, people's awareness and response to government policies and resource mobilisation.

So, all the parties, including our Director General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, other relevant ministries, city corporations, development partners (UNICEF, WHO) worked together and developed strategic plan for availability of vaccines and vaccines deployment. (Bangladesh_12)

Leadership at the highest level played a significant role in establishing and sustaining national and international collaborative partnerships. This leadership varied from the highest positions held by different elected or non-elected public representatives in each country.

It's very difficult to bring all entities of the country under one leadership, including the army, civil society, community and governments, but there are different ministries etc. So, we have one of the strongest factors for us; it was, we have one leadership [the king] that we all respect. (Jordan_1)

Public communication

Similarly, effective communication by government health officials to the public about the health emergency status and policies played a significant role in making decisions under strategic uncertainty during the pandemic. Governments in all countries attempted to communicate with the public about the virus, its magnitude, spread and control as well as government policies and justifications at different phases of the pandemic. They used various mediums, including traditional broadcast media through public addresses and chat shows, as well as digital social media using tools like public polls. However, social media, including Twitter and Facebook, were reportedly the most critical channels for public communication.

We recognized in the midst of this crisis that the public also needed an anchor around which they needed to understand how we perceive the threat… that misalignment between what the public perceives and what we were messaging internally… could lead to problems in public confidence and community incidents would start to rise… And so we've chosen now instead to communicate in a more granular fashion and let [public] know what is important to them.

### Impact of residential area characteristics and political group participation on depression among middle-aged and older adults: results of an 11-year longitudinal study [^1135PZXM]. Innovation in Aging (2024). Medium credibility.

The three moderating variables were measured as follows: First, urban and rural settlements were obtained using the item "area of residence". The question has five answer options (large city = 1, big city = 2, small city = 3, township = 4, and rural area = 5, with options 1, 2, and 3 were combined into "urban", options 4 were "suburban", and options 5 were "rural"). Second, we divided the administrative regions according to capital city status (binary, 1 = Taipei City) and special municipality status (binary, 1 = Kaohsiung City).

Third, the disparity between the political bases of parties reflects the level of political competition in electoral regions (electoral competition). We calculated the level of political competition in electoral regions by comparing the percentage of votes won by candidates formally nominated by the two major parties in the four local elections to elect county magistrates (city mayors) between 1993 and 2005. The narrow margin between the two candidates indicates a high level of political competition. Three points merit further investigation. First, we did not analyze presidential elections because a presidential candidate with more votes in county-level electoral districts, unlike a county magistrate candidate, does not necessarily guarantee victories. Second, competition between the two electorally dominant parties has intensified since democratization. Small parties either endorse a candidate from the major parties or, with a main party, nominate a joint candidate for the office of a county magistrate (city mayor). Taiwan's political structure is divided into two camps — the pan-green coalition and the pan-blue coalition — so that bipolar competition still creates party-coalition-based trust biases for individuals who identify with small parties. Third, it is common for the two major parties to send a candidate to run for mayor or county magistrate. However, some candidates may violate party discipline and participate in elections without party approval. These nonnominated aspirants may potentially entice supporters of their own parties. Thus, only considering the difference in votes between formally nominated candidates from the two major parties may underestimate or overestimate the differences between party bases. We computed the average of the differences between party nominees' vote shares in the four local elections to eliminate occasional bias from nonnominated aspirants when coding for single electoral outcomes.

### Exploring motivated reasoning in polarization over the unfolding 2023 judicial reform in Israel [^111X3kML]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Perceived societal polarization

Participants rated the extent to which they think Israel is polarized, without mentioning the reform. Higher scores indicated higher perceived polarization.

Motivated perceptions

We assessed two perceptions that can be motivated by participants' views on the reform — false consensus and importance of democratic features. To assess false consensus, we looked at participants' perceptions of the distribution of opinions about the reform in the population. Participants indicated the percentage of the population that supports, opposes, and has no opinion about the reform (adding up to 100). False consensus manifests when participants estimate their own camp (either pro- or anti-reform) as larger than the other camps. To assess importance of democratic features, we presented participants with six features — majority rule, separation of power between branches of government, protection of minority rights, independent and free media, free elections, and protection of human rights for everyone equally. Participants rated the extent to which they believe each feature is important to Israel's democracy.

Motivated downstream consequences

Participants rated their opinions regarding downstream consequences that can be motivated by the extremity of their views on the reform (i.e. issue-based polarization) and their feeling towards opposing camps (i.e. affective polarization). Following Exploratory Factor Analysis (see Supplementary Methods 4 in SI for full description), we focused on four immediate downstream consequences of polarization: endorsement of extreme protest methods (e.g. civil revolt), support of extreme protest control (e.g. police violence), conflict management strategies (e.g. compromise, dialogue), and delegitimization of political opponents. Delegitimization was assessed in the context of the judicial reform. Participants rated characteristics of people who support the reform and of people who oppose it (e.g. "They do not understand what democracy is", "They want revenge"). As with affective polarization, for each participant, we used only the items reflecting delegitimization of the opposing camp. Higher scores indicated greater delegitimization.

### Taking account of context in systematic reviews and guidelines considering a complexity perspective [^112zy3Yt]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

How is context defined and understood?

A plethora of definitions exists for 'context', each varying in the extent to which they adopt an 'intervention perspective' or a 'system perspective'; making it problematic to privilege a single frame of reference.UK Medical Research Council guidance defines context as 'factors external to the intervention which may influence its implementation, or whether its mechanisms of impact act as intended'. Further guidance defines context as 'any feature of the circumstances in which an intervention is conceived, developed, implemented and evaluated'. Methodologically, a tension exists between the technical advantages of deciding on a single standardised definition of context and the conceptual richness of diverse and competing definitions. A systematic review should clearly articulate its internal definition of context, justify its selection and apply this definition consistently through the review process.

Context and setting, although used interchangeably, are not synonymous. The former typically carries an overarching sense while the latter is often locally bounded (eg, an acute hospital setting in a low-income or middle-income development context). Research and evaluation, broadly speaking, seek either to ignore, control, document or explore contextual variation. Many intervention and evaluation designs seek to ensure that the context for the intervention group is the same as that in the control group, so that the intervention is the only meaningful difference between groups. Certain contexts are more easily explored by randomised controlled trials (eg, secondary or tertiary care)but become less amenable to controlled studies on implementation. Current design and statistical approaches do not adequately deal with contextual variations within source studies and imperfectly represent 'real world' conditions within the target context. Demarcation between the outer setting (the economic, political and social context within which an organisation resides) and the inner setting (features of structural, political and cultural contexts through which an implementation process will proceed) are 'not always clear', given that the interface is 'dynamic and sometimes precarious'. One concept analysis states: 'Context reflects a set of characteristics and circumstances that consist of active and unique factors, within which the implementation is embedded'. Subsequently, the concept analysis unpacks context into eight domains (ie, locational, geographical, epidemiological, sociocultural, socioeconomic, ethical, legal and political). Context typically incorporates the institutional context (setting), the wider environment (eg, epidemiological, genetic, geographical, sociocultural, health system specific, political and others) or a composite of both.

CHEST consensus statement — results: national government support of HC/RHAs policy suggestions include the following. 1a. We suggest political leadership at national levels should support health-care preparedness through financial assistance, support of market driven incentives, and preparedness requirements to HC/RHAs. 1b. We suggest national governments should support the development of responsive and nimble disaster/pandemic research processes that can both organize and assess information from prior disasters/pandemics, acquire real-time data in an ongoing one to provide situational awareness, and which can also learn from and support international disaster relief efforts. 1c. We suggest national, state/province/regional, and city/district governments should work with health-care experts and leadership, develop formal disaster/pandemic activation mechanisms to initiate, implement, and support disaster/pandemic plans and standards of care for health-care coalitions/regional health authorities and health-care professionals.

### Technical guidelines for United States – Mexico coordination on public health events of mutual interest [^115ywVEQ]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Mexico public health legal framework for coordination — The Political Constitution of the United Mexican States, in its Article 4, Paragraph 4, establishes the right of health protection and Article 73, Section XVI, first basis, establishes the General Public Health Council (GPHC), a body directly dependent of the President of the Republic and chaired by the Secretary of Health; the GPHC has authority to issue mandatory provisions in public health and is the second health authority in the country, preceded only by the President of the Republic. The General Health Law (GHL) is mandatory for all public and private entities and individuals in Mexico, defines General Public Health, and determines competencies and collaboration of the Federal and State governments. The Federal Law of Transperance and Access to Public Governmental Information (FLTAPGI) sets access rules except for information classified as reserved, and all 32 states in Mexico have similar bylaws. A reform of FLTAPGI published on July 5, 2010 defines handling of personal data and establishes principles and procedures to store, transmit, and limit access, while allowing use for specific technical purposes in governmental agencies with mechanisms to avoid unintentional transmission beyond intended agencies and purposes. The Mexican Official Norms (NOM) for Epidemiologic Surveillance (NOM 017-SSA2-1994) and Health Information (NOM 040-SSA2-2004) determine institutional responsibilities and surveillance procedures, including notification, data integration and communication. Constitution Article 117, Fraction I, states that "the States cannot, under any circumstance, sign agreement, treaty or coalition with another State or foreign power… " In summary, relevant Mexican laws do not contemplate but also do not forbid sharing public health information internationally, and Mexican law makes disease prevention and control an exclusive attribution of Mexican health authorities while allowing the Federal Government to establish specific collaboration agreements with other parties, including international agencies and other governments.

### Can current interlinked crises stimulate the structural and policy choices required for healthy societies? [^113rbcVx]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

For healthy societies to be an outcome of current crises, proponents of health equity should provide evidence to guide this framing of the causes and accountability for crises. They also should support social movements to demand action to influence policy outcomes, minimise indifference to the root causes of crises among communities, and direct blame for crises in ways that increase rather than detract from health equity.

Building healthy societies will require coalitions within countries and globally of governments, civil society, academia, and the private sector to present credibly what each part of government, each part of society, and each person can contribute, and to foster social mobilisation to support the improvements needed in systems and governance. We need to reach a consensus in our societies on the causes of current crises and what needs to be done. The health sector must urgently improve its capacity and performance to play its part, even though it is only one contributor, and often a minor one, in many of the required transformations. It will take humility and sensitivity to avoid being seen as using the resources of people and other sectors for narrow technocratic public health ends. Instead, the health sector will need to engage with the public's interests and priorities and be willing to make trade-offs and persuade, generously and credibly with evidence and a spirit of solidarity, to get support for creation and preservation of healthy societies.

Key messages

The current multiple interlinked crises provide opportunities for transformative action to enact healthy societies and improve social, economic, and environmental equity.
While the understanding of what constitutes a healthy society varies, common features can be identified drawing on existing concepts related to health equity.
Key structural and policy choices to realise healthy societies will require action across all sectors, not just health.
Evidence, research, and learning should frame and interpret the current crises in ways that support these choices.

### Global public health security and justice for vaccines and therapeutics in the COVID-19 pandemic [^114uVbhj]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

8 Vaccine confidence

While overall vaccine confidence remains robust globally, albeit with local variability, the rapid development and emergency authorization of COVID-19 vaccines has triggered a significant increase in vaccine misinformation and fuelled already organized vaccine-opposition groups and activists to join with other groups protesting government control measures. Some are connected to far-right political extremism and over the summer of 2020 they helped to ignite protests against COVID-19 prevention in several European capitals. These anti-vaccine activities degrade vaccine security and demand broad-based international action. This means promoting and distributing adequate public messagesand building confidence around the efficacy and safety of vaccines and defusing or dismantling anti-vaccine propaganda and interference from state-led activities and entrenched antivaccine groups. Ensuring global vaccine security must go beyond the traditional health sector and the community of vaccine scientists and public health experts. There is urgency to look at new mechanisms and options for countering a globalized antivaccine movement. The COVID-19 pandemic has reminded us of the disruptive power of viruses. A new vaccine security framework embracing vaccine diplomacy, collaboration, confidence, and sustainable financing is paramount. To avoid the further spread of variants of concern globally, it is essential that vaccine hesitancy be addressed immediately.

### Disagreement among experts about public health decision making: is it polarisation and does it matter? [^1126HDxc]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Disagreeing in public

An important difference between COVID-19 and other public health issues described as polarised is public visibility. Previously, the airing of differences among experts in the biomedical sciences was more limited in its reach (as were the numbers and types of experts involved), playing out in medical journals and at academic conferences. Disagreement over COVID-19 mitigation measures has been highly visible, via traditional and social media, reaching an audience unfamiliar with the ways that evidence is contested before it is settled. Communication of conflicting information to the public, in the interests of transparency, has been a goal of independent groups, but there is increasing concern that trust in the scientific community has been eroded as disagreements played out in public. Expert COVID-19 commentators may not have the credentials that were traditionally assumed of experts. Disagreement among them in the context of COVID-19 has a whole of society impact, beyond clinical outcomes and decision making. The nature of COVID-19 as a global concern, and the ease with which information can now be shared, mean that public engagement with expert disagreement is not surprising, but it complicates the discussion. It is possible that the levels and types of disagreement vary among different countries and subpopulations within countries. While people's attitudes to COVID-19 policy are consistently influenced by political considerations, they are also driven by personal priorities and experience. These features — augmented breadth of expertise, and public debate — have impacted how the concept of independence has been used.

### A theoretical framework for polarization as the gradual fragmentation of a divided society [^111dDGYC]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

As groups polarize and fragment, changes in narratives mirror the changes in the group members' shared beliefs, values, including moral convictions –, and norms about group behavior. That is, changes in the social identity content of the group. To illustrate our argument, we consider how collective narratives may vary at different phases of transformation, using dissent about the value of cultural diversity in society as an example. For someone aligned with a center-right ideology, this may mean voting for an anti-immigration politician. Those identifying with a more extreme faction may support harsh immigration policies and enforcement methods (a more extreme narrative). At the furthest extreme, individuals may endorse or engage in violence against minority groups. This progression illustrates how increasingly radical narratives can lead to more extreme attitudes and behaviors.

The role of dissent in fracturing societies is clearly shown in the global warming debate, which has polarized the public into opposing ideological camps. Although, broadly speaking, there is scientific consensus on the anthropogenic causes of global warming, the public is divided into those self-identifying as climate change skeptics, in line with a narrative that contradicts most scientific evidence, and an ideological camp of people who support a narrative aligned to climate change science. Focusing on the supporters of mitigating climate change, there is fragmentation within emerging factions (some more extreme than others) which not only endorse pro-environmental behaviors and political action, but also engage in radical and sometimes violent action (labeled as "eco-terrorism" by some media, government organizations and the corporations targeted).

### 'Knowing how the machine works': a novel framework for engaging with the political determinants of health [^112TY2UZ]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

It is well established that social determinants influence people's health and well-being. Yet, limited attention is given to the fact that social determinants are, in turn, the result of political determinants. The political struggle between different ideas, interests and power over public policies, that is, how societies shall function, results in formal and informal structures that work as a 'sorting machine': they determine how societies (re)distribute material resources and opportunities among their members, creating societal classes that face disparate health outcomes. Their visible and measurable characteristics are then labelled 'social determinants'. Improving public health, therefore, needs engaging with the political determinants. We contribute to this broader vision with a process-oriented, interdisciplinary framework. It first operationalises the analysis of political determinants of health to understand how, in a specific public health concern, politics shapes policy processes and causes differential health outcomes. Building on these insights, the framework then supports strategic engagement with the politics of policy processes, using agile methods to identify and promote more equitable and politically feasible policy options. We illustrate our approach by reporting on an interdisciplinary 6-year research project in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mozambique and Tanzania, examining how structural determinants contribute to unequal public health outcomes in industrial mining areas. Trade-offs between attracting mining firms and safeguarding public health have led to a patchwork of national legislation, global governance regimes and voluntary commitments, inviting an eclectic consideration of public health industrial mining. For instance, among over 560 mining projects across Africa, more than 90% of impact assessments were inaccessible. In the few that were, public health is only marginally considered, disproportionately harming vulnerable populations. To strengthen the 'structural competence' and policy relevance of the public health discipline, our results suggest an institutionalised cooperation with political science in curricula, training and applied research.

### Disagreement among experts about public health decision making: is it polarisation and does it matter? [^112ifDxX]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Who is an 'expert'?

The plethora of different voices commenting on COVID-19 is both a problem and an opportunity. Some dissenting opinions were patently incorrect or politically/ideologically biased. Others provided an alternate perspective on conventional and often conservative public health and infection prevention and control opinion.

Expertise — what is it, who has it, who should have it, how it is performed — is the subject of vigorous scholarly debate, particularly in the context of the (US-centric?) 'war on expertise' that preceded the pandemic.COVID-19 created an environment where 'experts' were numerous and claims of expertise went well beyond the disciplinary norms that might ordinarily be expected in contestations of evidence. Given the public airing of disagreement, assessing expertise has largely fallen to the public. Expert gate-keeping is neither desirable in times of crisis nor possible given how rapidly information is disseminated. It is important that publics can assess the veracity or applicability of expert claims, however assessing claims of expertise in a specialist subject can be difficult. Steps have been taken to address the dissemination of misinformation, but selective claims by people claiming expertise are less easy to counter. Detailed frameworks for identifying expertise exist to help policy makersbut tend to assume cues and social judgments that may not be accessible to publics. Guides for publics are general (eg, does the person have a degree? An academic affiliation?); these may filter out some inappropriate claims of expertise but not all.

### Interventions to reduce corruption in the health sector [^111TBrvh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

Corruption is the abuse or complicity in abuse, of public or private position, power or authority to benefit oneself, a group, an organisation or others close to oneself; where the benefits may be financial, material or non‐material. It is wide‐spread in the health sector and represents a major problem.

Objectives

Our primary objective was to systematically summarise empirical evidence of the effects of strategies to reduce corruption in the health sector. Our secondary objective was to describe the range of strategies that have been tried and to guide future evaluations of promising strategies for which there is insufficient evidence.

Search methods

We searched 14 electronic databases up to January 2014, including: CENTRAL; MEDLINE; EMBASE; sociological, economic, political and other health databases; Human Resources Abstracts up to November 2010; Euroethics up to August 2015; and PubMed alerts from January 2014 to June 2016. We searched another 23 websites and online databases for grey literature up to August 2015, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the U4 Anti‐Corruption Resource Centre, Transparency International, healthcare anti‐fraud association websites and trial registries. We conducted citation searches in Science Citation Index and Google Scholar, and searched PubMed for related articles up to August 2015. We contacted corruption researchers in December 2015, and screened reference lists of articles up to May 2016.

Selection criteria

For the primary analysis, we included randomised trials, non‐randomised trials, interrupted time series studies and controlled before‐after studies that evaluated the effects of an intervention to reduce corruption in the health sector. For the secondary analysis, we included case studies that clearly described an intervention to reduce corruption in the health sector, addressed either our primary or secondary objective, and stated the methods that the study authors used to collect and analyse data.

Data collection and analysis

One review author extracted data from the included studies and a second review author checked the extracted data against the reports of the included studies. We undertook a structured synthesis of the findings. We constructed a results table and 'Summaries of findings' tables. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main results

No studies met the inclusion criteria of the primary analysis. We included nine studies that met the inclusion criteria for the secondary analysis.

One study found that a package of interventions coordinated by the US Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Justice recovered a large amount of money and resulted in hundreds of new cases and convictions each year (high certainty of the evidence). Another study from the USA found that establishment of an independent agency to investigate and enforce efforts against overbilling might lead to a small reduction in overbilling, but the certainty of this evidence was very low. A third study from India suggested that the impacts of coordinated efforts to reduce corruption through increased detection and enforcement are dependent on continued political support and that they can be limited by a dysfunctional judicial system (very low certainty of the evidence).

One study in South Korea and two in the USA evaluated increased efforts to investigate and punish corruption in clinics and hospitals without establishing an independent agency to coordinate these efforts. It is unclear whether these were effective because the evidence is of very low certainty.

One study from Kyrgyzstan suggested that increased transparency and accountability for co‐payments together with reduction of incentives for demanding informal payments may reduce informal payments (low certainty of the evidence).

One study from Germany suggested that guidelines that prohibit hospital doctors from accepting any form of benefits from the pharmaceutical industry may improve doctors' attitudes about the influence of pharmaceutical companies on their choice of medicines (low certainty of the evidence).

A study in the USA, evaluated the effects of introducing a law that required pharmaceutical companies to report the gifts they gave to healthcare workers. Another study in the USA evaluated the effects of a variety of internal control mechanisms used by community health centres to stop corruption. The effects of these strategies is unclear because the evidence was of very low certainty.

Authors' conclusions

There is a paucity of evidence regarding how best to reduce corruption. Promising interventions include improvements in the detection and punishment of corruption, especially efforts that are coordinated by an independent agency. Other promising interventions include guidelines that prohibit doctors from accepting benefits from the pharmaceutical industry, internal control practices in community health centres, and increased transparency and accountability for co‐payments combined with reduced incentives for informal payments. The extent to which increased transparency alone reduces corruption is uncertain. There is a need to monitor and evaluate the impacts of all interventions to reduce corruption, including their potential adverse effects.

### A global public health convention for the 21st century [^1147fktp]. The Lancet: Public Health (2021). High credibility.

As shown by COVID-19, infectious diseases with a pandemic potential present a grave threat to health and wellbeing. Although the International Health Regulations provide a framework of binding legal obligations for pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response, many countries do not comply with these regulations. There is a need for a renewed framework for global collective action that ensures conformity with international regulations and promotes effective prevention and response to pandemic infectious diseases. This Health Policy identifies the necessary characteristics for a new global public health security convention designed to optimise prevention, preparedness, and response to pandemic infectious diseases. We propose ten recommendations to strengthen global public health governance and promote compliance with global health security regulations. Recommendations for a new global public health security convention include greater authority for a global governing body, an improved ability to respond to pandemics, an objective evaluation system for national core public health capacities, more effective enforcement mechanisms, independent and sustainable funding, representativeness, and investment from multiple sectors, among others. The next steps to achieve these recommendations include assembling an invested alliance, specifying the operational structures of a global public health security system, and overcoming barriers such as insufficient political will, scarcity of resources, and individual national interests.

### Exploring motivated reasoning in polarization over the unfolding 2023 judicial reform in Israel [^111MKZWD]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

National identity also seemed to play a motivating role, but only for issue-based polarization. Similarly to constructive patriotism, holding the more inclusive civic identity was associated with more issue-based polarization in the anti-reform camp. This camp likely regards criticism of governmental institutions and policies as a civic duty related to their civic identity as Israelis, thus motivating more extreme views of the reform. Ethno-religious identity, on the other hand, was associated with more extreme views in the pro-reform camp. These findings indicate a connection between more inclusive social identities and liberal-democratic attitudes, and vice versa — the connection between exclusive social identities and political preferences which lean away from liberal democracy.

So far, we discussed findings supporting the notion that pre-existing ideologically based factors motived people's views on an emerging political issue, polarizing them into two camps. Our findings further demonstrate perceptions which might be motivated by people's membership in these camps — false consensus and prioritizing different democratic features. First, our results demonstrate false consensus, a self-serving motivated bias. Each camp believed that a majority of fellow citizens shared their views, suggesting that people in our sample might have been motivated to believe that their opinion is supported by most of the population. Furthermore, adding both to the literature on polarization and on false consensus, we found that those who were more polarized about an issue (i.e. held more extreme views on the issue) showed greater false consensus, suggesting that this self- and group-serving bias might be motivated by extreme views. Taken together, our findings may indicate that in the context of polarization, people who hold extreme views may use the biased belief that they belong to the majority (i.e. false consensus) to motivate and justify unwillingness to compromise, animosity, and aggression towards opponents, further deepening the divide. Future research should more directly examine the consequences of false consensus in the context of polarization. A second motivated perception was related to the core issue at hand — the importance each camp assigns to core features of democracy. We found that indeed the pro-reform camp, who are currently in power (i.e. are represented by the elected government), prioritize the majority rule principle more than the anti-reform camp, who downplay the importance of this principle. Presumably, the anti-reform camp assign the lowest importance to this principle because the reform, which they perceive as a threat to democracy, was made possible based on majority rule. The lower importance that pro-reform participants assigned to other principles is also likely to be motivated by pre-existing institutional trust (separation of power, free media) and ethno-religious identity, as well as endorsement of blind patriotism (equal human rights, minority rights). Our results echo findings from candidate choice experiments, which showed that participants with strong partisan identity and desire for ingroup advantage were willing to weaken restraints on the executive (i.e.g.overnment) in favor of their ideological agendas. The notion that patriotism, identity and ideology might underline endorsement of core democratic principles paints a concerning picture of how people form their political views.

### Interventions to reduce corruption in the health sector [^116euWAe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Corruption is the abuse or complicity in abuse, of public or private position, power or authority to benefit oneself, a group, an organisation or others close to oneself; where the benefits may be financial, material or non-material. It is wide-spread in the health sector and represents a major problem.

Objectives

Our primary objective was to systematically summarise empirical evidence of the effects of strategies to reduce corruption in the health sector. Our secondary objective was to describe the range of strategies that have been tried and to guide future evaluations of promising strategies for which there is insufficient evidence.

Search Methods

We searched 14 electronic databases up to January 2014, including: CENTRAL; MEDLINE; EMBASE; sociological, economic, political and other health databases; Human Resources Abstracts up to November 2010; Euroethics up to August 2015; and PubMed alerts from January 2014 to June 2016. We searched another 23 websites and online databases for grey literature up to August 2015, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the U4 Anti-Corruption Resource Centre, Transparency International, healthcare anti-fraud association websites and trial registries. We conducted citation searches in Science Citation Index and Google Scholar, and searched PubMed for related articles up to August 2015. We contacted corruption researchers in December 2015, and screened reference lists of articles up to May 2016.

Selection Criteria

For the primary analysis, we included randomised trials, non-randomised trials, interrupted time series studies and controlled before-after studies that evaluated the effects of an intervention to reduce corruption in the health sector. For the secondary analysis, we included case studies that clearly described an intervention to reduce corruption in the health sector, addressed either our primary or secondary objective, and stated the methods that the study authors used to collect and analyse data.

Data Collection and Analysis

One review author extracted data from the included studies and a second review author checked the extracted data against the reports of the included studies. We undertook a structured synthesis of the findings. We constructed a results table and 'Summaries of findings' tables. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of the evidence.

### Obesity and advocacy: a joint clinical perspective and expert review from the Obesity Medicine Association and the obesity action coalition – 2024 [^113WyDuq]. Obesity Pillars (2024). High credibility.

State-level systems advocacy — medical boards, governors, and legislatures involves specific pathways and resources. For changing medical board policies, "most state medical boards require a Petition for Rule-Making", and "Completion and submission of a Petition for Rule-Making often is followed by a public comment period"; it "is therefore advisable to engage and elicit support from local healthcare providers, local and state medical societies, and medical schools", with a resource at "Helpful Internet link: https://www.fsmb.org/contact/state-medical-board/". Governors are emphasized: "State Governors are key partners for when engaging in system advocacy", and the National Governors Association "link (https://www.nga.org/) is a forum for bipartisan policy solutions", which "provides the profile of state governors, including biographical information, links to their website and contact information for key staff on both the state and federal level". Key focus areas include "state Medicaid programs, state employee health plans, and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Exchange Marketplace plans". At the legislature level, "State legislatures are often an early audience for obesity treatment advocacy initiatives", where "Perhaps most influential would be the Chair or Ranking Member (i.e., most senior member of the majority party) of a state Healthcare Committee or state Health Insurance Committee" who "help determine what services and treatments are covered and how the applicable budgets get allocated", with resources at "https://www.ncsl.org/, which is the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) website", which "maintains a map of the "State Legislative Session Calendar".

### Impact of residential area characteristics and political group participation on depression among middle-aged and older adults: results of an 11-year longitudinal study [^113cEUHG]. Innovation in Aging (2024). Medium credibility.

The study hypothesized that for older adults who remained politically engaged, living in areas with higher levels of electoral competition will be associated with a higher likelihood of depression. By contrast, this conditional effect will not be prevalent among those who were solely engaged in nonpolitical groups. For the purpose of comparison, other residential characteristics, such as urban–rural residences, are expected to have no impact on the likelihood of depression among older adults who are involved in political groups.

Given that political competition is a crucial factor, it is reasonable to anticipate that those residing in the capital city and those engaged in political groups will have significantly higher odds of reporting depression. Research has found that elections are more competitive in heterogeneous districts than in their homogenous counterparts and larger districts than in smaller ones. Greater diversity should make incumbents more vulnerable by offering more heterogeneous groups in the electorate so that the opposition can adequately represent their views. A larger size should increase the challenger supply and reduce the personal connections between representatives and their constituents, thereby encouraging greater contestation. Capital cities are likely to be sociologically, economically, and ideologically diverse, and highly populated because they create employment opportunities, leading to a population shift. Thus, this study hypothesized that there is a pathway linking capital city status, electoral competition, and mental health among older adults engaged in political groups.

This study used panel data covering 5,334 persons aged 50 years and older across four waves from 1996 to 2007 to examine the geographical contexts in which political group participation could be associated with depression. Using the same sample, we further investigated the association of participation in multiple social groups and residential area characteristics with depression.

### Evidence-based guideline: premature ovarian insufficiency [^113qh4KL]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). High credibility.

Recommendation categories interpretation — Figure guidance states for a strong recommendation: "Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not", "Most patients should receive the recommended course of action", and "The recommendation can be adopted as a policy in most situations". For a conditional recommendation: "The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not", "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients and clinicians must make greater effort in helping patients to arrive at a decision consistent with their values and preferences (shared decision- making)", and "Policy making will require substantial debate and involvement of many stakeholders", with other categories including "GOOD PRACTICE POINT Information of the advice of the guideline group regarding a certain recommendation" and "RESEARCH-ONLY RECOMMENDATION The test or intervention should only be considered within the setting of a research trial for which appropriate approvals and safety precautions have been established".

### The implications of defining obesity as a disease: a report from the association for the study of obesity 2021 annual conference [^1152dcXA]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Unlike various countries and organisations, including the World Health Organisation and the European Parliament, the United Kingdom does not formally recognise obesity as a disease. This report presents the discussion on the potential impact of defining obesity as a disease on the patient, the healthcare system, the economy, and the wider society. A group of speakers from a wide range of disciplines came together to debate the topic bringing their knowledge and expertise from backgrounds in medicine, psychology, economics, and politics as well as the experience of people living with obesity. The aim of their debate was not to decide whether obesity should be classified as a disease but rather to explore what the implications of doing so would be, what the gaps in the available data are, as well as to provide up-to-date information on the topic from experts in the field. There were four topics where speakers presented their viewpoints, each one including a question-and-answer section for debate. The first one focused on the impact that the recognition of obesity could have on people living with obesity regarding the change in their behaviour, either positive and empowering or more stigmatising. During the second one, the impact of defining obesity as a disease on the National Health Service and the wider economy was discussed. The primary outcome was the need for more robust data as the one available does not represent the actual cost of obesity. The third topic was related to the policy implications regarding treatment provision, focusing on the public's power to influence policy. Finally, the last issue discussed, included the implications of public health actions, highlighting the importance of the government's actions and private stakeholders. The speakers agreed that no matter where they stand on this debate, the goal is common: to provide a healthcare system that supports and protects the patients, strategies that protect the economy and broader society, and policies that reduce stigma and promote health equity. Many questions are left to be answered regarding how these goals can be achieved. However, this discussion has set a good foundation providing evidence that can be used by the public, clinicians, and policymakers to make that happen.

### Position statement on contemporary issues: conflict of interest [^113pUHFp]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Academy members in leadership positions should understand that they occupy a position of trust and are expected to act at all times in the best interests of the Academy, in good faith, and without bias or favor to outside interest. Whenever outside interests or other responsibilities potentially conflict with duty to the Academy, these must be declared. Members certify that they will act in such manner as to avoid even the appearance of using positions to advance any personal interest. If an actual, potential, or apparent conflict is detected, policies are in place to resolve such conflicts. All authors of Academy publications and speakers at Academy meetings adhere to the same principles of disclosure and avoidance of conflict of interest for the fair and balanced presentation of scientific information that guides practice. Any member who speaks at the annual business meeting or advisory board meeting must verbally disclose any potential conflicts of interest before speaking. The Academy is committed to transparency and objective decision-making at all organizational levels.

### Obesity and advocacy: a joint clinical perspective and expert review from the Obesity Medicine Association and the obesity action coalition – 2024 [^1142GCVV]. Obesity Pillars (2024). High credibility.

Framing an effective advocacy argument — framing an argument that facilitates approval of a systems advocacy initiative often requires a strategic approach that highlights the objective and emotional consequences of inaction integrated with evidenced-based solutions; an advocacy argument is more effective when directed at the appropriate audience, with a clear objective and accompanied by a proposal that is understandable, applicable, and accountable, and incorporating the patient perspective helps humanize the issue; operational steps listed include "Set advocacy priorities", "Develop advocacy plan", "Implement advocacy plan", and "Evaluate and potentially revise advocacy plans"; highlighting real-patient stories and pairing personal stories and compelling anecdotes with evidence and data is described as enhancing the impact of advocacy.
