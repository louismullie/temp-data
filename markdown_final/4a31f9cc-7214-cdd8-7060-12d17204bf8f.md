## Question

Lopressor versus toprol

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differences between Lopressor (metoprolol tartrate) and Toprol XL (metoprolol succinate), including formulation, pharmacokinetics, indications, dosing, safety, and how to choose between them in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pharmacologic identity and why the two exist. Then, I should verify pharmacokinetic differences and their clinical implications. Next, I will review labeled indications and guideline-supported uses. After that, I need to examine dosing strategies and titration. I will then assess safety, contraindications, and drug interactions. Finally, I will synthesize practical selection criteria and special-population considerations, making sure I double-check any numerical claims against the labels and pivotal trials as I go.

> Let me first confirm the fundamentals: both Lopressor and Toprol XL are metoprolol, a beta1-selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, differing only in salt and release characteristics, which drives differences in kinetics and dosing convenience [^111uD5YX] [^115dWRXH].

> I will now examine the formulations. Lopressor is metoprolol tartrate, an immediate-release tablet typically dosed multiple times per day, whereas Toprol XL is metoprolol succinate, an extended-release tablet designed for once-daily dosing with controlled, predictable release over 24 hours; I should confirm that the succinate salt is the ER formulation and that the tartrate is IR, which the FDA labeling supports [^115dWRXH] [^111L8Erh].

> Next, I should review pharmacokinetics carefully. Toprol XL achieves lower peak plasma concentrations but provides steadier beta1-blockade over 24 hours, with about 77% relative bioavailability compared with conventional metoprolol; in contrast, immediate-release metoprolol has about 50% first-pass metabolism and more pronounced peaks and troughs, which can translate into more frequent dosing needs and more variable beta-blockade across the day [^111L8Erh] [^112SRAFn] [^11478XwY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical effects without anchoring to outcomes. I need to check labeled indications and pivotal data. Toprol XL carries FDA-labeled indications for hypertension, angina pectoris, and heart failure, with MERIT-HF demonstrating a 34% reduction in all-cause mortality and a 19% reduction in all-cause mortality plus hospitalization; Lopressor is labeled for hypertension, angina, and myocardial infarction, reflecting its historical role including early IV-to-oral use in acute coronary syndromes [^116UAiGU] [^114akmi6] [^111uD5YX] [^113UUJ1P].

> Wait, let me verify dosing nuances because they often drive formulation choice. For hypertension, Toprol XL is typically initiated at 25–100 mg once daily and titrated to 100–400 mg once daily, whereas Lopressor is commonly 100–200 mg/day in divided doses; for heart failure, Toprol XL starts low at 12.5–25 mg once daily with biweekly up-titration to a target of 200 mg once daily, a regimen supported by MERIT-HF and contemporary HF guidelines; for angina, both can be used, but Toprol XL allows once-daily titration from 100–400 mg, while Lopressor is typically divided two to four times daily [^1173Lvb5] [^117E2pVd] [^115wrbBH] [^1145Vb2h] [^111WJHYY].

> I should double-check safety and tolerability signals that differ by formulation. Both carry class warnings to avoid abrupt cessation due to rebound ischemia, and both can worsen bradycardia, heart failure, or bronchospasm; notably, perioperative initiation of high-dose metoprolol succinate has been associated with increased bradycardia, hypotension, stroke, and death in at-risk patients, so routine perioperative beta-blocker initiation is discouraged, though continuation of chronic therapy is generally advised; additionally, CYP2D6 interactions can raise metoprolol levels and blunt cardioselectivity, warranting caution with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors [^115Z3rp2] [^1163VZ6a] [^115WT8ou] [^111JsEez] [^114CgVDb].

> Let me consider special populations and organ function. In renal impairment, neither formulation generally requires dose adjustment, though clinical monitoring is prudent; in hepatic impairment, both should be started low and titrated slowly due to predominant hepatic metabolism; in pregnancy, metoprolol is considered acceptable when needed, with monitoring for fetal effects; in pediatrics, Toprol XL has limited data and is not established under age 6, while Lopressor data are sparse for chronic use in children [^111TnYef] [^1138ZQpR] [^11446Jt6] [^114G4mmc].

> But wait, what if the clinical question is heart failure specifically. I need to ensure I align with guideline-preferred agents. Contemporary ACC/AHA/HFSA guidance recommends bisoprolol, carvedilol, or metoprolol succinate (Toprol XL) for HFrEF because of proven mortality benefit, and it advises against substituting immediate-release metoprolol tartrate for succinate in this context; this is a key reason to favor Toprol XL over Lopressor in HFrEF when a beta-blocker is indicated [^111WJHYY] [^1155oLjF].

> Next, I should review practical selection criteria. Choose Toprol XL when once-daily dosing improves adherence, when smoother 24-hour beta-blockade is desired, or when treating HFrEF; choose Lopressor when rapid titration with flexible dosing is needed, when IV therapy is required in acute settings, or when cost or access favors the IR formulation; in hypertension without compelling indications, beta-blockers are not first-line, so formulation choice follows the broader indication profile and patient preference [^1145Vb2h] [^111RQ1TR] [^113WfUdP].

> Hold on, I should verify a potential pitfall: I initially thought Lopressor might be preferred for angina because of faster onset, but let me reconsider. Both formulations reduce angina frequency and improve exercise tolerance, and Toprol XL provides comparable beta-blockade with once-daily convenience, so the choice should balance symptom pattern, adherence, and tolerability rather than assuming IR is inherently superior for angina [^115ND86h] [^111L8Erh].

> In summary, Lopressor and Toprol XL share the same active moiety but differ in release kinetics and labeled uses. Toprol XL offers once-daily dosing, steadier beta1-blockade, and robust heart failure outcome data, making it the preferred metoprolol formulation for HFrEF and a convenient option for hypertension and angina. Lopressor remains valuable for acute coronary care, flexible titration, and cost-sensitive scenarios, with both requiring cautious up-titration and avoidance of abrupt withdrawal [^116UAiGU] [^114akmi6] [^111rnH91] [^111WJHYY].

---

Lopressor (metoprolol tartrate) and Toprol XL (metoprolol succinate) are the same active drug with different formulations [^115dWRXH]. Lopressor is **immediate-release** and dosed 2–3 times daily, while Toprol XL is **extended-release** and dosed once daily [^112FrPFh], providing smoother beta-blockade and better adherence [^11478XwY]. Both treat hypertension, angina, and arrhythmias, but only Toprol XL is FDA-approved for heart failure and has **strong outcome data** (MERIT-HF) showing reduced mortality and hospitalizations [^114akmi6]. Lopressor is preferred for acute settings or rapid titration; Toprol XL is preferred for chronic therapy, especially heart failure, due to once-daily dosing and proven outcomes [^111WJHYY]. Both require gradual taper to avoid rebound ischemia [^1163VZ6a] [^115Z3rp2].

---

## Clinical indications

Both are indicated for hypertension and angina; **only Toprol XL is FDA-approved for heart failure** and has robust outcome data (MERIT-HF) showing reduced all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalizations [^114akmi6] [^116UAiGU]. Lopressor is commonly used for acute MI and arrhythmia control because of its rapid onset and flexible titration [^111uD5YX].

---

## Clinical efficacy

- **Hypertension**: Both effectively lower blood pressure; Toprol XL offers smoother 24-hour control and improved adherence with once-daily dosing [^111L8Erh] [^11478XwY].
- **Angina**: Both reduce angina frequency and improve exercise tolerance; Toprol XL provides more consistent coverage [^115ND86h].
- **Heart failure**: Only Toprol XL has proven mortality benefit in HFrEF (MERIT-HF) [^114akmi6].

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Adverse effects**: Similar profiles (bradycardia, fatigue, dizziness, hypotension) [^115WT8ou] [^111JSqs6].
- **Abrupt withdrawal**: Both can worsen angina or precipitate MI; taper over 1–2 weeks [^1163VZ6a] [^115Z3rp2].
- **Perioperative use**: Avoid initiating high-dose beta-blockers before noncardiac surgery due to increased risks (bradycardia, hypotension, stroke, death) [^111ijHcE] [^113TJZPj].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Adherence**: Toprol XL's once-daily dosing improves adherence and is preferred for chronic therapy [^notfound].
- **Acute settings**: Lopressor's IR formulation allows rapid titration in acute MI or arrhythmias [^111uD5YX].
- **Heart failure**: Toprol XL is the preferred metoprolol formulation due to proven mortality benefit [^111WJHYY].

1.1	Hypertension

TOPROL-XL is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including metoprolol.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

TOPROL-XL may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

1.2	Angina Pectoris

TOPROL-XL is indicated in the long-term treatment of angina pectoris, to reduce angina attacks and to improve exercise tolerance.

1.3	Heart Failure

TOPROL-XL is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality and heart-failure hospitalization in patients with heart failure.

### Metoprolol tartrate (Lopressor) [^111rnH91]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Metoprolol is a beta1-selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent. This preferential effect is not absolute, however, and at higher plasma concentrations, metoprolol also inhibits beta2-adrenoreceptors, chiefly located in the bronchial and vascular musculature.

Metoprolol has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and membrane-stabilizing activity is detectable only at plasma concentrations much greater than required for beta-blockade. Animal and human experiments indicate that metoprolol slows the sinus rate and decreases AV nodal conduction.

The relative beta1-selectivity of metoprolol has been confirmed by the following: (1) In normal subjects, metoprolol is unable to reverse the beta2-mediated vasodilating effects of epinephrine. This contrasts with the effect of nonselective beta-blockers, which completely reverse the vasodilating effects of epinephrine. (2) In asthmatic patients, metoprolol reduces FEV1and FVC significantly less than a nonselective beta-blocker, propranolol, at equivalent beta1-receptor blocking doses.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Clinical pharmacology studies have confirmed the beta-blocking activity of metoprolol in humans, as shown by (1) reduction in heart rate and cardiac output at rest and upon exercise, (2) reduction of systolic blood pressure upon exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, and (4) reduction of reflex orthostatic tachycardia.

The relationship between plasma metoprolol levels and reduction in exercise heart rate is independent of the pharmaceutical formulation. Beta1-blocking effects in the range of 30–80% of the maximal effect (approximately 8 to 23% reduction in exercise heart rate) correspond to metoprolol plasma concentrations from 30 to 540 nmol/L. The relative beta1-selectivity of metoprolol diminishes, and blockade of beta2-adrenoceptors increases at plasma concentration above 300 nmol/L.

14.3 Heart Failure

MERIT-HF was a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study of TOPROL-XL in which 3991 patients with ejection fraction ≤ 0.40 and NYHA Class II-IV heart failure attributable to ischemia, hypertension, or cardiomyopathy were randomized 1:1 to TOPROL-XL or placebo. The protocol excluded patients with contraindications to beta-blocker use, those expected to undergo heart surgery, and those within 28 days of myocardial infarction or unstable angina. The primary endpoints of the trial were (1) all-cause mortality plus all-cause hospitalization (time to first event) and (2) all-cause mortality. Patients were stabilized on optimal concomitant therapy for heart failure, including diuretics, ACE inhibitors, cardiac glycosides, and nitrates. At randomization, 41% of patients were NYHA Class II; 55% NYHA Class III; 65% of patients had heart failure attributed to ischemic heart disease; 44% had a history of hypertension; 25% had diabetes mellitus; 48% had a history of myocardial infarction. Among patients in the trial, 90% were on diuretics, 89% were on ACE inhibitors, 64% were on digitalis, 27% were on a lipid-lowering agent, 37% were on an oral anticoagulant, and the mean ejection fraction was 0.28. The mean duration of follow-up was one year. At the end of the study, the mean daily dose of TOPROL-XL was 159 mg.

The trial was terminated early for a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality (34%, nominal p = 0.00009). The risk of all-cause mortality plus all-cause hospitalization was reduced by 19% (p = 0.00012). The trial also showed improvements in heart failure-related mortality and heart failure-related hospitalizations, and NYHA functional class.

The table below shows the principal results for the overall study population. The figure below illustrates principal results for a wide variety of subgroup comparisons, including US vs. non-US populations (the latter of which was not pre-specified). The combined endpoints of all-cause mortality plus all-cause hospitalization and of mortality plus heart failure hospitalization showed consistent effects in the overall study population and the subgroups. Nonetheless, subgroup analyses can be difficult to interpret and it is not known whether these represent true differences or chance effects.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

The peak plasma levels following once-daily administration of TOPROL-XL average one-fourth to one-half the peak plasma levels obtained following a corresponding dose of conventional metoprolol, administered once daily or in divided doses. At steady state the average bioavailability of metoprolol following administration of TOPROL-XL, across the dosage range of 50 to 400 mg once daily, was 77% relative to the corresponding single or divided doses of conventional metoprolol.

The bioavailability of metoprolol shows a dose-related, although not directly proportional, increase with dose and is not significantly affected by food following TOPROL-XL administration.

The peak plasma levels following oral administration of conventional metoprolol tablets, however, approximate 50% of levels following intravenous administration, indicating about 50% first-pass metabolism.

Distribution

Metoprolol crosses the blood-brain barrier and has been reported in the CSF in a concentration 78% of the simultaneous plasma concentration. Only a small fraction of the drug (about 12%) is bound to human serum albumin.

Metabolism

Metoprolol is a racemic mixture of R- and S- enantiomers and is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. When administered orally, it exhibits stereoselective metabolism that is dependent on oxidation phenotype.

8.4	Pediatric Use

One hundred forty-four hypertensive pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years were randomized to placebo or to one of three dose levels of TOPROL-XL (0.2, 1or 2 mg/kg once daily) and followed for 4 weeks. The study did not meet its primary endpoint (dose response for reduction in SBP). Some pre-specified secondary endpoints demonstrated effectiveness including:

Dose-response for reduction in DBP,
1 mg/kg vs. placebo for change in SBP, and
2 mg/kg vs. placebo for change in SBP and DBP.

The mean placebo corrected reductions in SBP ranged from 3 to 6 mmHg, and DBP from 1 to 5 mmHg. Mean reduction in heart rate ranged from 5 to 7 bpm but considerably greater reductions were seen in some individuals [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

No clinically relevant differences in the adverse event profile were observed for pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years as compared with adult patients.

Safety and effectiveness of TOPROL-XL have not been established in patients < 6 years of age.

8.5	Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of TOPROL-XL in hypertension did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience in hypertensive patients has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients.

Of the 1,990 patients with heart failure randomized to TOPROL-XL in the MERIT-HF trial, 50% (990) were 65 years of age and older and 12% (238) were 75 years of age and older. There were no notable differences in efficacy or the rate of adverse reactions between older and younger patients.

In general, use a low initial starting dose in elderly patients given their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

8.6	Hepatic Impairment

No studies have been performed with TOPROL-XL in patients with hepatic impairment. Because TOPROL-XL is metabolized by the liver, metoprolol blood levels are likely to increase substantially with poor hepatic function. Therefore, initiate therapy at doses lower than those recommended for a given indication; and increase doses gradually in patients with impaired hepatic function.

8.7	Renal Impairment

The systemic availability and half-life of metoprolol in patients with renal failure do not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in normal subjects. No reduction in dosage is needed in patients with chronic renal failure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

14.1	Hypertension

In a double-blind study, 1092 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were randomized to once daily TOPROL-XL (25, 100, or 400 mg), PLENDIL®(felodipine extended-release tablets), the combination, or placebo. After 9 weeks, TOPROL-XL alone decreased sitting blood pressure by 6–8/4–7 mmHg (placebo-corrected change from baseline) at 24 hours post-dose. The combination of TOPROL-XL with PLENDIL has greater effects on blood pressure.

In controlled clinical studies, an immediate-release dosage form of metoprolol was an effective antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant therapy with thiazide-type diuretics at dosages of 100–450 mg daily. TOPROL-XL, in dosages of 100 to 400 mg once daily, produces similar β1-blockade as conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily. In addition, TOPROL-XL administered at a dose of 50 mg once daily lowered blood pressure 24-hours post-dosing in placebo-controlled studies. In controlled, comparative, clinical studies, immediate-release metoprolol appeared comparable as an antihypertensive agent to propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazide-type diuretics, and affected both supine and standing blood pressure. Because of variable plasma levels attained with a given dose and lack of a consistent relationship of antihypertensive activity to drug plasma concentration, selection of proper dosage requires individual titration.

14.2 Angina Pectoris

In controlled clinical trials, an immediate-release formulation of metoprolol has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing the number of angina attacks and increasing exercise tolerance. The dosage used in these studies ranged from 100 to 400 mg daily. TOPROL-XL, in dosages of 100 to 400 mg once daily, has been shown to possess beta- blockade similar to conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily.

### Metoprolol succinate (Toprol xl) [^112SRAFn]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

A controlled cross-over study in heart failure patients compared the plasma concentrations and beta1-blocking effects of 50 mg immediate-release metoprolol administered t.i.d., and 100 mg and 200 mg extended-release metoprolol succinate once daily. Extended-release metoprolol succinate 200 mg once daily produced a larger effect on suppression of exercise-induced and Holter-monitored heart rate over 24 hours compared to 50 mg t.i.d. of immediate-release metoprolol.

In other studies, treatment with metoprolol succinate produced an improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction. Metoprolol succinate was also shown to delay the increase in left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes after 6 months of treatment.

Although beta-adrenergic receptor blockade is useful in the treatment of angina, hypertension, and heart failure there are situations in which sympathetic stimulation is vital. In patients with severely damaged hearts, adequate ventricular function may depend on sympathetic drive. In the presence of AV block, beta-blockade may prevent the necessary facilitating effect of sympathetic activity on conduction. Beta2-adrenergic blockade results in passive bronchial constriction by interfering with endogenous adrenergic bronchodilator activity in patients subject to bronchospasm and may also interfere with exogenous bronchodilators in such patients.

Absorption

The peak plasma levels following once-daily administration of TOPROL-XL average one-fourth to one-half the peak plasma levels obtained following a corresponding dose of conventional metoprolol, administered once daily or in divided doses. At steady state the average bioavailability of metoprolol following administration of TOPROL-XL, across the dosage range of 50 to 400 mg once daily, was 77% relative to the corresponding single or divided doses of conventional metoprolol.

The bioavailability of metoprolol shows a dose-related, although not directly proportional, increase with dose and is not significantly affected by food following TOPROL-XL administration.

The peak plasma levels following oral administration of conventional metoprolol tablets, however, approximate 50% of levels following intravenous administration, indicating about 50% first-pass metabolism.

Distribution

Metoprolol crosses the blood-brain barrier and has been reported in the CSF in a concentration 78% of the simultaneous plasma concentration. Only a small fraction of the drug (about 12%) is bound to human serum albumin.

Metabolism

Metoprolol is a racemic mixture of R- and S- enantiomers and is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. When administered orally, it exhibits stereoselective metabolism that is dependent on oxidation phenotype.

14.1 Hypertension

In a double-blind study, 1092 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were randomized to once daily TOPROL-XL (25, 100, or 400 mg), PLENDIL®(felodipine extended-release tablets), the combination, or placebo. After 9 weeks, TOPROL-XL alone decreased sitting blood pressure by 6–8/4–7 mmHg (placebo-corrected change from baseline) at 24 hours post-dose. The combination of TOPROL-XL with PLENDIL® has greater effects on blood pressure.

In controlled clinical studies, an immediate-release dosage form of metoprolol was an effective antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant therapy with thiazide-type diuretics at dosages of 100–450 mg daily. TOPROL-XL, in dosages of 100 to 400 mg once daily, produces similar β1-blockade as conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily. In addition, TOPROL-XL administered at a dose of 50 mg once daily lowered blood pressure 24-hours post-dosing in placebo-controlled studies. In controlled, comparative, clinical studies, immediate-release metoprolol appeared comparable as an antihypertensive agent to propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazide-type diuretics, and affected both supine and standing blood pressure. Because of variable plasma levels attained with a given dose and lack of a consistent relationship of antihypertensive activity to drug plasma concentration, selection of proper dosage requires individual titration.

14.2 Angina Pectoris

In controlled clinical trials, an immediate-release formulation of metoprolol has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing the number of angina attacks and increasing exercise tolerance. The dosage used in these studies ranged from 100 to 400 mg daily. TOPROL-XL, in dosages of 100 to 400 mg once daily, has been shown to possess beta-blockade similar to conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling:

Worsening angina or myocardial infarction [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]
Worsening heart failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].
Worsening AV block [see Contraindications (4)].

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.

Hypertension and Angina: Most adverse reactions have been mild and transient. The most common (> 2%) adverse reactions are tiredness, dizziness, depression, diarrhea, shortness of breath, bradycardia, and rash.

Heart Failure: In the MERIT-HF study comparing TOPROL-XL in daily doses up to 200 mg (mean dose 159 mg once- daily; n = 1990) to placebo (n = 2001), 10.3% of TOPROL-XL patients discontinued for adverse reactions vs. 12.2% of placebo patients.

The table below lists adverse reactions in the MERIT-HF study that occurred at an incidence of ≥ 1% in the TOPROL-XL group and greater than placebo by more than 0.5%, regardless of the assessment of causality.

Post-operative Adverse Events: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8351 patients with or at risk for atherosclerotic disease undergoing non-vascular surgery and who were not taking beta–blocker therapy, TOPROL-XL 100 mg was started 2 to 4 hours prior to surgery then continued for 30 days at 200 mg per day. TOPROL-XL use was associated with a higher incidence of bradycardia (6.6% vs. 2.4%; HR 2.74; 95% CI 2.19, 3.43), hypotension (15% vs. 9.7%; HR 1.55; 95% CI 1.37, 1.74), stroke (1.0% vs. 0.5%; HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.26, 3.74) and death (3.1% vs. 2.3%; HR 1.33; 95% CI 1.03, 1.74) compared to placebo.

8.4 Pediatric Use

One hundred forty-four hypertensive pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years were randomized to placebo or to one of three dose levels of TOPROL-XL (0.2, 1, or 2 mg/kg once daily) and followed for 4 weeks. The study did not meet its primary endpoint (dose response for reduction in SBP). Some pre-specified secondary endpoints demonstrated effectiveness including:

Dose-response for reduction in DBP,
1 mg/kg vs. placebo for change in SBP, and
2 mg/kg vs. placebo for change in SBP and DBP.

The mean placebo corrected reductions in SBP ranged from 3 to 6 mmHg, and DBP from 1 to 5 mmHg. Mean reduction in heart rate ranged from 5 to 7 bpm but considerably greater reductions were seen in some individuals [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

No clinically relevant differences in the adverse event profile were observed for pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years as compared with adult patients.

Safety and effectiveness of TOPROL-XL have not been established in patients < 6 years of age.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of TOPROL-XL in hypertension did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience in hypertensive patients has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients.

Of the 1,990 patients with heart failure randomized to TOPROL-XL in the MERIT-HF trial, 50% (990) were 65 years of age and older and 12% (238) were 75 years of age and older. There were no notable differences in efficacy or the rate of adverse reactions between older and younger patients.

In general, use a low initial starting dose in elderly patients given their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

No studies have been performed with TOPROL-XL in patients with hepatic impairment. Because TOPROL-XL is metabolized by the liver, metoprolol blood levels are likely to increase substantially with poor hepatic function. Therefore, initiate therapy at doses lower than those recommended for a given indication; and increase doses gradually in patients with impaired hepatic function.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

The peak plasma levels following once-daily administration of extended release metoprolol succinate are reduced by 50 to 75% on average compared to a corresponding dose of immediate-release metoprolol tartrate, both when administered once daily or in divided doses. At steady state the average bioavailability of metoprolol following administration of metoprolol succinate, across the dosage range of 50 to 400 mg once daily, was reduced by 25% relative to the corresponding single or divided doses of immediate-release metoprolol tartrate. The bioavailability of metoprolol shows a dose-related, although not directly proportional, increase with dose. The exposure (Cmaxand AUC) of metoprolol succinate extended-release capsule are similar to that of TOPROL-XL®tablet.

Absorption

Plasma levels following oral administration of metoprolol tablet approximate 50% of levels following intravenous administration, indicating about 50% first-pass metabolism. Peak plasma concentration of metoprolol is attained at 10 hours following administration of metoprolol succinate extended-release capsule.

Effect of food

Compared to fasted state administration, high-fat, high-calorie meal (54.3% fat, 15.6% proteins and 30.1% carbohydrates) did not have a significant effect on the absorption of KAPSPARGO Sprinkle.

13	NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

13.1	Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Long-term studies in animals have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of metoprolol tartrate. In 2-year studies in rats at three oral dosage levels of up to 800 mg/kg/day (41 times, on a mg/m² basis, the daily dose of 200 mg for a 60-kg patient), there was no increase in the development of spontaneously occurring benign or malignant neoplasms of any type. The only histologic changes that appeared to be drug related were an increased incidence of generally mild focal accumulation of foamy macrophages in pulmonary alveoli and a slight increase in biliary hyperplasia. In a 21-month study in Swiss albino mice at three oral dosage levels of up to 750 mg/kg/day (18 times, on a mg/m² basis, the daily dose of 200 mg for a 60-kg patient), benign lung tumors (small adenomas) occurred more frequently in female mice receiving the highest dose than in untreated control animals. There was no increase in malignant or total (benign plus malignant) lung tumors, nor in the overall incidence of tumors or malignant tumors. This 21-month study was repeated in CD-1 mice, and no statistically or biologically significant differences were observed between treated and control mice of either sex for any type of tumor.

All genotoxicity tests performed on metoprolol tartrate (a dominant lethal study in mice, chromosome studies in somatic cells, a Salmonella /mammalian-microsome mutagenicity test, and a nucleus anomaly test in somatic interphase nuclei) and metoprolol succinate (a Salmonella /mammalian-microsome mutagenicity test) were negative.

No evidence of impaired fertility due to metoprolol tartrate was observed in a study performed in rats at doses up to 22 times, on a mg/m² basis, the daily dose of 200 mg in a 60-kg patient.

### Meta-analysis of the effects of carvedilol versus metoprolol on all-cause mortality and hospitalizations in patients with heart failure [^111NPja7]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Long-term treatment with appropriate doses of carvedilol or metoprolol is currently recommended for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) to decrease the risk of death, hospitalizations, and patients' symptoms. It remains unclear if the β blockers used in patients with HFrEF are equal or carvedilol is superior to metoprolol types. We performed a meta-analysis of the comparative effects of carvedilol versus metoprolol tartrate and succinate on all-cause mortality and/or hospitalization. We conducted an Embase and MEDLINE search for prospective controlled trials and cohort studies of patients with HFrEF who were received to treatment with carvedilol versus metoprolol. We identified 4 prospective controlled and 6 cohort studies with 30,943 patients who received carvedilol and 69,925 patients on metoprolol types (tartrate and succinate) with an average follow-up duration of 36.4 months. All-cause mortality was reduced in prospective studies with carvedilol versus metoprolol tartrate. Neither all-cause mortality nor hospitalizations were significantly different between carvedilol and metoprolol succinate in the cohort studies. In conclusion, in patients with HFrEF, carvedilol and metoprolol succinate have similar effects in reducing all-cause mortality.

### Metoprolol succinate (Toprol) [^117Q7UaG]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of metoprolol succinate ER PO (also known as Toprol XL, Kapspargo):
- **Bronchospasm**: use caution in patients with bronchospastic disease. Use the lowest possible dose. Consider administering concomitant β-2 agonists.
- **Exacerbation of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction**: do not discontinue abruptly in all patients, as coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized. Taper gradually over 1–2 weeks.
- **Exacerbation of arterial insufficiency**: use caution in patients with PAD.
- **Exacerbation of bradycardia**: use caution in patients with first-degree AV block, SND, or conduction disorders or concomitant use of drugs causing bradycardia. Monitor HR.
- **Exacerbation of HF**: use caution when up-titrating metoprolol in patients with HF. Increase diuretics and ensure clinical stability before up-titration.
- **Hypertensive crisis**: use caution in patients with pheochromocytoma. Administer in combination with an α-blocker and only after α-blockage has been initiated.
- **Mask symptoms of hyperthyroidism**: use caution in patients with thyroid disease.
- **Mask symptoms of hypoglycemia**: use caution in patients with diabetes mellitus or patients who are fasting (surgery, not eating regularly, or vomiting).
- **Thyroid storm**: do not discontinue abruptly in patients with thyroid disease suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis.

5.1	Abrupt Cessation of Therapy

Following abrupt cessation of therapy with certain beta-blocking agents, exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred. When discontinuing chronically administered TOPROL-XL, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, gradually reduce the dosage over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and monitor the patient. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary ischemia develops, promptly reinstate TOPROL-XL, and take measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina. Warn patients not to interrupt therapy without their physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, avoid abruptly discontinuing TOPROL-XL in patients treated only for hypertension.

5.2	Heart Failure

Worsening cardiac failure may occur during up-titration of TOPROL-XL. If such symptoms occur, increase diuretics and restore clinical stability before advancing the dose of TOPROL-XL [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. It may be necessary to lower the dose of TOPROL-XL or temporarily discontinue it. Such episodes do not preclude subsequent successful titration of TOPROL-XL.

5.3	Bronchospastic Disease

Patients with bronchospastic diseases should, in general, not receive beta-blockers. Because of its relative beta1- cardio- selectivity, however, TOPROL-XL may be used in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive treatment. Because beta1-selectivity is not absolute, use the lowest possible dose of TOPROL-XL. Bronchodilators, including beta2-agonists, should be readily available or administered concomitantly [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

5.4	Bradycardia

Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of TOPROL-XL. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, conduction disorders (including Wolff- Parkinson-White) or on concomitant drugs that cause bradycardia [see Drug Interactions (7.3)], may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate in patients receiving TOPROL-XL. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop TOPROL- XL.

### Metoprolol for acute myocardial infarction… [^114XyLP4]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Beta-blocker therapy has been proven to benefit patients with heart failure, arrhythmias, hypertension, or unstable angina. In some studies, early use of beta blockers has been associated with a 25 percent reduction in mortality rates for one or two days after suspected acute myocardial infarction. The COMMIT Collaborative Group aimed to assess the risks and benefits of adding early intravenous metoprolol followed by daily oral metoprolol to standard therapies for acute MI. The first intravenous injection of 5 mg of metoprolol or placebo was given immediately. If the heart rate was more than 50 beats per minute and the systolic blood pressure was greater than 90 mm Hg after two to three minutes, a second ampule was given. A third ampule could be given if indicated.

Fifteen minutes after the intravenous medication was administered, patients received 50 mg of metoprolol given orally or placebo every six hours for one day. From day 2, patients received 200 mg of controlled-release metoprolol daily for up to four weeks. All other management was at the discretion of physicians. The two primary outcomes were death from any cause and the composite of death, reinfarction, and cardiac arrest during hospitalization or up to day 28. Secondary end points included reinfarction, ventricular fibrillation, cardiac arrest, and cardiogenic shock. Similarly, the composite end point of death, reinfarction, or cardiac arrest occurred in 2, 166 of the intervention group and 2, 261 of the control group. Further analysis of the cause of death showed that the metoprolol group had a highly significant 22 percent reduction in deaths attributed to arrhythmia but a highly significant 29 percent increase in deaths from cardiogenic shock.

The metoprolol group also showed a highly significant 18 percent reduction in any reinfarction and a highly significant 17 percent reduction in ventricular fibrillation during treatment. Conversely, metoprolol was associated with a highly significant 12 percent increase in heart failure and an increase in reported cardiovascular conditions and respiratory conditions.

Chronic heart failure — beta-blockers with proven mortality benefit and agent selection is summarized as follows: Three beta-blockers have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of death in patients with chronic heart failure (HF): bisoprolol, sustained-release metoprolol (succinate), and carvedilol; positive findings with these 3 agents should not be considered a class effect, and patients who have Stage C HF should be treated with 1 of these 3 beta-blockers. In one head-to-head trial, carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) versus immediate-release metoprolol tartrate (target dose 50 mg twice daily) was associated with a significantly reduced mortality, and there have been no trials to explore whether the survival benefits of carvedilol are greater than those of sustained-release metoprolol when both are used at the target doses.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Catecholamine-depleting drugs may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. (7.1)
CYP2D6 Inhibitors are likely to increase metoprolol concentration. (7.2)
Beta-blockers including metoprolol, may exacerbate the rebound hypertension that can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. (7.3)

7.1 Catecholamine Depleting Drugs

Catecholamine depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Observe patients treated with TOPROL-XL plus a catecholamine depletor for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.

7.2 CYP2D6 Inhibitors

Drugs that are strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and propafenone were shown to double metoprolol concentrations. While there is no information about moderate or weak inhibitors, these too are likely to increase metoprolol concentration. Increases in plasma concentration decrease the cardioselectivity of metoprolol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Monitor patients closely when the combination cannot be avoided.

7.3 Digitalis, Clonidine, and Calcium Channel Blockers

Digitalis glycosides, clonidine, diltiazem, and verapamil slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use with beta-blockers can increase the risk of bradycardia.

If clonidine and a beta-blocker, such as metoprolol, are co-administered, withdraw the beta-blocker several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine because beta-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension that can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, delay the introduction of beta-blockers for several days after clonidine administration has stopped.

### Endothelial function is unaffected by changing between carvedilol and metoprolol in patients with heart failure – a randomized study [^111uihnQ]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In our study we found no changes in vascular reactivity in patients with mild HF by changing treatment from carvedilol to metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate. Previous studies with metabolic advantages of carvedilol compared to metoprolol were not reflected in our study of forearm glucose uptake; no changes were seen between carvedilol or metoprolol treatment. Diurnal blood pressure and heart rate measurement indicate that treatment with carvedilol and metoprolol, both succinate and tartrate formulation is comparable regarding the beta1-adrenergic blocking effect.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Clinical pharmacology studies have confirmed the beta-blocking activity of metoprolol in man, as shown by (1) reduction in heart rate and cardiac output at rest and upon exercise, (2) reduction of systolic blood pressure upon exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, and (4) reduction of reflex orthostatic tachycardia.

The relationship between plasma metoprolol levels and reduction in exercise heart rate is independent of the pharmaceutical formulation. Beta1-blocking effects in the range of 30–80% of the maximal effect (approximately 8 to 23% reduction in exercise heart rate) correspond to metoprolol plasma concentrations from 30 to 540 nmol/L. The relative beta1-selectivity of metoprolol diminishes and blockade of beta2-adrenoceptors increases at plasma concentration above 300 nmol/L.

In five controlled studies in normal healthy subjects, extended-release metoprolol succinate administered once a day, and immediate-release metoprolol administered once to four times a day, provided comparable total beta1-blockade over 24 hours (area under the beta1-blockade versus time curve) in the dose range 100 to 400 mg. In another controlled study, 50 mg once daily for each product, extended-release metoprolol succinate produced significantly higher total beta1-blockade over 24 hours than immediate-release metoprolol. For extended-release metoprolol succinate, the percent reduction in exercise heart rate was relatively stable throughout the entire dosage interval and the level of beta1-blockade increased with increasing doses from 50 to 300 mg daily.

### Metoprolol (Metoprolol tartrate) [^114mkPDm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Excretion

Approximately 95% of the dose can be recovered in urine. In most subjects (extensive metabolizers), less than 5% of an oral dose and less than 10% of an intravenous dose are excreted as unchanged drug in the urine. In poor metabolizers, up to 30% or 40% of oral or intravenous doses, respectively, may be excreted unchanged; the rest is excreted by the kidneys as metabolites that appear to have no beta-blocking activity. The renal clearance of the stereo-isomers does not exhibit stereo-selectivity in renal excretion.

Specific populations

Geriatric patients: The geriatric population may show slightly higher plasma concentrations of metoprolol as a combined result of a decreased metabolism of the drug in elderly population and a decreased hepatic blood flow. However, this increase is not clinically significant or therapeutically relevant.

Renal impairment: The systemic availability and half-life of metoprolol tartrate in patients with renal failure do not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in normal subjects.

Hepatic Impairment: Since the drug is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism, hepatic impairment may impact the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol.

Drug Interactions

Metoprolol is metabolized predominantly by CYP2D6. In healthy subjects with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer phenotype, coadministration of quinidine 100 mg, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, and immediate-release metoprolol 200 mg tripled the concentration of S-metoprolol and doubled the metoprolol elimination half-life. In four patients with cardiovascular disease, coadministration of propafenone 150 mg t.i.d. with immediate-release metoprolol 50 mg t.i.d. increased the steady-state metoprolol concentration 2-to 5-fold compared to metoprolol alone. Extensive metabolizers who concomitantly use CYP2D6 inhibiting drugs will have increased (several-fold) metoprolol blood levels, decreasing metoprolol's cardioselectivity [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

12.5 Pharmacogenomics

CYP2D6 is absent in about 8% of Caucasians (poor metabolizers) and about 2% of most other populations. CYP2D6 can be inhibited by several drugs. Poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 will have increased (several-fold) metoprolol blood levels, decreasing metoprolol's cardioselectivity.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.

Hypertension and Angina: Most adverse reactions have been mild and transient. The most common (> 2%) adverse reactions are tiredness, dizziness, depression, diarrhea, shortness of breath, bradycardia, and rash.

Heart Failure: In the MERIT-HF study comparing metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets in daily doses up to 200 mg (mean dose 159 mg once-daily; n = 1,990) to placebo (n = 2,001), 10.3% of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets patients discontinued for adverse reactions vs. 12.2% of placebo patients.

The table below lists adverse reactions in the MERIT-HF study that occurred at an incidence of ≥ 1% in the metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets group and greater than placebo by more than 0.5%, regardless of the assessment of causality.

Adverse Reactions Occurring in the MERIT-HF Study at an Incidence ≥ 1% in the Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets Group and Greater Than Placebo by More Than 0.5%

Post-operative Adverse Events: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,351 patients with or at risk for atherosclerotic disease undergoing non-vascular surgery and who were not taking beta–blocker therapy, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets 100 mg was started 2 to 4 hours prior to surgery then continued for 30 days at 200 mg per day. Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets use was associated with a higher incidence of bradycardia (6.6% vs. 2.4%; HR 2.74; 95% CI 2.19, 3.43), hypotension (15% vs. 9.7%; HR 1.55; 95% CI 1.37, 1.74), stroke (1.0% vs. 0.5%; HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.26, 3.74) and death (3.1% vs. 2.3%; HR 1.33; 95% CI 1.03, 1.74) compared to placebo.

14.1 Hypertension

In a double-blind study, 1092 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were randomized to once daily metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets (25 mg, 100 mg, or 400 mg), PLENDIL® (felodipine extended-release tablets), the combination, or placebo. After 9 weeks, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets alone decreased sitting blood pressure by 6–8/4–7 mmHg (placebo-corrected change from baseline) at 24 hours post-dose. The combination of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets with PLENDIL has greater effects on blood pressure.

In controlled clinical studies, an immediate-release dosage form of metoprolol was an effective antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant therapy with thiazide-type diuretics at dosages of 100 mg to 450 mg daily. Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, in dosages of 100 mg to 400 mg once daily, produces similar β1-blockade as conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily. In addition, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets administered at a dose of 50 mg once daily lowered blood pressure 24-hours post-dosing in placebo-controlled studies. In controlled, comparative, clinical studies, immediate-release metoprolol appeared comparable as an antihypertensive agent to propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazide-type diuretics, and affected both supine and standing blood pressure. Because of variable plasma levels attained with a given dose and lack of a consistent relationship of antihypertensive activity to drug plasma concentration, selection of proper dosage requires individual titration.

14.2 Angina Pectoris

In controlled clinical trials, an immediate-release formulation of metoprolol has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing the number of angina attacks and increasing exercise tolerance. The dosage used in these studies ranged from 100 to 400 mg daily. Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, in dosages of 100 to 400 mg once daily, has been shown to possess betablockade similar to conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily.

### Carvedilol compared with metoprolol succinate in the treatment and prognosis of patients with stable chronic heart failure: carvedilol or metoprolol evaluation study [^1122CZqt]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Background

β-Blockers exert a prognostic benefit in the treatment of chronic heart failure. Their pharmacological properties vary. The only substantial comparative trial to date-the Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial-has compared carvedilol with short-acting metoprolol tartrate at different dose equivalents. We therefore addressed the relative efficacy of equal doses of carvedilol and metoprolol succinate on survival in multicenter hospital outpatients with chronic heart failure.

Four thousand sixteen patients with stable systolic chronic heart failure who were using either carvedilol or metoprolol succinate were identified in the Norwegian Heart Failure Registry and The Heart Failure Registry of the University of Heidelberg, Germany. Patients were individually matched on both the dose equivalents and the respective propensity scores for β-blocker treatment. During a follow-up for 17 672 patient-years, it was found that 304 (27.2%) patients died in the carvedilol group and 1066 (36.8%) in the metoprolol group. In a univariable analysis of the general sample, metoprolol therapy was associated with higher mortality compared with carvedilol therapy (hazard ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–1.69; P < 0.001). This difference was not seen after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.57–1.50; P = 0.75) and adjustment for propensity score and dose equivalents (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.94–1.20; P = 0.36) or in the propensity and dose equivalent-matched sample (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–1.23; P = 0.99). These results were essentially unchanged for all prespecified subgroups.

Conclusions

In outpatients with chronic heart failure, no conclusive association between all-cause mortality and treatment with carvedilol or metoprolol succinate was observed after either multivariable adjustment or multilevel propensity score matching.

### Extended-release metoprolol succinate in chronic heart failure [^116LNxde]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and tolerability of extended-release (ER) metoprolol succinate and its role in the management of chronic heart failure.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search of English-language literature (1990-October 2002) was conducted using congestive heart failure and metoprolol CR/XL or metoprolol CR/ZOK as search terms to identify pertinent studies.

Study Selection/Data Extraction

All of the articles identified from the data sources were evaluated, with priority given to randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.

Data Synthesis

ER metoprolol succinate is a controlled-release tablet designed to produce even and consistent beta(1)-blockade throughout the 24-hour dosing interval, with less fluctuation in metoprolol plasma concentrations compared with immediate-release metoprolol. Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of ER metoprolol succinate in the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure. The MERIT-HF (Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure) study, the largest of these trials and the largest randomized mortality trial with beta-blockers in heart failure to date, demonstrated that ER metoprolol succinate reduced the relative risk of all-cause mortality by 34% versus placebo. Furthermore, the relative risk of the combined endpoint of mortality plus all-cause hospitalizations was reduced by 19% and sudden death was reduced by 41%. The benefits of therapy were evident in various patient subgroups, including elderly patients and those with diabetes mellitus. ER metoprolol succinate was generally well tolerated, with a similar proportion of patients discontinuing therapy due to adverse events relative to placebo (9.8% and 11.7%, respectively).

Conclusions

ER metoprolol succinate therapy provides substantial mortality and morbidity benefits in patients with New York Heart Association class II and III heart failure who are stabilized on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics. ER metoprolol succinate is administered once daily, is well tolerated, and provides consistent beta(1)-blockade over the 24-hour dosing interval.

### Consistency of the beneficial effect of metoprolol succinate extended release across a wide range dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and digitalis [^113ZEhmr]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The effects of beta-blockade with different extent of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and digitalization are unknown. To assess the effect of metoprolol succinate controlled release/extended release (CR/XL) combined with high versus low doses of ACEI and digitalis, we analyzed data from The Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Chronic Heart Failure (MERIT-HF) in which patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40% were randomized to metoprolol CR/XL versus placebo.

Methods and Results

Outcome was analyzed separately for those on a low dose (≤ median) of the ACEI or digitalis versus high dose (> median). The mean dose of ACEI in the high-dose group (n = 1457) was 3 times higher than that in the low-dose group (n = 2094). Mortality was reduced to a similar extent in the high- and low-dose ACEI subgroups (RR = .69 versus .64, respectively). Corresponding figures for combined mortality/all hospitalization and for mortality/hospitalization for heart failure were .85 versus .83, and .70 versus .68, respectively. Likewise, reduction in total mortality with metoprolol CR/XL was similar in patients receiving no digitalis (n = 1447; RR = .56), low dose (n = 1122; RR = .71), or high dose (n = 1421; RR = .71).

Conclusion

This analysis of MERIT-HF demonstrates consistent and similar improvement in outcome of patients receiving metoprolol CR/XL when combined with either a high or low dose of an ACEI or digitalis, or no digitalis at all. Thus regardless of ACEI and digitalis dose and whether patients are treated with digitalis or not, it is very important to add a beta-blocker to the existing heart failure therapy. beta-blockers should not be withheld until target doses of ACEI have been achieved.

2.3 Heart Failure

Dosage must be individualized and closely monitored during up-titration. Prior to initiation of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, stabilize the dose of other heart failure drug therapy. The recommended starting dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYHA Class II heart failure and 12.5 mg once daily in patients with more severe heart failure. Double the dose every two weeks to the highest dosage level tolerated by the patient or up to 200 mg of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets.

Initial difficulty with titration should not preclude later attempts to introduce metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. If patients experience symptomatic bradycardia, reduce the dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. If transient worsening of heart failure occurs, consider treating with increased doses of diuretics, lowering the dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, or temporarily discontinuing it. The dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets should not be increased until symptoms of worsening heart failure have been stabilized.

2.4 Administration

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are scored and can be divided; however, do not crush or chew the whole or half tablet.

### Endothelial function is unaffected by changing between carvedilol and metoprolol in patients with heart failure – a randomized study [^11316tKt]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Carvedilol has been shown to be superior to metoprolol tartrate to improve clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF), yet the mechanisms responsible for these differences remain unclear. We examined if there were differences in endothelial function, insulin stimulated endothelial function, 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate during treatment with carvedilol, metoprolol tartrate and metoprolol succinate in patients with HF.

Methods

Twenty-seven patients with mild HF, all initially treated with carvedilol, were randomized to a two-month treatment with carvedilol, metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate. Venous occlusion plethysmography, 24-hour blood pressure and heart rate measurements were done before and after a two-month treatment period.

Results

Endothelium-dependent vasodilatation was not affected by changing from carvedilol to either metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate. The relative forearm blood flow at the highest dose of serotonin was 2.42 ± 0.33 in the carvedilol group at baseline and 2.14 ± 0.24 after two months continuation of carvedilol (P = 0.34); 2.57 ± 0.33 before metoprolol tartrate treatment and 2.42 ± 0.55 after treatment (p = 0.74) and in the metoprolol succinate group 1.82 ± 0.29 and 2.10 ± 0.37 before and after treatment, respectively (p = 0.27). Diurnal blood pressures as well as heart rate were also unchanged by changing from carvedilol to metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate.

Conclusion

Endothelial function remained unchanged when switching the beta blocker treatment from carvedilol to either metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate in this study, where blood pressure and heart rate also remained unchanged in patients with mild HF.

14.1 Hypertension

In a double-blind study, 1,092 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were randomized to once daily metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets (25, 100, or 400 mg), PLENDIL®(felodipine extended-release tablets), the combination, or placebo. After 9 weeks, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets alone decreased sitting blood pressure by 6 to 8/4 to 7 mmHg (placebo-corrected change from baseline) at 24 hours post-dose. The combination of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets with PLENDIL has greater effects on blood pressure.

In controlled clinical studies, an immediate-release dosage form of metoprolol was an effective antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant therapy with thiazide-type diuretics at dosages of 100 to 450 mg daily. metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, in dosages of 100 to 400 mg once daily, produces similar β1-blockade as conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily. In addition, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets administered at a dose of 50 mg once daily lowered blood pressure 24-hours post-dosing in placebo-controlled studies. In controlled, comparative, clinical studies, immediate-release metoprolol appeared comparable as an antihypertensive agent to propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazide-type diuretics, and affected both supine and standing blood pressure. Because of variable plasma levels attained with a given dose and lack of a consistent relationship of antihypertensive activity to drug plasma concentration, selection of proper dosage requires individual titration.

14.2 Angina Pectoris

In controlled clinical trials, an immediate-release formulation of metoprolol has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing the number of angina attacks and increasing exercise tolerance. The dosage used in these studies ranged from 100 to 400 mg daily. Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, in dosages of 100 to 400 mg once daily, has been shown to possess beta-blockade similar to conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily.

### Impact of CYP2D6 polymorphisms on clinical efficacy and tolerability of metoprolol tartrate [^115mQBd7]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Metoprolol is a selective β-1 adrenergic receptor blocker that undergoes extensive metabolism by the polymorphic enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Our objective was to investigate the influence of CYP2D6 polymorphisms on the efficacy and tolerability of metoprolol tartrate. Two hundred and eighty-one participants with uncomplicated hypertension received 50mg of metoprolol twice daily followed by response-guided titration to 100mg twice daily. Phenotypes were assigned based on results of CYP2D6 genotyping and copy number variation assays. Clinical response to metoprolol and adverse effect rates were analyzed in relation to CYP2D6 phenotypes using appropriate statistical tests. Heart rate response differed significantly by CYP2D6 phenotype (P < 0.0001), with poor and intermediate metabolizers showing greater reduction. However, blood pressure response and adverse effect rates were not significantly different by CYP2D6 phenotype. Other than a significant difference in heart rate response, CYP2D6 polymorphisms were not determinants of variability in metoprolol response or tolerability.

### Metoprolol tartrate (metoprolol tartrate) [^112GtPRn]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Digitalis glycosides and beta blockers: Both digitalis glycosides and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. Monitor heart rate and PR interval.

Calcium channel blockers: Concomitant administration of a beta-adrenergic antagonist with a calcium channel blocker may produce an additive reduction in myocardial contractility because of negative chronotropic and inotropic effects.

CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Potent inhibitors of the CYP2D6 enzyme may increase the plasma concentration of metoprolol tartrate which would mimic the pharmacokinetics of CYP2D6 poor metabolizer (see Pharmacokinetics section). Increase in plasma concentrations of metoprolol would decrease the cardioselectivity of metoprolol. Known clinically significant potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 are antidepressants such as fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, bupropion, clomipramine, and desipramine; antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, and thioridazine; antiarrhythmics such as quinidine or propafenone; antiretrovirals such as ritonavir; antihistamines such as diphenhydramine; antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine or quinidine; antifungals such as terbinafine.

Hydralazine: Concomitant administration of hydralazine may inhibit presystemic metabolism of metoprolol leading to increased concentrations of metoprolol.

Alpha-adrenergic agents: Antihypertensive effect of alpha-adrenergic blockers such as guanethidine, betanidine, reserpine, alpha-methyldopa or clonidine may be potentiated by beta-blockers including metoprolol tartrate. Beta-adrenergic blockers may also potentiate the postural hypotensive effect of the first dose of prazosin, probably by preventing reflex tachycardia. On the contrary, beta adrenergic blockers may also potentiate the hypertensive response to withdrawal of clonidine in patients receiving concomitant clonidine and beta-adrenergic blocker. If a patient is treated with clonidine and metoprolol tartrate concurrently, and clonidine treatment is to be discontinued, stop metoprolol tartrate several days before clonidine is withdrawn. Rebound hypertension that can follow withdrawal of clonidine may be increased in patients receiving concurrent beta-blocker treatment.

Ergot alkaloid: Concomitant administration with beta-blockers may enhance the vasoconstrictive action of ergot alkaloids.

Dipyridamole: In general, administration of a beta-blocker should be withheld before dipyridamole testing, with careful monitoring of heart rate following the dipyridamole injection.
