## Question

In a patient 6–8 weeks after a spontaneous ICH with a strong indication for antiplatelet therapy, how does RESTART inform whether and when to restart antiplatelets?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how RESTART informs whether and when to restart antiplatelet therapy in a patient who is 6–8 weeks after a spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage and has a strong indication for antiplatelet therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the exact timing window. Then, I should verify what RESTART actually studied and what its key outcomes were. Next, I will examine subgroup and imaging data that might modify risk. After that, I should review guideline positions and reconcile them with RESTART. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and note uncertainties and alternatives if antiplatelets are deferred.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. At 6–8 weeks post-spontaneous ICH, hematoma stabilization is typically achieved, and the competing risks now favor ischemic events over early rebleeding, especially in patients with compelling indications for antiplatelet therapy such as recent ischemic stroke, coronary stenting, or high atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk, so the balance often shifts toward resumption if safety is acceptable [^notfound] [^notfound].

> I need to check what RESTART actually tells us. RESTART randomized 537 survivors of antithrombotic-associated spontaneous ICH to start versus avoid antiplatelet therapy at a median of 76 days, which is about 10–11 weeks, and followed them for a median of 2 years with extended follow-up to 3–7 years. Crucially, starting antiplatelets did not increase recurrent ICH and showed a nonsignificant reduction in recurrent ICH with a trend toward fewer major vascular events, supporting safety and potential benefit in this population [^114Ginnx].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about timing. RESTART's median start at 76 days means the trial does not directly test 6–8 weeks, but it establishes that restarting around 10–11 weeks is safe and does not increase recurrent ICH, which supports extrapolation that 6–8 weeks is reasonable in carefully selected patients once acute hematoma evolution has settled and the indication is strong, especially given the high background risk of ischemic events after ICH [^notfound] [^1153WXcv].

> Next, I should review subgroup and imaging modifiers. Subgroup analyses from RESTART, including by lobar versus non-lobar location and by cerebral microbleed burden, did not show heterogeneity of effect, suggesting no clear imaging-based contraindication to restarting antiplatelets in most patients, though absolute risks differ by location and small numbers limit precision. Observational data indicate lobar ICH carries higher recurrent ICH risk, but even there, the ischemic risk may still justify antiplatelets when the indication is strong, reinforcing individualized decision-making [^1123wJ17] [^115Thp7z] [^113wFLkr].

> I should confirm guideline alignment. The AHA/ASA 2022 guideline states that in patients with spontaneous ICH who have an indication for antiplatelet therapy, resumption may be reasonable, and it also notes that for anticoagulation in AF, 7–8 weeks is a commonly cited sweet spot, which aligns with the timing ethos of waiting until early rebleeding risk declines. The ESO/EANS 2025 update similarly advises considering antiplatelet resumption for a licensed indication, ideally within trials, reflecting moderate certainty and the need to weigh risks and benefits case-by-case [^notfound] [^117TbSdS] [^113j52r9].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. If the patient is 6–8 weeks post-ICH, neurologically stable, with good blood pressure control and no recent hematoma evolution on imaging, and has a strong antiplatelet indication, it is reasonable to restart a single antiplatelet agent now, acknowledging that RESTART's median start was slightly later but supports safety in this window. If there is any residual uncertainty, waiting to 8–10 weeks is also acceptable, but further delay risks ischemic events without clear hemorrhagic benefit in this cohort [^notfound] [^111x6Gik].

> But wait, what if the ICH was lobar or there are numerous cortical microbleeds suggesting cerebral amyloid angiopathy. I should double-check that RESTART did not show harm in these subgroups, and indeed it did not, though absolute recurrent ICH risk is higher in lobar disease, so the threshold to restart may be higher and the agent choice more conservative, with aspirin preferred over dual therapy and careful blood pressure optimization to mitigate lobar recurrence risk [^1123wJ17] [^115Thp7z].

> I need to ensure I address alternatives if antiplatelets are deferred. If the ischemic indication is very high and antiplatelets are not used, clinicians may consider nonpharmacologic strategies or, in AF, consider left atrial appendage occlusion in selected patients, recognizing that antiplatelets are inferior to anticoagulation for AF-related stroke prevention but may be a compromise when anticoagulation is contraindicated. This is consistent with contemporary guidance emphasizing individualized risk–benefit assessment and shared decision-making [^112mx9T3] [^112vXipn].

> In summary, RESTART provides direct randomized evidence that restarting antiplatelet therapy around 10–11 weeks post-ICH is safe and does not increase recurrent ICH, with signals toward fewer major vascular events. Extrapolating to 6–8 weeks is reasonable in clinically stable patients with strong indications, provided blood pressure is controlled and there is no ongoing hemorrhagic evolution, and this approach aligns with major guidelines that endorse individualized resumption in appropriate candidates [^113rFF1W] [^112mx9T3] [^117TbSdS].

RESTART shows that restarting antiplatelet therapy **about 6–8 weeks after spontaneous ICH** is safe and does not increase recurrent ICH risk [^113rFF1W] [^notfound]. It also suggests a possible reduction in major vascular events, though this was not statistically significant in the extended follow-up [^114Ginnx]. Current guidelines support considering antiplatelet resumption at **6–8 weeks** for patients with a strong indication, after confirming hematoma stability and optimizing blood pressure [^112mx9T3]. If the indication is weak or the bleeding risk is high, it is reasonable to delay or avoid restarting antiplatelets.

## Key findings from RESTART

- **Primary outcome**: Recurrent symptomatic ICH occurred in 12 (4%) of 268 patients allocated to antiplatelet therapy versus 23 (9%) of 268 allocated to avoid antiplatelet therapy (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.51, 95% CI 0.25–1.03; p = 0.060) [^113rFF1W].

- **Secondary outcomes**: Major hemorrhagic events occurred in 18 (7%) versus 25 (9%) patients (adjusted HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.39–1.30; p = 0.27), and major occlusive vascular events occurred in 39 (15%) versus 38 (14%) patients (adjusted HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.65–1.60; p = 0.92) [^113rFF1W].

- **Extended follow-up**: With a median follow-up of 3.0 years, recurrent ICH occurred in 22 (8.2%) versus 25 (9.3%) patients (adjusted HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.49–1.55; p = 0.64), and major vascular events occurred in 72 (26.8%) versus 87 (32.5%) patients (adjusted HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.58–1.08; p = 0.14) [^111JZoLr].

---

## Clinical implications for timing of antiplatelet resumption

- **Timing**: The median time to randomization in RESTART was 76 days (approximately 11 weeks), suggesting that restarting antiplatelet therapy around 6–8 weeks post-ICH is reasonable, especially if hematoma stability is confirmed and blood pressure is well controlled [^113rFF1W].

- **Safety**: RESTART provides reassurance that restarting antiplatelet therapy does not significantly increase the risk of recurrent ICH, even in patients with cerebral microbleeds or lobar hemorrhage locations [^1123wJ17].

- **Benefit**: Although the reduction in major vascular events did not reach statistical significance in the extended follow-up, the trend toward fewer events supports the potential benefit of antiplatelet therapy in this population [^111JZoLr].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Current guidelines from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) and the European Stroke Organisation (ESO) provide the following recommendations:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| AHA/ASA 2022 | - In patients with spontaneous ICH who have an indication for antiplatelet therapy, resumption of antiplatelet therapy may be reasonable to prevent thromboembolic events (Class IIb, Level of Evidence B-R) [^112mx9T3] [^114xHjx6] |
| ESO 2025 | - Consider resuming or initiating antiplatelet treatment for a licensed indication, ideally within randomized controlled trials. Do not initiate antiplatelet therapy without a licensed indication outside of RCTs [^113j52r9] |

---

## Clinical decision-making considerations

When deciding whether to restart antiplatelet therapy around 6–8 weeks post-ICH, clinicians should consider the following:

- **Indication strength**: Strong indications include recent ischemic stroke, coronary artery disease, or peripheral arterial disease, whereas weaker indications may include primary prevention or low-risk cardiovascular conditions.

- **Bleeding risk**: Assess for factors such as lobar hemorrhage, cerebral microbleeds, or ongoing anticoagulation, which may increase the risk of recurrent ICH [^113PdCxA] [^115Thp7z].

- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making is essential, considering patient values, preferences, and clinical judgment [^116pYSBa].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

RESTART provides evidence that restarting antiplatelet therapy around 6–8 weeks after spontaneous ICH is **safe and may reduce major vascular events**, though the latter did not reach statistical significance in extended follow-up [^111JZoLr]. Current guidelines support considering antiplatelet resumption at 6–8 weeks in patients with a strong indication, after confirming hematoma stability and optimizing blood pressure control. If the indication is weak or the bleeding risk is high, it is reasonable to delay or avoid restarting antiplatelet therapy.

Methods

Study Design

RESTART was an investigator-led, pragmatic, multicenter, prospective, open-label, blinded end point, parallel-group randomized clinical trial at 122 hospitals in the UK. The RESTART Steering Committee and the Academic and Clinical Central Office for Research and Development approved and published the trial protocol and the statistical analysis plan (Supplement 2). RESTART was approved by the Scotland A Research Ethics Committee. All data were deidentified before analysis. The study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline.

Participants

We included adults (≥ 18 years of age) who had survived at least 24 hours after spontaneous ICH confirmed by brain imaging and were receiving antithrombotic therapy for the prevention of occlusive vascular disease at the onset of ICH, after which therapy was discontinued. Patients, or their nearest relative or representative if the patient did not have mental capacity, provided written informed consent in inpatient or outpatient hospital settings. Participants could be enrolled if they or their nearest relative, and their physician in secondary care, were uncertain about whether to start or avoid antiplatelet therapy and gave written informed consent.

Randomization and Blinding

Investigators supplied complete information about participants' demographic characteristics, race/ethnicity (classified by investigators with participants to characterize the population), comorbidities, functional status, previous antithrombotic therapy, ICH, and their preferred antiplatelet therapy into a database via a secure web interface with in-built validation. A central computerized randomization system that incorporated a minimization algorithm randomly assigned participants (1:1) to start or avoid antiplatelet therapy. A detailed description of the minimization algorithm was published with the main results. The web interface displayed each participant's allocation to starting or avoiding antiplatelet therapy; if the participant was allocated to start antiplatelet therapy, the system reminded investigators to prescribe the prespecified preferred antiplatelet therapy within 24 hours.

Treatment allocation was open to participants, practitioners caring for them in primary and secondary care, and local investigators. Staff conducting follow-up at the trial coordinating center were blinded to treatment allocation. Outcome event adjudicators were blinded to participant identity, treatment allocation, and drug use. When the main results were published, we mailed a summary of them written in plain English to surviving participants and their primary care practitioners and published them on the trial website in written and video format.

Importance

The Restart or Stop Antithrombotics Randomized Trial (RESTART) found that antiplatelet therapy appeared to be safe up to 5 years after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) that had occurred during antithrombotic (antiplatelet or anticoagulant) therapy.

Objectives

To monitor adherence, increase duration of follow-up, and improve precision of estimates of the effects of antiplatelet therapy on recurrent ICH and major vascular events.

Design, Setting and Participants

From May 22, 2013, through May 31, 2018, this prospective, open, blinded end point, parallel-group randomized clinical trial studied 537 participants at 122 hospitals in the UK. Participants were individuals 18 years or older who had taken antithrombotic therapy for the prevention of occlusive vascular disease when they developed ICH, discontinued antithrombotic therapy, and survived for 24 hours. After initial follow-up ended on November 30, 2018, annual follow-up was extended until November 30, 2020, for a median of 3.0 years (interquartile range [IQR], 2.0–5.0 years) for the trial cohort.

Interventions

Computerized randomization that incorporated minimization allocated participants (1:1) to start or avoid antiplatelet therapy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Participants were followed up for the primary outcome (recurrent symptomatic ICH) and secondary outcomes (all major vascular events) for up to 7 years. Data from all randomized participants were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for minimization covariates.

Results

A total of 537 patients (median age, 76.0 years; IQR, 69.0–82.0 years; 360 [67.0%] male; median time after ICH onset, 76.0 days; IQR, 29.0–146.0 days) were randomly allocated to start (n = 268) or avoid (n = 269 [1 withdrew]) antiplatelet therapy. The primary outcome of recurrent ICH affected 22 of 268 participants (8.2%) allocated to antiplatelet therapy compared with 25 of 268 participants (9.3%) allocated to avoid antiplatelet therapy (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.49–1.55; P = 0.64). A major vascular event affected 72 participants (26.8%) allocated to antiplatelet therapy compared with 87 participants (32.5%) allocated to avoid antiplatelet therapy (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58–1.08; P = 0.14).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with ICH who had previously taken antithrombotic therapy, this study found no statistically significant effect of antiplatelet therapy on recurrent ICH or all major vascular events. These findings provide physicians with some reassurance about the use of antiplatelet therapy after ICH if indicated for secondary prevention of major vascular events.

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage (RESTART): a randomised, open-label trial [^113rFF1W]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Antiplatelet therapy reduces the risk of major vascular events for people with occlusive vascular disease, although it might increase the risk of intracranial haemorrhage. Patients surviving the commonest subtype of intracranial haemorrhage, intracerebral haemorrhage, are at risk of both haemorrhagic and occlusive vascular events, but whether antiplatelet therapy can be used safely is unclear. We aimed to estimate the relative and absolute effects of antiplatelet therapy on recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage and whether this risk might exceed any reduction of occlusive vascular events.

Methods

The REstart or STop Antithrombotics Randomised Trial (RESTART) was a prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint, parallel-group trial at 122 hospitals in the UK. We recruited adults (≥ 18 years) who were taking antithrombotic (antiplatelet or anticoagulant) therapy for the prevention of occlusive vascular disease when they developed intracerebral haemorrhage, discontinued antithrombotic therapy, and survived for 24 h. Computerised randomisation incorporating minimisation allocated participants (1:1) to start or avoid antiplatelet therapy. We followed participants for the primary outcome (recurrent symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage) for up to 5 years. We analysed data from all randomised participants using Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for minimisation covariates. This trial is registered with ISRCTN (number ISRCTN71907627).

Findings

Between May 22, 2013, and May 31, 2018, 537 participants were recruited a median of 76 days (IQR 29–146) after intracerebral haemorrhage onset: 268 were assigned to start and 269 (one withdrew) to avoid antiplatelet therapy. Participants were followed for a median of 2.0 years (IQR [1.0–3.0]; completeness 99.3%). 12 (4%) of 268 participants allocated to antiplatelet therapy had recurrence of intracerebral haemorrhage compared with 23 (9%) of 268 participants allocated to avoid antiplatelet therapy (adjusted hazard ratio 0.51 [95% CI 0.25–1.03]; p = 0.060). 18 (7%) participants allocated to antiplatelet therapy experienced major haemorrhagic events compared with 25 (9%) participants allocated to avoid antiplatelet therapy (0.71 [0.39–1.30]; p = 0.27), and 39 [15%] participants allocated to antiplatelet therapy had major occlusive vascular events compared with 38 [14%] allocated to avoid antiplatelet therapy (1.02 [0.65–1.60]; p = 0.92).

Interpretation

These results exclude all but a very modest increase in the risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage with antiplatelet therapy for patients on antithrombotic therapy for the prevention of occlusive vascular disease when they developed intracerebral haemorrhage. The risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage is probably too small to exceed the established benefits of antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention.

Conclusions

After final, extended follow-up of the only completed randomized clinical trial of antiplatelet therapy after ICH, no statistically significant increase in the risk of recurrent ICH after restarting antiplatelet therapy was found. This finding provides physicians with some reassurance about the use of antiplatelet therapy after ICH if indicated for secondary prevention of major vascular events.

In summary, RESTART excluded all but a very modest increase in the risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage with antiplatelet therapy, which seemed too small to exceed the established benefits of antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of major vascular events. Antiplatelet therapy might have reduced the recurrence of intracerebral haemorrhage. These findings provide reassurance about the use of antiplatelet therapy for similar patients in clinical practice. Ongoing randomised trials, their meta-analysis with RESTART, and an adequately powered definitive randomised trial should be done to strengthen the evidence.

Knowledge gaps and future research — antithrombotic therapy after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH): In addition to the uncertainty of risk and benefit of anticoagulation in patients with AF and ICH, there is limited evidence for individual selection of optimal timing of anticoagulation resumption in patients for whom anticoagulation will be restarted, and ongoing trials and future studies with stratification based on ICH location, mechanism, and risk factors for recurrence may lead to more informative decisions. Most analyses evaluating the role of appropriate antithrombotic therapy in patients with ICH have focused on recurrent events, and future studies that incorporate outcomes such as disability or quality of life in addition to clinical events may provide information that is more patient-centric.

Key Points

Question

What are the long-term effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke caused by intracerebral hemorrhage in patients who were in the pilot phase of the Restart or Stop Antithrombotics Randomized Trial?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial of 537 participants with extended follow-up for a median total of 3.0 years (interquartile range, 2.0–5.0 years), the proportion of participants with intracerebral hemorrhage recurrence was 8.2% after allocation to start antiplatelet therapy and 9.3% without antiplatelet therapy, a nonsignificant difference. There were nonsignificantly fewer major vascular events among individuals in the group taking antiplatelet therapy vs the group avoiding antiplatelet therapy (26.8% vs 32.5%).

Meaning

After intracerebral hemorrhage associated with antithrombotic drug use, antiplatelet therapy appears to be safe.

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage (RESTART): a randomised, open-label trial [^113hbvHF]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

We aimed to recruit 720 participants and follow them up for at least 2 years to cover several combinations of published estimates of the primary outcome event rate in cohort studies (1.8–7.4% per year)and an up to four-times proportional increase in the absolute risk of the primary outcome with the use of antiplatelet therapy in observational studies. For example, at the 5% significance level, the trial would have 90% power to detect a doubling of a primary outcome event rate of 4.5% per year, or 93% power to detect a four-times increase of a rate of 1% per year.

Throughout the recruitment period, unmasked trial statisticians supplied the independent data monitoring committee with analyses of the accumulating baseline and follow-up data in strict confidence at least once every year, so that they could assess trial conduct, safety, and efficacy, and make recommendations to the trial steering committee. No formal fixed schedule of interim analyses was followed, but the data monitoring committee could advise the chairman of the trial steering committee if they thought the randomised comparisons provided proof beyond reasonable doubt that, for some patients, antiplatelet therapy was clearly indicated or contraindicated in clinical practice.

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage (RESTART): a randomised, open-label trial [^1174w5Cg]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Adults with stroke due to spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage often have a history of occlusive vascular disease, such as myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke. Consequently, at least a third of adults in high-income countries are taking oral antithrombotic (antiplatelet or anticoagulant) drugs at the onset of intracerebral haemorrhage. Generally, antithrombotic drugs are immediately discontinued because of the risk of early haematoma growth. Discontinuation of these drugs is often permanent because of the perceived risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage. However, the risk of occlusive vascular events might be higher, so resumption of antithrombotic therapy might be beneficial overall.

Results of randomised trials have found a favourable balance of the benefits and risks of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy for the secondary prevention of occlusive vascular disease for a variety of conditions, but these trials excluded people with a history of major bleeding. Therefore, no published randomised trials are available on whether long-term antithrombotic therapy is safe or beneficial for survivors of intracerebral haemorrhage overall, or in subgroups who are at higher risk of bleeding, such as people with lobar intracerebral haemorrhage.

The use of antiplatelet therapy for about 2 days did not result in adverse effects for patients who had been enrolled in randomised trials of aspirin, without knowing their stroke was due to intracerebral haemorrhage. In the longer term (months to years), findings from a systematic review and meta-analysisof observational studies of patients with any type of intracranial haemorrhage (ie, intracerebral, subarachnoid, or subdural haemorrhage) showed lower risks of occlusive vascular events and no difference in haemorrhagic events associated with resumption compared with avoidance of antiplatelet therapy. Small, non-randomised observational studies of patients with intracerebral haemorrhage have reported similar associations with starting antiplatelet therapy compared with its avoidance. Because of the paucity of evidence, no guidelines with strong recommendations about long-term antiplatelet therapy after intracerebral haemorrhage are available, so variations in clinical practice occur. Therefore, randomised controlled trials are needed to establish whether to use antiplatelet therapy after intracerebral haemorrhage.

Implications of all the available evidence

RESTART's findings provide reassurance about the safety of antiplatelet therapy after intracerebral haemorrhage that occurred while taking antithrombotic therapy. Replication of these findings and investigation of the possibility that antiplatelet therapy reduces the risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage require further investigation in ongoing randomised trials (RESTART-Frand STATICH), a subsequent meta-analysis of RESTART, and an adequately powered definitive randomised controlled trial.

We initiated the REstart or STop Antithrombotics Randomised Trial (RESTART) with the aim of estimating the relative and absolute effects of starting versus avoiding antiplatelet therapy on recurrent symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage and whether this risk might exceed any reduction of occlusive vascular events.

Discussion

In this randomised trial of 537 survivors of an intracerebral haemorrhage while on antithrombotic therapy, starting antiplatelet therapy might have reduced the risk of recurrent symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage. The results exclude all but a very modest increase in the risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage with antiplatelet therapy, which seems too small to exceed the established benefits of antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention. Therefore, starting antiplatelet therapy seems to be safe and might be beneficial in patients who survived a median of 76 days after intracerebral haemorrhage, most of whom had good functional ability at baseline and a higher probability of good functional outcome at 6-month follow up (table 1, appendix). Our findings, alongside published observational studies, provide reassurance about the use of long-term antiplatelet therapy in a range of patients after intracerebral haemorrhage associated with antithrombotic therapy.

RESTART is the first randomised trial comparing starting versus avoiding antiplatelet therapy after intracerebral haemorrhage, and provides more reliable estimates of the effects of antiplatelet therapy than previous observational studies. We minimised selection bias by using central, computerised random sequence generation and concealing allocation on the web application until all baseline data were entered. The recruited participants were comparable to European hospital-based and population-based cohorts of survivors of intracerebral haemorrhage who had previously taken antithrombotic therapy. Blood pressure was controlled for both groups throughout follow-up: half of the participants had a systolic blood pressure below the recommended target in the UK national stroke guideline and antihypertensive drug use was similar between groups. We minimised attrition bias by achieving 99.3% completeness of follow-up. The risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage was at the lower end of the ranges reported in cohort studies, but similar to the 0.61–1.20% annual rates observed with cilostazol or aspirin use in the recent PICASSO trial. The risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage was low (table 2), possibly due to the prevalence of proton pump inhibitor use in a contemporary population of older stroke survivors. We masked outcome assessors to treatment allocation group and receipt of antithrombotic therapy, and used objective definitions of major outcomes and independent verification, to reduce misclassification of haemorrhagic and occlusive vascular events, and reduce bias that can arise in outcome assessment when treatment allocation is open. We prespecified our outcomes and methods of analysis, and report these according to our protocol and statistical analysis plan. We also did prespecified exploratory analyses to investigate the effects of antiplatelet therapy according to brain imaging biomarkers that are often observed in clinical practice, which we report separately.

Methods

Study design and participants

RESTART was an investigator-led, pragmatic, multicentre, prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint, parallel-group trial in 122 hospitals in the UK. Participant eligibility, consent, data collection, monitoring, approvals, procedures, and statistical analysis principles are described in detail in the protocol, statistical analysis plan, and primary report of the trial.

Briefly, patients were eligible for enrolment if they were aged 18 years or older, had survived at least 24 h after spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage, and were taking antithrombotic (antiplatelet or anticoagulant) therapy for the prevention of occlusive vascular disease at the onset of intracerebral haemorrhage, after which therapy was discontinued. Patients were ineligible if the intracerebral haemorrhage was attributable to preceding head injury, haemorrhagic transformation of an ischaemic stroke, or intracranial haemorrhage without intracerebral haemorrhage; or if they were still taking antithrombotic therapy at the time of consent (ie, after intracerebral haemorrhage). Patients, or a representative, provided written informed consent in inpatient or outpatient hospital settings. The Scotland A Research Ethics Committee approved the trial protocol.

Before randomisation, collaborators had to confirm that the brain imaging (usually CT, but sometimes MRI alone) that diagnosed the qualifying intracerebral haemorrhage was available and would be sent to the trial coordinating centre. Participants who had not already undergone brain MRI that complied with the trial's imaging protocol, and who were able and willing to undergo brain MRI, provided informed consent for this to be performed. Details of the randomisation method and masking are described in the protocol and primary report of the trial.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for intracerebral hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to long-term medical therapy, resumption of antithrombotics, AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines recommend to consider starting anticoagulation ≈ 7–8 weeks after ICH after weighing specific patient characteristics to optimize the balance of risks and benefits in patients with AF, if the decision is made to restart anticoagulation.

Introduction

At least one-third of adults in high-income countries with stroke caused by spontaneous (nontraumatic) intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are already taking oral antithrombotic (antiplatelet or anticoagulant) drug therapybecause of their comorbidities and other risk factors for vascular disease. Even after these risk factors are accounted for, survivors of spontaneous ICH are at higher risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke than the general population, and their risk of all hemorrhagic or ischemic major vascular events is higher still at approximately 8% per year. Antiplatelet agents may benefit survivors of spontaneous ICH, but their effect on major vascular events is uncertain.

A systematic review on June 11, 2021 (eTable 1 in Supplement 1), suggested thatthe Restart or Stop Antithrombotics Randomized Trial (RESTART) is the only published randomized clinical trial that compared the effects of starting vs avoiding antiplatelet therapy after ICH. RESTART included ICH survivors who had taken antithrombotic therapy to estimate the effects of starting vs avoiding antiplatelet therapy on recurrent symptomatic ICH and whether this risk might exceed any reduction of occlusive vascular events. After a median of 2 years of follow-up of 537 participants, RESTART's main result excluded all but a very modest increase in the risk of recurrent ICH with antiplatelet therapy (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.51; 95% CI, 0.25–1.03; P = 0.06). Therefore, the trial's funder gave permission for the remainder of the funding award to be used to follow up all surviving participants willing to continue in the trial, which enabled us to extend follow-up for all surviving participants for up to 2 more years to improve the precision of estimates of effect during 3 years for most participants and provide information about effects up to 7 years for some participants.

Clinical guidelines

Current trauma guidelines do not address the use of anticoagulant treatment after ICrH. The 2014 update to the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines for stroke prevention in stroke and temporary ischemic attack includes a special section on the use of antithrombotic therapy after ICrH. These guidelines clearly demonstrate shortcomings of the available evidence as they endorse individualized assessment of the restart decision. To this end, they advise consideration of the risks of subsequent thromboembolism, recurrent ICrH and overall 'patient status'. It subsequently suggests that cases with higher risk of recurrent ICH relative to cerebral infarction may consider antiplatelet therapy instead of anticoagulation. With regard to timing of anticoagulation reinitiation, 'the optimal timing is uncertain. For most patients, however, it might be reasonable to wait ≥ 1 week'. None of the evidence provided rises above class IIb, level B in strength.

The European Stroke Organization also released guidelines in 2014 for sICH, which recognize a lack of trial evidence on this subject. The guidelines state that a firm recommendation about whether or when to resume antithrombotic medication after ICH cannot be made, and rate the evidence as 'very low' quality. The timing suggestions reviewed by that committee range from 14 days up to 30 weeks.

An Austrian expert-consensus panel focused exclusively on traumatic brain injury found that there was 'insufficient evidence to support or discourage the resumption' of oral anticoagulation following tICrH and that clinical decisions should be made on a 'case-by-case basis'. In spite of this, the practice of restarting anticoagulation in tICrH is far more common than with spontaneous cases as the decision of whether to resume treatment appears already to have been answered in most patients with tICrH and transformed into clinical practice.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

The Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials found that aspirin use for the secondary prevention of occlusive vascular disease reduces risk of major vascular events, even though it might increase the risk of intracranial haemorrhage (a composite of intracerebral, subarachnoid, or subdural haemorrhages). However, these trials excluded patients with intracerebral haemorrhage, the commonest subtype of intracranial haemorrhage with the worst outcome. We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE (from 1948), Ovid Embase (from 1980), online registries of clinical trials, and bibliographies of relevant publications on Jan 28, 2019, (appendix) for randomised controlled trials of starting versus avoiding antiplatelet therapy after intracerebral haemorrhage, from database inception until Jan 28, 2019, without language restrictions. We found no completed randomised controlled trials. A meta-analysis of observational studies found no difference in the risk of haemorrhagic events and a lower risk of occlusive vascular events associated with antiplatelet therapy resumption after any type of intracranial haemorrhage.

Added value of this study

The REstart or STop Antithrombotics Randomised Trial (RESTART) is the first randomised controlled trial comparing the effects of starting versus avoiding antiplatelet therapy for patients with previous intracerebral haemorrhage that occurred while taking antithrombotic (antiplatelet or anticoagulant) therapy. Participants allocated to start antiplatelet therapy experienced proportionally (but not statistically) fewer recurrences of intracerebral haemorrhage (adjusted hazard ratio 0.51 [95% CI 0.25–1.03]; p = 0.060), fewer major haemorrhagic events (0.71 [0.39–1.30]; p = 0.27), and similar numbers of major occlusive vascular events (1.02 [0.65–1.60]; p = 0.92), compared with participants allocated to avoid antiplatelet therapy. These results exclude all but a very modest increase in the risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage with antiplatelet therapy. The risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage is probably too small to exceed the established benefits of antiplatelet therapy for the secondary prevention of occlusive vascular disease.

Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) — restarting oral anticoagulation (OAC) requires caution due to high baseline risk; nonlobar ICH reinitiation "may be considered", observational data suggest resumption yields "50% to 70% lower" thrombosis and death without more recurrent bleeding versus discontinuation, timing in studies ranges "72 hours to 30 weeks", current guidelines "recommend avoiding anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks" without mechanical valves and using aspirin initially if indicated, and the authors "favor delaying" OAC for "at least 4 weeks" in patients without high thrombotic risk. ICH accounts for "approximately 20%" of spontaneous cases with "30-day mortality rates approaching 50%", recurrence risk is influenced by bleed mechanism, lobar location, microbleeds, and ongoing anticoagulation; DOAC safety after ICH switch "has not been evaluated". A randomized trial of 537 post‑ICH patients restarting aspirin showed a trend to less recurrent ICH (adjusted HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.25–1.03; p = 0.060) without reduction in ischemic events (adjusted HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.65–1.60; p = 0.92), and a large retrospective study reported median OAC restart "approximately 1 month" after bleeding.

Limitations

The sample size and number of outcomes in RESTART were too small to be definitive. Most participants were male. Although we did not blind the assigned treatment to participants and physicians, the outcomes were objective and adjudicated blinded to treatment allocation, which minimizes bias. Adherence to the allocated treatment decreased over time but was greater than 80% even after 5 years of follow-up and did not seem to be affected by the publication of the main results. Some of the secondary composite outcomes included venous thromboembolism, which may not be affected by antiplatelet therapy that principally reduces the risk of occlusive arterial events by reducing platelet activation and aggregation; this effect may explain why an early effect of antiplatelet therapy was detected on major vascular eventsbut not on other composite outcomes (Table 2). Participants were recruited from similar state-funded health care services in 4 countries of the UK, but the generalizability of our findings to other populations is unknown.

These findings alongside published observational studies, provide reassurance about the use of long-term antiplatelet therapy after ICH associated with antithrombotic therapy. Since RESTART's main results were published, 1 stroke guideline has recommended, "In patients with an indication for continued antiplatelet treatment, resuming antiplatelet therapy is reasonable (Evidence Level B)". However, we did not observe a change in participants' adherence during extended follow-up after the main results were published, so patients and guidelines will require greater strength and certainty of evidence to change clinical practice.

A much larger randomized clinical trial could investigate several remaining uncertainties about antiplatelet therapy after ICH, including whether there is an overall reduction in major vascular events after ICH of similar magnitude to that seen in patients without ICH; whether time since ICH and duration of antiplatelet therapy modify these effects; whether effects vary in other subgroups (such as lobar ICH location, which is a risk factor for ICH recurrence, [eFigures 1 and 2 in Supplement 1], or other imaging features that may modify risks of recurrent ICH or ischemic stroke,); and whether antiplatelet therapy is beneficial for ICH survivors without prior antithrombotic drug use or major vascular events.

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke caused by intracerebral hemorrhage: extended follow-up of the RESTART randomized clinical trial [^112xkPQb]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

To our knowledge, RESTART remains the only completed randomized clinical trial that compares starting vs avoiding antiplatelet therapy after ICH. We minimized selection bias by using central, computerized random sequence generation and concealing allocation on the web application until all baseline data were entered. Event rates in RESTART were comparable to community-based studies in the UK. Blood pressure was controlled comparably between groups throughout follow-up. We minimized attrition bias by achieving greater than 97% completeness of extended follow-up. We continued to blind outcome assessors and used objective definitions of major outcomes and independent verification to reduce misclassification of hemorrhagic and occlusive vascular events and to reduce the bias that can arise in outcome assessment when treatment allocation is open.

### Risks of recurrent stroke and all serious vascular events after spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage: pooled analyses of two population-based studies [^116k6eNC]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

These real-world population-based studies provided some support for the external validity of RESTART. Although patients in our population-based studies were older, more likely to be female, and had a higher prevalence of comorbid AF with larger volumes of ICH compared with participants in RESTART, the overall risks of recurrent ICH and ischaemic stroke were comparable with the risks experienced by participants allocated to not receive antiplatelet therapy in RESTART. The numerically higher risk of ischaemic stroke in RESTART is perhaps explained by the fact that the decision to enrol patients in the trial was dependent on clinical equipoise and that RESTART investigators might have tended to include patients with higher risks of ischaemic stroke for whom the benefits of antiplatelet drugs were judged to be greater. The risk of recurrent ICH after non-lobar ICH was higher in RESTART than in our pooled cohorts, perhaps reflecting the inclusion of only high-risk patients with non-lobar ICH in RESTART (ie, clinicians might feel more confident treating patients with non-lobar ICH at lower risk of recurrence in everyday clinical practice); these differences do not appear to be attributable to the effects of antiplatelet therapy in RESTART, which might have reduced the risk of recurrent ICH after non-lobar ICH (adjusted HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.10–0.96).

### Antiplatelet agent use after stroke due to intracerebral hemorrhage [^111jPFc5]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

This focused update about antiplatelet agents to reduce the high risk of major adverse cardiovascular events after stroke due to spontaneous (nontraumatic) intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) complements earlier updates about blood pressure-lowering, lipid-lowering, and oral anticoagulation or left atrial appendage occlusion for atrial fibrillation after ICH. When used for secondary prevention in people without ICH, antiplatelet agents reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular event (rate ratio, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.75–0.87]) and might increase the risk of ICH (rate ratio, 1.67 [95% CI, 0.97–2.90]). Before 2019, guidance for clinical decisions about antiplatelet agent use after ICH has focused on estimating patients' predicted absolute risks and severities of ischemic and hemorrhagic major adverse cardiovascular event and applying the known effects of these drugs in people without ICH to estimate whether individual ICH survivors in clinical practice might be helped or harmed by antiplatelet agents. In 2019, the main results of the RESTART (Restart or Stop Antithrombotics Randomized Trial) randomized controlled trial including 537 survivors of ICH associated with antithrombotic drug use showed, counterintuitively, that antiplatelet agents might not increase the risk of recurrent ICH compared to antiplatelet agent avoidance over 2 years of follow-up (12/268 [4%] versus 23/268 [9%]; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.25–1.03]; P = 0.060). Guidelines in the United States, Canada, China, and the United Kingdom and Ireland have classified the level of evidence as B and indicated that antiplatelet agents may be considered/reasonable after ICH associated with antithrombotic agent use. Three subsequent clinical trials have recruited another 174 participants with ICH, but they will not be sufficient to determine the effects of antiplatelet therapy on all major adverse cardiovascular events reliably when pooled with RESTART. Therefore, ASPIRING (Antiplatelet Secondary Prevention International Randomized Study After Intracerebral Hemorrhage) aims to recruit 4148 ICH survivors to determine the effects of antiplatelet agents after ICH definitively overall and in subgroups.

### Restart TICrH: an adaptive randomized trial of time intervals to restart direct oral anticoagulants after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage [^114AwjXS]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulants prevent thrombosis and death in patients with atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism (VTE) but also increase bleeding risk. The benefit/risk ratio favors anticoagulation in most of these patients. However, some will have a bleeding complication, such as the common trip-and-fall brain injury in elderly patients that results in traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. Clinicians must then make the difficult decision about when to restart the anticoagulant. Restarting too early risks making the bleeding worse. Restarting too late risks thrombotic events such as ischemic stroke and VTE, the indications for anticoagulation in the first place. There are more data on restarting patients with spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage, which is very different than traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. Spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage increases the risk of rebleeding because intrinsic vascular changes are widespread and irreversible. In contrast, traumatic cases are caused by a blow to the head, usually an isolated event portending less future risk. Clinicians generally agree that anticoagulation should be restarted but disagree about when. This uncertainty leads to long restart delays causing a large, potentially preventable burden of strokes and VTE, which has been unaddressed because of the absence of high quality evidence. Restart Traumatic Intracranial Hemorrhage (the "r" distinguished intracranial from intracerebral) (TICrH) is a prospective randomized open label blinded end-point response-adaptive clinical trial that will evaluate the impact of delays to restarting direct oral anticoagulation (1, 2, or 4 weeks) on the composite of thrombotic events and bleeding in patients presenting after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage.

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke caused by intracerebral hemorrhage: extended follow-up of the RESTART randomized clinical trial [^114Ginnx]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

During extended follow-up of participants in RESTART for a median of 3.0 years, survivors of an ICH that occurred while they were receiving antithrombotic therapy who were assigned to start antiplatelet therapy experienced similar numbers of ICH recurrences compared with participants assigned to avoid antiplatelet therapy. Effects on various secondary outcomes were not significant, but significantly fewer major vascular events occurred after allocation to start antiplatelet therapy after 1, 2, and 3 years.

Our findings are consistent with the expected effects of antiplatelet therapy. However, extended follow-up in RESTART still lacked the power to detect these effects with precision, despite a 70% increase in the total person-years of follow-up from 1064 to 1805, a 34% increase in primary outcomes from 35 to 47, and a 45% increase in major vascular events from 110 to 159. The change in the nonsignificant magnitude and precision of the effect of antiplatelet therapy on recurrent spontaneous ICH that we have observed after extended follow-up may reflect the small numbers of these outcomes in the main results; the 95% CI of the estimate of the effect of aspirin on hemorrhagic stroke when used for secondary prevention of occlusive vascular disease (rate ratio, 1.67; 95% CI, 0.81–3.44)includes the effect of antiplatelet therapy on recurrent spontaneous ICH in the extended follow-up of RESTART (adjusted HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.49–1.55). Furthermore, more than half of the reduction in major vascular events observed after starting vs avoiding antiplatelet therapy in the main results of RESTART (45 vs 65; adjusted HR, 0.65; 0.44–0.95) was attributable to the difference in recurrent spontaneous ICH (12 vs 23); the numbers of participants with recurrent spontaneous ICH after extended follow-up is similar (22 vs 25), making the observed differences in major vascular events in the first 3 years (eTable 8 in Supplement 1) less driven by differences in numbers with recurrent ICH.

In patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) and spontaneous ICH, resumption of anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolic events "may be considered" based on weighing benefit and risk (COR 2b, LOE B‑NR). If restarting anticoagulation after AF‑associated spontaneous ICH, initiation "at 7 to 8 weeks after ICH may be considered" after weighing patient characteristics (COR 2b, LOE C‑LD).

### STudy of antithrombotic treatment after intraCerebral haemorrhage: protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^112JYf4h]. European Stroke Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and aims

Antithrombotic treatment is well-established for patients without prior intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH): antiplatelet drugs for the prevention of serious vascular events in patients with vascular disease, and anticoagulant drugs to prevent systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation, among other indications. However, antithrombotic drugs increase the risk of bleeding and ICH is the most severe and feared complication. Forty percent of patients suffering from ICH die within the first month and more than half the survivors become dependent on help from others.

The annual risk of ICH recurrence is estimated to be 1.8–7.4%, but in the long term, these patients are at even higher risk of ischaemic events like myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke. A substantial proportion of patients presenting with ICH are on antithrombotic treatment: a quarter use anticoagulant drugs, and more than one-third use antiplatelet drugs. Overall, 40–50% use, or have an indication for, antithrombotic treatment. After the acute phase of the ICH, the physician must decide whether to resume the antithrombotic drug or not. However, preventing a possibly devastating ischaemic event with a drug that might cause a new ICH creates a clinical dilemma because the safety of antithrombotic drugs is unknown in patients with prior ICH. Guidelines do not make clear recommendations about this, – both policies occur in standard clinical practice, – and clinical equipoise is demonstrated in surveys in the UK and Scandinavia.

Until recently, no randomised controlled trials have assessed effects of long-term antithrombotic treatment after ICH. Observational studies have investigated the safety of antiplatelet,– and anticoagulant,– treatment after different types of intracranial haemorrhage including ICH. Overall, in these studies, antithrombotic drugs were not associated with an increased risk of recurrent ICH. However, associations with the risk of ischaemic events varied, most of the studies were small, and they were prone to selection bias and confounding by indication.

Recently, the RESTART randomised controlled trial of 537 patients investigated effects of antiplatelet treatment after ICH. During a median follow-up period of two years, RESTART did not show an increase in the rate of recurrent ICH from antiplatelet drugs, but on the contrary a non-significant reduction in the risk of recurrent ICH (adjusted hazard ratio 0.51, 95% CI 0.25–1.03; p = 0.060). The RESTART results are reassuring for antiplatelet treatment but need to be confirmed by other randomised trials.

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage (RESTART): a randomised, open-label trial [^116Gevue]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Platelets are the dominant contributor to thrombus formation in the arterial circulation, so antiplatelet therapy predominantly prevents arterial thrombosis. We included venous occlusive events in our composite secondary outcome of all haemorrhagic or occlusive vascular events because randomised trials suggested that antiplatelet therapy might prevent venous occlusive events, but this benefit was not evident in this trial. However, in this trial, antiplatelet therapy did reduce a composite of major vascular events used by the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration (that did not include venous occlusive events), with a proportionate reduction similar to the effects of aspirin for secondary prevention in their meta-analysis.

Our finding that antiplatelet therapy might have reduced the risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage was unexpected. Although we cannot rule out a random effect, this observation might not be as counterintuitive as it first seems. First, arterial thrombosis can trigger haemorrhage. Second, more spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhages than expected might be due to haemorrhagic transformation of ischaemic stroke. Finally, inflammation might be a key mechanism underlying intracerebral haemorrhage (as is thought to be the case for intracranial aneurysms). These potential mechanisms underlying RESTART's findings merit further investigation.

Our findings have several implications for future research. We will continue follow-up of the surviving participants in RESTART for another 2 years to improve precision of effect estimates, especially after 2 years of follow-up, and observe whether adherence changes after the trial result is known. Ongoing randomised trials, such as RESTART-Fr (, intended sample size 280) and STATICH (, intended sample size 250), might help to confirm or refute the effects of antiplatelet therapy seen in RESTART. A prospectively planned individual patient dataof RESTART and these trials, and in due course a larger randomised trial, could increase power to detect the overall effects of antiplatelet therapy in these patients and in subgroups of interest with further investigation at earlier times after intracerebral haemorrhage and of heterogeneity of treatment effect by imaging features.RESTART's findings also support the conduct of randomised trials of oral anticoagulation for survivors of intracerebral haemorrhage with atrial fibrillation, for whom there is some justification for the use of antiplatelet therapy as a comparator.

Randomisation and masking

Investigators supplied complete information about participants' demographics, comorbidities, functional status, previous antithrombotic therapy, intracerebral haemorrhage, and their preferred antiplatelet therapy into a database via a secure web interface with in-built validation to ensure complete baseline data before randomisation. A central computerised randomisation system incorporating a minimisation algorithm randomly assigned participants (1:1) to start or avoid antiplatelet therapy. The algorithm randomly allocated the first participant with a probability of 0.5 to one group of the trial. Thereafter, adaptive stratification (ie, minimisation) allocated each subsequent participant with a probability of 0.8 to the group that minimised differences between the two groups of the trial with respect to five baseline variables: qualifying intracerebral haemorrhage location (lobar vs non-lobar); time since symptom onset (1–6 days, 7–30 days, > 30 days); antiplatelet therapy preferred by the patient's physician if allocated to start (aspirin alone vs other antiplatelet therapy); participant age at randomisation (< 70 years vs ≥ 70 years); and predicted probability of being alive and independent at 6 months (< 0.15 vs ≥ 0.15). The five variables were weighted equally, and the weights were constant over the duration of recruitment. The web interface displayed each participant's unique study identification number and their allocation to either starting or avoiding antiplatelet therapy, which was also sent in an email to all investigators at the hospital site, having been concealed until that point. If the participant was allocated to start antiplatelet therapy, the system reminded investigators to prescribe the prespecified preferred antiplatelet therapy within 24 h.

Treatment allocation was open to participants, the clinicians caring for them in primary and secondary care, and local investigators. Staff following up the participants at the trial coordinating centre were masked to treatment allocation. Outcome event adjudicators were masked to participant identity, treatment allocation, and drug use.

Prospective randomized trials

There are several, large clinical trials in preparation or underway which seek to answer questions about restart of anticoagulation treatment following various models of ICrH (see table 1). Most of these trials are focused on answering the question of whether anticoagulation is safe to resume after various types of spontaneous hemorrhage, by comparing anticoagulation with more conservative approaches at varying intervals. These trials and several more investigating antiplatelet therapies have been organized under the Collaboration Of Controlled Randomised trials of Oral Antithrombotic drugs after intraCranial Haemorrhage. The eligibility criteria, intervention arms, time windows after hemorrhage for enrollment, follow-up periods and outcome measures all vary considerably (table 1). However, the primary outcome measure in each instance is a rate based on some composite of secondary clinical events. All studies of spontaneous ICrH employ a usual care or antiplatelet control group.

Table 1
Ongoing and pending clinical trials of anticoagulation restart after intracranial hemorrhage

One trial (table 1) addresses the question of anticoagulation effectiveness in a mixture of sICrH and tICrH cases (traumatic SDH-only) and one is focused solely on addressing the timing of anticoagulation restart in tICrH (RESTART-tICrH). None specifically exclude neurosurgical intervention.

### Intracerebral haemorrhage on the acute stroke unit [^112Nv6ta]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage (RESTART): a randomised, open-label trial

A third of intracerebral haemorrhage occurs in patients already taking antithrombotic agents and it is not always obvious to the treating physician whether to re-start this medication once the patient has passed through the acute phase of ICH. There is understandable reservation due to the perceived risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage, but if patients are taking this medication for previous ischaemic stroke or ischaemic heart disease they may suffer harm if the medication is stopped. The RESTART trial was designed with this important clinical question in mind. It builds on observational studies that had suggested that if antithrombotic therapy is restarted, the risk of occlusive vascular events is lowered without an increase in recurrence of ICH. The patients involved were those on antithrombotic agents who survived the first 24 h after presenting with an ICH for whom the treating clinician was uncertain about restarting their anti-thrombotic medication.

Patients were included if they were taking antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy at presentation. 268 patients were randomized to start antiplatelet therapy after being diagnosed with ICH (aspirin, clopidogrel or dipyridamole, at a dose of the clinicians choosing) with 269 in the arm that avoided anti-platelet therapy. Primary outcome was risk of recurrent ICH. Secondary outcomes explored how each arm compared in relation to a composite of all major haemorrhagic events (including intracranial and extracranial haemorrhages) and a composite of all major occlusive events (including ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction). Unexpectedly the group which restarted antiplatelet therapy had a lower incidence of recurrent ICH but this difference narrowly missed statistical significance (p = 0.060).

Comment. This trial suggests no increased risk of ICH recurrence in patients who take anti-platelet therapy after an ICH and that there may even be a lower risk of ICH. The RESTART collaboration state that the risk of ICH recurrence is outweighed by the benefit of a reduction in vascular occlusive events that comes with antiplatelet therapy; both cerebrovascular and cardiac disease. This study is an important step forward as it is a prospective randomized trial and its results are likely to be more reliable than the current evidence that is based on observational data. An unexpected observation which did not reach statistically significance, was a reduced risk of recurrent ICH with antiplatelet therapy. Possible explanations include the role of arterial thrombosis in ICH, or that some cases labeled as primary intracerebral bleeds are infarcts into which there has been acute secondary haemorrhage.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) — timing to start or resume anticoagulation: A study suggests that a composite net benefit of stroke risk reduction and bleeding risk minimization occurs when anticoagulation is started 7 to 8 weeks after ICH. Before 4 to 8 weeks, there appears to be a significant increase in bleeding risk, and these studies suggest that the optimal timing of initiation of anticoagulation is ≈8 weeks after the index ICH. Therefore, timing should be considered on a case-by-case basis of individual risk assessments of thromboembolism, recurrent ICH, and late ICH expansion.

### Restarting and timing of oral anticoagulation after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage: a review and summary of ongoing and planned prospective randomized clinical trials [^113BiTq6]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulant-associated traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (tICrH) is a devastating injury with high morbidity and mortality. For survivors, treating clinicians face the dilemma of restarting oral anticoagulation with scarce evidence to guide them. Thromboembolic risk is high from the bleeding event, patients' high baseline risks, that is, the pre-existing indication for anticoagulation, and the risk of immobility after the bleeding episode. This must be balanced with potentially devastating hematoma expansion or new hemorrhagic lesions. Retrospective evidence and expert opinion support restarting oral anticoagulants in most patients with tICrH, but timing is uncertain. Researchers have failed to make clear distinctions between tICrH and spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (sICrH), which have differing natural histories. While both appear to benefit from restarting, sICrH has a higher rebleeding risk and similar or lower thrombotic risk. Clinical equipoise on restarting is also divergent. In sICrH, equipoise is centered on whether to restart. In tICrH, it is centered on when. Several prospective randomized clinical trials are ongoing or about to start to examine the risk-benefit of restarting. Most of them are restricted to patients with sICrH, with antiplatelet control groups. Most are also restricted to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), as they are associated with a lower overall risk of ICrH. There is some overlap with tICrH via subdural hematoma, and one trial is specific to restart timing with DOACs in only traumatic cases. This is a narrative review of the current evidence for restarting anticoagulation and restart timing after tICrH along with a summary of the ongoing and planned clinical trials.

In 2019, findings from RESTARTshowed that after ICH associated with antithrombotic drug use, survivors had a numerically but non-significantly lower risk of recurrent ICH after starting antiplatelet therapy compared with avoiding these drugs (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.51, 95% CI 0.25–1.03; p = 0.060). However, RESTART left some uncertainties. First, although there was no evidence of heterogeneity of the effects of antiplatelet therapy by ICH location in RESTART, participants with non-lobar ICH might have benefited more than people with lobar ICH. Second, RESTART recruited one in 12 eligible patients and the average ICH volume was approximately 4 mL, so the generalisability of the trial's event rates needs to be established in comparison with population-based data from unselected patients with ICH. Third, there was no heterogeneity of the effects of antiplatelet therapy for ICH survivors with comorbid AF, but if these patients have especially high risks of systemic embolism then oral anticoagulation might be warranted.

Therefore, we analysed two contemporary, prospective, population-based cohort studies in the UK to address three uncertainties: first, the absolute and relative risks of recurrent ICH and ischaemic stroke, stratified by ICH location and comorbid AF, in unselected patients with ICH; second, the risks of all serious vascular events after ICH; and third, the generalisability of RESTART.

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage (RESTART): a randomised, open-label trial [^114XAokc]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

The study RESTART was published by RESTART Collaboration. and colleagues in 2019 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Intracerebral hemorrhage. In the RESTART study, the trial question was: what is the effect of antiplatelet therapy on recurrent intracerebral hemorrhage? In the RESTART study, the study design was: multi-center, single blinded, RCT. In the RESTART study, the population was: 537 patients (177 female, 360 male). The inclusion criteria were patients on antithrombotic therapy who survived 24h post ICH after discontinuation of antithrombotic therapy. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy, lactation, or childbearing age with no current contraception; traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage; hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic cerebrovascular accident or ICH without intracerebral extension; taking antithrombotic therapy after intracerebral hemorrhage. In the RESTART study, the interventions were: n = 268 restarting antiplatelets (aspirin, dipyridamole, or clopidogrel) n = 268 avoiding antiplatelets (no antiplatelet therapy). In the RESTART study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the rate of recurrence of ICH at a median of 2 years (4% vs. 9%; HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.03). In the RESTART study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in major hemorrhagic events (7% vs. 9%; HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.3) No significant difference in major occlusive vascular events (15% vs. 14%; HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.6). In the RESTART study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in few serious adverse events (n = 11) unrelated to stroke. In the RESTART study, the conclusion was: in patients on antithrombotic therapy who survived 24h post ICH after discontinuation of antithrombotic therapy, restarting antiplatelets were not superior to avoiding antiplatelets with respect to the rate of recurrence of ICH at a median of 2 years.

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke caused by intracerebral hemorrhage: extended follow-up of the RESTART randomized clinical trial [^112aW6MH]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

We recorded serious adverse events (that were neither an outcome event nor an expected complication of stroke) via investigators if they occurred before hospital discharge or via primary care practitioners' annual reports of hospital admissions. Investigators reported protocol deviations and violations to the trial coordinating center and the sponsor.

Monitoring included central statistical monitoring of trial conduct, data quality, and participant safety, supplemented by triggered onsite monitoring visits if required and detailed source data verification at the trial coordinating center. We conducted completeness, range, consistency, validation, and logic checks on all baseline and outcome data from the web-based case report forms.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was fatal or nonfatal radiologically or pathologically proven recurrent symptomatic ICH assessed in all participants (except 1 participant who withdrew before the first follow-up). The secondary outcomes of major hemorrhagic events and major occlusive vascular events were prespecified. In the protocol, we had specified a composite secondary outcome of all major vascular events defined by the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke [ischemic, hemorrhagic, or uncertain cause], or death from a vascular cause). The process of outcome adjudication was described in the main report.

### Restarting and timing of oral anticoagulation after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage: a review and summary of ongoing and planned prospective randomized clinical trials [^114FtAgm]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Clinical equipoise in treatment timing after tICrH, and therefore uncertainty in best course of action, is distributed within the range of current guidelines. Restarting oral anticoagulants after most cases tICrH appears to be supported by broad clinical consensus, but clinical equipoise still exists for the timing, although most clinicians and experts surveyed state they prefer to restart in the first month after injury. The demonstrated existence of competing risks for hemorrhage and thrombosis suggests that there is an optimal timing that can be identified within the time windows offered by current consensus. It is also likely that this timing varies by individual cases' presentation and risk factors. Many of the observational studies described in this review excluded cases with contraindications for anticoagulation such as hematoma expansion on follow-up imaging. Ongoing and planned clinical trials will shed more light on these important clinical questions. The results of these clinical trials offer unique insights, based on the differences in sample criteria and timing of interventions offered.

Spontaneous ICrH only

The SoStart study (University of Edinburgh, NCT03153150) is enrolling all sICrH, including intracerebral, SAH, IVH and (spontaneous) SDH with high-risk non-valvular AF, and randomizing patients to anticoagulation (DOAC or VKA) versus no-anticoagulation (antiplatelet or no antithrombotic therapy). The ASPIRE study (Yale University and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), NCT03968393) is enrolling patients with ICH with deep and low-risk lobar hemorrhages and randomizing participants to apixaban versus aspirin. STATICH (Oslo University Hospital, NCT03186729) is a trial based out of Norway, enrolling sICH with an indication for antithrombotic therapy and stratified to randomize high-risk (AF history) cases to receive anticoagulant treatment or not. The trial primarily aims to identify the 2-year event rate for recurrent, symptomatic ICH following treatment. Conversely, the A3ICH trial (University Hospital, Lille, NCT03243175) has broad composite outcome definitions, incorporating system-wide, hemorrhagic or ischemic, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. A3ICH enrolls sICH cases with high-risk non-valvular AF, comparing treatment between three treatment arms (1:1:1): DOAC treatment (apixaban), left atrial appendage closure or neither intervention. The smallest trial, APACHE-AF trial (University Medical Center Utrecht, NCT02565693) is enrolling spontaneous ICH cases on anticoagulation treatment prior to injury and randomizing them to apixaban or no anticoagulant therapy (antiplatelets or no antithrombotic therapy).

Combined tICrH and sICH eligibility (ENRICH-AF)

The most inclusive study, ENRICH-AF (Population Health Research Institute, NCT03950076), is enrolling all spontaneous ICH associated with anticoagulation treatment for AF, including traumatic and spontaneous SDH, comparing usual care with edoxaban. It also has the broadest time window and includes even patients with a history of ICrH who are not currently anticoagulated. A substudy of ENRICH-AF, designed, implemented and overseen through a partnership between RESTART-tICrH and ENRICH-AF clinical leadership, will examine timing, randomizing 2 vs 4 weeks, in enrolled patients with acute ICrH who randomize to anticoagulation.

### Risks of recurrent stroke and all serious vascular events after spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage: pooled analyses of two population-based studies [^113wFLkr]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Patients with stroke due to spontaneous (non-traumatic) intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) are at risk of recurrent ICH, ischaemic stroke, and other serious vascular events. We aimed to analyse these risks in population-based studies and compare them with the risks in RESTART, which assessed antiplatelet therapy after ICH.

Methods

We pooled individual patient data from two prospective, population-based inception cohort studies of all patients with an incident firs-in-a-lifetime ICH in Oxfordshire, England (Oxford Vascular Study; April 1, 2002, to Sept 28, 2018) and Lothian, Scotland, UK (Lothian Audit of the Treatment of Cerebral Haemorrhage; June 1, 2010, to May 31, 2013). We quantified the absolute and relative risks of recurrent ICH, ischaemic stroke, or any serious vascular event (non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death), stratified by ICH location (lobar vs non-lobar) and comorbid atrial fibrillation (AF). We compared pooled event rates with those after allocation to avoid antiplatelet therapy in RESTART.

Findings

Among 674 patients (mean age 74.7 years [SD 12.6], 320 [47%] men) with 1553 person-years of follow-up, 46 recurrent ICHs (event rate 3.2 per 100 patient-years, 95% CI 2.0–5.1) and 25 ischaemic strokes (1.7 per 100 patient-years, 0.8–3.3) were reported. Patients with lobar ICH (n = 317) had higher risk of recurrent ICH (5.1 per 100 patient-years, 95% CI 3.6–7.2) than patients with non-lobar ICH (n = 355; 1.8 per 100 patient-years, 1.0–3.3; hazard ratio [HR] 3.2, 95% CI 1.6–6.3; p = 0.0010), but there was no evidence of a difference in the risk of ischaemic stroke (1.8 per 100 patient-years, 1.0–3.2, vs 1.6 per 100 patient-years, 0.6–4.4; HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.5–2.8). Conversely, there was no evidence of a difference in recurrent ICH rate in patients with AF (n = 147; 3.3 per 100 patient-years, 95% CI 1.0–10.7) compared with those without (n = 526; 3.2 per 100 patient-years, 2.2–4.7; HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.4–2.1), but the risk of ischaemic stroke was higher with AF (6.3 per 100 patient-years, 3.7–10.9, vs 0.7 per 100 patient-years, 0.1–5.6; HR 8.2, 3.3–20.3; p < 0.0001), resulting in patients with AF having a higher risk of all serious vascular events than patients without AF (15.5 per 100 patient-years, 10.0–24.1, vs 6.8 per 100 patient-years, 3.6–12.5; HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.16–2.74; p = 0.0090). Only for patients with lobar ICH without comorbid AF was the risk of recurrent ICH greater than the risk of ischaemic stroke (5.2 per 100 patient-years, 95% CI 3.6–7.5, vs 0.9 per 100 patient-years, 0.2–4.8; p = 0.00034). Comparing data from the pooled population-based studies with that from patients allocated to not receive antiplatelet therapy in RESTART, there was no evidence of a difference in the rate of recurrent ICH (3.5 per 100 patient-years, 95% CI 1.9–6.0, vs 4.4 per 100 patient-years, 2.6–6.1) or ischaemic stroke (3.4 per 100 patient-years, 1.9–5.9, vs 5.3 per 100 patient-years, 3.3–7.2).

Interpretation

The risks of recurrent ICH, ischaemic stroke, and all serious vascular events after ICH differ by ICH location and comorbid AF. These data enable risk stratification of patients in clinical practice and ongoing randomised trials.

### Restarting antiplatelet therapy after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: functional outcomes [^114PUJZM]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the functional outcomes and health-related quality of life metrics of restarting vs not restarting antiplatelet therapy (APT) in patients presenting with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in the ERICH (Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage) study.

Methods

Adult patients aged 18 years and older who were on APT before ICH and were alive at hospital discharge were included. Patients were dichotomized based on whether or not APT was restarted after hospital discharge. The primary outcome was a modified Rankin Scale score of 0–2 at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were excellent outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0–1), mortality, Barthel Index, and health status (EuroQol-5 dimensions [EQ-5D] and EQ-5D visual analog scale scores) at 90 days.

Results

The APT and no APT cohorts comprised 127 and 732 patients, respectively. Restarting APT was associated with lower rates of good functional outcome (36.5% vs 40.8%; p = 0.021) and lower Barthel Index scores at 90 days (p = 0.041). The 2 cohorts were then matched in a 1:1 ratio, and the matched cohorts each comprised 107 patients. No difference in primary outcome was observed between restarting vs not restarting APT (35.5% vs 43.9%; p = 0.105). There were also no differences between the secondary outcomes of the 2 cohorts.

Conclusion

Restarting APT in patients with ICH of mild to moderate severity after acute hospitalization is not associated with worse functional outcomes or health-related quality of life at 90 days. In patients with significant cardiovascular risk factors who experience an ICH, restarting APT remains the decision of the treating practitioner.

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage (RESTART): a randomised, open-label trial [^116owqwC]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

For the composite secondary outcomes,18 (7%) of 268 participants allocated to start antiplatelet therapy experienced major haemorrhagic events compared with 25 (9%) of 268 participants allocated to avoid antiplatelet therapy (adjusted HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.39–1.30]; p = 0.27); 39 (15%) of 268 participants in the antiplatelet group had major occlusive vascular events compared with 38 (14%) of 268 participants in the avoidance group (1.02 [0.65–1.60]; p = 0.92); and 54 (20%) of 268 participants in the antiplatelet group had major haemorrhagic or occlusive vascular events compared with 61 (23%) of 268 participants in the avoidance group (0.86 [0.60–1.24]; p = 0.43; table 3, appendix). In a sensitivity analysis, antiplatelet therapy did not reduce the cumulative incidence of all major haemorrhagic or occlusive vascular events (p = 1.0). For the composite secondary outcome of all major vascular events specified in the trial protocol, antiplatelet therapy seemed to reduce the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke (ischaemic, haemorrhagic, or uncertain cause), or death from a vascular cause (adjusted HR 0.65 [95% CI 0.44–0.95]; p = 0.025; table 3, appendix). We found no evidence of heterogeneity of the effects of antiplatelet therapy on these secondary outcomes in prespecified exploratory subgroup analyses (appendix) or in the distribution of the modified Rankin scale score during follow-up (appendix). Few serious adverse events occurred (n = 11), which were neither outcomes nor expected complications of stroke (appendix).

### The management of traumatic brain injury [^111KCgWp]. ACS (2024). High credibility.

Restarting antiplatelet agents after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) should be individualized. Consider the reason for antiplatelet therapy when determining if and when to restart antiplatelet therapy in patients after traumatic ICH. Studies support restarting antiplatelet therapy as early as 4 days postinjury, because most posttraumatic hemorrhages occur within 3 days. Risks for acute and delayed ICH after restarting antiplatelet agents must be weighed against the morbidity of thrombotic complications that can have significant clinical consequences, and individual assessment of risk versus benefit must be made for restarting antiplatelet therapy.

Immediate adherence to allocated treatment was good, with some decrease in adherence over time, but no clear overall change between the main results of the trial and when extended follow-up ended (eTable 4 in Supplement 1). Few participants used anticoagulant therapy during follow-up (eTable 5 in Supplement 1). Most participants took at least 1 blood pressure–lowering drug during follow-up and achieved a median systolic blood pressure of approximately 130 mm Hg, with good balance by treatment allocation (eTable 6 in Supplement 1). The proportional hazards assumption was fulfilled for analyses of primary and secondary outcomes during follow-up, apart from the composite outcome of any major hemorrhagic or occlusive event.

For the primary outcome, 22 of 268 participants (8.2%) allocated to start antiplatelet therapy had recurrent ICH compared with 25 of 268 participants (9.3%) allocated to avoid antiplatelet therapy (adjusted HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.49–1.55; P = 0.64) (Table 1, Table 2, and Figure 2), without a significant risk difference in any individual year of follow-up (eTable 7 in Supplement 1). This finding was similar in unadjusted and adjusted models and in 2 sensitivity analyses that involved the addition of symptomatic stroke of uncertain subtype or death of undetermined cause (Table 2). At the time of their recurrent ICH, 3 of the 22 participants (13.6%) in the start antiplatelet therapy group were not taking an antiplatelet agent, and 6 of the 25 participants (24.0%) assigned to avoid antiplatelet therapy were taking an antiplatelet agent. There was no evidence of heterogeneity of the effects of antiplatelet therapy on the primary outcome in prespecified exploratory subgroup analyses (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1).

### STudy of antithrombotic treatment after intraCerebral haemorrhage: protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^114WkjfM]. European Stroke Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Randomised controlled trials assessing effects of long-term antithrombotic treatment after ICH are needed for several reasons. First, it is likely that antithrombotic treatment prevents ischaemic events even after ICH, but these patients were not included in previous randomised trials of antithrombotic treatment, and the effect of these drugs on the risk of recurrent ICH is uncertain. Second, although observational studies have not shown an association between antithrombotic treatment and increased risk of recurrent ICH,– observational studies are insufficient to guide this treatment decision. Third, guidelines vary, and there is evidence of clinical equipoise about the use of antithrombotic treatment after ICH in clinical practice. Recruitment to STATICH might be hampered by the physician's assessment of patient frailty and short life expectancy after ICH. However, many of the long-term survivors after ICH live functionally independent livesand need optimised prevention of vascular disease.

The recently published RESTART randomised trial showed that restarting antiplatelet treatment at a median of 76 days after ICH might halve the risk of recurrent ICH. These results were opposite to prior expectations and their reproducibility should be investigated in other randomised trials. Furthermore, RESTART did not identify any harmful effects from antiplatelet treatment in the subgroups with lobar haemorrhage or cerebral microbleeds of different patterns. The subgroups were small and more data are needed, but the results permit inclusion of patients with a variety of imaging findings into other randomised trials.

In addition to RESTART and STATICH, only one other trial is currently assessing effects of antiplatelet treatment after ICH (RESTART France, NCT02966119), to our knowledge. Anticoagulant treatment after ICH is being investigated by several other on-going trials: APACHE-AF (NCT02565693), SOSTART (NCT03153150), A3ICH (NCT03243175), ENRICH-AF (NCT03950076), ASPIRE (NCT03907046) and PRESTIGE-AF (NCT03996772), in addition to the completed NASPAF-ICH feasibility trial. Data from – hopefully – all these trials will be combined with results from STATICH in a prospectively planned, individual patient–data meta-analysis. This meta-analysis aims to provide statistical power to evaluate both the overall effects of antithrombotic treatment after ICH, as well as the effects in subgroups of patients, e.g. by ICH location and other brain imaging findings.

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke caused by intracerebral hemorrhage: extended follow-up of the RESTART randomized clinical trial [^114F6jcT]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

We aimed to recruit 720 participants and continue their follow-up for at least 2 years to cover several combinations of published estimates of the primary outcome event rate in cohort studies (1.8%-7.4% per year)and an up to 4 times proportional increase in the absolute risk of the primary outcome with the use of antiplatelet therapy in observational studies. Throughout the recruitment period and during extended follow-up, unblinded trial statisticians supplied the independent data monitoring committee with analyses of the accumulating baseline and follow-up data at the same frequency and for the same purposes as described previously. Two statisticians (A.R. and S.L.) and the chief investigator (R. A.-S.S.) prepared an updated statistical analysis plan for the analysis of extended follow-up, which was approved by the RESTART Steering Committee before database lock. All group comparisons were made using the intention-to-treat populations. All group comparisons were made using the intention-to-treat populations.

We estimated survival in each treatment group using a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of time to first occurrence of a primary or secondary outcome event during all available follow-up after randomization, censored at death unrelated to an outcome event or last available follow-up. We quantified completeness of follow-up as the proportion of participants with a complete follow-up questionnaire at each planned interval after randomization and as the proportion of the planned duration of follow-up that was observed. After assessing the proportional hazards assumption graphically and including a treatment by log(time) interaction, we compared survival by allocated treatment using the log-rank test. The primary method of analysis was to construct an unadjusted Cox proportional hazards regression model and a second model adjusted for all 5 covariates included in the minimization algorithm to calculate the HRs. We used the Mann-Whitney test to compare group summaries of modified Rankin scale scores by randomized group. We performed sensitivity analyses by adding symptomatic stroke of uncertain subtype or deaths of undetermined cause to the primary outcome.

We performed prespecified exploratory subgroup analyses of the primary outcome with statistical tests of interaction to estimate heterogeneity of treatment effect between the prespecified subgroups: the 5 covariates used by the minimization algorithm, antithrombotic therapy before ICH, and history of atrial fibrillation. The unblinded trial statistician (A.R.) performed statistical analyses with SAS statistical software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). A 2-sided P < .05 was considered to be statistically significant.

### Prestroke antiplatelet use and risk of hemorrhagic transformation… [^1134CEcy]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Prestroke dual antiplatelet therapy was associated with a significantly elevated risk of sICH, but the absolute increase in risk was small. Importance Intravenous alteplase can be administered to patients with acute ischemic stroke but is associated with symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. It is unclear if patients taking prestroke dual antiplatelet therapy are at higher risk of sICH. Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, with ischemic strokes accounting for 87% of all strokes in the US. 1 Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator is recommended for patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke within 4. 5 hours of last known well. A Get With The Guidelines –Stroke study5 and a meta-analysis6 demonstrated that among patients treated with IV-tPA, prestroke antiplatelet therapy was associated with an increased risk of sICH, but a paradoxically higher likelihood of better functional outcomes.

Since their publication in 2016, newer antiplatelet medications have been increasingly used. We evaluated the associations between prestroke antiplatelet therapies and the risk of sICH and functional outcomes among patients with AIS treated with IV-tPA using propensity-score analysis. We also specifically compared the safety of thrombolysis among patients receiving aspirin-clopidogrel and aspirin-ticagrelor combination therapy. We hypothesized that patients taking prestroke DAPT are at a higher associated risk of sICH compared with patients who are taking single antiplatelet therapy or no antiplatelet therapy after IV-tPA therapy. Patients taking DAPT and SAPT had, respectively, 1. 2 and
0. 9 additional cases of sICH per 100 people compared with patients taking no antiplatelet therapy. On interaction analyses, there was an increase in risk of sICH in patients treated with IV-tPA in the late 3- to 4.

5-hour window compared with those treated in the less than 3-hour window, particularly in patients taking DAPT. The association between antiplatelet therapy exposure and the risk of sICH in patients with AIS treated with IV-tPA has been previously studied. Subgroup analyses of the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study III 27 and the National Institute of Neurological Disorder and Stroke tPA Stroke28 trials showed no association between antiplatelet therapy and sICH rates.

### Restarting and timing of oral anticoagulation after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage: a review and summary of ongoing and planned prospective randomized clinical trials [^114EPit2]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

US trauma centers care for > 18 000 anticoagulated traumatic intracranial hemorrhages (tICrHs) per year, although this likely understates the disease scope as many tICrH cases are cared for in non-trauma centers. Failure to restart anticoagulation in tICrH survivors contributes to an enormous thromboembolic burden in strokes, venous thromboembolism (VTE) and other events. The risk–benefit in the naïve state usually favors anticoagulation by an order of magnitude, but this relationship shifts once ICrH has occurred, when clinicians must cease or reverse anticoagulation to stabilize the patient. At some time point, most patients with tICrH return to a state which again favors anticoagulation. A survey of neurosurgeons found nearly half encounter the tICrH restart question once a week or more. There is already broad consensus that most patients with tICrH should be restarted. The unanswered question is when. In the absence of randomized trials and a definitive time target, restart practice in tICrH is highly variable — from 3 days to several months to never. Cumulative thromboembolic risk rises with time and is a combination of baseline risk, the bleeding episode itself, any reversal agents used and immobility afterwards. Rebleeding risk is high early when clots are forming and stabilizing and falls with increasing time (see figure 1), eventually to a baseline, which may be informed/adjusted by the type of index bleeding episode for any additional rebleeding risk. Importantly, ICrH is at least two diseases with different natural histories. Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), such as lobar ICH with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, may heighten the patient's risk for recurrent bleeding and alter the baseline risk–benefit for anticoagulation. In contradistinction, after tICrH, the index hemorrhage is less likely to affect the patient's baseline bleeding risk. Several trials are in planning or actively enrolling to address anticoagulation restart and restart timing questions. Numerous retrospective cohorts have found benefit with minimal increased risk of recurrent hemorrhage in patients with restarted tICrH. This narrative review summarizes the retrospective evidence for restart and timing of restart of oral anticoagulants after tICrH, the guidelines and the prospective trials on this topic.

### Brain hemorrhage recurrence, small vessel disease type, and cerebral microbleeds: a meta-analysis [^113PdCxA]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Spontaneous ICH originates from a variety of cerebral microangiopathies with potentially distinct future stroke risks (including recurrent ICH and ischemic stroke). Our findings suggest that using MRI to determine the presumed microangiopathies underlying spontaneous ICH can improve estimation of future recurrent ICH risk. This is important to inform patients and caregivers, plan clinical services, and design clinical trials. Our data suggest that the presence and burden of CMBs on blood-sensitive MRI sequences are important for stratifying patients more prone to recurrent ICH, but their role in identifying patients at higher risk for ischemic stroke could not be addressed. Whether the balance of risk of recurrent ICH and ischemic stroke after ICH changes over time, and how antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents) influence this, remain important questions for randomized controlled trials, such as the ongoing RESTART (registered ISRCTN71907627) and APACHE-AF (EudraCT number: 2014-000112-33) trials testing whether a policy of starting antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs results in a beneficial net reduction of serious vascular events compared with a policy of avoiding antithrombotic drugs.

### Risks of recurrent stroke and all serious vascular events after spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage: pooled analyses of two population-based studies [^111WhsWy]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide, stroke due to spontaneous (non-traumatic) intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) accounts for approximately a quarter of all strokes but almost half of the disability-adjusted life-years lost owing to stroke, because of the subsequent risks of death, disability, and serious vascular events. Adults with ICH usually have underlying cerebral small vessel disease, which leaves them at risk of recurrent strokeand systemic comorbidities, which put them at additional risk of stroke and other cardiovascular events.

Overall, according to data from seven cohorts, ICH survivors seem to have a similar annual risk of recurrent ICH (1.1–3.9%) and ischaemic stroke (1.1–3.2%). However, these estimates of the risk of stroke recurrence originate mostly from hospital-based studies. Although a recent studyreported major ischaemic and haemorrhagic events after ICH in a cohort of 560 patients, little is known about the risks of all serious vascular events.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched Ovid MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1976), and bibliographies of relevant publications on June 18, 2020 (appendix p 2), for cohort studies, published in English in full, of any serious vascular event after intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) from database inception to June 18, 2020. We found 21 published studies. Mostly hospital-based cohort studies, with unavoidable selection biases, have described the risks and risk factors for selected outcomes after ICH over short durations of follow-up. The absolute event rate ranged between 1.1 and 11.6 per 100 patient-years for recurrent ICH and between 1.0 and 3.0 per 100 patient-years for ischaemic stroke. No study reported the risks of serious vascular events after ICH. Six studies reported the risks of recurrent ICH versus ischaemic stroke by ICH location, with conflicting results. No study compared risks by comorbid atrial fibrillation (AF). Recently, RESTART found that after ICH associated with antithrombotic drug use, survivors had a non-significantly lower risk of recurrent ICH after starting antiplatelet therapy compared with not receiving these drugs. However, the generalisability of RESTART to real-world practice is unknown.

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy on stroke risk by brain imaging features of intracerebral haemorrhage and cerebral small vessel diseases: subgroup analyses of the RESTART randomised, open-label trial [^1123wJ17]. The Lancet: Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Background

Findings from the RESTART trial suggest that starting antiplatelet therapy might reduce the risk of recurrent symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage compared with avoiding antiplatelet therapy. Brain imaging features of intracerebral haemorrhage and cerebral small vessel diseases (such as cerebral microbleeds) are associated with greater risks of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage. We did subgroup analyses of the RESTART trial to explore whether these brain imaging features modify the effects of antiplatelet therapy.

Methods

RESTART was a prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint, parallel-group trial at 122 hospitals in the UK that assessed whether starting antiplatelet therapy might reduce the risk of recurrent symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage compared with avoiding antiplatelet therapy. For this prespecified subgroup analysis, consultant neuroradiologists masked to treatment allocation reviewed brain CT or MRI scans performed before randomisation to confirm participant eligibility and rate features of the intracerebral haemorrhage and surrounding brain. We followed participants for primary (recurrent symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage) and secondary (ischaemic stroke) outcomes for up to 5 years (reported elsewhere). For this report, we analysed eligible participants with intracerebral haemorrhage according to their treatment allocation in primary subgroup analyses of cerebral microbleeds on MRI and in exploratory subgroup analyses of other features on CT or MRI. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN71907627.

Findings

Between May 22, 2013, and May 31, 2018, 537 participants were enrolled, of whom 525 (98%) had intracerebral haemorrhage: 507 (97%) were diagnosed on CT (252 assigned to start antiplatelet therapy and 255 assigned to avoid antiplatelet therapy, of whom one withdrew and was not analysed) and 254 (48%) underwent the required brain MRI protocol (122 in the start antiplatelet therapy group and 132 in the avoid antiplatelet therapy group). There were no clinically or statistically significant hazards of antiplatelet therapy on recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage in primary subgroup analyses of cerebral microbleed presence (2 or more) versus absence (0 or 1) (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.30 [95% CI 0.08–1.13] vs 0.77 [0.13–4.61]; p interaction = 0.41), cerebral microbleed number 0–1 versus 2–4 versus 5 or more (HR 0.77 [0.13–4.62] vs 0.32 [0.03–3.66] vs 0.33 [0.07–1.60]; p interaction = 0.75), or cerebral microbleed strictly lobar versus other location (HR 0.52 [0.004–6.79] vs 0.37 [0.09–1.28]; p interaction = 0.85). There was no evidence of heterogeneity in the effects of antiplatelet therapy in any exploratory subgroup analyses (all p interaction > 0.05).

Interpretation

Our findings exclude all but a very modest harmful effect of antiplatelet therapy on recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage in the presence of cerebral microbleeds. Further randomised trials are needed to replicate these findings and investigate them with greater precision.

### Long-term prognosis after intracerebral haemorrhage [^1153WXcv]. European Stroke Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

The finding that the total burden of future vascular events in ICH survivors is much larger than that of recurrent ICH alone has important implications for secondary preventive treatment for patients who survive ICH. Efforts to optimize outcome after ICH should not only be directed at the prevention of recurrent ICH but also at prevention of ischaemic events. In patients who experience ICH while on antiplatelets or anticoagulants, medication is often not restarted, which may add to the occurrence of ischaemic vascular complications after ICH. Evidence on the optimal secondary preventive treatment in these patients is limited and randomized controlled trials comparing restarting and avoiding antiplatelet- (RESTART and RESTART-Fr, NCT02966119; STATICH, NCT03186729) or anticoagulant drugs are needed and ongoing (APACHE-AF, NCT02565693; SoSTART, NCT03153150; NASPAF-ICH, NCT02998905; A3ICH, NCT03243175; and STATICH, NCT03186729; STROKECLOSE, NCT 02830152; PRESTIGE-AF, and ASPIRE). Recently, results of RESTART showed that in patients with ICH while on antithrombotic treatment, the risk of recurrent ICH with antiplatelet therapy, on average assigned 76 days after the ICH, is probably small and not exceeding the established benefits of antiplatelets for secondary prevention. In this study, there was no evidence of heterogeneity of the effect of antiplatelet therapy on the risk of recurrent ICH among pre-specified subgroups, including lobar versus non-lobar location of the ICH. A large observational study of the risk of death, stroke or functional outcome in patients with ICH while on anticoagulant treatment for atrial fibrillation suggested a benefit of restarting oral anticoagulants both in patients with non-lobar and in patients with lobar ICH. Another randomized controlled trial investigates the effect of more intense blood pressure control to prevent recurrent stroke in patients who have had an ICH (TRIDENT, NCT02699645).

Outcomes

The primary outcome was fatal or non-fatal radiographically or pathologically proven recurrent symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage assessed in all participants (except one participant who withdrew before the first follow-up). The secondary outcomes were a composite of all major haemorrhagic events and a composite of all major occlusive vascular events. Major haemorrhagic events included recurrent symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (primary outcome), other forms of symptomatic spontaneous or traumatic intracranial haemorrhage, and symptomatic major extracranial haemorrhage at any site (requiring transfusion or endoscopic treatment or surgery, or resulting in death within 30 days). Major occlusive vascular events were ischaemic stroke; myocardial infarction; mesenteric ischaemia; peripheral arterial occlusion; deep vein thrombosis; pulmonary embolism; and carotid, coronary, or peripheral arterial revascularisation procedures. The composite secondary outcome of all major haemorrhagic or occlusive vascular events combined these two composite outcomes. In the protocol, we had specified a composite secondary outcome of all major vascular events defined by the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke [ischaemic, haemorrhagic, or uncertain cause], or death from a vascular cause).

Two consultant neurologists (WNW and MRM) at the trial coordinating centre were internal assessors of reports of every outcome event, masked to treatment allocation and use of antithrombotic therapy, using all available source documentation including clinical records, death certificates, autopsy reports, imaging reports, outpatient clinic letters, and hospital discharge summaries. One consultant neurologist (TG) was an external assessor and reviewed the same information on a random sample of 25 internally assessed events. He agreed with the internal assessors for 24 (96%) events (appendix) and, therefore, the internal assessors' categorisations remained final. Standardised definitions guided the final categorisation of outcomes.

### Risks of recurrent stroke and all serious vascular events after spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage: pooled analyses of two population-based studies [^113MAJkM]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

In the pooled cohorts, 344 (51%) of 674 patients were taking antithrombotic therapy before ICH (table 1). There was no evidence that the risk of recurrent ICH differed by use of antithrombotic therapy before ICH (yes vs no; HR 1.2, 95% CI 0.6–2.1), but the risk of ischaemic stroke was higher in patients who were taking antithrombotic therapy before ICH than those who were not (3.0, 1.2–7.5; p = 0.020). Results were also consistent in analyses adjusting for clustering (appendix p 9). These patients might benefit from antithrombotic therapy after ICH, but 356 (94%) of 378 ICH survivors were not on antithrombotic drugs at hospital or clinic discharge. Therefore, we compared patients in the pooled cohorts who had taken antithrombotic therapy before ICH and met the eligibility criteria for the RESTART trialwith patients who were allocated to not receive antiplatelet therapy in the RESTART trial to establish the external validity of RESTART (table 3; appendix p 20). Patients with ICH in the cohort studies were older and were more likely to have non-lobar ICH and comorbid AF in comparison with the RESTART participants, but the absolute event rate of recurrent ICH and ischaemic stroke did not differ (table 3). These findings were consistent in sensitivity analyses restricted to each cohort and when restricting analyses to 5 years of follow-up (appendix pp 21, 22). When using ICH location to stratify comparisons between the pooled cohorts and allocation to not receive antiplatelet therapy in RESTART, we did not find differences in the absolute event rate of ischaemic stroke and recurrent ICH, apart from a higher risk of recurrent ICH after non-lobar ICH in RESTART (5.5 per 100 patient-years, 95% CI 2.5–8.5) compared with the cohort studies (1.1 per 100 patient-years, 0.1–3.9; p = 0.018; appendix p 23). Findings were similar when using the 5-year follow-up data (appendix p 24).

### Risks of recurrent stroke and all serious vascular events after spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage: pooled analyses of two population-based studies [^114HeESw]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Our findings have implications for clinical practice and future research. Lobar ICH location can be used to stratify patients according to their risk of recurrent ICH, and comorbid AF can be used to stratify risk of ischaemic stroke and all serious vascular events after ICH. Given the apparent benefit of blood pressure lowering in reducing the risk of recurrent lobar ICH, the high frequency of recurrent ICH after lobar ICH should encourage greater use of blood pressure lowering therapy. Further research is needed to achieve larger sample sizes to explore risk stratification with greater precision and develop prognostic models using the three risk factors combined (ICH location, comorbid AF, and history of occlusive vascular disease) and other risk factors of interest (eg, biomarkers of cerebral small vessel disease). The high risk of all serious vascular events after ICH, whether ischaemic or haemorrhagic, and the poor uptake of blood pressure lowering therapy mandate more intensive approaches to secondary prevention; these include randomised trials of monitoring or therapeutic strategies to reduce blood pressure (and), and a large randomised trial to investigate the reproducibility of the potentially beneficial effects of antiplatelet therapy on recurrent ICH and all serious vascular events seen in RESTART. We found that for patients who stopped antithrombotic drugs after ICH or for those with known AF, the risk of ischaemic stroke was similar to the risk of recurrent ICH in those with lobar ICH, supporting the inclusion of these patients in recent and ongoing trials of starting versus stopping previous antithrombotic treatment in these subgroups. The high risk of all serious vascular events, which exceed the risk of recurrent ICH, for ICH survivors with comorbid AF support their inclusion in ongoing randomised trials of oral anticoagulants and scrutiny of the subgroup with lobar ICH by data monitoring committees.

For the composite secondary outcomes, no significant differences were found between participants assigned to start vs avoid antiplatelet therapy during the entire period of follow-up (Table 2). For the composite secondary outcome of all major vascular events (ie, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke [ischemic, hemorrhagic, or uncertain cause], or death from a vascular cause) as used by the Antithrombotic Trialists Collaboration, which seemed to be reduced by starting antiplatelet therapy in the main results of the trial (adjusted HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44–0.95; P = 0.03), no statistically significant reduction was found for the entire period of extended follow-up (Table 2). However, during the first 3 years of follow-up when almost all trial participants were followed up until they were censored or an outcome occurred, significant differences were found in the cumulative risk of all major vascular events between participants assigned to start vs avoid antiplatelet therapy after 1 year (cumulative risk difference, −7.0%; 95% CI, −12.6 to −1.4), 2 years (cumulative risk difference, −8.9%; 95% CI, −15.7 to −2.1), and 3 years (cumulative risk difference, −7.8%; 95% CI, −15.5 to −0.1)(Figure 3; eTable 7 in Supplement 1).

### Differences in cerebral small vessel disease magnetic resonance imaging markers between lacunar stroke and non-lobar intracerebral hemorrhage [^113bEzor]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

SVD can manifest itself as ischemic or hemorrhagic disease, between which many risk factors are shared. If we gain more insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms that determine whether someone is more prone to ischemic or hemorrhagic disease, this could inform treatment decisions. In clinical practice, antiplatelets are prescribed in patients with a lacunar stroke but not after a non–lobar ICH, as antiplatelet therapy was considered to increase the risk of ICH. However, the recently completed RESTART clinical trial found survivors of antithrombotic–associated ICH to have fewer recurrences of ICH when antiplatelet therapy was restarted compared to patients in whom antiplatelet therapy was avoided. In addition, in contrast with previous suggestions, cumulative evidence suggests that presence of CMB should not be a reason to refrain from antiplatelet therapy. A recent pooled analysis of individual patient data of patients with ischemia stroke or TIA, showed that although presence of CMB enhance the risk of ICH to a larger extent than that of ischemic stroke, the absolute risk of ischemic stroke in these patients is higher than the absolute risk of ICH.

Special considerations

Antiplatelet therapy after intracerebral haemorrhage

Restart or Stop Antithrombotics Randomised Trial (RESTART) compared starting vs avoiding antiplatelet agent after intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). At a median 3-year follow-up of 537 participants, there was no significant difference in recurrent ICH (8.2% vs 9.3%, p = 0.64) or major vascular events (26.8% vs 32.5%, p = 0.14) between two group.

Restarting antiplatelet therapy after ICH should be considered, particularly in patients with high-risk thromboembolic conditions.

Antiplatelet resistance

One-third of patients who had a stroke may develop recurrent stroke while on antiplatelet therapy, partly due to aspirin or clopidogrel resistance. In the laboratory studies, aspirin resistance is defined as a failure to achieve reduction in TXA 2 formation. Clopidogrel resistance refers to the inability to inhibit ADP-mediated platelet aggregation.

The most common cause of inadequate antiplatelet therapy is non-compliance. Approximately 50% of patients either stop taking medication or fail to adhere to the prescribed dose at 1 year.

Potential drug interactions may also result in reduced effect of antiplatelet therapy. Concomitant use of NSAIDs, particularly ibuprofen, offsets the clinical benefit of aspirin. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) inactivates the hepatic enzyme that converts clopidogrel to its active metabolite. Therefore, concomitant use of PPIs may decrease clopidogrel's effect.

Clopidogrel resistance has also been linked to gene polymorphisms. Clopidogrel is a prodrug that requires conversion into active metabolite by hepatic CYP2C19. The prevalence of poor metabolisers (subjects carrying two loss-of-function alleles) is as high as 58.8% among Asians.

### Restarting anticoagulant therapy after intracranial hemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116k2dsn]. Stroke (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The safety and efficacy of restarting anticoagulation therapy after intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) remain unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the associations of anticoagulation resumption with the subsequent risk of ICH recurrence and thromboembolism.

Methods

We searched published medical literature to identify cohort studies involving adults with anticoagulation-associated ICH. Our predictor variable was resumption of anticoagulation. Outcome measures were thromboembolic events (stroke and myocardial infarction) and recurrence of ICH. After assessing study heterogeneity and publication bias, we performed a meta-analysis using random-effects models to assess the strength of association between anticoagulation resumption and our outcomes.

Results

Eight studies were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis, with 5306 ICH patients. Almost all studies evaluated anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists. Reinitiation of anticoagulation was associated with a significantly lower risk of thromboembolic complications (pooled relative risk, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.25–0.45; Q = 5.12, P for heterogeneity = 0.28). There was no evidence of increased risk of recurrent ICH after reinstatement of anticoagulation therapy, although there was significant heterogeneity among included studies (pooled relative risk, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.58–1.77; Q = 24.68, P for heterogeneity < 0.001). No significant publication bias was detected in our analyses.

Conclusions

In observational studies, reinstitution of anticoagulation after ICH was associated with a lower risk of thromboembolic complications and a similar risk of ICH recurrence. Randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the true risk-benefit profile of anticoagulation resumption after ICH.

### Apixaban versus no anticoagulation after anticoagulation-associated intracerebral haemorrhage in patients with atrial fibrillation in the Netherlands (APACHE-AF): a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial [^114rG71f]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Background

In patients with atrial fibrillation who survive an anticoagulation-associated intracerebral haemorrhage, a decision must be made as to whether restarting or permanently avoiding anticoagulation is the best long-term strategy to prevent recurrent stroke and other vascular events. In APACHE-AF, we aimed to estimate the rates of non-fatal stroke or vascular death in such patients when treated with apixaban compared with when anticoagulation was avoided, to inform the design of a larger trial.

Methods

APACHE-AF was a prospective, randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial with masked endpoint assessment, done at 16 hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients who survived intracerebral haemorrhage while treated with anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation were eligible for inclusion 7–90 days after the haemorrhage. Participants also had a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of at least 2 and a score on the modified Rankin scale (mRS) of 4 or less. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive oral apixaban (5 mg twice daily or a reduced dose of 2.5 mg twice daily) or to avoid anticoagulation (oral antiplatelet agents could be prescribed at the discretion of the treating physician) by a central computerised randomisation system, stratified by the intention to start or withhold antiplatelet therapy in participants randomised to avoiding anticoagulation, and minimised for age and intracerebral haemorrhage location. The primary outcome was a composite of non-fatal stroke or vascular death, whichever came first, during a minimum follow-up of 6 months, analysed using Cox proportional hazards modelling in the intention-to-treat population. APACHE-AF is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02565693) and the Netherlands Trial Register (NL4395), and the trial is closed to enrolment at all participating sites.

Findings

Between Jan 15, 2015, and July 6, 2020, we recruited 101 patients (median age 78 years [IQR 73–83]; 55 [54%] were men and 46 [46%] were women; 100 [99%] were White and one [1%] was Black) a median of 46 days (IQR 21–74) after intracerebral haemorrhage. 50 were assigned to apixaban and 51 to avoid anticoagulation (of whom 26 [51%] started antiplatelet therapy). None were lost to follow-up. Over a median follow-up of 1.9 years (IQR 1.0–3.1; 222 person-years), non-fatal stroke or vascular death occurred in 13 (26%) participants allocated to apixaban (annual event rate 12.6% [95% CI 6.7–21.5]) and in 12 (24%) allocated to avoid anticoagulation (11.9% [95% CI 6.2–20.8]; adjusted hazard ratio 1.05 [95% CI 0.48–2.31]; p = 0.90). Serious adverse events that were not outcome events occurred in 29 (58%) of 50 participants assigned to apixaban and 29 (57%) of 51 assigned to avoid anticoagulation.

Interpretation

Patients with atrial fibrillation who had an intracerebral haemorrhage while taking anticoagulants have a high subsequent annual risk of non-fatal stroke or vascular death, whether allocated to apixaban or to avoid anticoagulation. Our data underline the need for randomised controlled trials large enough to allow identification of subgroups in whom restarting anticoagulation might be either beneficial or hazardous.

Three other studies focus on the immediate postacute period in patients with tICrH. Divito et al retrospectively analyzed 112 patients with tICrH, skewing severe with 29% requiring neurosurgical intervention. Median restart interval was 8 days (range 1–31) (see figure 6). These patients had 88 thromboembolic events: 32 pulmonary emboli (PEs), 44 deep venous thromboses (DVTs), 4 MIs and 2 left ventricular thrombi. To a large extent, the events in Divito drove restart decisions as opposed to starting with a priori secondary prevention in mind, and the population skewed severe with 42% having a Glasgow Coma Score < 9. However, the bleeding risk seen is informative. There were no deaths directly attributable to anticoagulation. One patient developed a chronic subdural hygroma that required surgery 2 weeks later, and one patient died of a hemothorax, but the patient was also in septic shock and the family declined further intervention. Byrnes et al used a similar retrospective model in which the thromboembolic event drove anticoagulation, analyzing 42 patients with tICrH who developed DVT, PE or blunt cerebrovascular injury, 26 of which were anticoagulated. Mean start interval was 11.9 days with a broad range with nearly half restarted between 1 and 2 weeks. Byrnes et al did not report on thromboembolic events after initiation of anticoagulation and found only one case of hematoma expansion, 1–2 mm in an intraparenchymal hemorrhage 6 days after restart that did not affect clinical course. Pandya et al studied 97 patients with tICrH, dividing them into SDH and all other tICrH and correlating start of either anticoagulants 36%, antiplatelets (53%) or both (11%). Start of therapy was 8.8 ± 9.7 days. None of the 'other' tICrH group had hematoma expansion. Five of the SDH (9.1%) had clinically significant expansion; however, only one of these was on an anticoagulant and one on both antiplatelet and anticoagulant (the others were on only antiplatelet therapy). Finally, there is an analysis that suggests a more aggressive approach to restarting. Hawryluk et al extracted data from 63 case reports and series on 492 anticoagulated patients with central nervous system hemorrhage finding a rebleeding rate of 8% and a thromboembolic event rate of 6%. Temporal mapping (see figure 7) showed most rebleeding events occurred before 72 hours, while most thromboembolic events occurred from 3 days to 1 week, suggesting 3 days would be the ideal restart interval. There are several limitations. The analysis is from the warfarin era, only 6.5% of the cases were traumatic, and it is confounded by heterogeneous case report/series reporting bias.

### Antiplatelet therapy after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage and functional outcomes [^111FJ3KN]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- Observational data suggest that antiplatelet therapy after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) alleviates thromboembolic risk without increasing the risk of recurrent ICH. Given the paucity of data on the relationship between antiplatelet therapy after ICH and functional outcomes, we aimed to study this association in a multicenter cohort. Methods- We meta-analyzed data from (1) the Massachusetts General Hospital ICH registry (n = 1854), (2) the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive database (n = 762), and (3) the Yale stroke registry (n = 185). Our exposure was antiplatelet therapy after ICH, which was modeled as a time-varying covariate. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and a composite of major disability or death (modified Rankin Scale score 4–6). We used Cox proportional regression analyses to estimate the hazard ratio of death or poor functional outcome as a function of antiplatelet therapy and random-effects meta-analysis to pool the estimated HRs across studies. Additional analyses stratified by hematoma location (lobar and deep ICH) were performed. Results- We included a total of 2801 ICH patients, of whom 288 (10.3%) were started on antiplatelet medications after ICH. Median times to antiplatelet therapy ranged from 7 to 39 days. Antiplatelet therapy after ICH was not associated with mortality (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.66–1.09), or death or major disability (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.59–1.16) compared with patients not started on antiplatelet therapy. Similar results were obtained in additional analyses stratified by hematoma location. Conclusions- Antiplatelet therapy after ICH appeared safe and was not associated with all-cause mortality or functional outcome, regardless of hematoma location. Randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the effects and harms of antiplatelet therapy after ICH.

### Re-initiation of dabigatran and direct factor Xa antagonists after a major bleed [^116JUSTZ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Another study linked 3 large Danish registries (1997–2013), and assessed the risk of recurrent stroke and mortality when restarting OAC in patients with AF and OAC-associated ICH (n = 1752). The majority of patients received VKA (65%) or VKA plus antiplatelet therapy (33%), and a small proportion received DOACs (2%) or DOACs plus antiplatelet therapy (< 1%). The overall event rates (using 1 year of follow-up) of the combined end point of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism and all-cause mortality (per 100 person-years) for patients treated with OAC was 13.6 vs 27.3 for nontreated patients (HR 0.55; 95% CI, 0.39–0.78; no P -value stated). Of patients who resumed OAC treatment after ICH (n = 621), the overall median time from ICH to the first claimed prescription was 34 days.

A Canadian registry study of 284 spontaneous warfarin related ICH (intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage) cases, in which warfarin was restarted in 91 (32%) patients, reported that there was no increase in 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio 0.49; 95% CI, 0.26–0.93; P = 0.03) in patients who restarted warfarin. This trend continued at 1 year but was no longer significant (adjusted odds ratio 0.79; 95% CI, 0.43–1.43; P = 0.43). This study included VTE indications and valve prosthesis for OAC therapy, in addition to AF.

A retrospective, 3-center analysis of 234 patients with warfarin-associated ICH found a 5-fold increased risk of recurrent ICH with the resumption of OAC in the immediate period (median time: 5.6 weeks; IQR 2.6–17) after the index event (HR 5.6; 95% CI, 1.8–17.2; P = 0.0029), and the HR for ischemic stroke was 0.11 (95% CI, 0.014–0.87; P = 0.036). The combined risk of recurrent ICH and ischemic stroke reached its lowest point if OAC therapy was restarted between 10 and 30 weeks after the index event.

### 2022 guideline for the management of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^115UJnrS]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

Spontaneous ICH with LVAD or mechanical valves — timing and safety signals for anticoagulation resumption: In LVAD patients, warfarin resumption "at a median of 14 days from the index ICH was associated with fewer fatal and nonfatal thrombotic events than the resumption of antiplatelet alone, and there was no significant difference in recurrent ICH rates". In another observational series, "22 patients with LVAD with ICH, none had evidence of LVAD thrombosis after reversal and holding of anticoagulation for up to 13 days". For mechanical valves, "complications were significantly increased when anticoagulation was resumed before day 14", but risk balancing "suggested that anticoagulation may be considered in those with mechanical valves as early as day 6 from the index ICH". The guideline text notes that "The decision to restart anticoagulation (eg, at 14 days after ICH)… is therefore reasonable and safe… but requires individualized assessment of risk and benefit".

### Risks of recurrent stroke and all serious vascular events after spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage: pooled analyses of two population-based studies [^1158htsb]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Added value of this study

These pooled analyses provide data from two contemporary population-based cohort studies, free of selection bias, with prospective follow-up for not only recurrent stroke, but also for all serious vascular events after ICH. The rates of ischaemic stroke and recurrent ICH in our cohort studies support the generalisability of the event rates observed in RESTART. A meta-analysis of our cohort studies and another four similar published cohorts established lobar ICH as a risk factor for recurrent ICH, but not for ischaemic stroke after ICH. We have identified comorbid AF as the major risk factor for ischaemic stroke and all serious vascular events after ICH.

Implications of all the available evidence

In clinical practice, ICH survivors can be stratified into groups at higher risk of recurrent ICH, ischaemic stroke, or all serious vascular events according to ICH location and comorbid AF. The high risk of ischaemic stroke and all serious vascular events for ICH survivors with AF mandates rapid completion of ongoing randomised controlled trials of antithrombotic drugs or left atrial appendage occlusion to reduce these risks.

Identifying risk factors for recurrent ICH, ischaemic stroke, and all serious vascular events after ICH could help with risk stratification to inform decisions about antithrombotic drugs after ICH. Lobar ICH location has been associated with a higher risk of recurrent ICH in some studies, but not others. The risk of recurrent stroke is particularly high in the first few days and weeks after transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or ischaemic stroke, although less is known about the time course of recurrent ICH. Some studies have found that the risks of recurrent ICH were particularly high in the first year after ICH, although most studies only included 30-day survivors so they are likely to have underestimated the true early risk. Risk factors for ischaemic stroke after ICH are also unclear. Although ICH location does not seem to be associated with the risk of ischaemic stroke, atrial fibrillation (AF) is likely to be a risk factor for ischaemic stroke, but not recurrent ICH.

### Geriatric trauma management [^111HQmqt]. ACS (2023). High credibility.

Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) — no randomized trial evidence exists to guide anticoagulation resumption in ICH patients. The European Stroke Initiative suggests starting with a review of the indication for anticoagulation and that oral antithrombotic therapy may be restarted 10–14 days postoperative depending on perceived thromboembolic and rebleeding risk; observational data noted median time to anticoagulation resumption was 31 days and that anticoagulation resumption was associated with fewer ischemic events.

### Post-intracranial hemorrhage antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112TmaUC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Antiplatelet agents can be used as a treatment alternative for patients who are not eligible for reinitiating OAC therapy. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines suggest that antiplatelet monotherapy may be considered in patients with a history of ICH event and having concern of bleeding. The results from the RESTART trial showed that antiplatelet agents did not increase the risk of recurrent ICH. Moreover, antiplatelet agents significantly reduced major vascular events such as non‐fatal myocardial infarction and non‐fatal stroke compared with no treatment, although the risk of all major occlusive vascular events is similar. Unlike RESTART, in our study, antiplatelet agents showed no benefit in preventing IS and increased risk in ICH, consistent with the findings of Chao et al. These differences may be attributed to the characteristics of our participants who were patients with AF presenting worse effects of antiplatelet agents than OACs in preventing thromboembolism. In addition, our results suggested superior effects of OACs to antiplatelet agents in reducing the risk of thromboembolic events and ICH. Considering no beneficial effects of antiplatelet therapy in IS prevention, which may be discouraging for patients with AF who subsequently developed intracranial hemorrhage, OACs should be considered for post‐intracranial hemorrhage.

### Risk of intracranial haemorrhage and ischaemic stroke after convexity subarachnoid haemorrhage in cerebral amyloid angiopathy: international individual patient data pooled analysis [^115sk826]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the much higher risks of ICH and cSAH in people with probable vs possible CAA, we did not find evidence of a higher mortality rate in this group, although the rate in our cohort was comparable to previous reports.

We found that patients with cSAH attributed to probable or possible CAA have a much higher annual risk of future intracranial haemorrhage (ICH or cSAH) than ischemic stroke [13.2% (95% CI 9.9–17.4) and 11.1% (95%CI 7.9–15.2), respectively, compared with a 5.1% (95% CI 3.1–8)]. The substantially higher ICH risk in probable compared to possible CAA (15.2% vs 1.8% per year) — with a similar ischemic stroke risk regardless of CAA status — might favor avoiding antithrombotics for patients with cSAH who meet the modified Boston criteria for probable CAA. There are no other observational data or randomized controlled trials addressing the risks of (re)starting antithrombotic drugs after cSAH. Data on whether antiplatelet drugs affect recurrent ICH risk after a symptomatic ICH are conflicting: while two small single center studies gave inconsistent data on whether the rate of recurrent ICH was increased by the use of aspirin, the RESTART randomized trial in ICH survivors found no evidence of an increase in the risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage with antiplatelet therapy for patients on antithrombotic therapy for the prevention of occlusive vascular disease when they developed ICH. However, this trial included small numbers of patients with disseminated superficial siderosis. We found a high risk of ICH after cSAH despite most patients not receiving antithrombotic therapy. Thus, in those judged to have a low vaso-occlusive risk starting or restarting them might be best avoided. Our finding that about one in five ICH occur in the first month raises particular concern for antithrombotic therapy during this early period following cSAH. Although randomized data are needed to inform antithrombotic decisions after cSAH, the rarity of cSAH and lack of clinician equipoise might make such trials challenging.

### Risks of recurrent stroke and all serious vascular events after spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage: pooled analyses of two population-based studies [^115Thp7z]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In pooled analyses of 674 patients with first-ever ICH in two recent, prospective, population-based cohort studies, we found similar overall absolute event rates of recurrent ICH and ischaemic stroke and a high absolute event rate of any serious vascular event. Lobar ICH location was the principal risk factor for recurrent ICH. Comorbid AF was the principal risk factor for ischaemic stroke and all serious vascular events; the risks of these events were even greater in patients with a history of occlusive vascular disease. The risk of recurrent ICH was greater than the risk of ischaemic stroke only for patients with lobar ICH without comorbid AF. The risk of any serious vascular event was greater for patients with lobar ICH who had comorbid AF compared with patients in sinus rhythm. Participants allocated to not receive antiplatelet therapy in RESTART had similar absolute event rates of recurrent ICH and ischaemic stroke to those for the patients in the real-world pooled population-based studies who fulfilled eligibility criteria for RESTART.

Although hospital-based studies have not been consistent in identifying lobar ICH location as a risk factor for recurrent ICH, this was a consistent risk factor in our population-based studies and in a meta-analysis of all studies with the required data. One explanation for this finding is that moderate-to-severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy — which is a bleeding-prone vasculopathy that portends a particularly high risk of recurrent ICH in patients with imaging biomarkers of this disease — underlies 58% of lobar ICHs, with 72% of patients also having moderate-to-severe small vessel disease. Another explanation is that only 49% of lobar ICH survivors took antihypertensive therapy at hospital discharge compared with 71% of non-lobar ICH; in the PROGRESS trial, blood pressure lowering reduced the risk of recurrent ICH by 49%, but use of antihypertensive treatment and adequate reduction of blood pressure are not always achieved in clinical practice, as reported by others. These explanations likely contributed to the risk of recurrent ICH being highest early after lobar ICH. Despite the difference in prevalence and treatment of high blood pressure by ICH location, lobar ICH location did not influence the risk of ischaemic stroke, probably because risk factors for occlusive vascular disease did not differ by ICH location.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) — anticoagulation selection: A number of retrospective analyses have attempted to address the risks and benefits of anticoagulation therapy in patients with both nonvalvular AF and a history of ICH, and the published literature suggests a potential reduction in recurrent ischemic events and all-cause mortality with the use of anticoagulation. Anticoagulation may be considered in select patients, based on assessments of risk and benefit, and enrollment in ongoing prospective RCTs should be prioritized; given the reduced risk of ICH with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) compared with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in stroke prevention trials and real-world practice, these may be favored in patients with a history of ICH if anticoagulation is deemed indicated, although data are lacking.

Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage — statin therapy after ICH: In patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and an established indication for statin pharmacotherapy, the risks and benefits of statin therapy on ICH outcomes and recurrence relative to overall prevention of cardiovascular events are described as uncertain, and the decision to use statins in patients with ICH depends on risk assessment of ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events versus recurrent ICH; enrollment in ongoing randomized clinical trials addressing this question can be encouraged. Observational data are mixed, with additional nonrandomized studies that have not found an association with statin use in patients with ICH, reports that lipophilic statins may be associated with higher rates of ICH than hydrophilic statins, and descriptions of a reduction in short- and long-term mortality with statin use. Clinical trials of the lipid-lowering PCSK9i (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors) have thus far not suggested increased risk of first ICH but have not yet examined risk of recurrence in patients with prior ICH.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic approach in adult patients with traumatic brain injury receiving oral anticoagulant therapy: an Austrian interdisciplinary consensus statement [^111dWFno]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Avoidance of therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 14 days post-TBI in patients without mechanical heart valves might decrease the risk of progression of traumatic hemorrhagic lesions. However, results from observational studies and retrospective analyses indicate that patients with a history of prior antithrombotic therapy experience thromboembolic complications significantly earlier after TBI, with a peak in the first 10 days post-trauma. A recent literature review by Tykocki and Guzek provides evidence that resuming antithrombotic therapy early (range 3–17.5 days) following TBI may carry an acceptably low risk of hemorrhagic complications, and that the risk of complications may be lower with NOACs than with VKAs.

More robust data are available regarding the optimal time window for initiating anticoagulant treatment after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in patients receiving anticoagulants. A retrospective study concluded that resumption should be delayed by at least 10 weeks to avoid the risk of early, recurrent hemorrhage. In contrast, a systematic review of data from 63 publications suggested that anticoagulation in high-risk patients may be restarted 3 days from the time of the index hemorrhage. A recent observational study investigated the resumption of antithrombotic treatment in 2619 patients with atrial fibrillation and intracerebral hemorrhage. The benefits of anticoagulation therapy (reduced risk of vascular death and nonfatal stroke in high-risk patients) seemed to be greatest when it was resumed 7–8 weeks after intracerebral hemorrhage, and there was no significant increase in the risk of severe hemorrhage. A randomized controlled trial of anticoagulant use in atrial fibrillation patients who have had an intracerebral hemorrhage is currently in progress.

Evidence: natural history of anticoagulated tICrH and hematoma expansion

The literature on anticoagulated tICrH is cross-contaminated with sICrH data. Investigators have not rigorously applied specific nomenclature. The abbreviation ICH has been applied to intracranial hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, traumatic and spontaneous, all of the above and various subsets. (We use the preferred specific nomenclature: intracerebral hemorrhage is ICH, intracranial hemorrhage is ICrH. These are preceded by t or s for traumatic or spontaneous.) While there is considerable variation within sICrH and tICrH, it is becoming clear there is also a distinct natural history between them. There is less data on tICrH, but what exists seems to indicate a lower risk of recurrent hemorrhage than sICrH and a higher rate of thromboembolism. The possible exception is subdural hematoma (SDH) (see figure 3), which may carry a higher rebleeding risk than other tICrH. The natural history of tICrH as a disease is important in this context for understanding when the acute event ends, that is, the cessation of hematoma expansion and stabilization of clot. Anticoagulants do not break fibrin bonds. They prohibit the deposition of new fibrin by inhibiting various factors in the clotting cascade. Hematoma expansion in tICrH is very common in the first 24 hours, much less so by 48 hours and rare by 72 hours.SDHs occasionally expand later, several days to weeks, or develop into chronic SDH/hygroma, although late surgical intervention is required with diminishing frequency the longer it remains stable. It is clear from the literature that preinjury anticoagulation is associated with worse outcome, double the risk of death, increased risk of hematoma expansion (early and delayed) generally meaning after 24 hours. However, there was evidence from a small (n = 63), prospective observational study of traumatic intracerebral hemorrhages that hematoma expansion slows from 24 to 72 hours, and may not extend beyond 3–4 days.

Restart following surgical intervention of tICrH

tICrH also frequently requires emergent surgical intervention. These patients are already at elevated risk of hematoma expansion as well as subsequent thromboembolic complications. The decision to perform neurosurgical interventions may further alter the subsequent risk profile of recurrent hemorrhage for anticoagulated tICrH. With regard to pre-injury treatment, anticoagulation increases the risks of surgical intervention. In the near term, pre-injury anticoagulant or antiplatelet treatment was not associated with acute, postoperative hemorrhage in a retrospective study of 143 neurosurgical (craniotomy and craniectomy) patients.VKA relative to DOAC, antiplatelets or controls has been associated with greater reversal agent use, hematoma expansion and mortality, but unrelated to the need for surgical intervention. Another study demonstrated that DOAC treatment pre-injury was associated with greater likelihood of neurosurgical intervention. However, a larger study of chronic SDH evacuation demonstrated that cases on preoperative anticoagulation therapy were more likely to experience major hemorrhage during follow-up (OR = 1.93, p = 0.014), and the time to occurrence of either hemorrhagic or thromboembolic complications was shorter.

With regard to reinitiation of anticoagulation therapy, the use of DOAC therapy or heparin has been recommended over VKA, based on evidence of lower risk of ICrH in non-bleeding populations. There is a real scarcity of evidence for any relationship between surgical treatment for tICrH and the decision to restart anticoagulation. Here as well, selection bias is an obvious concern with any retrospective, observational research into the question of restart. This may partly explain associations found between reinitiation and reduced risk of hemorrhage in unadjusted analyses. In cases with elevated risk of thromboembolic events, reinitiation as early as 3 days postinjury has also been suggested. However, the overall strategy for how to manage anticoagulant-associated ICrH after surgery is unclear.

### Restarting anticoagulant treatment after intracranial hemorrhage in patients with atrial fibrillation and the impact on recurrent stroke, mortality, and bleeding: a nationwide cohort study [^113U25Cj]. Circulation (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Intracranial hemorrhage is the most feared complication of oral anticoagulant treatment. The optimal treatment option for patients with atrial fibrillation who survive an intracranial hemorrhage remains unknown. We hypothesized that restarting oral anticoagulant treatment was associated with a lower risk of stroke and mortality in comparison with not restarting.

Methods and Results

Linkage of 3 Danish nationwide registries in the period between 1997 and 2013 identified patients with atrial fibrillation on oral anticoagulant treatment with incident intracranial hemorrhage. Patients were stratified by treatment regimens (no treatment, oral anticoagulant treatment, or antiplatelet therapy) after the intracranial hemorrhage. Event rates were assessed 6 weeks after hospital discharge and compared with Cox proportional hazard models. In 1752 patients (1 year of follow-up), the rate of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism and all-cause mortality (per 100 person-years) for patients treated with oral anticoagulants was 13.6, in comparison with 27.3 for nontreated patients and 25.7 for patients receiving antiplatelet therapy. The rate of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism and all-cause mortality (per 100 person-years) for recurrent intracranial hemorrhage, the rate of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism, and all-cause mortality (per 100 person-years) patients treated with oral anticoagulants was 8.0, in comparison with 8.6 for nontreated patients and 5.3 for patients receiving antiplatelet therapy. The adjusted hazard ratio of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism and all-cause mortality was 0.55 (95% confidence interval, 0.39–0.78) in patients on oral anticoagulant treatment in comparison with no treatment. For ischemic stroke/systemic embolism and for all-cause mortality, hazard ratios were 0.59 (95% confidence interval, 0.33–1.03) and 0.55 (95% confidence interval, 0.37–0.82), respectively.

Conclusions

Oral anticoagulant treatment was associated with a significant reduction in ischemic stroke/all-cause mortality rates, supporting oral anticoagulant treatment reintroduction after intracranial hemorrhage as feasible. Future trials are encouraged to guide clinical practice in these patients.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) — post-ICH antithrombotic management: In patients with a history of a symptomatic primary ICH, we suggest against the long-term use of antithrombotic therapy for the prevention of ischemic stroke (Grade 2C). Only in patients with deep hemorrhages who are at very high risk of cardiac embolism without antithrombotic therapy (> 7% per year) should anticoagulation be considered, generally those with mechanical heart valves or AF and high CHADS2 scores (≥ 4 points). In deep ICH with intermediate risk (5%-7% per year), antiplatelet therapy with aspirin may be preferred over no antithrombotic therapy or anticoagulation, whereas for patients whose only indication is antiplatelet therapy and the thromboembolic risk is generally low (< 5% per year), the benefit is unlikely to outweigh potential harm. A referenced decision analysis favored no antithrombotic therapy, reporting a lifetime gain of 0.3 QALY for deep hemorrhages and 1.9 QALY for lobar hemorrhages.

Limiting life-sustaining treatments — The decision of when and how to limit life-sustaining treatments after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains complex and highly dependent on individual preference; the decision to assign do not attempt resuscitation status is entirely distinct from the decision to limit other medical and surgical interventions and should not be used to do so, and decisions to implement an intervention should be shared between the physician and patient or surrogate and should reflect the patient's wishes as best as can be discerned; baseline severity scales can be useful to provide an overall measure of hemorrhage severity but should not be used as the sole basis for limiting life-sustaining treatments.

### Previous chronic symptomatic and asymptomatic cerebral hemorrhage in patients with acute ischemic stroke [^116XsdXo]. Neuroradiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The study aimed to analyze the prevalence of PCH in patients with acute ischemic stroke using SWI and to analyze the factors associated with PCH in those patients. Thirty-six (9.4%) patients were found to have PCH. Multivariable analysis results showed that TC, existence of CMBs on SWI, and medication history of antithrombotic drugs were independently associated with the presence of a PCH in patients with ischemic stroke. There were no differences in clinical characteristics between previous symptomatic and asymptomatic PCH.

In the present study, the frequency of PCH was 9.4%, or 4.5% for asymptomatic PCH, which was slightly lower than in previous studies. The discrepancies could be due to the selection of the subjects and geographical regions, as well as to different imaging protocols.

Patients with ischemic stroke should promptly receive antithrombotic therapy for secondary prevention if they do not have any significant contraindication, but for those with both acute ischemic stroke and PCH, symptomatic or not, long-term aggressive antithrombotic therapy should be used with caution after considering the risks and benefits to avoid re-bleeding. There were no long-term randomized studies addressing this issue. There is a marked paucity of evidence to guide clinicians when planning the long-term management of patients with cerebral hemorrhage and cogent indications for antithrombotic therapy. Recently, a randomized controlled trial, "The REstart or STop Antithrombotics Randomised Trial (RESTART) after stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage", has been registered to compare starting versus avoiding antiplatelet drugs for adults surviving antithrombotic-associated ICH at 122 hospital sites in the UK.

CMB can be associated with poor prognosis of stroke. A recent study reported in White and Chinese patients with ≥ 5 CMBs withholding antiplatelet drugs during the first year after transient ischemic attack/ischemic stroke may be inappropriate; however, the risk of ICH may outweigh any benefit thereafter.

Many randomised controlled trials and high-quality observational studies have added to the evidence base for the management of people with ICH since the last European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines for the management of spontaneous ICH were published in 2014, so we updated the ESO guideline. This guideline update was guided by the European Stroke Organisation (ESO) standard operating procedures for guidelines and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework, in collaboration with the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies (EANS). We identified 37 Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) questions and prioritised clinical outcomes. We conducted systematic literature searches, tailored to each PICO, seeking randomised controlled trials (RCT) - or observational studies when RCTs were not appropriate, or not available - that investigated interventions to improve clinical outcomes. A group of co-authors allocated to each PICO screened titles, abstracts, and full texts and extracted data from included studies. A methodologist conducted study-level meta-analyses and created summaries of findings tables. The same group of co-authors graded the quality of evidence, and drafted recommendations that were reviewed, revised and approved by the entire group. When there was insufficient evidence to make a recommendation, each group of co-authors drafted an expert consensus statement, which was reviewed, revised and voted on by the entire group. The systematic literature search revealed 115,647 articles. We included 208 studies. We found strong evidence for treatment of people with ICH on organised stroke units, and secondary prevention of stroke with blood pressure lowering. We found weak evidence for scores for predicting macrovascular causes underlying ICH; acute blood pressure lowering; open surgery via craniotomy for supratentorial ICH; minimally invasive surgery for supratentorial ICH; decompressive surgery for deep supratentorial ICH; evacuation of cerebellar ICH > 15mL; external ventricular drainage with intraventricular thrombolysis for intraventricular extension; minimally invasive surgical evacuation of intraventricular blood; intermittent pneumatic compression to prevent proximal deep vein thrombosis; antiplatelet therapy for a licensed indication for secondary prevention; and applying a care bundle. We found strong evidence against anti-inflammatory drug use outside of clinical trials. We found weak evidence against routine use of rFVIIa, platelet transfusions for antiplatelet-associated ICH, general policies that limit treatment within 24h of ICH onset, temperature and glucose management as single measures (outside of care bundles), prophylactic anti-seizures medicines, and prophylactic use of temperature-lowering measures, prokinetic anti-emetics, and/or antibiotics. New evidence about the management of ICH has emerged since 2014, enabling this update of the ESO guideline to provide new recommendations and consensus statements. Although we made strong recommendations for and against a few interventions, we were only able to make weak recommendations for and against many others, or produce consensus statements where the evidence was insufficient to guide clinical decisions. Although progress has been made, many interventions still require definitive, high-quality evidence, underpinning the need for embedding clinical trials in routine clinical practice for ICH.

### Diffusion-weighted imaging lesions and risk of recurrent stroke after intracerebral haemorrhage [^117GZoPx]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether the presence of diffusion-weighted imaging-positive (DWI+) lesions is associated with recurrent stroke after intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH).

Methods

The REstart or STop Antithrombotics Randomised Trial (RESTART) assessed the effect of restarting versus avoiding antiplatelet therapy after ICH on major vascular events for up to 5 years. We rated DWI sequences of MRI done before randomisation for DWI+ lesion presence, masked to outcome and antiplatelet use. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to quantify associations.

Results

Of 537 participants in RESTART, 247 (median (IQR) age 75.7 (69.6–81.1) years; 170 men (68.8%); 120 started vs 127 avoided antiplatelet therapy) had DWI sequences on brain MRI at a median of 57 days (IQR 19–103) after ICH, of whom 73 (30%) had one or more DWI+ lesion. During a median follow-up of 2 years (1–3), 18 participants had recurrent ICH and 21 had ischaemic stroke. DWI+ lesion presence was associated with all stroke, (adjusted HR 2.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 4.2)) and recurrent ICH (4.8 (95% CI 1.8 to 13.2)), but not ischaemic stroke (0.9 (95% CI 0.3 to 2.5)). DWI+ lesion presence (0.5 (95% CI 0.2 to 1.3)) vs absence (0.6 (95% CI 0.3 to 1.5), p interaction = 0.66) did not modify the effect of antiplatelet therapy on a composite outcome of recurrent stroke.

Conclusions

DWI+ lesion presence in ICH survivors is associated with recurrent ICH, but not with ischaemic stroke. We found no evidence of modification of effects of antiplatelet therapy on recurrent stroke after ICH by DWI+ lesion presence. These findings provide a new perspective on the significance of DWI+ lesions, which may be markers of microvascular mechanisms associated with recurrent ICH.

### Post-intracranial hemorrhage antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation [^111zUubF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) have an increased risk of thromboembolism, particularly those with a CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score ≥ 2; therefore, oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy is recommended commonly according to different guidelines. However, OAC therapy increases the risk of bleeding. Thus, after the occurrence of an intracranial hemorrhage episode, OAC agents should be discontinued immediately. Reinitiating antithrombotic therapy (AT) after the episode is a difficult decision, which requires balancing the risk of re‐bleeding and occurrence of thromboembolism. To date, there has been little research on whether or when to start AT and the drug of choice.

According to the report of RESTART (Restart or Stop Antithrombotics Randomised Trial) conducted in 2019, reinitiating antiplatelet therapy after an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) episode, compared with no treatment, did not increase the risk of ICH and major hemorrhagic events. Nevertheless, < 20% of participants in the RESTART trial had AF. Several retrospective observational studies have investigated the effectiveness and safety of reinitiating AT among patients with AF and a history of intracranial hemorrhage. A Danish study showed that reinitiating anticoagulants was associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke (IS) and all‐cause mortality compared with no treatment. Another Korean study showed that maintaining time in the therapeutic range of 60% among warfarin starters post‐intracranial hemorrhage, compared with no treatment, significantly reduced the risk of composite outcome of thromboembolic and major bleeding events. Contrarily, a Taiwanese study showed that initiating warfarin, compared with no treatment, significantly reduced the risk of IS but increased the risk of intracranial hemorrhage.

Large‐scale, randomized, prospective studies have proven that non‐vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are equivalently effective to warfarin in preventing thromboembolism among patients with AF; additionally, they significantly reduce the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. However, patients with a history of intracranial hemorrhage have been universally excluded from these studies. In addition, warfarin has been a major OAC evaluated in prior studies. To date, data on the effectiveness and safety of reinitiating NOACs subsequent to an intracranial hemorrhage episode are lacking.

The aim of our study was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of withholding or reinitiating AT in patients with AF and a history of intracranial hemorrhage. In addition, we compared different treatment strategies: OAC therapy versus no treatment, antiplatelet therapy versus no treatment, OAC therapy versus antiplatelet therapy, and NOAC versus warfarin.

### Outcomes in antiplatelet-associated intracerebral hemorrhage in the TICH-2 randomized controlled trial [^11592m3t]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background Antiplatelet therapy increases the risk of hematoma expansion in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) while the effect on functional outcome is uncertain. Methods and Results This is an exploratory analysis of the TICH-2 (Tranexamic Acid in Intracerebral Hemorrhage-2) double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, which studied the efficacy of tranexamic acid in patients with spontaneous ICH within 8 hours of onset. Multivariable logistic regression and ordinal regression were performed to explore the relationship between pre-ICH antiplatelet therapy, and 24-hour hematoma expansion and day 90 modified Rankin Scale score, as well as the effect of tranexamic acid. Of 2325 patients, 611 (26.3%) had pre-ICH antiplatelet therapy. They were older (mean age, 75.7 versus 66.5 years), more likely to have ischemic heart disease (25.4% versus 2.7%), ischemic stroke (36.2% versus 6.3%), intraventricular hemorrhage (40.2% versus 27.5%), and larger baseline hematoma volume (mean, 28.1 versus 22.6 mL) than the no-antiplatelet group. Pre-ICH antiplatelet therapy was associated with a significantly increased risk of hematoma expansion (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.28; 95% CI, 1.01–1.63), a shift toward unfavorable outcome in modified Rankin Scale (adjusted common OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.32–1.91) and a higher risk of death at day 90 (adjusted OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.25–2.11). Tranexamic acid reduced the risk of hematoma expansion in the overall patients with ICH (adjusted OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62–0.93) and antiplatelet subgroup (adjusted OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.41–0.91) with no significant interaction between pre-ICH antiplatelet therapy and tranexamic acid (P interaction = 0.248). Conclusions Antiplatelet therapy is independently associated with hematoma expansion and unfavorable functional outcome. Tranexamic acid reduced hematoma expansion regardless of prior antiplatelet therapy use. Registration URL: https://www.isrctn.com; Unique identifier: ISRCTN93732214.

### 2022 guideline for the management of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^115rHaPE]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for intracerebral hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to stroke rehabilitation, AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines recommend to consider offering early supported discharge to increase the likelihood of living at home at 3 months in patients with spontaneous ICH with mild-to-moderate severity.

### Resumption of antiplatelet therapy in patients with primary intracranial hemorrhage-benefits and risks: a meta-analysis of cohort studies [^116zUp3v]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical disagreement over antiplatelet (AP) resumption in patients with primary intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) has long existed. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the benefits of AP resumption on preventing ischemic or thromboembolic events against its risks of promoting ICH recurrence or hematoma expansion.

Methods

All relevant articles published in Pubmed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Science Direct from January 1950 to March 2017 were sourced, and the combined relative risk (RR) was calculated.

Results

A total of 3648 articles were found, and after screening, 6 cohort studies including 1916 patients were included in this meta-analysis. AP resumption was associated with a decreased risk of ischemic or thromboembolic events (RR, 0.61; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.48–0.79; P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the risk of ICH recurrence or hematoma expansion between patients with or without AP resumption (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.47–1.51; P = 0.56).

Conclusion

AP resumption in patients with primary ICH reduced the risk of ischemic or thromboembolic events, without significant increase of risk of ICH recurrence or hematoma expansion.

### Low-dose antiplatelet therapy survey after intracerebral hemorrhage in China: a retrospective hospital-based study [^114zWwbm]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Restarting of antiplatelet therapy (AT) for patients with a history of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is still a clinical dilemma in China. We aimed to investigate the association between low-dose AT and the long-term clinical outcome in Chinese ICH patients. A total of 312 patients with a history of ICH were retrospectively enrolled and followed. The ischemic vascular events, recurrent ICH, and all-cause death were reviewed retrospectively. We explored the predictors of ischemic vascular events and recurrent ICH from all patients using Cox proportional hazard regression model. One hundred fifty-one (48.4%) patients were treated with low-dose AT, and the median duration of follow-up was 4.0 years (interquartile range, 2.5–5 years). Compared to 30 (19.8%) of 151 participants who restarted low-dose AT had ischemic vascular events, 51 (31.7%) of 161 participants who did not receive AT showed ischemic vascular events (p = 0.025). Eighteen (11.9%) of 151 participants treated with low-dose AT had recurrent ICH and 21 (13.0%) of 161 in non-AT participants (p = 0.830). Cox regression analysis also showed that diabetes mellitus was an independent risk factor for ischemic vascular events (p = 0.029). Uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) was independently associated with the risk for both ischemic vascular events (p = 0.025) and recurrent ICH (p = 0.001). Atrial fibrillation (AF) was an independent risk factor for recurrent ICH among patients with a history of ICH (p = 0.018). In a Chinese population of patients with predominantly deep, mild to moderate severity ICH, restarting of low-dose AT at a median of 6.2 months was associated with a lower risk of ischemic vascular events without increased risk of recurrent ICH.

### Haemostatic therapies for acute spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage [^112f2MF2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Outcome after spontaneous (non-traumatic) intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is influenced by haematoma volume; up to one-third of ICHs enlarge within 24 hours of onset. Early haemostatic therapy might improve outcome by limiting haematoma growth. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006, and last updated in 2009.

Objectives

To examine 1) the effectiveness and safety of individual classes of haemostatic therapies, compared against placebo or open control, in adults with acute spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage, and 2) the effects of each class of haemostatic therapy according to the type of antithrombotic drug taken immediately before ICH onset (i.e. anticoagulant, antiplatelet, or none).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Trials Register, CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 11, MEDLINE Ovid, and Embase Ovid on 27 November 2017. In an effort to identify further published, ongoing, and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCT), we scanned bibliographies of relevant articles and searched international registers of RCTs in November 2017.

Selection Criteria

We sought randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any haemostatic intervention (i.e. pro-coagulant treatments such as coagulation factors, antifibrinolytic drugs, or platelet transfusion) for acute spontaneous ICH, compared with placebo, open control, or an active comparator, reporting relevant clinical outcome measures.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and contacted corresponding authors of eligible RCTs for specific data if they were not provided in the published report of an RCT.

Main Results

We included 12 RCTs involving 1732 participants. There were seven RCTs of blood clotting factors versus placebo or open control involving 1480 participants, three RCTs of antifibrinolytic drugs versus placebo or open control involving 57 participants, one RCT of platelet transfusion versus open control involving 190 participants, and one RCT of blood clotting factors versus fresh frozen plasma involving five participants. We were unable to include two eligible RCTs because they presented aggregate data for adults with ICH and other types of intracranial haemorrhage. We identified 10 ongoing RCTs. Across all seven criteria in the 12 included RCTs, the risk of bias was unclear in 37 (44%), high in 16 (19%), and low in 31 (37%). Only one RCT was at low risk of bias in all criteria. In one RCT of platelet transfusion versus open control for acute spontaneous ICH associated with antiplatelet drug use, there was a significant increase in death or dependence (modified Rankin Scale score 4 to 6) at day 90 (70/97 versus 52/93; risk ratio (RR) 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 1.61, one trial, 190 participants, moderate-quality evidence). All findings were non-significant for blood clotting factors versus placebo or open control for acute spontaneous ICH with or without surgery (moderate-quality evidence), for antifibrinolytic drugs versus placebo (moderate-quality evidence) or open control for acute spontaneous ICH (moderate-quality evidence), and for clotting factors versus fresh frozen plasma for acute spontaneous ICH associated with anticoagulant drug use (no evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Based on moderate-quality evidence from one trial, platelet transfusion seems hazardous in comparison to standard care for adults with antiplatelet-associated ICH. We were unable to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy and safety of blood clotting factors for acute spontaneous ICH with or without surgery, antifibrinolytic drugs for acute spontaneous ICH, and clotting factors versus fresh frozen plasma for acute spontaneous ICH associated with anticoagulant drug use. Further RCTs are warranted, and we await the results of the 10 ongoing RCTs with interest.

### Intracranial hemorrhage during dual antiplatelet therapy: JACC review topic of the week [^112WRUZY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with acetylsalicylic acid and a P2Y 12 inhibitor is an established therapy for a broad spectrum of patients with cardiovascular disease. The ischemic benefit of DAPT is partially offset by its increased bleeding risk, with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) being the most serious complication. Although uncommon (0.2%-0.3% annually), its cumulative burden can be substantial given the number of patients afflicted by cardiovascular disease worldwide. Patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack harbor a particularly high risk for ICH when treated with DAPT. Prediction rules may assist clinicians when weighing the risk/benefit ratio of prescribing DAPT for patients with stroke/transient ischemic attack in the nonacute, ambulatory setting. Currently, there are no reversal agents that can rapidly and effectively reverse the effect of P2Y 12 inhibitors in routine practice, although a reversal agent for ticagrelor is under clinical investigation.

### Platelet transfusion versus standard care after acute stroke due to spontaneous cerebral haemorrhage associated with antiplatelet therapy (PATCH): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial [^113Xd83G]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

The study PATCH was published by Baharoglu MI and colleagues in 2016 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Intracerebral hemorrhage and Platelet transfusion. In the PATCH study, the trial question was: what is the role of platelet transfusion after acute spontaneous primary intracerebral hemorrhage in people taking antiplatelet therapy? In the PATCH study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the PATCH study, the population was: 190 patients (78 female, 112 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage who had used antiplatelet therapy for the last 7 days and had a GCS score ≥ 8. The key exclusion criteria were blood on brain imaging suggestive of epidural or subdural hematoma, or an underlying aneurysm or AVM; planned surgical evacuation of intracerebral hemorrhage within 24 h of admission; previous adverse reaction to platelet transfusion; history of coagulopathy; known thrombocytopenia; lacking mental capacity by national legal standards before intracerebral hemorrhage; or if death appeared imminent; infratentorial or large intraventricular hematomas. In the PATCH study, the interventions were: n = 97 platelet transfusion (1–2 platelet concentrates depending on the type of antiplatelet therapy; COX inhibitor or ADP receptor inhibitor plus standard care) n = 93 standard care (standard care alone). In the PATCH study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in death or functional dependence at 3 months (72% vs. 56%; aOR 2.05, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.56). In the PATCH study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in survival at 3 months (68% vs. 77%; OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.19) No significant difference in poor outcome with mRS score 3–6 at 3 months (89% vs. 82%; OR 1.75, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.97) No significant difference in intracerebral hemorrhage growth at 24 hours (2.01 mL vs. 1.16 mL; AD 0.85 mL, 95% CI -5.66 to 7.36). In the PATCH study, the safety outcomes were: significant difference in serious adverse events (42% vs. 29%) and death during hospital stay (24% vs. 17%). In the PATCH study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage who had used antiplatelet therapy for the last 7 days and had a GCS score ≥ 8, platelet transfusion was inferior to standard care with respect to death or functional dependence at 3 months.
