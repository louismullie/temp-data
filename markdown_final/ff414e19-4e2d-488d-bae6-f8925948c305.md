## Question

How does the presence of Radiculopathy affect the treatment of sciatica?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the presence of radiculopathy affects the treatment of sciatica. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and the clinical distinction between sciatica and radiculopathy. Then, I should verify how radiculopathy changes prognosis and natural history. Next, I will examine how it shifts conservative management, including medications and physiotherapy. After that, I need to check how radiculopathy modifies interventional options and surgical decision-making, including timing. Finally, I should consider special scenarios, diagnostic implications, and synthesize a practical clinical approach with attention to terminology and evidence certainty.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate entities. Sciatica is best viewed as a symptom complex of leg pain radiating below the knee in a nerve-root distribution, whereas radiculopathy denotes objective neurological deficit such as weakness, sensory loss, or diminished reflexes in a dermatomyotomal pattern; importantly, radicular pain can exist with or without radiculopathy, and the neuPSIG working group recommends moving away from the vague term "sciatica" toward more precise labels like radicular pain or painful radiculopathy to improve care and research clarity [^115NwCLA] [^115P7Z1M].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about prognosis without checking the data. I initially thought radiculopathy might imply a worse long-term outlook, but wait, let me verify that. Electrodiagnostic-confirmed radiculopathy has been associated with faster and greater improvements in disability during physical therapy compared with patients without radiculopathy, suggesting a favorable prognostic signal in some contexts, even though the presence of neurological deficit can also correlate with severity and chronicity in other cohorts; the natural history of radiculopathy is generally favorable over weeks to months, yet up to roughly a third may have persistent symptoms beyond 6–12 months, which complicates prognostication and timing decisions [^113u4ZJ7] [^115hdpkj] [^116KrCzA].

> Next, I should review how radiculopathy changes conservative management. Let me think about medications first. Evidence for analgesics in "sciatica" is limited and heterogeneous; NSAIDs show little benefit for radicular pain, and guideline-based neuropathic regimens may be more appropriate when a clear neuropathic mechanism is present, though overall certainty remains low, so I need to be cautious and tailor to pain phenotype and risk profile [^115VyQ8n] [^113EPKBn]. For physiotherapy, I should double-check the magnitude of benefit. Contemporary systematic reviews show no consistent short- to long-term superiority of physiotherapy over minimal interventions for clinically diagnosed sciatica, with only small, uncertain benefits versus advice; however, subgroup signals suggest patients with confirmed radiculopathy may respond differently, and electrodiagnostic-confirmed radiculopathy predicts better disability trajectories, so I should individualize exercise and avoid passive modalities that lack support [^11218GHJ] [^113EPKBn] [^113u4ZJ7].

> I will now examine interventional options, and I need to ensure I separate diagnostic from therapeutic roles. Transforaminal epidural steroid injections can provide short- to medium-term pain relief and functional gains in radiculopathy, with evidence ranging from low to moderate certainty depending on control groups and technique; selective nerve root blocks can both aid diagnosis and defer or avoid surgery in a meaningful proportion of patients, though recurrence is common and durability varies, so shared decision-making about goals and timing is essential [^113JhrMx] [^1175azPX] [^1133T7yo] [^112qsQcb]. But wait, what if I'm overstating long-term benefit? I should confirm that most injection trials show effects waning by 3–12 months, reinforcing their role as a bridge or diagnostic tool rather than a definitive cure in many cases [^113JhrMx] [^1175azPX].

> Now, surgical decision-making is where radiculopathy most clearly changes the calculus, so I need to be precise. The presence of progressive motor deficit, cauda equina syndrome, or severe, disabling pain refractory to conservative care constitutes a surgical indication; discectomy yields faster pain relief and improved function in the short to medium term compared with nonoperative care, but differences attenuate by 6–12 months and often disappear by 1–2 years, so expectations must be calibrated [^113UAS6C] [^111dfzmK] [^115p4U5u]. Hold on, I should verify timing recommendations. Multiple studies and guidelines converge on an optimal window of roughly 4–8 months for persistent, severe radiculopathy from disc herniation, with worse outcomes after prolonged symptoms beyond 6–12 months; expedited surgical triage is reasonable when pain is severe, function is profoundly impaired, or deficits progress, acknowledging that most primary care patients improve without surgery [^111V5eqz] [^1167cnpW] [^113ycnyi].

> Let me consider special scenarios and diagnostic implications so I don't miss nuance. Imaging is not routinely indicated early unless red flags are present, but when radiculopathy is suspected or persistent, MRI helps confirm a surgically concordant lesion and guide interventions; I should confirm that only a minority of secondary care patients have a clear surgical target on MRI matching clinical findings, underscoring the need for careful selection and correlation [^1152weWt] [^11242oAe]. I need to check whether electrodiagnostics add value beyond imaging. Electrodiagnostic testing can corroborate radiculopathy, refine prognosis, and occasionally redirect management when the clinical picture and imaging diverge, though it is not universally required [^113u4ZJ7]. Finally, I should remember that terminology matters for trials and care pathways; heterogeneous use of "sciatica" has likely obscured treatment effects, so adopting mechanism-based labels and subgrouping may improve future evidence and clinical decisions [^115NwCLA] [^114KBNkX].

> Synthesis and practical approach: Let me reconsider the core question to ensure internal consistency. The presence of radiculopathy shifts treatment toward earlier specialist input, a lower threshold for imaging to confirm a structural correlate, consideration of neuropathic analgesic strategies, and a more proactive discussion of interventional and surgical options, especially when deficits are progressive or pain remains severe beyond roughly 6–8 weeks; conversely, in the absence of radiculopathy, a more conservative, watchful approach with education, activity, and time is reasonable given the favorable natural history, with imaging and procedures reserved for nonresponders or atypical courses [^113ycnyi] [^115hdpkj] [^1152weWt]. I should double-check that shared decision-making is emphasized because patient preferences for speed of relief versus risks and costs meaningfully alter the value of surgery in this context [^111dfzmK] [^113UAS6C].

Radiculopathy reshapes sciatica care by **shifting focus from pain to neurological function** and by **shortening the timeline to escalation** when deficits are present. Management should prioritize **early recognition of neurological deficits** and prompt referral for surgical evaluation when weakness or cauda equina features are present, as delays worsen outcomes [^1167cnpW] [^111V5eqz]. Conservative care remains first-line for pain-only cases, but radiculopathy lowers the threshold for epidural steroids or surgery and **reduces the time to imaging and specialist review** to prevent irreversible deficits and persistent disability [^113JhrMx] [^1152weWt] [^111dfzmK].

---

## Diagnostic implications

- **Clinical differentiation**: Radiculopathy is defined by objective neurological deficits (weakness, sensory loss, reflex changes) in a nerve root distribution, whereas sciatica alone is primarily a pain syndrome without confirmed neurological deficit [^115P7Z1M] [^1174QzuG].

- **Imaging indications**: The presence of radiculopathy lowers the threshold for early MRI to confirm nerve root compression and guide intervention timing, especially when deficits are progressive or severe [^notfound].

- **Electrodiagnostic testing**: EMG and nerve conduction studies can confirm radiculopathy, differentiate from peripheral neuropathies, and help localize the affected root when imaging is inconclusive [^113u4ZJ7].

---

## Conservative management considerations

- **Activity and physical therapy**: Remaining active and supervised exercise are recommended; however, radiculopathy may limit exercise tolerance, necessitating tailored programs focused on neural mobilization and core stabilization [^112qiq8H].

- **Pharmacological management**: NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, and neuropathic agents (gabapentin, pregabalin) are commonly used, but evidence for pharmacological efficacy in sciatica is limited, and radiculopathy may require more aggressive pain control strategies [^115VyQ8n].

- **Epidural steroid injections**: ESIs are more strongly indicated in radiculopathy due to inflammation from nerve root compression, providing short-term pain relief and functional improvement, and potentially delaying or avoiding surgery [^113JhrMx] [^114VdnHR].

---

## Surgical management considerations

- **Indications for surgery**: Radiculopathy with progressive neurological deficits, cauda equina syndrome, or persistent disabling pain despite conservative care are clear indications for surgical intervention [^1167cnpW] [^115EuZHV] [^112qTvd9].

- **Timing of surgery**: Early surgery (within 6 months) is associated with faster relief and better short-term outcomes, though long-term results often converge with conservative care; delays beyond 6–12 months are linked to worse outcomes [^113UAS6C] [^1167cnpW].

- **Surgical options**: Microdiscectomy is the standard procedure, with minimally invasive techniques offering comparable outcomes and lower complication rates in selected patients [^115EuZHV].

---

## Prognostic implications

Worse outcomes are associated with **radiculopathy**, including higher risks of persistent pain, disability, and chronic neuropathic pain than in sciatica without neurological deficits. Early identification and targeted intervention — especially surgery when indicated — **improve short-term recovery** and may mitigate long-term neurological sequelae, though long-term outcomes often resemble conservative care [^113UAS6C].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

A **stepped-care approach** begins with conservative management, escalating to interventional and surgical options if neurological deficits progress or fail to improve. Emphasizing **early recognition** of neurological deficits and timely referral to specialists helps prevent irreversible neurological damage and persistent disability.

---

Radiculopathy **significantly alters the management of sciatica** by necessitating **earlier imaging**, a lower threshold for epidural steroids, and timely surgical evaluation when deficits are present. Conservative care remains foundational, but **early, targeted interventions** are critical to prevent neurological decline and optimize outcomes.

The prevalence of sciatica in Western society and its economic and functional impact make it an important problem to understand for treatment. Such understanding will impact greatly both medical management and decisions regarding activity, which could affect the perceived disability and financial dependence of a patient.

### Early surgery for sciatica [^113ycnyi]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

In primary care, about two thirds of people with sciatica recover within two to three monthswithout the need or even an indication for invasive treatments. Therefore, extrapolation of Liu and colleagues' findings to a primary care population would be misleading. Their conclusions should be limited to people with a specific diagnosis of radicular pain with or without radiculopathy, who have likely not responded adequately to non-surgical approaches, or to people with severe pain and a large enough impact on quality of life to warrant secondary care referral. A more appropriate conclusion might be that discectomy could be an option for people with radicular pain (with or without radiculopathy) who present to secondary care settings with a clear indication for surgery.

Despite limitations related to the low certainty of evidence, Liu and colleagues' review raises an important point for clinicians, people with sciatica, and policy makers. Growing evidence for worse surgical outcomes associated with prolonged symptom duration, together with the better short and medium term benefits of discectomy reported in this systematic review, challenge the stepped care approach that offers the least invasive options first to everyone with sciatica. Expedited surgical triage would be preferable for people with discogenic sciatica and a clear indication for surgery when rapid pain relief is a priority. Although many international pathways have this intention, reality is often divergent. Access to specialist services is difficult and delayed in many health systems globally, requiring proactiveness and perseverance from the patient, which is often compromised by their symptoms. Easier and faster access to surgical triage is needed for patients who are most likely to benefit.

Although the new review cannot provide clear treatment recommendations, the findings highlight one of the main obstacles to improving outcomes in this clinical field: sciatica is a heterogeneous condition and no routine clinical measures can consistently predict outcome. This knowledge gap hinders early triage, including to more invasive treatments. Solving the heterogeneity puzzle is the key to helping people with sciatica and clinicians choose the right treatment for them earlier in the disease trajectory, while being fully informed of the benefits and risks of surgery.

### Stratified care versus usual care for management of patients presenting with sciatica in primary care (SCOPiC): a randomised controlled trial [^115dZYyK]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The term sciatica describes symptoms of pain radiating from the low back to the legs, and it can be associated with sensory and motor deficits. Occasionally, patients only have leg pain with no associated back pain. A prolapsed disc causing compression of lumbar spinal nerve roots is the most common cause of sciatica. Sciatica has a substantial impact on patients and constitutes a considerable health-care, social, and economic burden.

As in many countries, most patients with sciatica in the UK are managed in primary care. For most patients, especially those with a short symptom duration, usual care comprises mostly a stepped-care approach, starting with conservative interventions such as advice, medications, and physiotherapy, with those patients who show no improvement eventually being offered imaging, specialist assessment, and consideration of suitability for invasive treatments (eg, injections or surgery). A longer symptom duration of sciatica is related to worse outcomes following both conservative and surgical treatment. In the absence of a systematic way to identify patients who might need more support in their care, including a referral to specialists for consideration of more invasive treatments, there is considerable variation in practice. The current, mainly stepped care, approach means that most patients have to show no improvement with previous interventions before being considered for further treatments, resulting in delays in referral to spinal specialists.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed up to Dec 31, 2013, with the search terms "stratified care", "sciatica", and "radiculopathy". The search was restricted to English language publications. We found no previous trials of stratified care for patients with sciatica before undertaking our study. Therefore, no systematic review was possible. The evidence considered came from previous research on prognostic stratified care for patients with non-specific lower back pain (STarT Back and IMPaCT Back studies) and a cohort of patients with sciatica (ATLAS study) in the primary care setting, from which we examined the factors predicting referral of patients to specialist spinal services. These previous studies shaped the development of the stratification algorithm (previously published) that was tested in this trial.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^114KBNkX]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Pain radiating from the spine into the leg is commonly referred to as "sciatica". "Sciatica" may be associated with significant consequences for the person living with the condition, imposing a reduced quality of lifeand substantial direct and indirect costs (eg, £1.2–10.6 billion annually in the United Kingdom alone, extrapolated from primary care data).

Of note, there is no consensus on the definition and diagnostic criteria for "sciatica". The term "sciatica" has been used to encompass a range of nerve-related conditions originating from the spine such as radicular pain or painful radiculopathy. Despite the linguistic allusion to neural involvement, "sciatica" has in some instances even been used to encompass somatic referred pain.

Although these pain conditions may overlap, they are discrete entities with differing dominant pain characteristics (eg, nociceptive or neuropathic), which may require specific management approaches. Nevertheless, these terms are often used interchangeably, and these heterogeneous conditions are often amalgamated in clinical trials. Whether or not this amalgamation contributes to the modest treatment effects seen for "sciatica" is unclear.

Two of the main challenges associated with a diagnosis of "sciatica" relate to the inconsistent use of terminology for the diagnostic labels, "sciatica" or radicular pain or painful radiculopathy, and the identification of neuropathic pain. These challenges hinder collective clinical and scientific understanding and clarity regarding these conditions, impact effective clinical communication and care planning, prevent clear interpretation of the scientific literature related to the condition, and ultimately may contribute to the limited efficacy of care for people living with "sciatica". Indeed, most trials on conservative management for people with "sciatica" either show no, or at best, modest effects.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115wPE3n]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Apart from the possibility that physiotherapy is indeed not effective for patients with sciatica, there are multiple possible reasons for the lack of evidence. The physiotherapy interventions used in the 11 trials comparing physiotherapy with substantial interventions are not all considered contemporary in line with current clinical guidelines. This is a reflection of a lack of recent physiotherapy trials, with only four of the 11 studies published in the last decade. Current clinical guidelines recommend group exercise and continuation of normal activities; however, bedrest was a component of the conservative treatment arm in two trials. The UK NICE Guidelines find no evidence supporting the use of corsets or belts, but these were a core component in another trial conducted before publication of these guidelines. The physiotherapy interventions are highly heterogeneous and remain unclear in several studies. The Bailey study leaves physiotherapy interventions at the discretion of the treating clinician, and the Peul study refers people to physiotherapy only if they are fearful of movement, leaving uncertainty about how many participants in those trials had active physiotherapy treatment. It could also be argued that patients deemed suitable for surgery are likely to represent a specific subgroup that may be less amenable to physiotherapeutic interventions (e.g. with intractable pain or neurological deficit). Indeed, two trials comparing physiotherapy interventions with surgery included patients who had already failed conservative treatment, raising serious concerns that physiotherapy interventions could possibly succeed in such a population.

A further challenge to progress in treatment is the diagnosis of sciatica itself. There is no agreed definition for sciatica, reflected in the wide range of definitions used in clinical trials, including our review. The broad term 'sciatica' comprises radiculopathy, radicular pain, or somatic referred pain. The differing patient populations bring clinical heterogeneity to most meta-analyses. Unfortunately, the high heterogeneity among studies reduces the confidence in our results. Together with previous systematic reviews with inconclusive findings, our results question the value of continuing to perform clinical trials in heterogeneous groups of patients. Although subgrouping according to risk stratification showed promise in the management of people with non-specific low back pain, this has failed in patients with sciatica. Subgrouping using a mechanism-based approach shows promising signals in patients with neuropathic pain of different aetiologies, but has yet to be examined in sciatica.

### Low back and radicular pain: a pathway for care developed by the British pain society [^112dHsJD]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

These consensus guidelines aim to provide an overview of best practice for managing chronic spinal pain reflecting the heterogeneity of low back pain. Most guidelines have covered only one aspect of spinal care and thus have been divisive and potentially worsened the quality of care. Additionally, some of the evidence base is subjective and of poor quality. The British Pain Society low back pain pathway has reached across all disciplines and involved input from patients. It is recognized, however, that there is an urgent need for further good-quality clinical research in this area to underpin future guidelines. Considerable work is still needed to clarify the evidence; however, foundations have been laid with this pathway. Key features include: risk stratification; clarification of intensity of psychological interventions; a logical progression for the management of sciatica; and decision points for considering structural interventions such as spinal injections and surgery.

### Biologic drugs as analgesics for the management of low back pain and sciatica [^117KLLZ6]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To discuss the current knowledge on the impact of commonly used biologic agents (i.e., anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha [anti-TNF-α] and anti-nerve growth factor [anti-NGF]) in the management of low back pain with or without sciatica.

Methods

A narrative literature review of studies investigating the use of biologic agents for the management of low back pain and sciatica was conducted. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for English language publications. A hand-search of reference lists of relevant studies was also performed.

Results

Although some observational studies showed that inhibition of TNF-α reduced pain and improved function, randomized controlled trials and a meta-analysis failed to demonstrate the superiority of anti-TNF-α over placebo in this regard. Anti-TNF-α, however, reduced the risk of having invasive procedures such as discectomy and radicular block in cases of sciatica. Conversely, controlled studies showed moderate pain reduction and mild functional improvement with anti-NGF administration, but the side effect profile of anti-NGF was unfavorable compared with placebo.

Conclusions

Overall, anticytokine treatments have limited efficacy in patients with chronic low back pain with or without sciatica. However, larger and better-designed studies may need to be performed in specific patient subpopulations. Low back pain is particularly disabling in younger patients. This group therefore represents a potential target population for investigating the effectiveness of anticytokine therapies, especially where other pharmacological and nonpharmacological management strategies have failed.

### Early surgery for sciatica [^111dfzmK]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

International guidelines for sciatica recommend a stepped care approach starting with conservative management (ie, physiotherapy and medication), escalating to steroid injections, then surgery when non-surgical treatment has failed or when major radicular weakness is present. Unfortunately, evidence on the effectiveness of both non-surgicaland surgical options is uncertain.

In a linked paper, Liu and colleagues (doi:) report a methodologically sound and balanced systematic review and meta-analysis of 24 randomised clinical trials evaluating the evidence of surgical care for people with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation. Their meta-analysis suggests that discectomy is statistically significantly superior to non-surgical treatment in reducing leg pain and disability. However, effects were moderate at best (10–20 point reduction on a 100 point scale), but mostly small (5–10 point reduction). The benefits of discectomy were only evident in the short to medium term, with no clinically meaningful effects beyond 12 months.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115VyQ8n]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Although the knowledge of evidence about surgery has changed in the past decade, we still do not know much about a simpler conservative treatment such as pharmacological interventions for sciatica. A recent clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Societyrecommends that surgery should be considered as a treatment option for persistent and disabling radicular pain caused by a herniated lumbar disc. This recommendation relies on moderate short term benefits from large randomised clinical trials such as those by Peul et aland Weinstein et al, with 283 and 501 patients randomised, respectively. At present, there is a limited number of mainly small trials of pharmacological interventions with typically short term follow-up. For example, the evidence to support the use of anticonvulsants in chronic sciatica arises from a single trial with only 50 participants.

Our principal finding is that there is insufficient evidence to confidently guide the use of any analgesic or adjuvant pain medicine for the effective management of pain and disability in patients with sciatica. Until this changes, we would advise clinicians treating such patients who exhibit clinical features of neuropathic pain to consider evidence based guidelines for neuropathic painand for other patients with sciatica to consider therapeutic recommendations from current guidelines for the management of non-specific low back pain.

### Epidural injections for lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica: a comparative systematic review and meta-analysis of cochrane review [^113JhrMx]. Pain Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Epidural injections are one of the commonly performed procedures in managing low back and lower extremity pain. In the past, Pinto et al and Chou et al performed systematic reviews and meta-analyses with a recent update from Oliveira et al showing lack of effectiveness of epidural steroid injections in managing lumbar radiculopathy. In contrast, multiple other systematic reviews and meta-analyses have supported the efficacy and use of epidural injections utilizing fluoroscopic guidance.

Study Design

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of epidural injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain with sciatica or lumbar radiculopathy.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of 3 categories of epidural injections for lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica performed utilizing saline with steroids, local anesthetic alone, or steroids with local anesthetic.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, RCTs with a placebo control or an active control design, performed under fluoroscopic guidance, with at least 6 months of followed-up were included. The outcome measures were pain relief and functional status improvement. Significant improvement was defined as 50% or greater pain relief and functional status improvement. Literature search was performed through January 2021. Methodological quality assessments were performed. Evidence was summarized utilizing principles of best evidence synthesis.

Results

In this analysis, a total of 21 RCTs were utilized with at least 6 months of follow-up and performed under fluoroscopic guidance. However, only 6 of 25 trials from Cochrane review met inclusion criteria for this review. Based on qualitative analysis, of the 21 trials included in the present analysis, there was only one placebo-controlled trial found to be negative. With conventional meta-analysis, there was no significant difference among the studies because all of the studies were active control with local anesthetic or local anesthetic and steroids. Further, with single-arm analysis, of the 5 trials included in that portion of the study, significant improvement was seen with local anesthetic alone compared to local anesthetic and steroids. There was a tendency for better improvement with steroids in terms of both pain relief and functional status. The level of evidence is Level I or strong for local anesthetic with steroids and Level I to II or moderate to strong for local anesthetic as a single agent based on multiple relevant high quality RCTs.

Limitations

Despite multiple trials available, there is a paucity of true RCTs performed under fluoroscopic guidance with any of the approaches.

Conclusion

Epidural injections with or without steroids for radiculopathy showed significant effectiveness with Level I or strong evidence for local anesthetic with steroids and Level II to I or moderate to strong evidence with local anesthetic alone.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^113dV893]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

ACOEM Guidelines — scope and clinical questions for invasive treatments target management of low back disorders among working-age adults and span acute (up to 1 month duration), subacute (1 to 3 months' duration), and chronic (more than 3 months' duration) clinical timeframes; covered conditions include low back pain (LBP), sciatica/radiculopathy, spondylolisthesis, facet arthrosis, degeneration of the disc, failed back surgery syndrome, and spinal stenosis, while several broad categories including congenital disorders or malignancies and specific intraoperative procedures are not addressed. Guidance is organized by treatment phase (acute, subacute, chronic, postoperative) to answer multi-part questions including when, and for what conditions invasive procedures are recommended, when, and for what conditions surgery are recommended, which surgeries are recommended for which conditions, and what management options are recommended for delayed recovery.

### Surgical management of lumbar radiculopathy: a systematic review [^115p4U5u]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Lumbar radiculopathy is characterized by radiating pain with or without motor weakness or sensory disturbances; the point prevalence ranges from 1.6 to 13.4%. The objective of this review was to determine the efficacy, safety, and cost of surgical versus nonsurgical management of symptomatic lumbar radiculopathy in adults.

Methods

We searched PubMed from January 1, 2007, to April 10, 2019 with hand searches of systematic reviews for studies prior to 2007. One reviewer extracted data and a second checked for accuracy. Two reviewers completed independent risk of bias and strength of evidence ratings.

Results

We included seven RCTs (N = 1158) and three cost-effectiveness analysis. Surgery reduced leg pain by 6 to 26 points more than nonsurgical interventions as measured on a 0- to 100-point visual analog scale of pain at up to 26 weeks follow-up; differences between groups did not persist at 1 year or later. The evidence was somewhat mixed for function and disability in follow-up through 26 weeks (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.16 (95% CI, -0.30 to -0.03); minimal differences were observed at 2 years (SMD -0.06 (95% CI, -0.20 to 0.07). There were similar improvements in quality of life, neurologic symptoms, and return to work. No surgical deaths occurred and surgical morbidity was infrequent. The incidence of reoperations ranged from 0 to 10%. The average cost per quality-adjusted life year gained from a healthcare payor perspective ranged from $51,156 to $83,322 for surgery compared to nonsurgical interventions.

Discussion

Most findings are based on a body of RCT evidence graded as low to very low certainty. Compared with nonsurgical interventions, surgery probably reduces pain and improves function in the short- and medium-term, but this difference does not persist in the long-term. Although surgery appears to be safe, it may or may not be cost-effective depending on a decision maker's willingness to pay threshold.

### Systematic review of prognostic factors for work participation in patients with sciatica [^116KrCzA]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbosacral radicular syndrome, often called sciatica, is commonly caused by a herniated lumbar disc. The syndrome is characterised by lower limb pain radiating below the knee in an area of the leg served by one or more lumbosacral nerve roots. There may be other neurological findings such as sensory and motor deficits. Sciatica is usually self-limiting with pain and disability decreasing over time, but not all patients fully recover. Surgical treatment is usually offered in more severe cases when severe radiating leg pain persists after a period of conservative management. In a large study (n = 782), 34% of conservatively treated patients experienced very or extremely bothersome symptoms at 6 months follow-up. Similarly, a systematic review (n = 13 883) showed that surgically treated patients reported, despite decreased pain and disability scores 3 months after surgery, on average mild to moderate pain and disability 5 years after surgery.

The direct and indirect costs of patients suffering from sciatica are high, and an important cost driver is work absenteeism. In the acute phase, most people with sciatica will stop working and some will resume work in the short time. Return to work (RTW) rates vary from 66% after 2 yearsto between 67% and 85% after 10 years. The high socioeconomic impact of sciatica and its impact on the ability to work in patients raise the need to identify factors that predict reduced RTW. Prognostic evidence could assist clinicians to better define high risk groups and inform both clinicians and patients with regard to counselling and treatment choices to promote RTW. The objective of this study was to review and summarise prognostic factors of work participation in patients with sciatica.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^116ADYBA]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

Although some attempts have been made to better define spine-related leg pain, there is no consensus on terminology nor on the clinical criteria used to define "sciatica", or different subgroups of spine-related leg pain in clinical trials. This conundrum has resulted in inconsistent criteria and their application to define spine-related leg pain in interventional studies.

The absence of agreement on terminology and lack of consensus on case definition is likely a reason for the large range in prevalence data reported for "sciatica" (1.6%-43%). Importantly, the heterogeneity of patient populations resulting from the inconsistent use of terminology (including case definitions) and variable eligibility criteria may in part explain the conflicting evidence and influence the interpretation of efficacy of treatments (eg, physiotherapeutic interventions and pharmaceutical management) for people with "sciatica".,

The IASP has, therefore, suggested that the term "sciatica" should not be used. Instead, they recommended that pain in the lower limb which originates from the lower back should be described with more precise case definitions such as referred pain, radicular pain, or (painful) radiculopathy. These definitions are in line with the terminology described by Bogduk et al.(Table 1).

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111jg71Q]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

'Sciatica' is a broad term describing spinally referred pain of neural origin that radiates into the leg. The reported prevalence of sciatica varies widely (1.2–43%), probably due to different diagnostic criteria, reflecting a heterogeneous patient population. Sciatica is a significant burden to healthcare and the economy, as a neuropathic component in low back pain it is not only linked to poorer quality of life, but also increases the already high costs of back pain by a further 67%. Although prognosis is good for most patients, up to 45% continue to have symptoms for 12 months or longer.

Physiotherapy interventions such as exercise, manual therapy and psychological therapy are recommended in clinical guidelines for people with sciatica. However, the available systematic reviews examining the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions are at least ten years old. For example, study selection in the most recent systematic review comparing surgery versus conservative care ended in 2009. Their results could not be meta-analysed due to poor reporting and clinical heterogeneity. Similarly, a network-meta-analysis concluded its search in 2009, finding no support for the effectiveness of exercise or traction while manipulation may be beneficial. However, the latter was based on a single study only. Prior to this, reviews specifically focusing on conservative management of sciatica were published in 2010 and 2007 and were unable to make strong conclusions on the superiority of any treatment. More recent reviews published in 2015 and 2016 were limited to a subset of physiotherapy interventions (e.g. physical activity versus surgery and exercise versus advice to stay active). A recent review looked at a range of physiotherapy interventions, however the review did not include a meta-analysis.

Of note, sciatica is a heterogeneous condition with no agreed diagnostic criteria. Most reviews to date make no reference to the clinical diagnosis of included study participants rendering it unclear whether patients had confirmed nerve involvement. The objective of this systematic review was therefore to assess the up-to-date evidence on the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions compared with control interventions in people with clinically diagnosed sciatica.

### Sciatica: what the rheumatologist needs to know [^113KCa4R]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Sciatica is a set of symptoms rather than a specific diagnosis, and is caused by a herniated lumbar disc in the vast majority of cases. The most important symptom is lower limb pain radiating below the knee and into the foot and toes. The clinical course of acute sciatica is generally favorable, with most pain and related disability improving within 2–4 weeks with or without treatment. Diagnosis mainly involves history taking and physical examination. Imaging is warranted if there is evidence of an underlying pathology other than disc herniation, such as infection or malignancy, and in patients with severe symptoms that do not improve after 6–8 weeks of conservative treatment. MRI is the preferred imaging modality, as it can visualize soft tissues better than CT and does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation. Conservative treatment is generally the first-line option in patients with sciatica; however, the currently available evidence does not show any intervention — including a broad range of conservative and surgical approaches — to have clearly superior outcomes. Thus, patient preference seems to be an important factor in the clinical management of sciatica.

### Comparative systematic review and meta-analysis of cochrane review of epidural injections for lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica [^1175azPX]. Pain Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Epidural injections are among the most commonly performed procedures for managing low back and lower extremity pain. Pinto et al and Chou et al previously performed systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which, along with a recent update from Oliveira et al showing the lack of effectiveness of epidural steroid injections in managing lumbar disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and radiculopathy. In contrast to these papers, multiple other systematic reviews and meta-analyses have supported the effectiveness and use of epidural injections utilizing fluoroscopically guided techniques. A major flaw in the review can be related to attributing active-controlled trials to placebo-controlled trials. The assumption that local anesthetics do not provide sustained benefit, despite extensive evidence that local anesthetics provide long-term relief, similar to a combination of local anesthetic with steroids is flawed.

Study Design

The Cochrane Review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of epidural injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain with sciatica or lumbar radiculopathy were reanalyzed using systematic methodology and meta-analysis.

Objectives

To re-evaluate Cochrane data on RCTs of epidural injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain with sciatica or lumbar radiculopathy utilizing qualitative and quantitative techniques with dual-arm and single-arm analysis.

Methods

In this systematic review, we have used the same RCTs from the Cochrane Review of a minimum of 20% change in pain scale or significant pain relief of ≥ 50%. The outcome measures were pain relief and functional status improvement. Significant improvement was defined as 50% or greater pain relief and functional status improvement. Our review was performed utilizing the Cochrane Review methodologic quality assessment and the Interventional Pain Management Techniques - Quality Appraisal of Reliability and Risk of Bias Assessment (IPM-QRB). Evidence was summarized utilizing the principles of best evidence synthesis and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) system. Clinical relevance of the pragmatic nature of each study was assessed.

Results

In evaluating the RCTs in the Cochrane Review, 10 trials were performed with fluoroscopic guidance. Utilizing conventional dual-arm and single-arm meta-analysis, the evidence is vastly different from the interpretation of the data within the Cochrane Review. The overall combined evidence is Level I, or strong evidence, at one and 3 months, and Level II, or moderate evidence, at 6 and 12 months.

Limitations

The limitation of this study is that only data contained in the Cochrane Review were analyzed.

Conclusion

A comparative systematic review and meta-analysis of the Cochrane Review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of epidural injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain with sciatica or lumbar radiculopathy yielded different results. This review, based on the evidence derived from placebo-controlled trials and active-controlled trials showed Level I, or strong evidence, at one and 3 months and Level II at 6 and 12 months. This review once again emphasizes the importance of the allocation of studies to placebo-control and active-control groups, utilizing standards of practice with inclusion of only the studies performed under fluoroscopic guidance.

### Impact of preoperative duration of symptoms on patient satisfaction, outcomes and complications after lumbar discectomy: a propensity-matched comparison [^1167cnpW]. Spine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sciatica due to lumbar herniated disk (LDH) is a frequent cause of disability and reduced quality life. In general, the natural history of sciatica is favorable with spontaneous remission in the majority of patients. Surgical intervention in the form of a decompression or discectomy is clearly indicated in the presence of a neurologic deficit. However, in patients with severe pain and disability or in patients whom recovery is unacceptably slow, surgical intervention can also be recommended. – For these patients, in whom there is no clear-cut surgical indication, evidence-based recommendations on the timing of the surgical intervention have not been established.

The NASS Evidence-Based Clinical Guidelines Committee raised the question regarding optimal timing for surgical intervention in 2012 when they published the Clinical Guidelines for Multidisciplinary Spine Care: "Diagnosis and Treatment of Lumbar Disc Herniation with Radiculopathy". As there was no literature specifically addressing the question, they made their recommendations based on four available papers addressing the issue of surgical timing. – The committee suggests surgical intervention within six months if the patients' symptoms are severe enough to warrant surgery. In general, the committee concluded that surgery within one year of symptoms is associated with faster recovery and improved long-term outcomes. Since the publication of the NASS guideline several publications have addressed the timing of surgical intervention. – In a systematic review published in 2015 by Schoenfeld and Bono, they conclude "A possible point beyond which outcomes may be compromised is six months after symptom onset". Siccoli et al.suggested reducing the maximum time to surgery down to between 14 to 22 weeks.

The ideal method to determine the optimal timing of surgical intervention of symptomatic LDH would be to perform a randomized study in which patients are assigned surgery at different time points. A similar design has been attempted to reveal whether surgical intervention of LDH was better than non-surgical treatment, but the large group of patients choosing to cross over from the assigned groups complicated the interpretation of these results. Furthermore, there is an ethical problem in conducting a trial where some patients with severe pain are expected to wait for a long time to be treated.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the time to surgery is associated with postoperative patient satisfaction, health-related quality of life, leg and back pain, complications, and reoperations following surgery for LDH using propensity-matched cohorts.

### Timing of surgery for sciatica: subgroup analysis alongside a randomized trial [^1172ZxJJ]. European Spine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica is characterized by radiating pain in an area of the leg typically served by one lumbar or sacral spinal nerve root and is sometimes associated with sensory and motor deficit. Apart from infrequent causes, sciatica is mostly due to a herniated lumbar disc. Because of the high prevalence in general practice and the major impact of low back disorders on society, surgery is frequently performed to speed up recovery of sciatica. Probably as a result of socio-cultural circumstances, different timing of surgical removal of the herniated portion of the disc appears to vary greatly in the western countries. Recently the option of surgery was offered to patients after only 6 weeks of unremitting sciatica. The major reason to offer early surgery was the unattractive alternative: the slow natural course of sciatica, occasionally extending over 4 years. Globally two options were available: (1) early surgery and (2) prolonged conservative care, possibly with surgery at a later date. Since surgery is economically affordable and relatively safe, most patients in western countries prefer early surgery rather than to wait for months or even years, risking long term work-disability and presence of chronic pain. Recently this study provided evidence that the prolonged conservative care strategy resulted in complete recovery at 1 year as similar as the surgical strategy, but it took twice as long compared to early surgery. The 1-year effects of the two assigned treatment strategies were similar as far as function and pain were concerned in the randomized cohorts. The contribution of this study is that patients, opting for early surgery, now are able to base their decision on realistic data about the alternative strategy, with similar outcomes at 1 and 2 years compared to early surgery. Individual decisions regarding early surgery or not are still difficult to make. Since treatment effects can differ between subgroups of patients, this might influence the indication for early disc surgery.

Therefore, it would be of great interest to patients and physicians to define determinants which occur early in the course of sciatica and predict the speed of recovery with either prolonged conservative care or early surgery. Insight in these determinants may help in the decision about when to perform surgery. We carried out a subgroup analysis of data from the aforementioned randomized trial to evaluate anamnestic, neurological and radiological variables which might in theory influence the difference in rate of recovery between the two treatment strategies.

### Surgical treatment and outcomes of lumbar radiculopathy [^113DavSM]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Lumbar disk herniation is a significant cause of lumbar radiculopathy and results in billions of dollars in health care expenditure. Herniated lumbar disks cause mechanical and chemical irritation of the nerve roots leading to complaints of sciatica. Surgeons have several surgical options when approaching herniated disks, including various microsurgical procedures. The 3 most prominent studies to date on surgical and nonsurgical management of herniated disks agree on the efficacy of surgery over medical management in the short term but have some discrepancies when looking at long-term results. Cauda equina syndrome is a variation of lumbar disk herniation in which patients experience a combination of saddle anesthesia, abnormal lower extremity reflexes, and neurogenic bowel or bladder symptoms.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^114FdS7z]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pain radiating from the spine into the leg is commonly referred to as "sciatica", "Sciatica" may include various conditions such as radicular pain or painful radiculopathy. It may be associated with significant consequences for the person living with the condition, imposing a reduced quality of life and substantial direct and indirect costs. The main challenges associated with a diagnosis of "sciatica" include those related to the inconsistent use of terminology for the diagnostic labels and the identification of neuropathic pain. These challenges hinder collective clinical and scientific understanding regarding these conditions. In this position paper, we describe the outcome of a working group commissioned by the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group (NeuPSIG) of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) which was tasked with the following objectives: (1) to revise the use of terminology for classifying spine-related leg pain and (2) to propose a way forward on the identification of neuropathic pain in the context of spine-related leg pain. The panel recommended discouraging the term "sciatica" for use in clinical practice and research without further specification of what it entails. The term "spine-related leg pain" is proposed as an umbrella term to include the case definitions of somatic referred pain and radicular pain with and without radiculopathy. The panel proposed an adaptation of the neuropathic pain grading system in the context of spine-related leg pain to facilitate the identification of neuropathic pain and initiation of specific management in this patient population.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^113LdhDA]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

5. Conclusion

In conclusion, the working group has revised the terminology of spine-related leg pain and its specific case definitions. The panel recommends discouraging use of the term "sciatica" in clinical practice and research; instead, accurate case definitions should be used. The panel, with support from the NeuPSIG membership consultation, proposes the term of "spine-related leg pain" as an umbrella term to include the case definitions of somatic-referred pain and radicular pain with and without radiculopathy. This term may help differentiate pain originating from structures in the back from those originating from nonspinal structures (eg, somatic-referred pain from the hip).

The panel also proposed an adaptation of the neuropathic pain grading system in the context of spine-related leg pain, to facilitate the identification of neuropathic pain and initiation of specific management in this patient population.

Overall, the panel highlighted that the grading system is ideally applied within and augmented by the clinical work up, rather than considered in isolation. Furthermore, the proposed recommendations should be seen as a starting point that will likely need to be reviewed and revised as new knowledge arises and a more definitive understanding emerges. Table 2 summarises the recommendations and recommended actions in research.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^115P7Z1M]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) etiologic descriptors distinguish nonspecific, specific, radiculopathy, sciatica, and visceral disease–related pain as follows: Nonspecific low back pain is pain in which no specific cause or structure can be identified to account for the patient's perceived symptoms; specific low back pain is pain that can be linked to a disorder, disease, infection, injury, trauma, or structural deformity and a potential causal relationship can be found between the diagnosis and the pain; radiculopathy is dysfunction of a nerve root associated with pain, sensory impairment, weakness, or diminished deep tendon reflexes in a nerve root distribution; sciatica is pain radiating down the leg below the knee in the distribution of the sciatic nerve, suggesting nerve root compromise due to mechanical pressure or inflammation and is the most common symptom of lumbar radiculopathy; and visceral diseases resulting in back pain are pain secondary to diseases of the viscera with examples including endometriosis, prostatitis, and aortic aneurysm.

### Acupotomy for military training-induced lumbar radiculopathy with sciatica: protocol of a randomized controlled trial [^1114XxRv]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The rising global healthcare burden of lumbar disc herniation (LDH) has intensified research into effective therapies. While prior studies have evaluated acupuncture and massage for sciatica in civilian populations, combat-related low back pain frequently involves disc herniation with sciatica — present in 62% of cases. Traditional therapies are often suboptimal for military operational contexts, as prolonged recovery times and side-effect risks conflict with operational imperatives. A 2025 meta-analysis of interventional pain techniquesdemonstrated that ultrasound-guidance reduces adverse events by 37% compared to blind procedures, supporting its risk-reduction utility in resource-constrained settings. This study addresses an evidence gap by examining non-pharmacological interventions for occupational sciatica and proposing military healthcare improvements. If proven effective, acupotomy could emerge as a pivotal non-pharmacological military medicine treatment, reducing reliance on NSAIDs and epidural injections. Its short recovery enables weekly sessions, potentially decreasing medical discharges through accelerated return-to-duty rates — critical for sustaining combat readiness. Future cost-effectiveness analyses may establish its economic advantage over surgery or long-term pharmacotherapy, with findings extending to civilian cohorts like firefighters facing comparable physical demands.

The study has several limitations. Acupotomy's efficacy is highly operator-dependent, relying significantly on practitioner skill and experience. Primary outcomes were assessed only at 4 weeks and 1 month post-treatment, leaving its long-term effectiveness (eg, at 6 months or 1 year) unknown. The participant cohort consisted solely of active-duty military personnel aged 18–45, limiting generalizability to other populations. Additionally, the nature of the intervention complicates blinding and introduces potential placebo effects, which could impact the assessment of allocation concealment. We must also account for neurophysiological effects from the sham procedure. A superficial puncture (5–10 mm depth) may stimulate cutaneous nociceptors, potentially inducing transient pain modulation through gate control mechanisms. Alternatively, it might trigger limited pro-inflammatory cytokine release (eg, IL-6), contributing to non-specific pain modulation. While we will statistically control for rescue medication (Celecoxib), its analgesic effects may obscure the treatment's therapeutic benefits. This approach reflects real-world military clinical practice, where adjunct medication is often unavoidable in severe sciatica cases. Dynamic MRI for intervertebral foraminal volume assessment was considered but omitted due to cost and logistical constraints in military settings.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^111V5eqz]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation — impact of preoperative symptom duration on outcomes indicates worse results with prolonged symptoms and suggests an intermediate window for surgery. One study provides Level IV evidence that a duration of symptoms greater than six months is associated with less improvement following microdiscectomy than symptom duration less than six months. Another series concluded that patients with sciatica for more than 12 months have a less favorable outcome. In a 132‑patient series assessed at one year using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), VAS and Clinical Overall Score (COS), patients with short leg pain duration (less than four months) had a significantly lower COS at follow‑up than those with longer duration (> eight months). The authors concluded that the optimal time for surgical treatment may be four to eight months, with weak indications for surgery before two months and a probably increased risk of a less favorable result after eight months; delaying surgery for more than eight months is associated with poor outcomes.

### Outcome evaluation of the operative management of lumbar disc herniation causing sciatica [^1179FKcN]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Object

The authors conducted a study to assess health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and the appropriateness of surgery in patients who have undergone elective lumbar discectomy.

Methods

The study involved a prospective cohort of 82 surgically treated patients with lumbar disc herniation causing lower-extremity radiculopathy. An independent study coordinator recorded demographic data and administered the North American Spine Society (NASS) lumbar spine instrument and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) before treatment, and at 6 months and 1 year after surgery. The HRQOL results were also compared with normative data for the NASS and SF-36. The influence of baseline variables on HRQOL was determined using regression modeling. The InterQual Indicators for Surgery and Procedures (ISP) were used to compare surgeon practice patterns with standardized indications for surgery. The NASS neurogenic symptom (NSS) and pain/disability scores (PDSs) showed very significant improvement at 6 months and little change between 6 months and 1 year. The SF-36 physical function and bodily pain scale scores were associated with the greatest improvement. Interestingly, the 1-year NASS (NSS and PDS) and SF-36 (only PCS) scores remained lower than those of age-matched normative data. Other than preoperative HRQOL scores, the only other variable that inversely influenced HRQOL was the duration of time between symptom onset and surgery. Ninety-five percent of ISP forms were completed, and 97% of the indications recorded by the surgeon matched the criteria.

Conclusions

The reporting of standardized outcomes in association with indications for surgery is feasible and may help elucidate the ideal rate for discectomy.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^111vr5QA]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of surgery in patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniations is not without dispute. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of surgery versus conservative therapy (including epidural injections) for patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation. A comprehensive search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and PEDro up to October 2009. Randomised controlled trials of adults with lumbar radicular pain, which evaluated at least one clinically relevant outcome measure (pain, functional status, perceived recovery, lost days of work) were included. Two authors assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane criteria and extracted the data. In total, five studies were identified, two of which with a low risk of bias. One study compared early surgery with prolonged conservative care followed by surgery if needed; three studies compared surgery with usual conservative care, and one study compared surgery with epidural injections. Data were not pooled because of clinical heterogeneity and poor reporting of data. One large low-risk-of-bias trial demonstrated that early surgery in patients with 6–12 weeks of radicular pain leads to faster pain relief when compared with prolonged conservative treatment, but there were no differences after 1 and 2 years. Another large low-risk-of-bias trial between surgery and usual conservative care found no statistically significant differences on any of the primary outcome measures after 1 and 2 years. Future studies should evaluate who benefits more from surgery and who from conservative care.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^114ZLMiJ]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation and radiculopathy — about 95% of herniated discs occur at the lower lumbar spine (L4/5 and L5/S1 level); disc herniation above this level is more common in people aged over 55 years. The estimated prevalence of lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica has been described as 9.8 per 1,000 cases, 5.1 in men and 3.7 in women. Lumbar radiculopathy secondary to disc herniation resolves spontaneously in 23% to 48% of patients, but up to 30% to 70% will still have significant symptoms after one year, with 5% to 15% of patients undergoing surgery. Based on controlled evaluations, lumbar intervertebral discography has been shown to diagnose internal disc disruption in 39% of a younger cohort of patients with low back pain, and in a study without assessing internal disc disruption the reported prevalence rate of discogenic pain was 26%.

### Stratified care versus usual care for management of patients presenting with sciatica in primary care (SCOPiC): a randomised controlled trial [^113D4tKN]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Sciatica has a substantial impact on individuals and society. Stratified care has been shown to lead to better outcomes among patients with non-specific low back pain, but it has not been tested for sciatica. We aimed to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of stratified care versus non-stratified usual care for patients presenting with sciatica in primary care.

Methods

We did a two-parallel arm, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial across three centres in the UK (North Staffordshire, North Shropshire/Wales, and Cheshire). Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had a clinical diagnosis of sciatica, access to a mobile phone or landline number, were not pregnant, were not currently receiving treatment for the same problem, and had no previous spinal surgery. Patients were recruited from general practices and randomly assigned (1:1) by a remote web-based service to stratified care or usual care, stratified by centre and stratification group allocation. In the stratified care arm, a combination of prognostic and clinical criteria associated with referral to spinal specialist services were used to allocate patients to one of three groups for matched care pathways. Group 1 was offered brief advice and support in up to two physiotherapy sessions; group 2 was offered up to six physiotherapy sessions; and group 3 was fast-tracked to MRI and spinal specialist assessment within 4 weeks of randomisation. The primary outcome was self-reported time to first resolution of sciatica symptoms, defined as "completely recovered" or "much better" on a 6-point ordinal scale, collected via text messages or telephone calls. Analyses were by intention to treat. Health-care costs and cost-effectiveness were also assessed. This trial is registered on the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN75449581.

Findings

Between May 28, 2015, and July 18, 2017, 476 patients from 42 general practices around three UK centres were randomly assigned to stratified care or usual care (238 in each arm). For the primary outcome, the overall response rate was 89% (9467 of 10 601 text messages sent; 4688 [88%] of 5310 in the stratified care arm and 4779 [90%] of 5291 in the usual care arm). Median time to symptom resolution was 10 weeks (95% CI 6.4–13.6) in the stratified care arm and 12 weeks (9.4–14.6) in the usual care arm, with the survival analysis showing no significant difference between the arms (hazard ratio 1.14 [95% CI 0.89–1.46]). Stratified care was not cost-effective compared to usual care.

Interpretation

The stratified care model for patients with sciatica consulting in primary care was not better than usual care for either clinical or health economic outcomes. These results do not support a transition to this stratified care model for patients with sciatica.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^11218GHJ]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Physiotherapy interventions are prescribed as first-line treatment for people with sciatica; however, their effectiveness remains controversial. The purpose of this systematic review was to establish the short-, medium- and long-term effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions compared to control interventions for people with clinically diagnosed sciatica.

Methods

This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO CRD42018103900. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase, PEDro, PubMed, Scopus and grey literature were searched from inception to January 2021 without language restrictions. Inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials evaluating physiotherapy interventions compared to a control intervention in people with clinical or imaging diagnosis of sciatica. Primary outcome measures were pain and disability. Study selection and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers with consensus reached by discussion or third-party arbitration if required. Risk of bias was assessed independently by two reviewers using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool with third-party consensus if required. Meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed with random effects models using Revman v5.4. Subgroup analyses were undertaken to examine the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions compared to minimal (e.g. advice only) or substantial control interventions (e.g. surgery).

Results

Three thousand nine hundred and fifty eight records were identified, of which 18 trials were included, with a total number of 2699 participants. All trials had a high or unclear risk of bias. Meta-analysis of trials for the outcome of pain showed no difference in the short (SMD − 0.34 [95%CI − 1.05, 0.37] p = 0.34, I² = 98%), medium (SMD 0.15 [95%CI − 0.09, 0.38], p = 0.22, I² = 80%) or long term (SMD 0.09 [95%CI − 0.18, 0.36], p = 0.51, I² = 82%). For disability there was no difference in the short (SMD − 0.00 [95%CI − 0.36, 0.35], p = 0.98, I² = 92%, medium (SMD 0.25 [95%CI − 0.04, 0.55] p = 0.09, I² = 87%), or long term (SMD 0.26 [95%CI − 0.16, 0.68] p = 0.22, I² = 92%) between physiotherapy and control interventions. Subgroup analysis of studies comparing physiotherapy with minimal intervention favoured physiotherapy for pain at the long-term time points. Large confidence intervals and high heterogeneity indicate substantial uncertainly surrounding these estimates. Many trials evaluating physiotherapy intervention compared to substantial intervention did not use contemporary physiotherapy interventions.

Conclusion

Based on currently available, mostly high risk of bias and highly heterogeneous data, there is inadequate evidence to make clinical recommendations on the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions for people with clinically diagnosed sciatica. Future studies should aim to reduce clinical heterogeneity and to use contemporary physiotherapy interventions.

### Impact of condoliase on health-related quality of life in participants with radicular leg pain associated with lumbar disk herniation: results from a United States phase 3 clinical trial [^117Wo1zV]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disk herniation (LDH) is a common spinal condition caused by localized displacement of disk material (primarily the nucleus pulposus) beyond the normal limits of the intervertebral disk space, often resulting in nerve root compression and debilitating pain. In many cases, LDH-associated radicular leg pain (often referred to as sciatica) resolves spontaneously or through conservative symptom management strategies such as rest, physical therapy, and pain-relieving medications. Epidural steroid injections (ESIs) are used to provide short-to-medium term symptomatic relief in certain cases, although they are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for this indication. Individuals with persistent pain despite nonsurgical management have limited treatment options apart from surgery, perhaps contributing to the resurgence of interest in nonsurgical alternatives such as chemonucleolysis (recently reviewed elsewhere). – In addition to pain relief, optimal LDH management should include restoration or maintenance of the individual's quality of life (QoL) and productivity.

### Are combined conservative interventions effective in reducing pain, disability and / or global rating of pain in people with sciatica with known neuropathic pain mechanisms? [^113bsyoP]. European Spine Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

National Clinical Guidelines recommend an integrated combination of conservative management strategies for sciatica. However, the efficacy of such combinations have not been established. The purpose of this systemic review with meta-analysis was to determine the efficacy of combined conservative (non-pharmacological) compared to single interventions for people with sciatica with a confirmed neuropathic mechanism.

Methods

The systematic review was registered on PROSPERO CRD42023464011. The databases included were the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase, PubMed, Scopus, APA PsycINFO, and grey literature sources from inception until January 2024. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of combined non-pharmacological interventions in comparison to a control intervention among individuals with sciatica of a neuropathic origin identified using diagnostic or clinical tests. Primary outcomes were back pain, leg pain, and disability. The secondary outcome was global rating of change. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment (using Cochrane ROB2) were assessed by two reviewers. Meta-analysis was performed with a random effects model with inverse variance weighting used for the metanalysis using SPSS v 29.

Results

3,370 articles were identified, of which 6 were included. Risk of bias was high in one study and had some concerns in the remaining 5 studies for each outcome measure. There was evidence of efficacy for combined interventions for back pain in the short-and long-term (SMD -0.56 (95% CI -0.91, -0.22, p = 0.01, I² = 0.2; SMD -0.44 (95% CI -0.79, -0.1, p = 0.03, I² = 0.00), and for disability in the short term (SMD -0.48 (95% CI -0.92, -0.04, p = 0.04, I² = 0.72). There was no evidence of efficacy for leg pain at any time point ((short term SMD -0.45 (95% CI -0.91, 0.02, p = 0.06, I² = 0.65), medium term (SMD -0.29 (95% CI -1.12, 0.54, p = 0.35, I² = 0.82), long term (SMD -0.40 (95% CI -1.23, 0.44, p = 0.18, I² = 0.57). Certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate.

Conclusion

There are few studies that have combined conservative (non-pharmacological) interventions for the management of sciatica with a neuropathic component pain mechanism, as recommended by National Clinical Guidelines. This review indicates that combining conservative (no-pharmacological) management strategies appeared more effective than single interventions for the outcomes of low back pain in the short and long term, and for disability in the short term, but not for leg pain at any time point. The overall low certainty of evidence, suggests that future studies with more robust methodologies are needed.

### Prevalence of weakness and factors mediating discrepancy between reported and observed leg weakness in people with sciatica [^115C547k]. European Spine Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica describes spine-related leg pain of neural origin, and its prevalence could be as high as 43%. At least one third of people with sciatica develop persistent pain lasting one year or longer The burden of sciatica is considerable, with many people describing total suspension of normal life due to the severity and nature of symptoms. Systematic reviews have failed to show good effect sizes for sciatica treatments, including physiotherapy, pharmacological, injection and surgical management

Radicular leg pain is a cardinal feature of sciatica, but a substantial proportion of patients also report symptoms suggesting loss of function such as hypoaesthesia (numbness) and weakness. Leg weakness is a commonly reported symptom in people with sciatica. Trials of people with clinically diagnosed sciatica suggest that between 30–70% of participants have detectable weakness. Symptoms of leg weakness can persist for two years in up to 25% of people with sciatica. Leg weakness in sciatica is associated with lower physical function and higher emotional distress.

Despite the high prevalence and impact of weakness in people with sciatica, little is known about the relationship between the symptom of reported weakness and the clinical sign of observed weakness. Empirically, clinicians often observe that patients report weakness while myotomal muscle testing remains normal. However, to our knowledge there are currently no data on potential discrepancies between reported and observed weakness. This study therefore aims to examine the prevalence and potential discrepancies between reported and observed leg weakness in people with sciatica. In addition, we investigate which factors mediate potential discrepancies.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^115NwCLA]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

3.2. Outcomes phase 1a: terminology

The working group agreed that the term "sciatica" is not accurate (ie, the sciatic nerve is typically not affected with spine-related leg pain), is used inconsistently (ie, no agreed definition or clinical criteria), and does not always help to make sense of pain for patients. However, the panel also acknowledged that the term "sciatica" has a historically strong hold in the wider clinical and research communities: It is well established in patient and public language (even if its use is not always in a neural context) and firmly embedded in the scientific literature (eg, it is Medical Subject Headings in leading search databases). For these reasons, and from a pragmatic point of view, the panel recognised that the term "sciatica" is likely to be retained by the wider public and research community.

Nevertheless, the panel recommended discouraging the term "sciatica" for use in clinical practice and research. If used, it should include further specification of what the term means. Clinically, such specification may include a more accurate explanation for patients (ie, that the source is in the back and that there is variability among presentations. For an example see). In a research setting, further specification should include the use of more accurate case definitions (see below for recommended case definitions for specific spine-related leg pain). As a minimum, a description of specific clinical criteria used as case definition for the study population need to be provided.

3.2.1. Recommended case definitions of specific spine-related leg pain

The panel recommended the use of case definitions for specific spine-related leg pain, including the following:
(1) Somatic-referred pain
(2) Radicular pain without or with radiculopathy

The case definitions of somatic-referred pain, radicular pain, and radiculopathy have already been defined and described by Bogdukand have been incorporated into the IASP terminology. The working group in principle agreed with these case definitions and their descriptions. We collated the descriptions of each case definition and added several clarifying adjustments (Table 1, and text in italics below). Of note, the panel emphasised that differentiation of these specific case definitions needs to take place in the context of the broader clinical presentation and, ideally, a detailed clinical examination.

### Physical examination for lumbar radiculopathy due to disc herniation in patients with low-back pain [^1136ySRX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Low-back pain with leg pain (sciatica) may be caused by a herniated intervertebral disc exerting pressure on the nerve root. Most patients will respond to conservative treatment, but in carefully selected patients, surgical discectomy may provide faster relief of symptoms. Primary care clinicians use patient history and physical examination to evaluate the likelihood of disc herniation and select patients for further imaging and possible surgery.

Objectives

(1) To assess the performance of tests performed during physical examination (alone or in combination) to identify radiculopathy due to lower lumbar disc herniation in patients with low-back pain and sciatica;(2) To assess the influence of sources of heterogeneity on diagnostic performance.

Search Strategy

We searched electronic databases for primary studies: PubMed (includes MEDLINE), EMBASE, and CINAHL, and (systematic) reviews: PubMed and Medion (all from earliest until 30 April 2008), and checked references of retrieved articles.

Selection Criteria

We considered studies if they compared the results of tests performed during physical examination on patients with back pain with those of diagnostic imaging (MRI, CT, myelography) or findings at surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed the quality of each publication with the QUADAS tool, and extracted details on patient and study design characteristics, index tests and reference standard, and the diagnostic two-by-two table. We presented information on sensitivities and specificities with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for all aspects of physical examination. Pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were computed for subsets of studies showing sufficient clinical and statistical homogeneity.

Main Results

We included 16 cohort studies (median N = 126, range 71 to 2504) and three case control studies (38 to100 cases). Only one study was carried out in a primary care population. When used in isolation, diagnostic performance of most physical tests (scoliosis, paresis or muscle weakness, muscle wasting, impaired reflexes, sensory deficits) was poor. Some tests (forward flexion, hyper-extension test, and slump test) performed slightly better, but the number of studies was small. In the one primary care study, most tests showed higher specificity and lower sensitivity compared to other settings. Most studies assessed the Straight Leg Raising (SLR) test. In surgical populations, characterized by a high prevalence of disc herniation (58% to 98%), the SLR showed high sensitivity (pooled estimate 0.92, 95% CI: 0.87 to 0.95) with widely varying specificity (0.10 to 1.00, pooled estimate 0.28, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.40). Results of studies using imaging showed more heterogeneity and poorer sensitivity. The crossed SLR showed high specificity (pooled estimate 0.90, 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.94) with consistently low sensitivity (pooled estimate 0.28, 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.35). Combining positive test results increased the specificity of physical tests, but few studies presented data on test combinations.

Authors' Conclusions

When used in isolation, current evidence indicates poor diagnostic performance of most physical tests used to identify lumbar disc herniation. However, most findings arise from surgical populations and may not apply to primary care or non-selected populations. Better performance may be obtained when tests are combined.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111TFJhh]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The clinical syndrome of sciatica has been recognised since ancient times. Currently believed to arise from a disorder of the nerve root, the syndrome is known by a range of synonyms such as lumbosacral radicular syndrome, nerve root compromise, nerve root pain, and nerve root entrapment or irritation. Sciatica is considered to be a prognostic indicator of poor outcome among patients with low back painwith a substantial proportion continuing to have persistent pain for two years or longer. The annual prevalence of sciatica is estimated to be between 14%and 2%. While there are a range of definitions of sciatica, the key clinical features that can help clinicians to distinguish it from non-specific low back pain include unilateral leg pain that is worse than the low back pain, pain radiating below the knee, presence of numbness or pins and needles in a dermatomal distribution, positive results on a straight leg raise test, and weakness or reflex changes, or both, in a myotomal distribution.

Analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs are often prescribed for patients with sciatica. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of sciatica are about five times more likely to take drugs than those with low back pain only. Drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), skeletal muscle relaxants, opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, systemic corticosteroids, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants. While guidelines provide clear and generally consistent recommendations for the prescription of drugs for non-specific low back pain, this is not the case for sciatica.

At present the efficacy and tolerability of commonly prescribed analgesic and adjuvant drugs for the management of patients with sciatica has not been established. The problem is that there are no reviews that specifically focus on these drugs that are used in primary care to manage sciatica. Because most guidelines recommend a course of conservative care before surgery is considered, it is imperative to understand what best practice conservative care should entail. In this systematic review we determined the efficacy and tolerability of analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs typically administered in primary care (orally, topically, or parentally) in the management of patients with sciatica when compared with other treatment options or no treatment.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^111qVtyj]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation — epidemiology and demographics — shows that the prevalence of a symptomatic herniated lumbar disc is about 1% to 3%, with the highest prevalence among people aged 30 to 50 years and a man to woman ratio of 2:1; in individuals aged 25 to 55 years, about 95% of herniated discs occur at the lower lumbar spine (L4-L5 and L5-S1). The estimated prevalence of lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica is 9.8 per 1,000 cases, and it has been estimated that lumbar disc herniation occurs in 30% of the population at some time in their lifetime; studies also have shown sciatic symptoms may be present from 1.6% in the general population to 43% in select working populations in the US.

### What are long-term predictors of outcomes for lumbar disc herniation? A randomized and observational study [^117H3Gip]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although previous studies have illustrated improvements in surgical cohorts for patients with intervertebral disc herniation, there are limited data on predictors of long-term outcomes comparing surgical and nonsurgical outcomes.

Questions/Purposes

We assessed outcomes of operative and nonoperative treatment for patients with intervertebral disc herniation and symptomatic radiculopathy at 8 years from the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial. We specifically examined subgroups to determine whether certain populations had a better long-term outcome with surgery or nonoperative treatment.

Methods

Patients with symptomatic lumbar radiculopathy for at least 6 weeks associated with nerve root irritation or neurologic deficit on examination and a confirmed disc herniation on cross-sectional imaging were enrolled at 13 different clinical sites. Patients consenting to participate in the randomized cohort were assigned to surgical or nonoperative treatment using variable permuted block randomization stratified by site. Those who declined randomization entered the observational cohort group based on treatment preference but were otherwise treated and followed identically to the randomized cohort. Of those in the randomized cohort, 309 of 501 (62%) provided 8-year data and in the observational group 469 of 743 (63%). Patients were treated with either surgical discectomy or usual nonoperative care. By 8 years, only 148 of 245 (60%) of those randomized to surgery had undergone surgery, whereas 122 of 256 (48%) of those randomized to nonoperative treatment had undergone surgery. The primary outcome measures were SF-36 bodily pain, SF-36 physical function, and Oswestry Disability Index collected at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and then annually. Further analysis studied the following factors to determine if any were predictive of long-term outcomes: sex, herniation location, depression, smoking, work status, other joint problems, herniation level, herniation type, and duration of symptoms.

Results

The intent-to-treat analysis of the randomized cohort at 8 years showed no difference between surgical and nonoperative treatment for the primary outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures of sciatica bothersomeness, leg pain, satisfaction with symptoms, and self-rated improvement showed greater improvement in the group randomized to surgery despite high levels of crossover. The as-treated analysis of the combined randomized and observational cohorts, adjusted for potential confounders, showed advantages for surgery for all primary outcome measures; however, this has the potential for confounding from other unrecognized variables. Smokers and patients with depression or comorbid joint problems had worse functional outcomes overall (with surgery and nonoperative care) but similar surgical treatment effects. Patients with sequestered fragments, symptom duration greater than 6 months, those with higher levels of low back pain, or who were neither working nor disabled at baseline showed greater surgical treatment effects.

Conclusions

The intent-to-treat analysis, which is complicated by high rates of crossover, showed no difference over 8 years for primary outcomes of overall pain, physical function, and back-related disability but did show small advantages for secondary outcomes of sciatica bothersomeness, satisfaction with symptoms, and self-rated improvement. Subgroup analyses identified those groups with sequestered fragments on MRI, higher levels of baseline back pain accompanying radiculopathy, a longer duration of symptoms, and those who were neither working nor disabled at baseline with a greater relative advantage from surgery at 8 years.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^115EuZHV]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Management of sciatica varies considerably. Patients are commonly treated in primary care but a small proportion is referred to secondary care and may eventually undergo surgery if complaints remain present for at least 6 weeks. Conservative treatment for sciatica is primarily aimed at pain reduction, either by analgesics or by reducing pressure on the nerve root. There seems to be consensus that surgery is indicated in carefully selected patients for sciatica in presence of a herniated lumbar disc, or severe sciatica with serious or progressive neurologic deficits and imaging demonstrating lumbar disc herniation at the nerve root level correlating with the patient's examination findings. The primary rationale of surgery for sciatica is that surgery will relieve nerve root irritation or compression due to herniated disc material. The most common type of surgery is open microdiscectomy, surgical removal of part of the disc, performed with or without the use of an operating microscope or other magnifying tools. Other minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as endoscopic surgery have recently been developed. In the absence of serious neurologic deficits or for persistent non-radicular low back pain, consensus whether surgery is useful or not has not yet been established. Furthermore, the timing of the intervention with respect to prolonged conservative care has not been evaluated properly.

At present, several randomised trials have been published that have compared surgery with conservative treatment. The objective of this systematic review is to compare and summarise the evidence regarding the effectiveness of surgery compared with conservative treatment for patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113UAS6C]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

Very low to low certainty evidence suggests that discectomy was superior to non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections in reducing leg pain and disability in people with sciatica with a surgical indication, but the benefits over non-surgical care reduced over time. Discectomy might be an option for people who require rapid leg pain relief and disability improvement, when the benefits outweigh the risks and costs related to surgery.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^1174QzuG]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD low back pain guideline glossary — radicular and related terminology is defined as follows: Radicular LBP is pain in the back and lower limb associated with a disorder of the spinal nerve root and/or its ganglion and may or may not be accompanied by objective evidence of impaired conduction (radiculopathy); non-radicular LBP typically does not radiate past the knee; radiculopathy refers to impaired conduction along a spinal nerve or its roots, may be diagnosed by clinical exam or electrodiagnostic testing, and may or may not be accompanied by radicular pain; sciatica is pain along the path of the sciatic nerve, is a symptom rather than a condition, and is often used interchangeably with radiculopathy; referred pain originates in one location but is perceived in other regions and does not involve stimulation of nerve roots, differentiating it from radicular pain; neurogenic claudication comprises leg pain symptoms while walking or standing relieved by sitting or spinal flexion and is associated with spinal stenosis; spinal stenosis is narrowing of the central spinal canal or neuroforamina usually due to degenerative changes, may also be congenital, and may or may not present with symptoms like neurogenic claudication; a herniated disc is herniation of the nucleus pulposus through its fibrous covering that can compress adjacent nerve roots; and non-specific LBP lacks signs of a serious underlying condition or specific spinal cause, with degenerative imaging changes usually considered nonspecific and often called uncomplicated LBP.

### The efficacy of therapeutic selective nerve block in treating lumbar radiculopathy and avoiding surgery [^112qTvd9]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar radiculopathy is defined as pain in the lower back, radiating to the lower limb along the course of a certain lumbar nerve caused by a pathological process such as inflammation or mechanical compression of that nerve root. It can affect the quality of life and limit the activities of affected patients. It is mostly caused by lumbar disc prolapse (LDP) compressing the nerve root or nerve root foraminal stenosis. Sciatica is a pain in the distribution of the sciatic nerve. Radicular pain can be associated with numbness, paresthesia, tingling, muscle weakness, and loss of specific reflexes, but even without the presence of these symptoms, we cannot exclude the diagnosis.

The compression of the nerve root is mostly caused by herniated discs in approximately 90% of cases. Additionally, foraminal stenosis and, less often, tumors, cysts, inflammation, and/or nerve root injury are other possible causes.

Most sciatica cases can be treated conservatively with rest, muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and physiotherapy. Failure of conservative management is usually considered in the case of continuity of the pain for at least six weeks. On the other hand, the exact timing needed for the patient to stay on the conservative care before switching to another treatment method has not been appropriately evaluated. Meanwhile, an immediate surgical intervention is required in acute settings, especially in those with acute drop foot or bladder incontinence. In the absence of these red flags, there is much disagreement about surgery's effectiveness in chronic sciatica. Moreover, many patients might be reluctant to undergo surgery or may not be fit for general anesthesia, making it crucial to search for alternative management like Selective Nerve Root Block.

Selective nerve root block (SNRB) is a procedure that can be used as a diagnostic and therapeutic method. SNRB can be used in multiple sites, including cervical and lumbar. Steroids are usually injected near the spinal nerve as it exits from the intervertebral foramen. The use of steroids is due to their ability to reduce inflammation and induce numbness to the pain transmission through the nerve. The procedure can be done under fluoroscopy or CT guidance. The use of SNRB in patients with severe pain can reduce their pain and thus reduce their need for surgery. The objective of our study is to investigate the effectiveness of the use of fluoroscopy-guided therapeutic SNRB as a non-surgical option for patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation and/or foraminal stenosis.

### Surgical microdiscectomy versus transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc (NERVES): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^113yXFzx]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Herniated lumbar disc resulting in back and leg pain travelling below the knee, sciatica, or radiculopathy is a worldwide burden to society. The condition affects an estimated 11% of patients presenting to their primary-care provider worldwide, with an annual prevalence estimated to be 2.2%. Generally, outcomes are favourable and 80% of patients improve with conservative care within 12–24 months. However, given that patients affected by this condition are typically aged 40–45 years, there is a risk of loss of livelihood if it is not managed promptly.

Treatment options have been considered by various expert-led guidelines, but no consensus exists for transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) due to a scarcity of class I evidence. Generally, once analgesia and lifestyle-modifying treatments have failed, steroid nerve root injections and surgical microdiscectomy are recommended for severe persistent cases. Stepwise care approaches based on treatment with non-opioids have been identified as likely to represent a more cost-effective approach than strategies involving direct referral for disc surgery; however, evidence for a stepwise treatment progression involving TFESI is scarce. Following various randomised trials comparing surgical treatments with non-surgical therapy, surgery is often deemed the most successful treatment option, leading to more than 10 000 discectomy procedures per year in the UK and 190 000 such procedures in the United States. The costs to the UK's National Health Service (NHS) for microdiscectomy (requiring patients to be hospitalised for 2 nights, on average) are approximately £4500 compared with £700 for TFESI.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114fgkNq]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Risk of bias and certainty of evidence

Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias (selection, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting bias) of included trials using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We assessed funding and conflict of interest statements as part of assessing other bias (eg, industry funded trials without declaration of investigator autonomy was judged to be at high risk; supplemental file 11). We rated the certainty of evidence for each of the outcomes by using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) framework. For each GRADE domain, the quality of evidence was downgraded by one level if a serious flaw was present, that is: risk of bias (> 25% of participants in this comparison were from studies at high risk of bias (supplemental file 3), inconsistency (substantial unexplained interstudy heterogeneity, I² > 50), imprecision (95% confidence interval were 20 points different to the point estimates), and, and small study effects (> 25% of participants were from small studies (< 100 participants per arm)). Certainty of evidence was rated as high, moderate, low, or very low. Any discrepancies between the evaluation of risk of bias and certainty of evidence were resolved through consensus, or, when required, by arbitration with a third reviewer.

### Physical therapy plus general practitioners' care versus general practitioners' care alone for sciatica: a randomised clinical trial with a 12-month follow-up [^112imvE9]. European Spine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

The lumbosacral radicular syndrome (LRS), also called sciatica, is a disorder with radiating pain in the leg below the knee in one or more lumbar or sacral dermatomes, and can be accompanied by phenomena associated with nerve root tension or neurological deficits. A prolapsed disc is a frequent cause of LRS, but other causes include spinal or lateral recess stenosis, tumours and radiculitis. The incidence of LRS in the Netherlands is estimated at 5 per 1,000 persons a year.

There is consensus that treatment of LRS in the first 6–8 weeks should be conservative. The exact content of the conservative treatment is, however not yet clear. After the study of Vroomen et al. bed rest is no longer regarded as a treatment option for LRS. Assessed in a recent systematic review was the effectiveness of conservative treatments of LRS. Thirty trials were included that evaluated injections (n = 14), traction (n = 9), physical therapy (PT) (n = 4), bed rest (n = 2), manipulation (n = 2), medication (n = 2) and acupuncture (n = 1) as a treatment for LRS. Because several trials indicated no evidence of an effect it is not recommended to use corticosteroid injections and traction as treatment option. Whether clinicians should prescribe PT, bed rest, manipulation or medication could not be concluded from this review. Therefore, there is no evidence that one type of conservative treatment is clearly superior to others for patients with LRS.

In an previous observational study it was shown that GPs did not adhere to the guideline regarding the referral to PT; almost half of patients with LRS were referred for PT, although this was not recommended in the guideline. No specific characteristic could be identified to explain this referral to PT. Moreover, there is a lack of knowledge concerning the effectiveness of PT in LRS. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effectiveness of PT management additional to GP management compared to GP management alone, in patients with acute LRS.

### Discectomy compared with standardized nonoperative care for chronic sciatica due to a lumbar disc herniation: a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial with 2-year follow-up [^111nR1Ks]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Randomized controlled trials evaluating acute sciatica have not demonstrated prolonged improvements in terms of patient-reported pain and function. For chronic sciatica, however, microdiscectomy has been found to be superior at 1 year. Whether this effect persists during the second year is not known. The purpose of the present study was to report the 2-year outcomes following lumbar microdiscectomy as compared with standardized nonoperative care for the treatment of chronic sciatica resulting from a lumbar disc herniation.

Methods

The present study is a secondary analysis of a previously reported randomized controlled trial with extension to 2 years of follow-up. Patients with radiculopathy for 4 to 12 months resulting from an L4-L5 or L5-S1 disc herniation were randomized to microdiscectomy or 6 months of nonoperative care followed by surgery if needed. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed at 2 years for the primary outcome (the intensity of leg pain) (range of possible scores, 0 [no pain] to 10 [worst pain]) as well as for secondary outcomes (including the Oswestry Disability Index score, the intensity of back pain, and quality of life).

Results

One hundred and twenty-eight patients were randomized in the present study. Twenty-four (38%) of the 64 patients who had been randomized to nonoperative care crossed over to surgical treatment by 2 years following enrollment. At the 2-year time point, the follow-up rate was approximately 70%. At 2 years, the operative group had less leg pain than the nonoperative group (mean, 2.8 ± 0.4 compared with 4.2 ± 0.4; treatment effect, 1.3 [95% confidence interval, 0.3 to 2.4]). The treatment effect favored surgery for all secondary outcome measures at 6 months and 1 year and for back pain intensity and physical function at 2 years.

Conclusions

At 2 years, the present study showed that microdiscectomy was superior to nonoperative care for the treatment of chronic sciatica resulting from an L4-L5 or L5-S1 disc herniation. However, the difference between the groups did not surpass the minimal clinically important difference at 2 years as was reached at earlier follow-up points, likely as the result of patients crossing over from nonoperative to operative treatment.

### Computed tomography for the diagnosis of lumbar spinal pathology in adult patients with low back pain or sciatica: a diagnostic systematic review [^111TnhFU]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of CT scans vary considerably across primary diagnostic studies. Potential sources of heterogeneity include: difference in considered pathology, variation in CT protocols, differences in study design, included study populations, or the methodological quality of the studies. Therefore, our aim is to provide evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of CT in patients with LBP or sciatica with symptoms suspected to be caused by specific underlying pathology. Sciatica is here defined as nerve root pain or radiating leg pain. We also aim to assess the potential influence of various sources of heterogeneity on the outcomes.

### Incidence of and risk factors for lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy in adults: a systematic review [^115Q14bg]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Our review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statement. Details of our protocol were registered in the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO No. CRD42011001197). This review was initially conducted in partial fulfilment of a doctoral dissertation in epidemiology as an unpublished manuscript, which we updated to September 2023.

Data sources and search strategy

We systematically searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Trials Registry, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Database of Abstracts Related to Effects; initially from 1970 to March 2016. In February 2022, we conducted an update and identified records published between April 2016 and January 2022. We ran a final search update to 21 September 2023. Search strategies combined terms from three key concepts: intervertebral disc herniation, lumbar spine, and etiology, and were developed in consultation with an experienced information specialist (Appendix 1 in Online Supplementary Material). The reference lists of all eligible studies were also searched for additional relevant studies.

Eligibility criteria

Eligible were studies published in English, French, or Spanish that used cohort, case–control, or randomised trial (only potentially eligible for risk factor evidence) designs to examine the incidence of and/or risk factors for LDH with radiculopathy in adults (aged 18 years or older). We excluded studies of asymptomatic LDH, or LDH due to neoplasm, infection, fracture, dislocation, or spinal cord injury. Narrative reviews, case reports or series, cross-sectional, cadaveric, animal studies, or studies where the majority of the population was < 18 years of age were also excluded.

In consultation with clinical experts, we defined LDH with radiculopathy as lumbar or lumbosacral radiculopathy, sciatica, and/or clinically relevant neurologic deficit, with or without advanced imaging (i.e. MRI or CT) confirmation of disc herniation. We conceptualised and applied three types of case definitions for LDH with radiculopathy. A surgical case definition was used for study populations that had surgical intervention for LDH with radiculopathy. A hospital-based case definition applied when study participants sought medical care for LDH in a hospital setting without surgical intervention. A clinical case definition of LDH with radiculopathy was used to describe study populations identified or selected based on relevant clinical signs and symptoms of LDH with radiculopathy in primary care or community-based settings.

### Natural history of radiculopathy [^115hdpkj]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Radicular pain is a frequent complaint of patients presenting to outpatient primary care and musculoskeletal clinics. Most cases of radiculopathy are self-limiting, and symptoms resolve over the course of weeks to months. There is spontaneous resolution of disc herniations, and clinical improvement correlates with morphologic resolution. Knowledge of the natural history of radiculopathy is crucial for the health care provider to appropriately counsel and treat patients with this disorder. Although each patient should be managed individually, the favorable prognosis of radiculopathy based on the natural history supports a conservative approach for the initial weeks to months for most patients.

### The efficacy of therapeutic selective nerve block in treating lumbar radiculopathy and avoiding surgery [^113HhgZs]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients and Methods

Methodology

This is a prospective study of therapeutic nerve root block in patients with sciatica at Jordan University Hospital. Approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) number (67/2018/1535) at our institution. This study was conducted according to guidelines set in the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent before study enrollment. The study's data was collected from the Neurosurgery Department at Jordan University Hospital, between January 2018 and December 2019.

Study Population

All patients initially included in the study described severe sciatica for three to six months with a VAS of 8/10 and above (n = 779). Patients with associated cervical radiculopathy, cauda equina syndrome, clinically documented motor weakness, traumatic lumbar radiculopathies, or previous spine surgeries were excluded. All patients with documented malignancies or inflammatory diseases were excluded as well (n = 358).

All remaining patients had a trial of conservative treatment for at least 4–6 weeks (n = 421). The conservative therapy consisted of bed rest for three days, NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, occasional use of antiepileptics like Gabapentin, and supervised physiotherapy. They were followed up weekly to look for progression or deterioration of their signs and symptoms. During the follow-up period, patients with intractable pain who could not tolerate conservative management or those who developed neurological deficits were excluded and offered surgery (n = 345). Only those who failed to improve after 4–6 weeks of conservative treatment and their VAS remained 8/10, and above were included in our study (n = 76) [Figure 1].

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113EPKBn]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review, including 18 studies and 2699 participants with a clinical diagnosis of sciatica suggests that physiotherapy interventions are only better than minimal interventions in reducing pain at long-term time points. Physiotherapy interventions are less effective than substantial interventions (e.g. surgery) in reducing pain at medium term and disability at short- and medium-term time points. However, heterogeneity was considerable in most meta-analyses, and confidence intervals were large, indicating substantial uncertainly surrounding the precision of these estimates. The favourable results for substantial intervention for pain in medium term and disability in short term did not persist following sensitivity analyses removing studies with high risk of bias. The currently available literature therefore provides insufficient evidence to support strong recommendations for physiotherapy interventions in the treatment of people with sciatica.

This systematic review reflects a wider collective inability to show significant benefit of non-surgical treatments for people with sciatica. Pharmacological options fail to demonstrate effects beyond placebo, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, anti-convulsants, anti-depressants or opioids. Epidural cortisone injections have small effect sizes and short-term benefits. These findings are disappointing given the clear need for effective conservative interventions voiced by patients.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — intravenous glucocorticoids: VAS sciatic leg improvement of 5.7 cm occurred on day one, but no durable benefit was observed at day 30 with a single intravenous bolus of glucocorticoids for any outcome, and a glucocorticoid bolus had no effect on functioning or objective signs of radicular irritation. This study provides Level I therapeutic evidence that a single intravenous infusion of glucocorticoids provides only temporary (three days) relief of pain, with the authors concluding that a single intravenous pulse of glucocorticoid provides a small and transient improvement in sciatic leg pain.

### Epidural steroid injections compared with gabapentin for lumbosacral radicular pain: multicenter randomized double blind comparative efficacy study [^1123Fy5Z]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The physical, socioeconomic, and psychological impact of low back pain is enormous. Low back pain has been the leading cause of years lost to disability over the past several decades, with a lifetime prevalence that ranges between 50% and 90%. The economic cost is estimated to exceed $100bn a year in the United States (£67bn, €93bn), over half of which can be attributed to lost productivity. Efforts to deal with the worldwide burden posed by low back pain have become an international priority.

The classification of back pain is perhaps the most important distinction for clinicians to make as it influences investigation and treatment decisions at all levels of care. Since the development of validated instruments to categorize low back pain, studies have determined that the proportion of chronic cases that are predominantly neuropathic (that is, sciatica, radicular pain from a herniated disc, or neurogenic claudication from spinal stenosis) ranges between 17% and 55%, with one review finding a median prevalence rate of 41%. Whereas the presence of neuropathic symptoms portends a more negative prognosis for acute episodes, lumbosacral radicular pain might be more responsive to procedural interventions than non-specific back pain.

### Early surgery for sciatica [^11242oAe]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Studies that evaluated plasma disc decompression and chemonucleolysis were also included, but the small number did not permit firm recommendations. Commendably, the authors carefully rated the certainty of evidence, which was low or very low. The true effect could, therefore, be markedly different from the reported estimates, allowing only weak clinical recommendations. This certainty of evidence is disappointing considering that 11 of the 12 trials evaluating discectomy were reported after the CONSORT reporting guidelines were published. The authors concluded that "discectomy might be an option for people with sciatica who feel that the rapid relief offered by discectomy outweighs the risks and costs associated with surgery".

So, does that mean that people with sciatica should be offered surgery because they will experience more rapid improvements in pain and disability compared with non-surgical interventions? As always, context is key when interpreting study findings. In this systematic review, although not specifically mentioned by the research authors, most of the trials that examined the effect of discectomy recruited patients from secondary care. According to the stepped care approach recommended by international guidelines, secondary care referral should only be initiated for people who have not responded to conservative care or have severe radicular weakness. Furthermore, to be considered for surgery, patients require a surgical indication such as a structural target on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Accordingly, this systematic review included only trials of people with discogenic sciatica diagnosed by MRI. However, only 30% of patients in secondary care have an MRI finding that matches the spinal level predicted by clinical examination and thus represents a clear surgical indication. The results of this systematic review therefore relate to a much smaller and more defined group than the heterogeneous population with sciatica encountered in community healthcare settings.

### Mechanical diagnosis and therapy for radiculopathy [^11511YKP]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Despite its classic clinical presentation, and even when confirmed by compatible imaging findings of a herniated disc, the radiculopathy diagnosis provides only limited assistance for making decisions about treatment. The 2003 Medicare data revealed an eightfold variation in the rates of lumbar laminectomy and discectomy across geographic regions. In an effort to address this uncertainty in care, this article describes the management paradigm known as Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy and its usefulness in decision-making for patients with lumbar radiculopathies, and reviews the relevant literature.

3 RELEVANT FEATURES OF RADICULOPATHY

Radiculopathy is a syndrome of neurological impairment of sensory and/or motor function of a spinal nerve root that arises from nerve root injury or compression. Patients' symptoms and signs vary depending on which nerve root is affected, as outlined in Table 1 and Figure 1. Although the precise frequency of lumbosacral radiculopathies is unknown, the vast majority involve the L5 and/or S1 nerve roots, as the L4/L5 and L5/S1 intervertebral discs are the most likely to herniate. Depending on the direction of herniation, either the L5 and/or S1 nerve root can be affected. Like radiculopathy from disc herniation, radiculopathy due to other etiologies, including degenerative spondyloarthropathy, typically resolve spontaneously in weeks to months but may persist in some patients.

TABLE 1
Common features of radiculopathies by level.

Radiculopathy often, but not always, includes radiating pain and/or sensory loss along dermatomal territories, and can be termed "sciatica" by patients and healthcare providers. The character of the pain may be neuropathic — burning, electric — or may be described as dull or aching. Patients may or may not have concurrent low back pain. Factors on history that correlate highly with nerve root impingement on imaging and/or radiculopathy on EDX include pain that radiates within a specific dermatome (odds ratio [OR] 4.1), pain with coughing or sneezing (OR 3.2), subjective muscle weakness (OR 2.2), and subjective sensory loss (OR 2.1).

### Surgical microdiscectomy versus transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc (NERVES): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^114VdnHR]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

A single-centre randomised trial of 128 patients compared surgery with conservative care (including steroid injections) for sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc and found that surgery provided better clinical improvement in leg pain scores by 24 points. Although this study reported a surgical benefit, there was a clear difference in safety profiles between treatments, with nine adverse events (including one nerve root injury) in patients receiving surgery and none in patients managed conservatively. Furthermore, a single-institution study might not be generalisable across wider health-care providers. Although treatment for radiculopathy with TFESI offers theoretical cost advantages and reduced risk compared with surgery, robust class I clinical data supporting its efficacy are scarce, and there is no worldwide consensus on the use of TFESI. We are aware of only one other trial comparing the direct effect of surgery with that of epidural steroid injections in 100 patients with sciatica secondary to lumbar disc herniation. However, this trial was also a single-centre study and the route of administration was via a posterior interlaminar (lumbar puncture) injection, as opposed to TFESI. The trial showed that steroid injections avoided the need for surgery in 23 (46%) of 50 patients. In view of conflicting clinical evidence, we aimed to complete the first multicentre, randomised controlled trial comparing the clinical effectiveness of TFESI with that of surgical microdiscectomy for management of radicular pain secondary to herniated lumbar disc in patients with non-emergency presentation of sciatica with symptom duration of up to 12 months. We also aimed to assess cost-effectiveness and quality of life outcomes of both treatments.

### The management of sciatica by acupuncture: an expert consensus using the improved Delphi survey [^111intyj]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The purpose of this study is to establish a consensus based on the consensus of experts to determine the common clinical influencing factors and the best acupuncture parameters for acupuncture treatment of sciatica. The results showed that acupuncture therapy may have a satisfactory effect in improving sciatica. Nearly 90% of experts believe that the current acupuncture treatment can improve the pain and function of sciatica regardless of the severity of the disease that is to minimize the impact of sciatica on patients' life treatment. Although some terms specific to "traditional Chinese medicine" are included in the consensus items, the consensus result still has certain practicability and promotion significance.

According to the final consensus, acupuncture is recommended to improve the clinical symptoms for mild, moderate, and severe sciatica caused by the lumbar disc herniation. This consensus is similar to some previous research results. A single-center, parallel, randomized controlled trial involving 46 patients with sciatica pain for at least 12 weeks found that acupuncture was safer than sham acupuncture in treating chronic sciatica and had a curative effect in improving short-term pain. Two systematic reviews (one included 12 RCTs, 1842 patients; another included 11 RCTs, 932 patients) showed that acupuncture might be more effective in treating sciatica than drug therapy in relieving leg pain.

### National clinical guidelines for non-surgical treatment of patients with recent onset low back pain or lumbar radiculopathy [^112qiq8H]. European Spine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To summarise recommendations about 20 non-surgical interventions for recent onset (< 12 weeks) non-specific low back pain (LBP) and lumbar radiculopathy (LR) based on two guidelines from the Danish Health Authority.

Methods

Two multidisciplinary working groups formulated recommendations based on the GRADE approach.

Results

Sixteen recommendations were based on evidence, and four on consensus. Management of LBP and LR should include information about prognosis, warning signs, and advise to remain active. If treatment is needed, the guidelines suggest using patient education, different types of supervised exercise, and manual therapy. The guidelines recommend against acupuncture, routine use of imaging, targeted treatment, extraforaminal glucocorticoid injection, paracetamol, NSAIDs, and opioids.

Conclusion

Recommendations are based on low to moderate quality evidence or on consensus, but are well aligned with recommendations from international guidelines. The guideline working groups recommend that research efforts in relation to all aspects of management of LBP and LR be intensified.

### ACR appropriateness criteria on low back pain [^114Sn7hb]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute low back pain with or without radiculopathy is one of the most common health problems in the United States, with high annual costs of evaluation and treatment, not including lost productivity. Multiple reports show that uncomplicated acute low back pain or radiculopathy is a benign, self-limited condition that does not warrant any imaging studies. Guidelines for recognition of patients with more complicated status can be used to identify those who require further evaluation for suspicion of more serious problems and contribute to appropriate imaging utilization.

### Management of symptomatic lumbar disk herniation: an international perspective [^115E7GWi]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

The diversity among the current international practice patterns and the discrepancy between the eminence-based medicine and the evidence-based medicine in the treatment of lumbar disk herniation is presented. Minimally invasive techniques were expected to give the lowest postoperative low back pain, however, also to give the highest risk of recurrent disk herniation.

Study Design

A questionnaire survey.

Objective

To evaluate the current practice patterns of surgeons regarding both the surgical and nonsurgical management of lumbar disk herniation (LDH) worldwide and to compare this with the current literature.

Summary Of Background Data

Sciatica is a common diagnosis in the general population. Sciatica is most frequently caused by LDH. Multiple surgical techniques and treatment modalities are available to treat LDH, albeit some with small effect sizes or without compelling evidence.

Methods

A survey including questions on the application of physical examination, expectations regarding different surgical and nonsurgical techniques, factors influencing the outcome of surgery were distributed among members of AOSpine International and the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies.

Results

Eight hundred and seventeen surgeons from 89 countries completed the questionnaire. These surgeons perform a total of 62.477 discectomies yearly. Pain medication and steroid injections were expected to be the most effective nonsurgical treatments. The severity of pain and/ or disability and failure of conservative therapy were the most important indications for surgery. A period of 1 to 2 months of radiculopathy was regarded as a minimum for indicating surgery. Unilateral transflaval discectomy was the procedure of choice among the majority and was expected to be the most effective technique with the lowest complication risk. Surgeons performing more lumbar discectomies, with more clinical experience and those located in Asia, were more likely to offer minimally invasive surgical techniques.

Conclusion

This study shows that current international practice patterns for LDH surgery are diverse. There seems to be a discrepancy between preferred surgical techniques and the attitudes of surgeons worldwide and the evidence. Further research should focus on developing international guidelines to reduce practice variety and offer patients the optimal treatment for LDH.

### Stratified care versus usual care for management of patients presenting with sciatica in primary care (SCOPiC): a randomised controlled trial [^111ffwnt]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first trial to test a stratified care model in the primary care setting specifically for patients with a clinical diagnosis of sciatica. We did not find convincing evidence that the stratified care model tested in this trial (combining prognostic information with clinical criteria) led to faster resolution of sciatica symptoms or benefits for other patient outcomes, compared to usual care. In the stratified care arm, the median time to first resolution of sciatica symptoms was slightly shorter (by 2 weeks), but this difference was not significant. By 12 weeks, approximately 50% of participants in both arms had reported first resolution of symptoms. By the end of the follow-up period at 12 months, 74% of patients in the stratified care arm and 71% in the usual care arm had reported resolution of symptoms. From a health economics perspective, we found no evidence that the model of stratified care tested in this trial was a cost-effective use of health-care resources when compared with usual NHS care. The usual care arm marginally dominated stratified care. Similar findings were observed in scenarios incorporating tests and treatment data from hospital records, and the three sciatica groups (1, 2, and 3).

Secondary outcomes analyses showed that, on average, participants in both trial arms reported similar, good improvements. Subgroup analyses were exploratory as the trial was not powered for these analyses, and as such these results should be treated with caution. The significant result observed with stratified care for patients clinically diagnosed with spinal stenosis is based on a small number of patients and could simply be a chance finding. However, further investigation of this subgroup could be warranted.

The results of this trial, testing a sciatica-specific stratified care model combining prognostic factors and clinical indicators of referral to spinal specialists, are different to those showing the effectiveness of a prognostic stratified care model for patients with non-specific low back pain. At 12 months, the percentage change in disability in both arms of the SCOPiC trial, 54.9% for the stratified care arm and 51.3% for the usual care arm (based on mean RMDQ values at baseline and 12 months of follow-up), was considerably higher than that achieved in the STarT Back trial of stratified care for non-specific low back pain(43.9% for the stratified care arm and 34% for the control arm).

### The prognostic value of electrodiagnostic testing in patients with sciatica receiving physical therapy [^113u4ZJ7]. European Spine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the prognostic value of electrodiagnostic testing in patients with sciatica receiving physical therapy.

Methods

Electrodiagnostic testing was performed on 38 patients with sciatica participating in a randomized trial comparing different physical therapy interventions. Patients were grouped and analyzed according to the presence or absence of radiculopathy based on electrodiagnostic testing. Longitudinal data analysis was conducted using multilevel growth modeling with ten waves of data collected from baseline through the treatment and post-treatment periods up to 6 months. The primary outcome measure was changes in low back pain-related disability assessed using the Roland and Morris disability questionnaire (RMDQ).

Results

Patients with radiculopathy (n = 19) had statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in RMDQ scores at every post-treatment follow-up occasion regardless of treatment received. The final multilevel growth model revealed improvements in RMDQ scores in patients with radiculopathy at the 6-week (-8.1, 95% CI -12.6 to -2.6; P = 0.006) and 6-month (-4.1, 95% CI -7.4 to -0.7; P = 0.020) follow-up occasions compared to patients without radiculopathy. Treatment group was not a significant predictive factor at any follow-up occasion. An interaction between electrodiagnostic status and time revealed faster weekly improvements in RMDQ scores in patients with radiculopathy at the 6-week (-0.72, 95% CI -1.4 to -0.04; P = 0.040) through the 16-week (-0.30, 95% CI, -0.57 to -0.04; P = 0.028) follow-up occasions compared to patients without radiculopathy.

Conclusions

The presence of lumbosacral radiculopathy identified with electrodiagnostic testing is a favorable prognostic factor for recovery in low back pain-related disability regardless of physical therapy treatment received.

### Comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for implantable peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) in the management of chronic pain: from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^1147KJ5F]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

ASIPP PNS guidelines — impact of chronic peripheral neuropathic pain on health care resource utilization: Key Question 1 asks "What is the impact of chronic peripheral neuropathic pain or lumbar muscle degeneration on healthcare resource utilization?". Chronic pain is defined as "pain that extends beyond an expected timeframe of healing", and in 2011 chronic neuropathic pain was redefined as "pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system, including peripheral fibers and central neurons". In the United States, an estimated 20.9% of U.S. adults experienced chronic pain with 6.9% suffering high-impact chronic pain, as of 2021. Globally, neuropathic pain has been described as highly prevalent in 7% to 10% of the general population with 20% to 30% noting chronicity. Economic burden data show U.S. spending of $134.5 billion in 2016 for spinal pain, a 53.5% increase from 2013 when $87.6 billion was spent; costs for other musculoskeletal disorders increased 43.5%, from $183 billion in 2013 to $263 billion in 2016. In the United Kingdom, chronic pain was present in 51% of participants with an overall neuropathic pain prevalence of 9.2%. European burden data reported the highest prevalence in diabetic peripheral neuropathy (20% to 25%), followed by spinal nerve pain or radiculopathy (17% to 22%), with total cost varied €10,000 and 60% to 70% attributed to indirect costs; in the United States, indirect costs for neuropathic pain were estimated as high as U.S. $30,000 annually per patient.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® low back pain: 2021 update [^1152weWt]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the United States, acute low back pain, with or without radiculopathy, is the leading cause of years lived with disability and the third ranking cause of disability-adjusted life-years. Uncomplicated acute low back pain and/or radiculopathy is a benign, self-limited condition that does not warrant any imaging studies. Imaging is considered in those patients who have had up to 6 weeks of medical management and physical therapy that resulted in little or no improvement in their back pain. It is also considered for those patients presenting with red flags, raising suspicion for a serious underlying condition, such as cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, fracture, or infection. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Limaprost alfadex and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for sciatica due to lumbar spinal stenosis [^114ijwqW]. European Spine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Limaprost, a prostaglandin E1 analog, has vasodilatory properties and increases blood flow of the nerve root. However, it has not been clarified whether limaprost affects pain sensation associated with radiculopathy due to lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of oral limaprost with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for radiculopathy.

Methods

We performed a multicenter prospective randomized trial. Patients with LSS who had radicular-type neurologic intermittent claudication assessed based on a self-reported diagnostic support tool were randomized into three treatment groups. Limaprost, NSAIDs, or limaprost plus NSAIDs were administered orally for 6 weeks. Leg pain, low back pain (LBP) and the associated symptoms were assessed by a numerical rating scale (NRS) both at rest and on movement as well as the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) and Short Form (SF)-36.

Results

Sixty-one patients were enrolled in the study. Each treatment finally reduced radicular pain, and the improvement was prominent in a combination treatment. There were no significant differences in radicular pain among three groups at final follow-up. LBP was not influenced by limaprost, and a significant reduction of LBP and RDQ was confirmed in a combination treatment compared with limaprost. Physical function of the SF-36 subscales after a combination treatment showed a marked alleviation compared with NSAIDs.

Conclusions

These obtained findings suggest that the effects of limaprost seem to be limited to radicular pain, not for LBP. Overall, a combination treatment might be more effective in the management of radiculopathy induced by LSS than monotherapy with either agent.

### Clinical outcomes of 3T magnetic resonance imaging-guided lumbar and sacral foraminal injections [^114jMQ12]. Neuroradiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low back pain is a multifactorial disease, and different treatment options are continuously discussed in the medical community. The choice of the best therapeutic approach for a patient heavily relies on the accurate identification of etiologic factors and symptoms. This applies in particular to the distinction between localized low back pain (lumbago) versus radicular pain. The latter typically follows the supply territory of a distinct nerve into the groin, the buttocks, or a lower limb. In the case of L4 to S3 nerve roots, the term sciatica is used for related symptoms of pain or paresthesia (numbness, burning, tingling sensation). Radicular pain is believed to be caused by nerve inflammation, sometimes induced by direct mechanical nerve compression, the most common cause being a bulging lumbar disc and/or spondylolisthesis. Lower limb radiculopathy is a considerable worldwide health problem, without gender predominance. It has a lifetime incidence of 10 to 40% that affects patients' quality of life, causes economic losses, and increases healthcare costs.

Lower back pain treatment follows a stepwise approach. The first step is to determine whether a motor deficit is present. Should this be the case, prompt surgical evaluation is indicated to precisely define its extent. In the absence of significant motor deficit, the second step usually involves patient education and adapted oral medication, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and muscle relaxants. Other complementary second-line treatments include massages, physiotherapy, and acupuncture. Unlike lumbago care, the third step for radicular pain, if it lasts longer than 6–8 weeks, consists of lumbar or sacral nerve root infiltrations. These infiltrations provide pain relief and may also have a diagnostic purpose — the confirmation of a single affected nerve root — if surgery is required for the patient during the course of the disease. For inoperable patients, repeated infiltrations might even represent a final treatment option.

### Patients' own accounts of sciatica: a qualitative study [^111kAwCN]. Spine (2011). Low credibility.

STUDY DESIGN.: Longitudinal qualitative interview study, nested within a back pain cohort study. OBJECTIVE.: Enhance the understanding of patients' own perspectives on living with sciatica to inform improvements in care and treatment outcomes. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Reports of patients' own accounts of sciatica and its impact on daily life are still scarce. Research on back pain has shown that it is important to understand how people live with pain and how they perceive interactions with health care professionals and interpret interventions. These types of insights help to improve treatments and their acceptability to patients. METHODS.: In-depth qualitative interviews with 37 people at baseline and 6 and 12 months' follow-up. The interviews covered topics that were derived from the Illness Perceptions Questionnaire and allowed open-ended talk about people's experiences of pain. All interviews were tape-recorded, fully transcribed, and thematically analyzed. RESULTS.: People needed to make sense of sciatica through identifying a cause and having it clinically diagnosed. The impact of sciatic pain was seen to be constant, intense, and all-encompassing. Appreciation of this by clinicians was considered important, as well as the provision of clear information about treatment and prognosis. Expectations about treatment options varied between patients, and people balanced pain relief with adverse effects. CONCLUSION.: Our study highlights patients' own accounts of the distinctiveness, impact, and intrusiveness of their sciatic symptoms. Our findings emphasize the importance of leg pain in identifying a subgroup of back-pain patients more likely to have severe symptoms, be at risk of poor outcome, and who should be considered a priority for early diagnosis and management. Future management of sciatica needs to include listening to patients' stories, offering a credible physical assessment, explanation, and diagnosis of the condition. Explaining the limits to treatment is seen as positively contributing to the partnership between patients and clinicians.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^114VnjGL]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In general, there is evidence that early surgery in patients with sciatica provides for a better short-term relief of leg pain as compared to prolonged conservative care, but the evidence is low quality because of the fact that only one trial investigated this properly. No significant differences were found between surgery and usual conservative care in any of the clinical outcomes after 1 and 2 years, but the evidence is of very low quality. The scarcity of studies as well as the limited quality of the studies does not support the choice for any timing in our current guidelines.

Future studies should evaluate who benefits more from surgery and who from conservative care. Also economic evaluations should analyse the economical gain of the potential faster recovery against increased cost and complication rate of surgery.

### The efficacy of therapeutic selective nerve block in treating lumbar radiculopathy and avoiding surgery [^1133T7yo]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Selective nerve root block (SNRB) is a procedure that can be used as a diagnostic or a therapeutic method. SNRB can be used in multiple sites, including cervical and lumbar. Our study aims to investigate the clinical effectiveness of the use of fluoroscopically guided therapeutic selective nerve root block as a non-surgical symptom management of lumbar radiculopathy.

Patients and Methods

This is a prospective study of therapeutic nerve root block in 76 patients with low back pain and/or sciatica at Jordan University Hospital. Data was collected by independent clinical interviewers, and visual analogue score (VAS) was used to measure pain severity.

Results

A total of 76 patients, 25 (32.8%) males and 51 (67.2%) females, underwent SNRB. 69 (90.7%) patients improved immediately after the procedure. Out of the total, 22 (28.9%) patients showed a long-term relief of symptoms and did not experience any recurrence during the three months of follow-up, while 47 (61.8%) experienced a recurrence of pain. In patients experiencing recurrence of symptoms, 35 needed surgery.

Conclusion

Therapeutic SNRB is an important procedure in the pain management of patients with lumbar radiculopathy caused by lumbar disc prolapse and foraminal stenosis. Our study showed that avoidance of surgery was achieved in up to 54% of patients; pain relief for at least 6 months was achieved in up to 29% of patients after a single SNRB. This makes it a very good second line of management after conservative treatment and a possible method to delay, and sometimes cease, the need for surgery.

### Fasinumab (REGN475), an antinerve growth factor monoclonal antibody, for the treatment of acute sciatic pain: results of a proof-of-concept study [^111WtT8B]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Several reasons can be proposed for the lack of efficacy with fasinumab and most other biologic drugs in sciatic pain. This condition may represent mixed pain states consisting of pathways different from those involved in other painful musculoskeletal conditions. Nevertheless, there was no prior reason to suggest that fasinumab would not work on either nociceptive or neuropathic pain, as anti-NGF agents have demonstrated efficacy for osteoarthritis, primarily a nociceptive pain condition, and limited efficacy for at least some neuropathic pain conditions: eg, painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Additionally, it is possible that these drugs do not effectively reach the site of action mediating the sciatic pain. As another explanation that may have accounted for the lack of an effect in the earlier studies was the timing of the assessments, efficacy in the current study was assessed at week 4 using both time-integrated (AUC) and landmark analyses. This time point was chosen both because of the self-limiting nature of many cases of sciatica and because it was hypothesized that evaluation at an early time point might enhance the ability to demonstrate treatment benefit. A previous clinical trial of infliximab that showed no difference between active and placebo treatment used a 12-week primary end point. However, the results of the current study do not support the earlier assessment hypothesis.

The diagnostic criteria for this study relied on the clinical signs and symptoms associated with the syndrome of sciatic pain that are commonly used by general practitioners to diagnose this condition. The diagnosis did not require confirmation of disc herniation based upon imaging (magnetic resonance or computerized tomography), as radiological confirmation is rarely conducted in the general practice setting unless infection or neoplasm is suspected. Thus, based upon this diagnostic approach, it is possible that at least some of these patients did not have radiculopathy due to disc herniation but had low back pain with leg radiation.

Taken together, the available data suggest that sciatica is a complex and variable disorder, and that the pathogenesis of acute sciatic pain is not yet sufficiently understood for effective targeted treatment.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^112X8knx]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — introduction and scope state that the guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to address key clinical questions surrounding the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy and was developed as an educational tool to assist practitioners who treat these patients. The patient population encompasses adults (18 years or older) with a chief complaint of leg pain, numbness or weakness in a dermatomal or myotomal distribution as a result of a primary lumbar disc herniation. The document clarifies that it does not represent a "standard of care", is not a fixed treatment protocol, should not be seen as prescribing the type, frequency or duration of intervention, and should not be used as the sole reason for denial of treatment and services.

### Management of tarlov cysts: an uncommon but potentially serious spinal column disease-review of the literature and experience with over 1, 000 referrals [^113XUrPM]. Neuroradiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Although Tarlov cysts have been reported in some cases to be associated with isolated lower limb radiculopathy and paresthesias, they are also more commonly associated with pelvic, perineurial, urogenital pain, and neurological conditions. The broader impact of Tarlov cysts was detailed more extensively in clinical assessments of six cohorts with MRI-identified sacral Tarlov cysts involving different referral patient groups. The assessments and symptom profiles of patients with Tarlov cysts in these studies are detailed in Table 2.

Table 2
Symptoms associated with Tarlov cysts

EDX electrodiagnostic studies, IENFD intraepidermal nerve fiber density

Langdown et al.'s early report of 54 Australian patients (38 women, 16 men) with MRI-identified sacral Tarlov cysts were referred for a spinal surgeon specialist opinion for low back pain, sciatica, or spinal stenosis. Their objective was to clarify the relationship of Tarlov cysts in the origin of symptoms of lumbosacral spinal canal stenosis focusing only on typical symptoms of low back pain, nerve root pain, leg pain, and neurological loss. Based on these restricted symptoms, the authors concluded that only 30% of patients had symptomatic Tarlov cysts that could be considered contributory, or the main cause of symptoms.

When comorbid spinal conditions are present along with Tarlov cysts, it can be difficult to attribute causality of symptoms. Complicating treatment decisions are observations that spinal degenerative changes themselves are known to increase with age and degenerative changes have commonly been reported in various imaging investigations in asymptomatic subjects.

This early study by Langdown et al. did not investigate the occurrence of other symptoms in patients with Tarlov cysts. A focus of MRI mainly on the lumbar region and the usual degenerative spinal pathologies and absence of gynecological or urological investigations for symptoms related to sacral cysts have been cited as major reasons why the clinical impacts of sacral Tarlov cysts are often overlooked.

Five more recent studies investigating symptoms of patients with Tarlov cysts have involved either more extensive evaluations, different referral settings, or study groups involving mainly women. Additional investigations in these studies have included bladder, urinary, and sexual functions as Tarlov cysts located in the sacral regions can adversely impact nerves for these functions (Table 2). Enquiry into these symptoms is rare as many spine surgeons focus on the disc space and are uncomfortable discussing genital pain and sexual dysfunction.

### Retro-trochanteric sciatica-like pain: current concept [^113mVv47]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this manuscript is to review the current knowledge in terms of retro-trochanteric pain syndrome, make recommendations for diagnosis and differential diagnosis and offer suggestions for treatment options. The terminology in the literature is confusing and these symptoms can be referred to as 'greater trochanteric pain syndrome', 'trochanteric bursitis' and 'trochanteritis', among other denominations. The authors focus on a special type of sciatica, i.e. retro-trochanteric pain radiating down to the lower extremity. The impact of different radiographic assessments is discussed. The authors recommend excluding pathology in the spine and pelvic area before following their suggested treatment algorithm for sciatica-like retro-trochanteric pain. Level of evidence II.

### Efficacy of epidural injections in managing chronic spinal pain: a best evidence synthesis [^111pMTy3]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Epidural injections have been used since 1901 in managing low back pain and sciatica. Spinal pain, disability, health, and economic impact continue to increase, despite numerous modalities of interventions available in managing chronic spinal pain. Thus far, systematic reviews performed to assess the efficacy of epidural injections in managing chronic spinal pain have yielded conflicting results.

Objective

To evaluate and update the clinical utility of the efficacy of epidural injections in managing chronic spinal pain.

Study Design

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials of epidural injections in managing chronic spinal pain.

Methods

In this systematic review, randomized trials with a placebo control or an active-control design were included. The outcome measures were pain relief and functional status improvement. The quality of each individual article was assessed by Cochrane review criteria, as well as the Interventional Pain Management Techniques-Quality Appraisal of Reliability and Risk of Bias Assessment (IPM-QRB). Best evidence synthesis was conducted based on the qualitative level of evidence (Level I to V). Data sources included relevant literature identified through searches of PubMed for a period starting in 1966 through August 2015; Cochrane reviews; and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles.

Results

A total of 52 trials met inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis was not feasible. The evidence in managing lumbar disc herniation or radiculitis is Level II for long-term improvement either with caudal, interlaminar, or transforaminal epidural injections with no significant difference among the approaches. The evidence is Level II for long-term management of cervical disc herniation with interlaminar epidural injections. The evidence is Level II to III in managing thoracic disc herniation with an interlaminar approach. The evidence is Level II for caudal and lumbar interlaminar epidural injections with Level III evidence for lumbar transforaminal epidural injections for lumbar spinal stenosis. The evidence is Level III for cervical spinal stenosis management with an interlaminar approach. The evidence is Level II for axial or discogenic pain without facet arthropathy or disc herniation treated with caudal or lumbar interlaminar injections in the lumbar region; whereas it is Level III in the cervical region treated with cervical interlaminar epidural injections. The evidence for post lumbar surgery syndrome is Level II with caudal epidural injections and for post cervical surgery syndrome it is Level III with cervical interlaminar epidural injections.

Limitations

Even though this is a large systematic review with inclusion of a large number of randomized controlled trials, the paucity of high quality randomized trials literature continues to confound the evidence.

Conclusion

This systematic review, with an assessment of the quality of manuscripts and outcome parameters, shows the efficacy of epidural injections in managing a multitude of chronic spinal conditions.

### Costs and cost-effectiveness of epidural steroids for acute lumbosacral radicular syndrome in general practice: an economic evaluation alongside a pragmatic randomized control trial [^112jAPa4]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Design

A pragmatic, randomized, controlled, single-blinded trial in Dutch general practice.

Objective

Assessing the costs and cost-effectiveness of adding segmental epidural steroid injections to care as usual in radiculopathy in general practice.

Summary Of Background Data

Lumbosacral radicular syndrome (radiculopathy) is a benign, generally self-limiting but painful condition caused by a herniated lumbar intervertebral disc, which results in an inflammatory process around the nerve root. Segmental epidural steroid injections could lessen pain. Low back pain and sciatica form a large financial burden on national health care systems. Improving pain treatment could lower costs to society by diminishing loss of productivity.

Methods

Patients with acute radiculopathy were included by general practitioners. All patients received usual care. Patients in the intervention group received one segmental epidural steroid injection containing 80 mg of triamcinolone as well. Follow-up was performed using postal questionnaires at 2, 4, 6, 13, 26, and 52 weeks. Main outcomes were pain, disability and costs. Economic evaluation was performed from a societal perspective with a time horizon of 1 year.

Results

Sixty-three patients were included in the analysis. Mean total costs were €4414 or $5985 in the intervention group and €5121 or $6943 in the control group. This difference was mostly due to loss of productivity. The point estimate for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was -€730 or -$990 (1-point diminishment on the numerical rating scale back pain score in 1 patient in the course of 1 yr would save €730 or $990). Bootstrapping showed a 95% confidence interval of -€4476 to €951 or -$6068 to $1289. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showed that without additional investment the probability that epidural steroids are cost-effective is more than 80%.

Conclusion

The effect on pain and disability of epidural steroids in lumbosacral radicular syndrome is small but significant, and at lower costs with no reported complications or adverse effects. Segmental epidural steroid injections could be considered by policy makers as an additional treatment option.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^114JV7GR]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

Here, we describe the outcome of a working group commissioned by the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group (NeuPSIG) of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) and tasked with the following objectives:
(1) To revise the use of terminology for classifying spine-related leg pain (spine-related leg pain is an umbrella term that includes nerve-related [eg, radicular pain and painful radiculopathy] as well as somatic referred pain. As such, this term is broader than "sciatica", which linguistically refers to neural involvement. The term "spine-related leg pain" is supported by the working group and was confirmed in the NeuPSIG membership consultation. For further details, see 3.3),
(2) To propose a way forward on the identification of neuropathic pain in the context of spine-related leg pain.

### A history of lumbar disc herniation from hippocrates to the 1990s [^116pjEm4]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

In ancient times, a supernatural understanding of the syndrome of lumbar radiculopathy often involved demonic forces vexing the individual with often crippling pain. The ancient Greeks and Egyptians began to take a more naturalistic view and, critically, suspected a relationship between lumbar spinal pathology and leg symptoms. Relatively little then changed for those with sciatica until the classic works by Cotugno and Kocher arrived in the late 18th century. Early lumbar canal explorations were performed in the late 1800s and early 1900s by MacEwen, Horsley, Krause, Taylor, Dandy, and Cushing, among others. In these cases, when compressive pathologies were found and removed, the lesions typically were (mis-)identified as enchondromas or osteochondritis dissecans. To better understand the history, learn more about the first treatments of lumbar disc herniation, and evaluate the impact of the early influences on modern spine practice, searches of PubMed and Embase were performed using the search terms discectomy, medical history, lumbar spine surgery, herniated disc, herniated nucleus pulposus, sciatica, and lumbar radiculopathy. Additional sources were identified from the reference lists of the reviewed papers. Many older and ancient sources including De Ischiade Nervosa are available in English translations and were used. When full texts were not available, English abstracts were used. The first true, intentional discectomy surgery was performed by Mixter and Barr in 1932. Early on, a transdural approach was favored. In 1938, Love described the intralaminar, extradural approach. His technique, although modified with improved lighting, magnification, and retractors, remains a staple approach to disc herniations today. Other modalities such as chymopapain have been investigated. Some remain a part of the therapeutic armamentarium, whereas others have disappeared. By the 1970s, CT scanning after myelography markedly improved the clinical evaluation of patients with lumbar disc herniation. In this era, use of discectomy surgery increased rapidly. Even patients with very early symptoms were offered surgery. Later work, especially by Weber and Hakelius, showed that many patients with lumbar disc herniation would improve without surgical intervention. In the ensuing decades, the debate over operative indications and timing continued, reaching another pivotal moment with the 2006 publication of the initial results of Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial.

### Inversion therapy in patients with pure single level lumbar discogenic disease: a pilot randomized trial [^1114aJxe]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Backache and sciatica due to protuberant disc disease is a major cause of lost working days and health expenditure. Surgery is a well-established option in the management flowchart. There is no strong evidence proving that traction for sciatica is effective. We report a pilot prospective randomized controlled trial comparing inversion traction and physiotherapy with standard physiotherapy alone in patients awaiting lumbar disc surgery. This study sought to study the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial on the effect of inversion therapy in patients with single level lumbar discogenic disease, who had been listed for surgery.

Methods

This was a single centre prospective randomized controlled trial undertaken at the Regional Neurosciences Centre, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK. It was a prospective randomized controlled trial where patients awaiting surgery for pure lumbar discogenic disease within the ambit of the prestated inclusion/exclusion criteria were allocated to either physiotherapy or physiotherapy and intermittent traction with an inversion device. Post-treatment assessment made by blinded observers at 6 weeks for various outcome measures included the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) Score, Short Form 36 (SF 36), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Visual Analogue Pain Score (VAS), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance and the need for surgery. Avoidance of surgery was considered a treatment success.

Results

Twenty-six patients were enrolled and 24 were randomized [13 to inversion + physiotherapy and 11 to physiotherapy alone (control)]. Surgery was avoided in 10 patients (76.9%) in the inversion group, whereas it was averted in only two patients (22.2%) in the control group. Cancellation of the proposed operation was a clinical decision based on the same criteria by which the patient was listed for surgery initially. There were no significant differences in the RMDQ, SF 36, ODI, VAS or MRI results between the two groups.

Conclusion

Intermittent traction with an inversion device resulted in a significant reduction in the need for surgery. A larger multicentre prospective randomized controlled trial is justified in patients with sciatica due to single level lumbar disc protrusions.

Implications For Rehabilitation

- Resolution of impairment and diasability due to radiculopathy is the aim of any intervention.• Avoidance of surgery meant satisfactory resolution of impairment and disability due to radiculopathy. This happened more often in the inversion group to the extent of reaching statistical significance.• The 12-point improvement in disability by the Oswestry Disability Index in the inversion group suggests a role for this intervention in disability reduction.• Inversion may form part of the conservative rehabilitation of patients with single level unilateral lumbar disc protrusion alongside other forms of physiotherapy.• There is a potential secondary impact in the reduction of rehabilitation following surgery.

### The efficacy of oral steroids in the treatment of acute sciatica… [^116uqc4s]. ClinicalTrials (2006). Low credibility.

The Efficacy of Oral Steroids in the Treatment of Acute SciaticaClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview. Sciatica is a common diagnosis in primary care, occurring in approximately one percent of all patients with acute low back pain. Traditional treatment generally involves pain control, activity as tolerated, and time. The general consensus is that fifty percent of patients with sciatica recover within six weeks, and that ninety percent are better in twelve weeks. Those patients with intractable pain or progressive neurologic symptoms usually receive epidural steroid injections and, if necessary, decompressive laminectomy or discectomy.

We hypothesize that the use of oral steroids to treat acute sciatica will speed patients' recovery as measured by: changes in physical findings, rates of return to work and activities of daily living, pain and disability assessment scores, and decreases in the use of narcotic and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and in the need for epidural injection or surgical intervention. Randomization and Blinding Once the diagnosis of acute sciatica had been confirmed, subjects were randomized to receive either a nine day tapering course of prednisone or placebo capsules. The principle investigator and research nurse were blinded as to group assignment. All subjects received current standard therapy for sciatica, including: a NSAID, narcotics if needed, activity as tolerated, and a referral for physical therapy.

All patients received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication and narcotic medication if needed for pain control. Patients randomized to the study group received tapering course of prednisone: 60 mg for three days, 40 mg for three days, and 20 mg for three days. Patients randomized to the control group received capsules identical in appearance to the prednisone capsules but containing an inert filler substance. Patients were questioned at each visit to determine whether they were taking their study medication and whether they were still taking non-steroidal or narcotic medication.
