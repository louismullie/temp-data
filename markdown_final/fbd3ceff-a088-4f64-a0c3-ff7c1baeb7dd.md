## Question

low back pain work up

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the workup of low back pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to structure the diagnostic triage and duration staging. Then, I should verify the red flag screening strategy and its diagnostic accuracy. Next, I will examine imaging indications and modality selection, followed by advanced testing. After that, I should review psychosocial risk stratification and first-line conservative management. Finally, I will consider reassessment, escalation, documentation, and key controversies so the flow remains evidence-based and pragmatic.

> Let me first confirm the initial clinical triage approach and duration definitions, because this frames every downstream decision; I should categorize low back pain into nonspecific mechanical pain, pain with radiculopathy or stenosis, and pain suggesting specific serious pathology while also staging acute, subacute, and chronic durations, as this is consistent with ACP/APS and NICE guidance and influences imaging timing and referral thresholds [^115G2Ryv] [^112BNubN].

> Wait, let me verify the red flag set and how to apply it; I need to screen for fracture, malignancy, infection, and cauda equina syndrome using features like trauma, older age, chronic corticosteroid use, known cancer, weight loss, fever, IV drug use, immunosuppression, saddle anesthesia, new bowel or bladder dysfunction, and progressive weakness, while remembering that individual red flags often have limited accuracy and that combinations markedly increase post-test probabilities for fracture and that history of malignancy is the strongest single red flag for spinal cancer [^113o9wQM] [^117FoEKd] [^113sgg8c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about red flags being definitive; I should double-check that the absence of red flags does not absolutely exclude serious pathology, as case literature reminds me of vertebral infection or other serious causes presenting subtly, and systematic reviews emphasize that many guideline-endorsed red flags lack robust accuracy data, so clinical judgment and reassessment remain essential [^116Pyr2R] [^114cbAFE] [^114ksr6d].

> Next, I will examine imaging decisions; for acute nonspecific low back pain without red flags, I should avoid routine imaging because it rarely changes management and may cause harm, whereas I need immediate MRI or CT when cauda equina is suspected, severe or progressive neurologic deficits are present, high-energy trauma suggests fracture, or infection or malignancy is suspected, aligning with ACR, ACP/APS, NICE, and Choosing Wisely recommendations [^1152weWt] [^116BxmRG] [^114hvKiN] [^1163LDmg] [^112BNubN].

> I need to ensure the imaging modality matches the clinical question; MRI without contrast is preferred for neurologic deficits and radiculopathy, contrast-enhanced MRI for suspected infection or malignancy, plain radiographs first for suspected fracture with CT if radiographs are equivocal, and emergent MRI for suspected cauda equina syndrome, recognizing these modality selections come from ACR appropriateness criteria and are widely adopted in contemporary pathways [^113sgg8c] [^114UwfEa] [^116BxmRG].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought any pain persisting beyond six weeks mandates MRI; let me reconsider and verify the threshold; imaging for subacute or chronic symptoms is indicated after about six weeks of optimal conservative care when symptoms persist or progress and the patient is a candidate for surgery or intervention, or if red flags emerge at any point, which clarifies that persistence alone without potential for intervention may not justify imaging [^1152weWt] [^112xTTUU].

> I will now examine advanced diagnostic evaluation if the initial workup is unrevealing but suspicion remains; I should confirm the role of ESR and CRP and a complete blood count when infection or inflammatory etiologies are suspected, consider targeted labs like PSA in older men with concerning features, and be cautious with specialized procedures since provocative discography is not recommended for diagnosing discogenic pain and routine diagnostic blocks have insufficient evidence for widespread use outside specialist contexts [^114g1zui] [^111ASBLM].

> Next, I should review psychosocial risk stratification because yellow flags drive chronicity and disability; I need to assess depression, anxiety, fear-avoidance, catastrophizing, substance use risk, and work factors, and I should consider validated tools like the STarT Back Screening Tool and functional indices to guide early integrated psychological and physical therapy interventions for higher-risk patients [^116qgeXL] [^115k3pmU] [^112osGiQ].

> Let me think about first-line conservative management and verify it aligns with guidelines; I should provide education and reassurance, promote activity and graded exercise including core strengthening, consider yoga, tai chi, motor control exercises, and spinal manipulation in selected acute cases, prioritize nonpharmacologic approaches for most, and reserve medications like NSAIDs as adjuncts, while considering duloxetine in chronic cases when appropriate and integrating a biopsychosocial plan [^112osGiQ] [^112BNubN] [^116MmT2N].

> I should confirm the duration of conservative care and follow-up cadence; generally, a minimum of about six weeks of guideline-concordant management without red flags is reasonable before reconsidering imaging, with reassessment every two to four weeks to monitor pain, function, adherence, and emergence of new red flags, ensuring timely escalation only when indicated [^112xTTUU] [^1152weWt].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of patient expectations and shared decision-making because imaging overuse often stems from reassurance needs; I need to explain that early imaging does not improve outcomes in uncomplicated cases, can uncover incidental findings that mislead management, and that structured education with a clear recovery plan maintains satisfaction without unnecessary tests, which I should document along with the red flag assessment and rationale [^112TNJNZ] [^114hvKiN] [^112sULD9].

> But wait, what about evidence gaps and controversies; I should acknowledge that many red flags lack strong diagnostic accuracy, that imaging utilization remains high despite guidance, and that special populations like older adults, those on corticosteroids, or immunocompromised patients warrant a lower threshold for imaging, reinforcing the need for nuanced, context-aware application of guidelines [^113o9wQM] [^111o9SBv] [^114UwfEa].

> I should double-check the prognosis messaging; although most acute episodes improve over weeks, a sizable subset has persistent pain at three to twelve months, which means early identification of psychosocial risks and sustained active management are crucial to reduce transition to chronicity and disability [^115NutWU] [^111XafBa].

> Let me first confirm the overall decision flow to ensure coherence; start with focused history and examination to categorize the pain and stage duration, screen for red flags judiciously and respond urgently when present, defer imaging in uncomplicated acute cases while initiating active conservative care, reassess systematically, image and refer when symptoms persist despite optimal management or new red flags arise, and document the reasoning and shared decisions throughout so that each step is justified by guideline-based evidence [^114v4FW4] [^1152weWt] [^1132T4Ju].

---

The low back pain workup begins with a **focused history and physical exam** [^114v4FW4] to identify **red flags** (malignancy, infection, fracture, cauda equina) [^112BNubN] and neurologic deficits. Routine imaging is **not indicated** for nonspecific low back pain [^1132T4Ju]; obtain MRI for red flags, severe or progressive neurologic deficits [^112xTTUU], or persistent symptoms after 6 weeks of conservative care [^1151j7Un]. Use X-ray or CT only when **fracture is suspected** [^113sgg8c] or **MRI is contraindicated**. Reserve laboratory testing for suspected **infection, malignancy, or inflammatory disease** [^116MmT2N]. Most cases are managed **conservatively** with reassurance, activity, and nonpharmacologic therapies [^112osGiQ]; refer to specialists for persistent or severe cases [^112xTTUU].

---

## Clinical history and physical examination

A **focused history and physical examination are essential** [^115G2Ryv] to categorize patients into the following broad groups:

- **Nonspecific low back pain**: Most common, no identifiable specific cause [^112zscUj] [^115NutWU].

- **Radiculopathy or spinal stenosis**: Nerve root involvement or spinal canal narrowing [^116MmT2N] [^112zscUj].

- **Specific spinal causes**: Malignancy, infection, fracture, or inflammatory disease [^113o9wQM] [^112BNubN].

---

### Red flags indicating serious underlying conditions

Red flags are **critical** for identifying patients with potentially serious underlying conditions that require immediate attention [^117VrR4S]:

| **Condition** | **Red flags** |
|-|-|
| Malignancy | - History of cancer [^113o9wQM] <br/> - Unexplained weight loss <br/> - Age > 50 years <br/> - Failure to improve after 4–6 weeks |
| Infection | - Fever <br/> - Recent infection <br/> - Immunosuppression [^112BNubN] <br/> - IV drug use |
| Fracture | - Significant trauma <br/> - Osteoporosis <br/> - Prolonged corticosteroid use [^113o9wQM] <br/> - Age > 65 years [^112BNubN] |
| Cauda equina syndrome | - Saddle anesthesia <br/> - Bowel/bladder dysfunction [^116BxmRG] <br/> - Severe or progressive neurological deficits [^112BNubN] |

---

### Physical examination components

Inspection assesses posture, gait, and deformities, while palpation evaluates tenderness and muscle spasm. Range of motion is tested in flexion, extension, lateral bending, and rotation [^114v4FW4]. The **neurologic examination** includes motor strength, sensory testing, reflexes, and the straight-leg raise test [^116MmT2N].

---

## Diagnostic imaging

Imaging is **not routinely recommended** for nonspecific low back pain without red flags or neurologic deficits [^112TNJNZ] and should be **reserved for specific clinical indications**:

| **Imaging modality** | **Indications** |
|-|-|
| MRI | - Suspected malignancy <br/> - Infection [^114UwfEa] <br/> - Cauda equina syndrome [^116BxmRG] <br/> - Severe or progressive neurological deficits [^112xTTUU] <br/> - Persistent symptoms after 6 weeks of conservative treatment [^1151j7Un] |
| X-ray | - Suspected fracture [^113sgg8c] <br/> - Significant trauma <br/> - Osteoporosis <br/> - Chronic corticosteroid use [^113o9wQM] |
| CT scan | - Suspected fracture [^113sgg8c] <br/> - MRI contraindicated |

---

## Laboratory tests

Laboratory tests are **not routinely indicated** for nonspecific low back pain and should be considered only when specific conditions are suspected [^112BNubN]:

- **Infection**: CBC, ESR, CRP, blood cultures.

- **Malignancy**: CBC, ESR, CRP, specific tumor markers.

- **Inflammatory disease**: HLA-B27, rheumatoid factor, ANA.

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause and symptom severity** [^116MmT2N]:

- **Nonspecific low back pain**: Conservative management, reassurance, activity modification, physical therapy, analgesics [^112osGiQ].

- **Radiculopathy or spinal stenosis**: Conservative management initially; consider epidural steroid injections or surgery if symptoms persist.

- **Specific spinal causes**: Immediate referral to specialists, surgical intervention, or specific medical treatment [^112zscUj].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is **essential** to monitor progress, assess treatment response, and identify any emerging red flags or complications [^112xTTUU]. Persistent or worsening symptoms despite conservative management warrant further evaluation and possible specialist referral [^112BNubN].

---

The low back pain workup emphasizes a **focused history and physical examination** [^114v4FW4] to identify red flags and neurologic deficits. Imaging and laboratory testing are reserved for specific indications, and most cases are managed conservatively [^112osGiQ].

### Evaluation of guideline-endorsed red flags to screen for fracture in patients presenting with low back pain [^117FoEKd]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

- **Objectives**: (1) Describe the evolution of guideline-endorsed red flags for fracture in patients presenting with low back pain; (2) evaluate agreement between guidelines; and (3) evaluate the extent to which recommendations are accompanied by information on the diagnostic accuracy of endorsed red flags.

- **Design**: Systematic review.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE and PubMed, PEDro, CINAHL, and EMBASE electronic databases. We also searched in guideline databases, including the National Guideline Clearinghouse and Canadian Medical Association Infobase.

- **Eligibility criteria for selecting studies**: Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines.

- **Data extraction**: Two review authors independently extracted the following data: health professional association or society producing guideline, year of publication, the precise wording of endorsed red flag for vertebral fracture, recommendations for diagnostic workup if fracture is suspected, if the guidelines substantiate the recommendation with citation to a primary diagnostic study or diagnostic review, if the guideline provides any diagnostic accuracy data.

- **Results**: Seventy-eight guidelines from 28 countries were included. A total of 12 discrete red flags were reported. The most commonly recommended red flags were older age, use of steroids, trauma, and osteoporosis. Regarding the evolution of red flags, older age, trauma, and osteoporosis were the first red flags endorsed (in 1994), and previous fracture was the last red flag endorsed (in 2003). Agreement between guidelines in endorsing red flags was only fair; kappa = 0.32. Only 9 of the 78 guidelines substantiated their recommendations with citations.

### Pain and the brain: Lower back pain [^117ULrRc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic lower back pain is a common and frequently disabling problem, but an organic cause cannot always be identified. Pain often co-occurs with mood and anxiety disorders; however, when patients present with somatic symptoms in the primary care setting, clinicians often overlook mood and anxiety symptoms. Because appropriate treatment includes both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies, a team approach that involves both mental health and primary care professionals is warranted to alleviate the patient's pain, manage psychiatric comorbidities, and improve the patient's functioning and quality of life. Additionally, when prescribing pain medication, clinicians should monitor patients for substance misuse.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for low back pain, specifically with respect to history and physical examination, the ACP/APS 2007 guidelines recommend eliciting a focused medical history and performing a physical examination to categorize patients with low back pain into one of the following broad categories:

- **Nonspecific low back pain**: This category includes pain not attributed to any specific pathology.

- **Back pain potentially associated with radiculopathy or spinal stenosis**: This includes cases where nerve root compression may be suspected.

- **Back pain potentially associated with another specific spinal cause**: Includes conditions such as fractures, tumors, or infections that may lead to back pain.

### Red flags to screen for malignancy and fracture in patients with low back pain: Systematic review [^114DVPnJ]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Of the four red flags endorsed in the American College of Physicians guideline, data was found only on older age, trauma, and corticosteroid use, but not on history of osteoporosis. In general, the presence of these red flags increased the likelihood of fracture by up to 15%. The exception was the red flag "prolonged corticosteroid use", which, when present, suggested a post-test probability of 33% (95% confidence interval 10% to 67%) when positive. By contrast, the American College of Physicians guideline uses the red flag "corticosteroid use", as studied by Deyo and Diehl, which, when present, results in a post-test probability of 4% (0% to 44%).

- **Figure 3 - Red flags not endorsed**: In general, when present, these produce trivial increases in probability of fracture; few produced a precise estimate beyond the pre-test prevalence. Exceptions are contusion or abrasion reported by Patrick and colleagues (62%, 95% confidence interval 49% to 74% post-test probability). The combination of red flags (any four of leg or buttock pain, female, older age, BMI 70, severe trauma, prolonged use of corticosteroids) reported by Henschke and colleagues had a 90% post-test probability (34% to 99%). Trauma with neurological signs reported by Gibson and Zoltie resulted in a 43% post-test probability (11% to 82%).

### Do not routinely offer imaging for uncomplicated low back pain [^11581kLH]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

Clinicians often report that they order imaging when patients specifically request it. Systematic reviews of surveys and interviews suggest that about half of the patients expect imaging from their health provider because they believe it can help rule out a sinister cause for the pain. Some patients also believe that imaging can identify the cause better than the clinician's physical exam and facilitate a more tailored approach to treatment.

There is still considerable uncertainty as to what alternatives to imaging would convey the diagnosis of non-specific low back pain satisfactorily from the patient's perspective. Future research should focus on this area to develop strategies for explaining low back pain to patients.

### Recurrence of an episode of low back pain: An inception cohort study in emergency departments [^1117Ndcj]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to (1) determine the 1-year estimate of recurrence of low back pain (LBP) in a cohort of people presenting to emergency departments who have recently recovered from an episode of acute LBP in a middle-income country, (2) estimate a recurrence of LBP stratified by the STarT Back Screening Tool (SBST), and (3) determine prognostic factors for the recurrence of LBP.

A prospective inception cohort study design was used. We included 238 patients who presented to emergency departments with recent-onset nonspecific LBP in São Paulo, Brazil. The outcome was the recurrence of an episode of LBP, assessed using two definitions: (1) 12-month recall alone and (2) pain measurements at follow-up. Prognostic factors were determined by logistic regression.

Within 1 year, the estimated recurrence of an episode of LBP ranged from 35% (79/225 events) [first definition] to 44% (100/226 events) [second definition]. When patients were stratified by the SBST, the estimate of recurrence ranged from 29% to 37% (21–27/73 events) for low-risk patients, from 33% to 39% (24–28/72 events) for medium-risk patients, and from 43% to 56% (34–45/80 events) for high-risk patients. Age, perceived risk of persistent LBP, and disability were independent prognostic factors associated with LBP recurrence within 1 year.

After recovering from a previous episode of acute LBP, 4 in every 10 patients experienced a recurrence within 1 year. This estimate varied depending on the classification used in the SBST. Within 1 year, age, perceived risk of persistent LBP, and baseline disability were significant factors.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® thoracic back pain [^114Lq71v]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). High credibility.

The ACR 2024 guidelines highlight specific circumstances regarding low back pain, particularly for patients experiencing upper back pain. They recommend not obtaining routine imaging for adult patients with acute, subacute, or chronic thoracic back pain unless accompanied by myelopathy, radiculopathy, or red flags. It is advisable to consider thoracic spine X-rays for patients with subacute or chronic thoracic back pain.

### Effectiveness of treatments for acute and subacute mechanical non-specific low back pain: a systematic review with network meta-analysis [^111XafBa]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Low back pain is a common symptom affecting people of all ages and socioeconomic statuses. In 2017, the worldwide point prevalence of low back pain (acute, subacute, and chronic) was 7.83% (95% CI 7.04 to 8.64), with 577 million people affected at any one time. In the same year, low back pain was responsible for approximately 65 million years lived with disability, representing a deterioration of about 17.5% since 2007. This increase was mainly due to population growth and aging, with the greatest rise recorded in low-income and middle-income countries. More people leave their jobs due to low back pain than due to diabetes, hypertension, neoplasm, asthma, heart, and respiratory diseases combined. About one in four adults in the United States experienced low back pain for at least 24 hours within the previous three months, with 7.6% of adults reporting at least one episode of severe acute low back pain within a year. Moderate-to-severe pain and impairment of motor and psychological functions due to low back pain are the primary reasons for seeking medical consultation from a general practitioner.

Despite its high prevalence, low back pain generally has a good prognosis. A specific cause of low back pain can seldom be identified, with the most prevalent type being mechanical, non-specific low back pain (NS-LBP). Most episodes of acute and subacute NS-LBP significantly improve within six weeks, with the average pain intensity being moderate (6 on a 100-point scale; 95% CI 3 to 10) by 12 months. However, two-thirds of people with low back pain still experience pain at three months (67%, 95% CI 50% to 83%) and at 12 months.

### Diagnostic imaging for low back pain: Advice for high-value health care from the American College of Physicians [^114hvKiN]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Diagnostic imaging is indicated for patients with low back pain only if they have severe progressive neurologic deficits or signs or symptoms that suggest a serious or specific underlying condition. In other patients, evidence indicates that routine imaging is not associated with clinically meaningful benefits but can lead to harms. Addressing inefficiencies in diagnostic testing could minimize potential harms to patients and have a large effect on the use of resources by reducing both direct and downstream costs. In this area, more testing does not equate to better care. Implementing a selective approach to low back imaging, as suggested by the American College of Physicians and American Pain Society guideline on low back pain, would provide better care to patients, improve outcomes, and reduce costs.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® thoracic back pain [^113YVuoR]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). High credibility.

ACR 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a thoracic spine X-ray, MRI, or CT for adult patients experiencing thoracic back pain, particularly in cases involving low-velocity trauma, osteoporosis, advanced age, or chronic corticosteroid use. For patients over 65 years of age, as well as those with osteoporosis, prior benign non-traumatic compression fractures, or chronic corticosteroid use, it is advised to consider a contrast-enhanced MRI of the thoracic spine. Alternatively, a whole-body bone scan or bone scan with SPECT or SPECT/CT can be used as initial imaging.

### Most red flags for malignancy in low back pain guidelines lack empirical support: A systematic review [^114cbAFE]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians do not want to miss underlying serious pathology, but it is still unclear which red flags are relevant. We aimed to evaluate the origin and evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of red flags for malignancy for the management of low back pain (LBP) in primary care. We performed a comprehensive overview and searched the literature using snowballing techniques and reference checking for evidence on red flags endorsed in clinical guidelines for identifying patients with a higher likelihood of malignancy. We selected studies including people with LBP without any restriction on study design. We extracted data on prevalence and diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, we assessed the methodological quality of studies evaluating diagnostic accuracy.

We identified 13 red flags endorsed in a total of 16 guidelines and 2 extra red flags not endorsed in any guideline. We included 33 publications, varying from systematic reviews to case reports. The origin of many red flags was unclear or was sourced from case reports. The incidence of malignancy in patients presenting with LBP in primary care varied between 0% and 0.7%. Seven studies provided diagnostic accuracy data on red flags. We found 5 red flags with accuracy data from 2 or more studies, with 2 ("history of malignancy" and "strong clinical suspicion") considered informative.

In conclusion, the origin and diagnostic accuracy of many red flags endorsed in guidelines are unclear. A "history of malignancy" and "strong clinical suspicion" are the only red flags with empirical evidence of acceptably high diagnostic accuracy.

### Effects of diagnostic information, per se, on patient outcomes in acute radiculopathy and low back pain [^115hhPd6]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2008). Low credibility.

We conducted a prospective randomized study of patients with acute low back pain and/or radiculopathy to assess the effect of knowledge of diagnostic findings on clinical outcomes. The practice of ordering spinal imaging, perhaps unintentionally, includes a large number of patients for whom the imaging test is performed for purposes of reassurance or because of patient expectations. If this rationale is valid, one would expect to see a measurable effect from diagnostic information, per se.

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 246 patients with acute (< 3 weeks) low back pain (LBP) and/or radiculopathy (150 LBP and 96 radiculopathy patients) were recruited. Patients were randomized using a stratified block design with equal allocation to either the unblinded group (MR imaging results provided within 48 hours) or the blinded group (both patient and physician blinded to MR imaging results). After the initial MR imaging, patients followed 6 weeks of conservative management. Roland function, visual pain analog, absenteeism, Short Form (SF)-36 Health Status Survey, self-efficacy scores, and Fear Avoidance Questionnaire were completed at presentation; 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks; and 6, 12, and 24 months. Improvement of Roland score by 50% or more and patient satisfaction assessed by Cherkin symptom satisfaction measure were considered a positive outcome.

- **Results**: Clinical outcome at 6 weeks was similar for unblinded and blinded patients. Self-efficacy, fear avoidance beliefs, and the SF-36 subscales were similar over time for blinded and unblinded patients.

### Can screening instruments accurately determine poor outcome risk in adults with recent onset low back pain? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115k3pmU]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Types of participants

Studies were eligible if they involved adults (aged 18 or over) with 'recent onset' low back pain (LBP), defined as acute LBP (0–6 weeks) or subacute LBP (6 weeks to 3 months), with or without leg pain. Studies involving participants with both recent-onset and chronic symptoms were included, with the intention of obtaining data from study authors specific to the 'recent onset' participants only. Studies including participants with pain in other body regions were considered eligible if more than 75% of participants had LBP.

Cohorts of compensable and non-compensable patients presenting to primary, secondary, and tertiary care settings were also eligible for inclusion. It was deemed appropriate to include individuals registered on workers' compensation databases, as this typically occurs in conjunction with a presentation to a healthcare provider. Participants may have presented with a first episode of pain or reported episodic/recurrent LBP, provided that the painful episode was immediately preceded by at least one pain-free month, as suggested previously.

### Noninvasive treatments for acute, subacute, and chronic low back pain: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^115crRCd]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for low back pain, more specifically with respect to psychological interventions, the ACP 2017 guidelines recommend offering mindfulness-based stress reduction, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or operant therapy in patients with chronic LBP.

### Red flags to screen for malignancy and fracture in patients with low back pain [^115fawnV]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

What are the best red flags to indicate the possibility of fracture or malignancy in patients presenting with low back pain in primary, secondary, or tertiary care? Older age, prolonged corticosteroid use, severe trauma, and the presence of a contusion or abrasion increase the likelihood of spinal fracture. The likelihood was higher with multiple red flags, and a history of malignancy increases the likelihood of spinal malignancy.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® low back pain: 2021 update [^1152weWt]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). High credibility.

In the United States, acute low back pain, with or without radiculopathy, is the leading cause of years lived with disability and the third-ranking cause of disability-adjusted life-years. Uncomplicated acute low back pain and/or radiculopathy is a benign, self-limited condition that does not warrant any imaging studies. Imaging is considered for patients who have had up to 6 weeks of medical management and physical therapy with little or no improvement in their back pain. It is also considered for patients presenting with red flags, raising suspicion for a serious underlying condition, such as cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, fracture, or infection.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies, such as the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Do not routinely offer imaging for uncomplicated low back pain [^111AMUxe]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

Less than 5–10% of all low back pain is due to a specific underlying spinal pathology. The remaining 90–95% has no indication of a serious cause and should be managed with conservative treatments such as advice and reassurance, exercise, physical therapy, chiropractic care, cognitive-behavioural therapy, or pain management.

Diagnostic triage based on clinical history and examination can help distinguish between non-specific or more serious low back pain. Imaging may do more harm than good when serious conditions are not suspected and is likely to prolong recovery in patients with non-specific low back pain.

Patients' primary concerns of whether their pain is caused by something serious and what they should do to aid recovery can be addressed by sound education and reassurance, without the need for imaging.

### Initial management decisions following a new consultation for low back pain: Implications of the usage of physical therapy for subsequent health care costs and utilization [^115GA9dg]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

To describe the utilization of physical therapy following a new primary care consultation for low back pain (LBP) and to examine the relations between physical therapy utilization and other variables with health care utilization and costs in the year after consultation, a retrospective cohort was obtained from electronic medical records and insurance claims data.

- **Setting**: Single health care delivery system.

- **Participants**: Individuals (N = 2184) older than 18 years with a new consultation for LBP from 2004 to 2008.

- **Interventions**: Patients were categorized as receiving initial physical therapy management if care occurred within 14 days after consultation.

- **Main outcome measures**: Total health care costs for all LBP-related care received in the year after consultation were calculated from claims data. Predictors of utilization of emergency care, advanced imaging, epidural injections, specialist visits, and surgery were identified using multivariate logistic regression. The generalized linear model was used to compare LBP-related costs based on physical therapy utilization and identify other cost determinants.

Initial physical therapy was received by 286 of the 2184 patients (13.1%) and was not a determinant of LBP-related health care costs or utilization of specific services in the year after consultation. Older age, mental health, or neck pain comorbidity, and initial management with opioids were determinants of cost and several utilization outcomes.

In conclusion, initial physical therapy management was not associated with increased health care costs or utilization.

### Non-specific low back pain [^115NutWU]. Lancet (2017). Low credibility.

Non-specific low back pain affects people of all ages and is a leading contributor to disease burden worldwide. Management guidelines endorse triage to identify the rare cases of low back pain caused by medically serious pathology, necessitating diagnostic work-up, specialist referral, or both. Because non-specific low back pain does not have a known pathoanatomical cause, treatment focuses on reducing pain and its consequences. Management consists of education and reassurance, analgesic medicines, non-pharmacological therapies, and timely review. The clinical course of low back pain is often favourable; thus, many patients require little if any formal medical care.

Two treatment strategies are currently used: a stepped approach beginning with more simple care that progresses if the patient does not respond, and the use of simple risk prediction methods to individualise the amount and type of care provided. The overuse of imaging, opioids, and surgery remains a widespread problem.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. Part VIII: Lateral hip and thigh pain [^116Lmq5o]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

This article presents an evidence-based algorithm to assist primary care providers with the diagnosis and management of lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults. It is part of a series that focuses on coexisting pain patterns and contributors to chronic low back pain (CLBP) in the aging population. The objective of the series is to encourage clinicians to take a holistic approach when evaluating and treating CLBP in older adults.

- **Methods**: A content expert panel and a primary care panel collaboratively used the modified Delphi approach to iteratively develop an evidence-based diagnostic and treatment algorithm. The panelists included physiatrists, geriatricians, internists, and physical therapists who treat both civilians and veterans, and the algorithm was developed so that all required resources are available within the Veterans Health Administration system. An illustrative patient case was chosen from one of the author's clinical practices to demonstrate the reasoning behind principles presented in the algorithm.

- **Results**: An algorithm was developed which logically outlines evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults. A case is presented which highlights the potential complexities of identifying the true pain generator and the importance of implementing proper treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults can contribute to and coexist with CLBP. Distinguishing the true cause(s) of pain from potentially a myriad of asymptomatic degenerative changes can be challenging, but a systematic approach is essential for effective management.

### Interventional therapies, surgery, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation for low back pain: An evidence-based clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Society [^111ASBLM]. Spine (2009). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for low back pain, specifically in relation to diagnostic nerve blocks, the APS 2009 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to recommend diagnostic selective nerve root block, intra-articular facet joint block, medial branch block, or sacroiliac joint block in patients with LBP (with or without radiculopathy).

### The need for multidimensional stratification of chronic low back pain (LBP) [^116uhMhf]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

To enable stratified management, easily identifiable group-specific factors, with potentially unique underlying etiology, may inform pragmatic changes to assessment, clinical diagnosis, and treatment approaches for LBP patients in primary care. For example, classification systems associated with easy-to-identify patient epidemiologic factors, such as age, sex, body mass index, and comorbid medical and/or psychological conditions, may enable or enhance subclassification of LBP patients. The primary objective of this cross-sectional study was to assess which existing simple primary care LBP stratification schema is associated with distinct subpopulations as characterized by these easily identifiable primary epidemiological factors. With a schema identified, we further investigated whether the alternative stratification systems contributed independently to grouping in this schema.

### Do not routinely offer imaging for uncomplicated low back pain [^112sULD9]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

The clinical problem has evolved significantly over the past two decades concerning the use of imaging in managing low back pain (LBP). Historically, imaging was a routine component of the diagnostic workup for most LBP cases. However, evidence now indicates that imaging is beneficial only for a small subgroup of patients where there is suspicion of red flag conditions. These conditions include cancer, infection, inflammatory disease, fractures, and severe neurological deficits, collectively accounting for only 5–10% of LBP presentations in primary care. For the remaining 90–95% of LBP cases, categorized as non-specific or uncomplicated LBP, imaging does not guide management and may cause more harm than benefit.

International guidelines and various "Choosing Wisely" campaigns now endorse a diagnostic triage approach to identify patients who require imaging. Despite these advances in knowledge, imaging rates for LBP should theoretically be decreasing. However, recent systematic reviews reveal an increase in imaging over the past 20 years, with at least a third of all images deemed unnecessary.

- **Choosing wisely statements**:

	"Don't routinely image patients with low back pain regardless of the duration of symptoms unless: (a) there are clinical reasons to suspect serious underlying pathology (i.e. red flags), or (b) imaging is necessary for the planning and/or execution of a particular evidence-based therapeutic intervention on a specific spinal condition". — Canadian Spine Society, Choosing Wisely Canada

### Red flags to screen for vertebral fracture in patients presenting with low-back pain [^117VrR4S]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023).

Low-back pain (LBP) is a common condition seen in primary care. A principal aim during a clinical examination is to identify patients with a higher likelihood of underlying serious pathology, such as vertebral fracture, who may require additional investigation and specific treatment. All 'evidence-based' clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of red flags to screen for serious causes of back pain. However, it remains unclear if the diagnostic accuracy of red flags is sufficient to support this recommendation.

The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of red flags obtained in a clinical history or physical examination to screen for vertebral fracture in patients presenting with LBP.

- **Search methods**: Electronic databases were searched for primary studies between the earliest date and 7 March 2012. Forward and backward citation searching of eligible studies was also conducted.

- **Selection criteria**: Studies were considered if they compared the results of any aspect of the history or test conducted in the physical examination of patients presenting for LBP or examination of the lumbar spine, with a reference standard (diagnostic imaging). The selection criteria were independently applied by two review authors.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three review authors independently conducted 'risk of bias' assessment and data extraction. Risk of bias was assessed using the 11-item QUADAS.

### Diagnosis and treatment of low back pain: A joint clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society [^111fPrGs]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). High credibility.

The ACP/APS 2007 guidelines recommend eliciting a focused medical history and performing a physical examination to categorize patients with low back pain into one of the following broad categories:

- **Nonspecific low back pain**: This category includes patients with pain that cannot be attributed to any specific underlying condition.

- **Back pain potentially associated with radiculopathy or spinal stenosis**: These patients may exhibit symptoms suggestive of nerve root involvement or narrowing of the spinal canal.

- **Back pain potentially associated with another specific spinal cause**: This includes patients with pain that can be linked to a particular spinal disorder or condition.

These diagnostic investigations are essential for lumbar spinal stenosis, specifically with respect to history and physical examination.

### Back pain as the initial presentation of subacute bacterial endocarditis in a patient with a complex medical history [^112uD1Xb]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) poses a diagnostic challenge due to its diverse clinical presentations, especially among high-risk groups. Diagnosis relies on integrating clinical presentation, blood cultures, and imaging findings. Advanced imaging techniques enhance diagnostic accuracy, particularly in complex cases. Treatment involves antimicrobial therapy and surgery in complicated cases, with early intervention crucial for optimal outcomes. Coordinated care by an endocarditis team ensures tailored treatment plans, prompt complication management, and long-term monitoring after discharge. The authors present a case of subacute IE initially presenting with back pain in a patient with a complex medical history, highlighting diagnostic and management approaches.

### Red flags to screen for malignancy and fracture in patients with low back pain: Systematic review [^112a24AB]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

The evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of red flag signs and symptoms is reviewed to screen for fracture or malignancy in patients presenting with low back pain in primary, secondary, or tertiary care.

- **Objective**: To review the evidence on diagnostic accuracy of red flag signs and symptoms to screen for fracture or malignancy in patients presenting with low back pain to primary, secondary, or tertiary care.

- **Design**: Systematic review.

- **Data sources**: Medline, OldMedline, Embase, and CINAHL from earliest available up to 1 October 2013.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Primary diagnostic studies comparing red flags for fracture or malignancy to an acceptable reference standard, published in any language.

- **Review methods**: Assessment of study quality and extraction of data were conducted by three independent assessors. Diagnostic accuracy statistics and post-test probabilities were generated for each red flag.

- **Results**: We included 14 studies (eight from primary care, two from secondary care, four from tertiary care) evaluating 53 red flags; only five studies evaluated combinations of red flags. Pooling of data was not possible because of index test heterogeneity. Many red flags in guidelines provide virtually no change in probability of fracture or malignancy or have untested diagnostic accuracy. The red flags with the highest post-test probability for detection of fracture were older age (9%; 95% confidence interval 3% to 25%), prolonged use of corticosteroid drugs (33%; 10% to 67%), severe trauma (11%; 8% to 16%), and the presence of a contusion or abrasion (62%; 49% to 74%). Probability of spinal fracture was higher when multiple red flags were present (90%; 34% to 99%). The red flag with the highest post-test probability for detection of spinal malignancy was a history of malignancy.

### Low back pain [^116MmT2N]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Low back pain is a common problem that is the leading cause of disability and is associated with high costs. Evaluation focuses on the identification of risk factors indicating a serious underlying condition and increased risk for persistent disabling symptoms to guide the selective use of diagnostic testing, including imaging, and treatments. Nonpharmacologic therapies, including exercise and psychosocial management, are preferred for most patients with low back pain and may be supplemented with adjunctive drug therapies. Surgery and interventional procedures are options in a minority of patients who do not respond to standard treatments.

### Triage for nonspecific lower-back pain [^112QNZGQ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unremitting lower-back pain has long been a costly and personally devastating problem in society. Guidelines for the treatment of lower-back pain have provided evidence-based recommendations to help identify patients who will benefit from specific types of treatment in an effort to reduce costs and human suffering. However, there is little evidence that these guidelines are being applied in the daily practice of healthcare providers. Practical information is required to assist healthcare providers in triaging patients for specific treatments so that interventions can be targeted only to those who need them. In this way, iatrogenic complications and unnecessary costs can be contained.

This chapter provides information on how to triage the patient with nonspecific lower-back pain for optimal care. The recommendations are supported by evidence-based guidelines, and when these are not available, best practice principles. Because appropriate treatment varies depending on the length of time a patient is suffering from lower-back pain, the chapter is divided into recommendations for acute, subacute, chronic, and recurrent phases of lower-back pain.

### The need for multidimensional stratification of chronic low back pain (LBP) [^111xt68F]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) patients exhibit considerable heterogeneity, necessitating stratification initiated in primary care that extends beyond mere symptoms and psychosocial risk factors. Notably, the predominant mechanical pain patterns observed during presentation have distinctive and easily recognizable epidemiological profiles. Such recognition can enhance stratification methods and facilitate more targeted interventions. It is intriguing to note that differences were identified within a context of minimal variability in disability severity and chronicity risk across the various pain pattern groups. This highlights that initial stratification based solely on the aforementioned factors might not yield distinct LBP subgroups, potentially restricting the scope of clinical and epidemiological research.

Treatment options and guideline recommendations

There is an almost endless list of treatment options currently available to patients with low back pain (LBP), each supported by different theories, potential mechanisms, underpinning rationales, and research evidence. Some are accompanied by extravagant claims of complete pain relief, often advertised via the internet. Most of these claims and unusual treatment approaches have not proven to be effective when subjected to rigorous and independent evaluation. Treatments include oral medications, topical medications, exercise, manual therapy, traction, acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), spinal cord stimulators, mattresses, orthotics, back supports, biofeedback, spinal injections, and surgery. In other words, LBP patients may be offered treatments from the full range of conservative, pharmacological, non-pharmacological, traditional, and complementary healthcare interventions, as well as invasive interventions.

Given this almost limitless array of options, it is not uncommon for patients with similar LBP signs and symptoms to receive different interventions from healthcare professionals. Key reasons for such variation in practice are firstly the close commitment of different intervention providers to their respective favorite treatments, and secondly the clinical uncertainty associated with LBP in terms of diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment selection. Evidence for the first reason is provided by studies that show the association between the attitudes and beliefs of practitioners and their clinical decisions.

### Red flags to screen for malignancy and fracture in patients with low back pain: systematic review [^116csVFz]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

- **Methods**

- **Data sources**: For the Cochrane diagnostic test accuracy reviews, we searched Medline, OldMedline, Embase, and CINAHL (Ebsco) for eligible studies from the earliest record up to 7 March 2012. The search was updated to include studies up to 1 October 2013. The searches used combinations of terms related to the patient population, history taking, physical examination, and the target condition and were developed in collaboration with a medical information specialist. Forward and backward citation searches were completed.

- **Study selection**: Primary diagnostic studies were considered if they looked at the results of history taking or physical examination compared with those of an acceptable reference standard, to identify spinal fracture or spinal malignancy in adult patients presenting with low back pain. Examples of reference standards include diagnostic imaging to confirm the presence of spinal fracture, primary malignancy, or metastases in the spine. Long term follow-up (more than six months) of patients after the initial consultation was also considered an appropriate reference standard for both fracture and malignancy if suspected cases identified during the follow-up period were confirmed by medical review. Cohort and cross-sectional studies of a consecutive series of patients that presented sufficient data to allow estimates of diagnostic accuracy (such as sensitivity and specificity) were considered for eligibility. We considered studies reported in abstracts or conference proceedings and full journal publications in all languages.

### Management of children presenting with low back pain to emergency department [^116Q7AJs]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

We aimed to describe characteristics, etiology, and health care use in children with low back pain (LBP) presenting to a pediatric emergency department (ED) and to develop an algorithm to design a diagnostic approach.

- **Methods**: We conducted a 7-year cohort study of children admitted to the ED with a primary complaint of LBP. They were classified into diagnostic groups: visceral LBP, traumatic LBP, and non-visceral/non-traumatic LBP. To identify high-risk factors (red flags) associated with severe prognosis conditions (SPCs), we analyzed the non-visceral/non-traumatic group, comparing the SPC children with those without SPCs.

- **Results**: Our population comprised 140 females (52.6%) and 126 males (47.4%), with a median age of 10.5 years. Eighty children (30.3%) were hospitalized, with an average length of stay of 8.53 ± 9.84 days. SPCs accounted for 28 patients (18.9%) of the overall 148 with non-traumatic/non-visceral LBP. In this group, SPCs presented with earlier onset and longer duration of symptoms than non-SPCs. The presence of red flags was more significant in the SPCs group, 28 vs. 18; 100% vs. 15% (p < 0.001); sensitivity 100%, specificity 85%. Among SPCs, 78.6% were hospitalized vs. non-SPCs (16.8%) (p < 0.001); within the SPC group, 2 patients returned due to the onset of red flags.

- **Conclusion**: Our study identified significant high-risk factors (red flags) associated with serious outcomes (SPC group) compared to the non-SPC group, thereby ensuring specific treatment. We developed an algorithm based on previous literature and the findings of our study.

### The need for multidimensional stratification of chronic low back pain (LBP) [^111YhYd1]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) is currently ranked as the leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide. Despite extensive study and numerous clinical practice guidelines, treatment costs for LBP continue to increase without improvement in functional outcomes. In the US, the annual expenditure related to LBP ($86 billion) has reached levels comparable to the care of diabetes ($98 billion), cancer ($89 billion), and nonspine arthritis ($80 billion).

Although many acute episodes of LBP resolve, substantial numbers of patients suffer repeated relapses requiring treatment. A recent review reported that 75% of patients experiencing an episode of LBP continue to report pain at 6 weeks (subacute phase), and 66% continue to report pain at 3 months (chronic phase). Up to 25% of LBP persists in a constant, chronic state and incurs the largest costs (approximately 75%) in terms of health care utilization and loss of productivity.

At the primary care level, most clinical practice guidelines dichotomize LBP patients into those with specific LBP (a small group with an easily identifiable pain source, e.g. infection) or with implied mechanical or "non-specific" LBP (a large group, > 80%). Patients with nonspecific LBP are heterogeneous in terms of clinical characteristics and prognosis, and thus are more likely to respond favorably to specific treatment, rather than the current "one-size-fits-all" approach. Evidence suggests that a more specific approach to management leads to tailored treatments (i.e. stratified management) and improved outcomes, although with moderate to low confidence.

### Prevention and treatment of low back pain: Evidence, challenges, and promising directions [^111BRq5w]. Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

Many clinical practice guidelines recommend similar approaches for the assessment and management of low back pain. Recommendations include using a biopsychosocial framework to guide management, with initial non-pharmacological treatment, including education that supports self-management and the resumption of normal activities and exercise. Psychological programs are suggested for those with persistent symptoms. Guidelines recommend prudent use of medication, imaging, and surgery. The recommendations are based almost exclusively on trials from high-income countries, focused mainly on treatments rather than on prevention, with limited data on cost-effectiveness.

Globally, gaps between evidence and practice exist, with limited use of recommended first-line treatments and inappropriately high use of imaging, rest, opioids, spinal injections, and surgery. Doing more of the same will not reduce back-related disability or its long-term consequences. The advances with the greatest potential are arguably those that align practice with the evidence, reduce the focus on spinal abnormalities, and ensure the promotion of activity and function, including work participation.

We have identified effective, promising, or emerging solutions that could offer new directions, but these need greater attention and further research to determine if they are appropriate for large-scale implementation. These potential solutions include focused strategies to implement best practices, the redesign of clinical pathways, integrated health and occupational interventions to reduce work disability, and changes in compensation systems.

### Red flags to screen for malignancy and fracture in patients with low back pain: Systematic review [^111YZq4y]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Unnecessary imaging is a concern in many settings, with adverse consequences for both the patient and society. Our review shows that the advice provided in some guidelines to refer all patients with a single positive red flag for imaging is unwise. Given that 80% of patients in primary care might have at least one positive red flag, such a course would mean that most patients with low back pain would receive diagnostic imaging. In contrast, our review aligns with the approach of the American College of Physicians guideline and others, which suggest considering the probability of serious disease, given the specific red flags present, when making decisions about the need for and timing of imaging. Our results indicate that many guidelines will require revision to provide advice that is more firmly grounded in relevant diagnostic research.

- **Unanswered questions and future research**: Our review has highlighted the need for more high-quality diagnostic research on this topic. Much of the existing research has evaluated single clinical features, and our results suggest it might be more useful to evaluate combinations of clinical features, as is done with decision rules such as the Ottawa Ankle Rule and Canadian C-Spine Rule. While some decision rules are available, all are at the derivation stage and await external validation. There is also a need for systematic reviews of red flags to screen for other conditions such as infection and ankylosing spondylitis.

### Low back and radicular pain: A pathway for care developed by the British Pain Society [^112dHsJD]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

These consensus guidelines aim to provide an overview of best practices for managing chronic spinal pain, reflecting the heterogeneity of low back pain. Most guidelines have covered only one aspect of spinal care and thus have been divisive and potentially worsened the quality of care. Additionally, some of the evidence base is subjective and of poor quality. The British Pain Society low back pain pathway has reached across all disciplines and involved input from patients. It is recognized, however, that there is an urgent need for further high-quality clinical research in this area to underpin future guidelines. Considerable work is still needed to clarify the evidence; however, foundations have been laid with this pathway. Key features include:

- **Risk stratification**: Clarification of intensity of psychological interventions.
- **Management of sciatica**: A logical progression for managing sciatica.
- **Decision points**: Consideration for structural interventions such as spinal injections and surgery.

### ACR appropriateness criteria low back pain [^1172qyrP]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Most patients presenting with uncomplicated acute low back pain (LBP) and/or radiculopathy do not require imaging. Imaging is considered for those patients who have had up to 6 weeks of medical management and physical therapy with little or no improvement in their back pain. It is also considered for patients presenting with red flags that raise suspicion for serious underlying conditions, such as cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, fracture, and infection.

Many imaging modalities are available to clinicians and radiologists for evaluating LBP. The application of these modalities depends largely on the working diagnosis, the urgency of the clinical problem, and comorbidities of the patient. For concerns about a lumbar spine fracture, multidetector CT is recommended. Patients deemed to be interventional candidates, with LBP lasting for more than 6 weeks after conservative management and with persistent radiculopathic symptoms, may seek MRI. Patients with severe or progressive neurologic deficits on presentation and red flags should be evaluated with MRI.

The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies, such as the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation, to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures.

Numerous published guidelines support the use of so-called red flag questions to screen for serious pathology in patients with low back pain. This paper examines the effectiveness of red flag questions as a screening tool for patients presenting with low back pain to a multidisciplinary academic spine center.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of the cases of 9,940 patients with a chief complaint of low back pain. The patients completed a questionnaire that included several red flag questions during their first physician visit. Diagnostic data for the same clinical episode were collected from medical records and were corroborated with imaging reports. Patients who were diagnosed as having a vertebral fracture, malignancy, infection, or cauda equina syndrome were classified as having a red flag diagnosis.

- **Results**: Specific individual red flags and combinations of red flags were associated with an increased probability of underlying serious spinal pathology; for example, recent trauma and an age of > 50 years were associated with vertebral fracture. The presence or absence of other red flags, such as night pain, was unrelated to any particular diagnosis. For instance, for patients with no recent history of infection and no fever, chills, or sweating, the presence of night pain was a false-positive finding for infection > 96% of the time. In general, the absence of red flag responses did not meaningfully decrease the likelihood of a red flag diagnosis; 64% of.

### Low back pain investigations and prognosis: a review [^116pcDrz]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Low back pain is reviewed in terms of when investigations are useful and its clinical course. Despite the extensive evaluation of the accuracy of investigations such as radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and myelography, there is a surprising dearth of research to inform their use in primary care. There is no clear evidence on which to base judgments for the selection of appropriate tests to confirm or exclude low back pain pathology. It appears that investigations are rarely necessary for low back pain. Specific investigations should be ordered to identify a particular pathology but should not be ordered routinely for general screening. In the absence of pathology, low back pain and its associated disability improve rapidly in the first weeks after onset, but, in contradiction to all guidelines, both commonly persist and the best evidence suggests that recurrences are common.

### Evaluation and treatment of acute back pain in the emergency department [^117BAync]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Back pain is a common presenting complaint to the emergency department. The key to proper evaluation is a history and physical examination focused on determining if any red flags for serious disease are present. If no red flags are present, the patient most likely has nonspecific back pain, and their symptoms will resolve in 4 to 6 weeks. No diagnostic testing is required.

For patients with red flags, a focused history and examination, in conjunction with diagnostic laboratory tests and imaging, determine whether the patient has an emergent condition such as herniated disc, epidural compression, or spinal infection.

### Red flags to screen for malignancy and fracture in patients with low back pain: Systematic review [^114LwQnw]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Low back pain is a major cause of disability, leading to considerable healthcare expenditure around the world, especially in high-income countries. The difficulty in providing a definitive diagnosis for most presentations of back pain has given rise to the term "non-specific low back pain", which is generally considered to be benign and can be managed in a primary care setting. Some patients, however, present with low back pain as the initial manifestation of more serious pathology, such as malignancy, spinal fracture, infection, or cauda equina syndrome.

Spinal fracture and malignancy are the most common serious pathologies affecting the spine. In patients with low back pain presenting to primary care, between 1% and 4% will have a spinal fracture, and in less than 1%, malignancy — whether primary tumor or metastasis — will be the underlying cause.

### Low-back and neck pain diagnosis and treatment [^1162KjRZ]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Back and neck pain are symptoms, often complaints, and sometimes causes of disability, but they are not diseases. These distinctions are critical to understanding the personal and societal impact of back and neck pain and our opportunities to discover new ways to reduce their impact. This article briefly describes the diagnosis and treatment of spinal pain, the relationship between pain and disability, and the challenges in prioritizing our resource allocations between curing pain problems and reducing disability.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® low back pain: 2021 update [^114UwfEa]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for low back pain, particularly concerning diagnostic imaging, ACR 2021 guidelines recommend considering lumbar spine MRI with or without IV contrast as initial imaging in patients with low back pain (LBP), with or without radiculopathy, who exhibit one or more of the following conditions:

- **Suspicion of cancer**: MRI can help in identifying malignancies affecting the lumbar region.
- **Infection**: Imaging is crucial to detect any infectious processes.
- **Immunosuppression**: Patients with compromised immune systems may need earlier imaging due to a higher risk of serious underlying conditions.

### Diagnosis and treatment of low back pain: A joint clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society [^1144jTXr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for low back pain, specifically concerning general principles, the ACP/APS 2007 guidelines recommend considering the addition of nonpharmacologic therapy with proven benefits. For patients with acute low back pain, spinal manipulation is suggested. In cases of chronic or subacute low back pain, intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise therapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, spinal manipulation, yoga, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or progressive relaxation may be valuable for those not responding to self-care options.

### Can screening instruments accurately determine poor outcome risk in adults with recent onset low back pain? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114hedtW]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Following the removal of duplicate articles, two reviewers independently assessed the titles and abstracts of studies identified by the search for eligibility. AW assessed all the articles, while EK and LG each assessed 50% of the articles. All reviewers applied a checklist of inclusion and exclusion criteria, and any disagreements were resolved through discussion. If necessary, the full paper was obtained for further assessment. Full texts of studies potentially fulfilling the eligibility criteria were retrieved, with subsequent independent assessment of all articles undertaken by EK and LG. Reasons for study exclusion were noted on a checklist, with any disagreements resolved by discussion.

EK and either LG or LR independently reviewed the full text of eligible studies and extracted relevant data using a standardized spreadsheet. Extracted data included details of the healthcare setting, recruitment, study population, number of participants, loss to follow-up, symptom duration, LBP history, compensability, concomitant treatments, outcome measurement, statistical analyses, and reporting quality. Discrepancies in extracted data were identified and checked. If the required data could not be extracted, authors were emailed with the specific inquiry. If no response was received, authors were re-emailed after two weeks and finally following a further week.

Predictive validity is conventionally assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, with the area under the curve (AUC) statistic being the most routinely reported measure of performance.

### Pain one week after an emergency department visit for acute low back pain is associated with poor three-month outcomes [^116yVXPS]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) is responsible for more than 2.5 million visits to U.S. emergency departments (EDs) annually. Nearly 30% of patients who present to an ED with acute LBP report functional impairment or pain three months later. These patients are at risk of chronic LBP, a highly debilitating condition. In this study, we assessed whether three variables assessable shortly after symptom onset could independently predict poor three-month outcomes among LBP patients who present to an ED.

- **Methods**: This was a planned analysis of data from two randomized comparative effectiveness studies of patients with acute, non-traumatic, non-radicular LBP. Patients were enrolled during an ED visit, contacted by telephone 1 week after the ED visit, and then followed up by telephone three months later. The co-primary three-month outcomes were LBP-related functional impairment and persistent moderate or severe LBP. Two of the three hypothesized predictor variables were assessed during the index visit:
	- The STarT Back Screening Tool score, a nine-item, multidimensional tool validated and widely used in the outpatient setting.
	- The patient's own anticipated duration of LBP.
	- The third hypothesized predictor was the presence of pain assessed by phone 1 week after the ED visit.

We then determined whether these three predictor variables were independently associated with poor outcomes at three months, after controlling for medication received, age, and sex.

- **Results**: A total of 354 patients were enrolled. Of these, 309 (87%) provided three-month impairment data and 311 (88%) provided three-month pain data.

### Barriers and progress in the treatment of low back pain [^116j7CWC]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Why aren't treatments more effective?

There are likely several key explanations, explored in detail elsewhere. Firstly, many of our treatments are predicated on a healthcare practitioner's specific diagnosis, based, for example, on imaging findings or the results of subjective and objective examination; yet, these approaches to diagnosis correlate poorly with the patient's symptoms, their onward path or trajectory, or their treatment responsiveness. Secondly, patient heterogeneity in clinical trials means that the average treatment effect masks a wide range of individual responses to any specific treatment, including, for example, patients who benefit a great deal along with those who benefit little or not at all. Thus, a compelling argument for our lack of progress in achieving better treatment results is that we have failed to focus on identifying and addressing the factors that really influence patients' outcomes. In other words, we have largely failed to match patients with the most appropriate treatment for their individual profile.

Identification of clinically relevant subgroups of non-specific low back pain patients may be related to causal mechanisms, different prognoses, or treatment responsiveness. For example, although psychosocial factors associated with poor prognosis (or yellow flags) have been shown to be important in the development of chronicity and future disability, and most guidelines recommend the assessment of these factors, there have been few easy-to-use tools to help clinicians identify these factors in busy clinical practice and limited guidance about a

### Red flags presented in current low back pain guidelines: A review [^117Wnmmx]. European Spine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to identify and descriptively compare the red flags endorsed in guidelines for detecting serious pathology in patients presenting with low back pain to primary care.

We conducted searches across databases, the World Wide Web, and engaged with experts to locate multidisciplinary clinical guidelines for low back pain in primary care, selecting the most recent guideline per country. We extracted data on the number and type of red flags used to identify patients with a higher likelihood of serious pathology. Additionally, we collected information on whether accuracy data (such as sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values) was presented to support the endorsement of specific red flags.

In the results, we identified 21 discrete guidelines published between 2000 and 2015, though one guideline could not be retrieved. After selecting one guideline per country, we included 16 guidelines from 15 different countries, along with one covering Europe as a whole. All guidelines focused on managing patients with low back pain in either a primary care or multidisciplinary care setting. Five guidelines presented red flags in a general context, not linked to any specific disease. In total, we discovered 46 discrete red flags associated with the four main categories of serious pathology: malignancy, fracture, cauda equina syndrome, and infection. Most guidelines identified two red flags for fractures ('major or significant trauma' and 'use of steroids or immunosuppressors') and two for malignancy ('history of cancer' and 'unintentional weight loss'). Most often, pain at night was also a common indicator.

### Imaging strategies for low-back pain: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^112TNJNZ]. Lancet (2009). Low credibility.

Some clinicians perform lumbar imaging routinely, even in the absence of historical or clinical features suggestive of serious low-back problems. We investigated the effects of routine, immediate lumbar imaging versus usual clinical care without immediate imaging on clinical outcomes in patients with low-back pain and no indication of serious underlying conditions.

- **Methods**: We analyzed randomized controlled trials that compared immediate lumbar imaging (radiography, MRI, or CT) versus usual clinical care without immediate imaging for low-back pain. These trials reported on pain or function (primary outcomes), quality of life, mental health, overall patient-reported improvement (based on various scales), and patient satisfaction with the care received. Six trials (n = 1804) met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed by two independent reviewers using criteria adapted from the Cochrane Back Review Group. Meta-analyses were conducted with a random effects model.

- **Findings**: We did not observe significant differences between immediate lumbar imaging and usual care without immediate imaging for primary outcomes at either short-term (up to 3 months, standardized mean difference 0.19, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.39 for pain and 0.11, -0.29 to 0.50 for function, with negative values favoring routine imaging) or long-term (6–12 months, -0.04, -0.15 to 0.07 for pain and 0.01, -0.17 to 0.19 for function) follow-up. Other outcomes did not differ significantly. Trial quality, use of different imaging methods, and duration of low-back pain did not affect the results, although analyses were limited by small numbers.

### Analgesia for non-specific low back pain [^111u7ABT]. BMJ (2024). Low credibility.

Low back pain, synonymous with "primary" low back pain, is pain felt between the lower ribs and the buttocks. This differs from radicular low back pain, which occurs when a spinal nerve root is affected, resulting in pain that extends down the legs. Approximately 90% of cases are non-specific, meaning a specific cause has not been identified. The causes of the remaining 10%, affecting around less than 1 in 100 in primary care and about 5 in 100 in emergency departments, include fractures, infections, malignancies, inflammatory disorders such as spondylarthritis, spinal stenosis, or non-spinal problems such as kidney issues or menstrual-related pain.

The prognosis for a new episode of non-specific low back pain is good. Most people recover from acute low back pain within a few weeks irrespective of any treatment. Some people, however, develop chronic low back pain, typically defined as symptoms lasting for over three months, either as a fluctuating/recurring or continuous problem. Of those who present to primary care with acute low back pain, a quarter will have some ongoing pain or functional impairment at three months (chronic pain), although the estimates from individual studies range widely from 2% to 48%.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^116qgeXL]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for low back pain, specifically concerning psychosocial evaluation, ACOEM 2021 guidelines recommend considering psychological evaluation in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic pain under the following circumstances:

- **Observed or suspected significant psychosocial dysfunction**: To assess psychosocial factors contributing to the patient's pain reports and disability behaviors.

- **Inadequate recovery**: This includes a dysfunctional status persisting beyond the typical recovery duration, failure to benefit from indicated therapies, or inability to return to work when medically indicated, as well as a persistent pain problem inadequately explained by the patient's physical findings.

- **Medication and/or drug issues**: This involves any suspicion of drug overuse or misuse, aberrant drug behavior, substance abuse, addiction, use of illicit substances, or consideration of chronic opioid use.

- **Premorbid history**: Includes a history of major psychiatric symptoms or disorders.

- **Compliance/adherence problems**: Issues with adherence to prescribed medical treatments or rehabilitation programs. This is for evaluating suitability for, or potential benefits from a proposed functional restoration program, such as comprehensive occupational rehabilitation or interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation.

- **Cognitive impairment evidence**: Associated with significant dysfunction in daily living activities, secondary to injury and/or adverse effects of medical therapies initiated for chronic pain.

- **Catastrophic injuries**: Accompanied by significant pain-related concerns.

### How common is imaging for low back pain in primary and emergency care? Systematic review and meta-analysis of over 4 million imaging requests across 21 years [^111o9SBv]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

To estimate the proportion of patients seeking care for low back pain (LBP) who are imaged and explore trends in the proportion of patients who received diagnostic imaging over time, we examined the effect of study-level factors on estimates of imaging proportion.

- **Data sources**: Electronic searches were conducted through MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases from January 1995 to December 2017.

- **Eligibility criteria for selecting studies**: Observational designs and controlled trials that reported imaging for patients presenting to primary care or emergency care for LBP were included. We assessed study quality and calculated pooled proportions by care setting and imaging type, with strength of evidence assessed using the GRADE system.

- **Results**: Forty-five studies were included, representing 19,451,749 consultations for LBP that resulted in 4,343,919 imaging requests/events over 21 years. In primary care, there was moderate quality evidence that the simple imaging proportion was 16.3% (95% CI 12.6% to 21.1%) and complex imaging was 9.2% (95% CI 6.2% to 13.5%). The pooled proportion for any imaging was 24.8% (95% CI 19.3% to 31.1%). In emergency care, there was moderate quality evidence that the simple imaging proportion was 26.1% (95% CI 18.2% to 35.8%) and high-quality evidence that the complex imaging proportion was 8.2% (95% CI 4.4% to 15.6%). The pooled proportion for any imaging was 35.6% (95% CI 29.8% to 41.8%). Complex imaging increased from 7.4% (95% CI 5.7% to 9.6%) for imaging requested in 1995 to 11.4% (95% CI 9.6% to 13.5%) in 2015, showing a relative increase of 53.5%.

### Red flags to screen for malignancy and fracture in patients with low back pain: Systematic review [^113o9wQM]. BMJ (2013). High credibility.

Objective: To review the evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of red flag signs and symptoms to screen for fracture or malignancy in patients presenting with low back pain to primary, secondary, or tertiary care.

Design: Systematic review.

Data sources: Medline, OldMedline, Embase, and CINAHL from earliest available up to 1 October 2013.

Inclusion criteria: Primary diagnostic studies comparing red flags for fracture or malignancy to an acceptable reference standard, published in any language.

Review methods: Assessment of study quality and extraction of data was conducted by three independent assessors. Diagnostic accuracy statistics and post-test probabilities were generated for each red flag.

Results: We included 14 studies (eight from primary care, two from secondary care, four from tertiary care) evaluating 53 red flags; only five studies evaluated combinations of red flags. Pooling of data was not possible due to index test heterogeneity. Many red flags in guidelines provide virtually no change in the probability of fracture or malignancy or have untested diagnostic accuracy. The red flags with the highest post-test probability for detection of fracture were older age (9%, 95% confidence interval 3% to 25%), prolonged use of corticosteroid drugs (33%, 10% to 67%), severe trauma (11%, 8% to 16%), and presence of a contusion or abrasion (62%, 49% to 74%). Probability of spinal fracture was higher when multiple red flags were present (90%, 34% to 99%). The red flag with the highest post-test probability for detection of spinal malignancy was a history of malignancy (33%).
