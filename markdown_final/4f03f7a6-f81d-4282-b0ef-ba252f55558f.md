## Question

Why sould troponine levels increase IN THE DAYS after a PCI for a NSTEMI

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why troponin levels can increase in the days after PCI for NSTEMI and how to interpret those elevations clinically and diagnostically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline troponin kinetics in NSTEMI and how PCI alters release and clearance. Then, I should verify the universal definition of periprocedural myocardial injury and type 4a MI and how it applies when baseline troponin is already elevated. Next, I will examine the timing of post-PCI troponin peaks and why serial sampling matters. After that, I need to distinguish true procedural injury from ongoing ischemia, reperfusion washout, and non-ischemic causes. Finally, I will integrate prognostic data and guideline-based thresholds to translate this into practical management and risk stratification.

> Let me first confirm the baseline context: in NSTEMI, troponin rises and falls over hours to days, so any post-PCI value must be interpreted against the pre-PCI trajectory. If troponin was rising or peaking at the time of PCI, a subsequent increase may simply reflect the index infarction's natural kinetics rather than new injury, which is why the Fourth Universal Definition requires that pre-PCI troponin be normal or stable/falling before attributing a post-PCI rise to procedural injury [^1144Bv5h] [^115wSy3Z].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic framework for periprocedural myocardial injury and type 4a MI: the current consensus uses a relative increase in troponin of more than 20% from the pre-PCI nadir with an absolute post-PCI value at least 5 times the 99th percentile upper reference limit within 48 hours. However, emerging data suggest that a threshold above 40% relative increase better separates prognostically meaningful injury from noise in patients with elevated baseline troponin, and this is where careful serial sampling becomes essential to avoid misclassification [^1144Bv5h] [^111hFFgx] [^112Ycof8].

> I will now examine the timing of post-PCI troponin peaks, because I need to ensure we are measuring when it matters: many patients peak later than 6–8 hours, with troponin T frequently peaking at or beyond 12–24 hours after PCI, meaning early sampling can miss the true peak and underestimate injury. This is particularly relevant when baseline troponin is elevated, as the decay curve may be prolonged and a new procedural rise can be superimposed on a falling trend [^1125B3sE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — what exactly causes a post-PCI troponin rise in this setting: distal embolization of plaque or thrombus causing microinfarction, ischemia-reperfusion injury with oxidative stress and mitochondrial disruption, side-branch occlusion or transient flow limitation, and direct mechanical trauma from guidewires or balloons can all contribute. Importantly, impaired tissue-level perfusion despite restored epicardial flow correlates with troponin release, reinforcing the link between microvascular dysfunction and biomarker elevation [^113iY2TN].

> But wait, what if the apparent "increase" is just the washout phenomenon from reperfusion of the culprit territory? I should double-check the trajectory: after successful reperfusion, delayed release of previously sequestered troponin can produce a secondary rise that reflects earlier necrosis rather than new procedural injury, which is why attribution requires documented stability or decline before PCI and then a subsequent increase that meets delta criteria. This is precisely why guidelines emphasize serial pre- and post-PCI sampling and trend analysis [^1144Bv5h] [^115wSy3Z].

> Let me consider non-ischemic contributors that can confound interpretation in the days after PCI: renal dysfunction slows troponin clearance and can elevate baseline levels, heart failure and tachyarrhythmias can provoke chronic or acute myocardial strain with troponin release, and systemic inflammation or critical illness can injure the myocardium. These factors argue for integrating clinical context, ECG, imaging, and angiographic data rather than relying on a single post-PCI value [^114jcGFd] [^115RRzAg].

> Next, I should review prognostic implications, because I need to ensure the interpretation changes management: in patients with NSTEMI and stable or falling pre-PCI troponin, a post-PCI relative increase greater than 40% with an absolute value at least 5 times the URL identifies a high-risk cohort with markedly higher 1-year mortality and MACE, independent of new ischemic symptoms or ECG changes. This supports using a higher delta threshold to define clinically relevant PMI in this population [^111hFFgx] [^112Ycof8].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that any post-PCI troponin rise is benign — let me reconsider: even modest post-PCI elevations in elective or ACS settings have been linked to worse outcomes in multiple analyses, though effect sizes vary and baseline troponin status strongly modifies interpretation. The safest approach is to treat a new, substantial delta as a red flag for adverse prognosis while corroborating with clinical, ECG, and angiographic evidence before labeling a type 4a MI [^1146S9qh] [^117A5XpR].

> I should confirm how guidelines operationalize this: contemporary ESC guidance anchors diagnosis and risk stratification in serial high-sensitivity troponin within 0/1–2 hour algorithms for NSTE-ACS, and for post-PCI attribution, the Fourth Universal Definition requires pre-PCI stability or decline plus a meaningful post-PCI rise. Practically, that means sampling pre-PCI, then again at 6–8 hours and 12–24 hours post-PCI to capture the true peak and to compute a valid delta, especially when baseline is elevated [^111QnpBh] [^1144Bv5h].

> Let me translate this into bedside management: if a post-PCI troponin rise meets or exceeds a 40% delta with an absolute value at least 5 times the URL, I should escalate surveillance, optimize antithrombotic therapy, evaluate for stent thrombosis or side-branch compromise with ECG and, if indicated, echocardiography or angiography, and consider advanced antiplatelet strategies or hemodynamic support. Conversely, small rises below this threshold in a patient with falling pre-PCI troponin are common and may not mandate action in isolation, though they still warrant careful review of the procedure and clinical course [^111hFFgx] [^112Ycof8].

> In summary, troponin can increase in the days after PCI for NSTEMI due to the natural evolution of the index infarction, reperfusion-related washout, true periprocedural myocardial injury from distal embolization or mechanical trauma, and occasionally non-ischemic drivers. Accurate interpretation hinges on serial pre- and post-PCI measurements, attention to timing of the peak, and application of validated delta thresholds, with a post-PCI relative increase greater than 40% plus an absolute value at least 5 times the URL identifying patients at highest risk and prompting intensified evaluation and therapy [^1144Bv5h] [^1125B3sE] [^111hFFgx].

Troponin may rise after PCI for NSTEMI due to **periprocedural myocardial injury** from distal embolization, microvascular obstruction, or ischemia-reperfusion injury [^113iY2TN] [^1144Bv5h]. Additional causes include **stent-related complications** (stent thrombosis, malapposition, or edge dissection), side-branch occlusion, or guidewire-related trauma [^notfound]. These injuries cause myocyte necrosis and troponin release, with **magnitude linked to worse outcomes** [^117A5XpR] [^1146S9qh]. Serial troponin monitoring and correlation with ECG, symptoms, and angiography are essential to distinguish expected minor rises from clinically significant injury or type 4a MI [^1144Bv5h] [^112CEKMb].

## Mechanisms of troponin elevation after PCI in NSTEMI

Several mechanisms can explain **post-PCI troponin elevation** in NSTEMI:

---

### Periprocedural myocardial injury (PMI)

- **Distal embolization**: Plaque or thrombus embolization can cause microinfarction and troponin release [^112zXMXa].

- **Microvascular obstruction**: Impaired microvascular flow from emboli or reperfusion injury leads to ischemia and necrosis [^notfound].

- **Ischemia-reperfusion injury**: Reperfusion can cause oxidative stress and inflammation, injuring myocytes and releasing troponin [^notfound].

---

### Procedural complications

- **Stent-related complications**: Stent thrombosis, malapposition, or edge dissection can cause ischemia and necrosis [^notfound].

- **Side-branch occlusion**: Occlusion of a side branch can cause ischemia and troponin release [^notfound].

- **Guidewire-related trauma**: Coronary perforation or dissection can cause ischemia and necrosis [^notfound].

---

### Patient-specific factors

Chronic kidney disease **reduces troponin clearance**, increasing levels, and a **high thrombus burden** increases embolic risk and PMI.

---

## Clinical significance of troponin elevation after PCI

Troponin elevation after PCI is **clinically significant** and associated with adverse outcomes:

- **Adverse outcomes**: PMI and type 4a MI are linked to higher mortality and MACE [^111hFFgx] [^112Ycof8].

- **Dose-response**: Higher post-PCI troponin correlates with higher mortality and MACE risk [^117A5XpR] [^111hFFgx].

- **Prognostic value**: Post-PCI troponin is an independent predictor of mortality and MACE [^117A5XpR] [^116jXcov].

---

## Diagnostic criteria for periprocedural myocardial infarction (type 4a MI)

The Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction provides **diagnostic criteria** for type 4a MI:

| **Criterion** | **Definition** |
|-|-|
| Biomarker rise | Post-PCI troponin rise > 20% from baseline with absolute value ≥ 5× 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) [^111hFFgx] |
| Clinical evidence | New ischemic symptoms, new significant ST-T changes, or new pathological Q waves [^notfound] |
| Imaging evidence | Loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality [^notfound] |

---

Recent data suggest that a **post-PCI troponin rise > 40%** with an absolute value ≥ 5× URL better identifies prognostically relevant PMI [^111hFFgx] [^112Ycof8].

---

## Timing and kinetics of troponin elevation after PCI

Troponin elevation after PCI typically peaks within **12–24 hours** and can persist for several days [^114NyGZH]. Peak timing varies with baseline troponin, procedural factors, and patient characteristics [^1125B3sE].

---

## Clinical management implications

Troponin elevation after PCI in NSTEMI **warrants careful evaluation**:

- **Serial monitoring**: Track troponin trends and correlate with ECG, symptoms, and angiography [^1144Bv5h].

- **Risk stratification**: Use troponin magnitude to guide further testing and therapy [^117A5XpR].

- **Preventive strategies**: Optimize antiplatelet therapy, procedural technique, and risk-factor control to limit PMI [^115FGiNh].

---

Troponin elevation after PCI in NSTEMI reflects periprocedural myocardial injury from embolization, microvascular obstruction, or procedural complications, with **magnitude linked to worse outcomes**. Serial monitoring and correlation with clinical and angiographic data are essential to guide management and risk stratification [^1144Bv5h].

### Prognostic relevance of type 4a myocardial infarction and periprocedural myocardial injury in patients with non-ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction [^1158ZUmG]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Non–ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is a common cardiac condition that contributes to a substantial portion of hospital admissions and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although NSTEMI incidence has been increasing over the years, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has significantly improved prognosis, reducing cardiovascular death and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), particularly in high-risk patients. – The availability of new techniques and advances in medical therapy have lowered the occurrence of thrombotic complications during and after PCI, resulting in improved procedural success rates and patient outcomes. Nonetheless, elevation of cardiac troponin (cTn) after PCI is still frequently observed, especially with the use of high-sensitivity troponin tests.

The definition and prognostic role of periprocedural myocardial injury (PMI) and type 4a MI are well established in patients with chronic coronary syndromes undergoing PCI with nonelevated baseline cTn levels. – Conversely, the incidence, interpretation, and prognostic relevance of PMI and type 4a MI, as currently defined by the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (UDMI), in patients with NSTEMI (thus with elevated baseline troponin) are still unknown, as stated in the recent consensus document of the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Cellular Biology of the Heart and the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions. Moreover, the post-PCI ΔcTn cutoff of 20% used to define type 4a MI and PMI after NSTEMI is based on consensus expert opinion, not supported by robust evidence. A standardized definition of periprocedural ischemic events based on scientific evidence, with prognostic relevance and applicable in clinical practice, is highly warranted.

This study aims to investigate (1) the incidence of PMI with and without type 4a MI in patients with NSTEMI undergoing PCI; (2) the prognostic relevance of these periprocedural ischemic events defined according to current consensus (post-PCI ΔcTn > 20% with an absolute postprocedural value of ≥ 5 times the 99th percentile upper reference limit [URL]); and (3) the best post-PCI cTn change threshold for prognostic stratification of patients with PMI.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to cardiac troponin, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain additional testing after 3 hours if the first two high-sensitivity cardiac troponin measurements of the 0 hour/1 hour algorithm are inconclusive and no alternative diagnoses explaining the condition have been made.

Acute coronary syndromes — revascularization strategy in multivessel disease highlights evidence gaps: in patients with non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), the role of multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus culprit-only PCI needs further supportive data, and whether multivessel PCI should be guided by angiography or physiology is still a matter of debate; it also clarifies that recommendations for PCI of nonculprit arteries in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are for patients who are not intended for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and that the optimal strategy for those with more complex anatomy is less clear.

### Timing of peak troponin T and creatine kinase-MB elevations after percutaneous coronary intervention [^1125B3sE]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The prognostic significance of elevations in creatine kinase-MB and troponin T (cTnT), which have been conventionally measured 6 to 8 h after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), has been established. However, the time to peak biomarker appearance in the circulation has not been defined and is the purpose of this pilot study.

Design

Nonrandomized, nonconsecutive patient cohort.

Setting

Clinical practice, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.

Patients

Cohort (n = 57) undergoing elective PCI.

Interventions

cTnT and creatine kinase (CK)-MB measured at baseline, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, and ≥ 2 h (mean ± SEM, 18 ± 5 h) after PCI.

Measurements and Results

Postprocedure cTnT elevations were detected in 30 of 57 patients (53%). Of these, 4 of 30 patients (13%) had peak cTnT at 4 h (0.80 ± 0.40 ng/mL), 5 of 30 patients (17%) had peak cTnT at 8 h (1.07 ± 0.48 ng/mL), and 21 of 30 patients (70%) had peak cTnT at ≥ 12 h (0.21 ± 0.06 ng/mL); 22 of 30 patients received abciximab. Elevations in CK-MB occurred in 14 of 57 patients (25%). Of these, 3 of 14 patients (21%) demonstrated peak CK-MB at 2 h (18.5 ± 7.9 ng/mL) and the remainder (11 of 14 patients, 79%) during the 12- to 20-h interval (20.2 ± 4.4 ng/mL); 12 of 14 patients received abciximab.

Conclusion

More cTnT than CK-MB elevations occur after PCI; however, both biomarkers demonstrate a longer time to peak value than anticipated in clinical practice. Early surveillance monitoring (< 12 h) does not detect peak biomarker levels, especially in patients with normal baseline values. If peak levels are to be used to determine prognosis, then longer time intervals should be used for post-PCI surveillance. The timing of peak elevations appears to be influenced by baselines values as well. Early elevations may reflect the conjoint effects of injury associated with the disease process and the intervention itself. These data suggest that a re-evaluation of surveillance monitoring to account for the variability reported and the influence of baseline elevations of biomarkers may improve the prognostic power of the measurements.

Early discharge after myocardial infarction — among low-risk ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), an early discharge strategy of < 3 days from admission is not associated with increased mortality; the Zwolle score has been recommended as a clinical tool to help identify low-risk patients (score ≤ 3) who can potentially be discharged earlier (48 to 72 hours). Small retrospective studies suggest safety of very early or same-day discharge after PCI for acute coronary syndromes (ACS), with most (71%) of same-day discharge being troponin-negative, and patients considered for early discharge should be clinically stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia, acute kidney injury, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, heart failure (HF), and procedural complications and with adequate postdischarge support; hospitals and care providers should ensure access to postdischarge prescription medications and adequate follow-up.

### Interpreting troponin elevations: do we need multiple diagnoses? [^114RT5Ut]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

In keeping with this reasoning, interventional cardiologists have opted to use the less sensitive CK-MB to define MI post-PCI. They define an MI as a complication of PCI when CK-MB increases three or more times normal. The task force has recommended (by arbitrary convention) that PCI-related MI (TYPE 4a) be defined by a biomarker elevation greater than three times its 99th URL, assuming a normal baseline value going into the procedure. They do not say which biomarker need be used to meet these criteria.

In either the case of PCI or CABG, the important differentiation is to distinguish an event severe enough to be considered as a complication, from relatively minor (expected) injury related to the procedure. If criteria appropriate for the clinical setting do not qualify for diagnosing MI, small abnormalities in cardiac biomarkers can be ignored. However, if criteria for MI are exceeded it could simply be termed 'PCI complicated by MI, or 'CABG complicated by MI' without the need for using specific subtype letters or numbers. If the problems of diagnosing patients who have suffered sudden death are considered a separate issue, this would greatly simplify incorporation of the new diagnostic scheme into ICD-9 codes.

The preferred terminology may require further debate, but the new scheme for the definition of MI provides an improved framework for assessing and documenting coronary ischaemia/infarct. No matter how the ICD-9 codes evolve, it makes clinical sense to clearly differentiate between troponin elevations that are chronic, vs. transient elevations associated with acute coronary events, vs. transient elevations associated with other myocardial stresses.

Making these distinctions clear may also help in our quest for ever improving therapy. Troponin elevations are quite common in intensive care unit patients such as the one presented above. –, The in-hospital complication rates for patients hospitalized for ACS are high, and patients who suffer acute MI during hospitalization for other problems differ substantially in their clinical course and outcomes compared with those who present initially with an acute coronary syndrome. The ACC/AHA guidelines for the management of patients with unstable angina/non-ST-elevation MIpromote an aggressive approach for treatment of non-ST elevation MI, but no recommendations are made for assessment and treatment of TYPE2 MI. This leaves the optimal treatment strategy for such patients quite uncertain. By providing a specific new diagnosis, it may be possible to encourage further research on how best to manage these patients, and perhaps help determine whether a troponin level should be measured in the first place.

### Relationship between troponin on presentation and in-hospital mortality in patients with ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention [^1118RjCc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Troponin release in ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction has predictable kinetics with early levels reflective of ischemia duration. Little research has examined the value of admission troponin levels inpatients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. We investigated the relationship between troponin on presentation and mortality in a large, real‐world cohort ofpatients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention.

Methods and Results

We used multivariable adaptive regression modeling to examine the association between admission troponin levels and in‐hospital mortality for patients who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention for. We adjusted for known clinical risk factors using a validated mortality risk model derived from the NCDR (National Cardiovascular Data Registry) CathPCI database, and this same model was used to calculate patients' predicted mortality based on clinical and demographic factors. Patients were then stratified by troponin groups to compare predicted versus observed mortality. Of the 14 061 patients included in the cohort, 47.2% had initial troponin levels that were undetectable or within the reference range. Admission troponin was an independent predictor of in‐hospital mortality, and any value above the reference range was associated with increased mortality (1.8% versus 5.1%, [standardized difference, 18.2%]). Patients with the highest predicted risk for mortality (13% predicted) in the highest admission troponin grouping experienced an observed mortality of 19.5%. Patients in low troponin groupings consistently demonstrated lower than predicted mortality based on their clinical and demographic risk profile.

Conclusions

Nearly half of patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention had normal troponin on presentation and had a relatively good outcome. Mortality increases with elevated admission troponin levels, regardless of baseline clinical risk. The substantial number of patients who present with markedly elevated troponin and their relatively worse outcomes highlights the need for continued improvement in prehospitaldetection and care.

### Implications of lowering threshold of plasma troponin concentration in diagnosis of myocardial infarction: cohort study [^114N4oJu]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Management during index admission

Rates of referral to cardiology and for coronary revascularisation did not differ between patients with troponin concentrations < 0.012 µg/L and 0.012–0.049 µg/L. Compared with those with troponin concentrations ≥ 0.050 µg/L, patients with troponin concentrations of 0.012–0.049 µg/L were less likely to be diagnosed with unstable angina or an acute coronary syndrome (98/352 (28%) v 692/752 (92%)), referred to a cardiologist (129/352 (37%) v 642/752 (85%)), receive dual antiplatelet treatment (46/352 (13%) v 550/752 (73%)), or undergo coronary revascularisation (16/352 (5%) v 394/752 (52%)) (P < 0.001 for all) (table 2).

* Variables analysed with χ² test with post hoc Fisher's exact testing between individual groups with significance set at P < 0.0167 to account for multiple comparisons.

Clinical outcomes

Patients were followed up for a median of 446 (range 366–572) days. At 12 months, patients with troponin concentrations of 0.012–0.049 µg/L were four times more likely to have died or been readmitted with recurrent myocardial infarction than those with troponin concentrations < 0.012 µg/L (47/352 (13%) v 31/988 (3%), P < 0.001, odds ratio 4.7, 95% confidence interval 2.9 to 7.9; table 3and fig 1). Differences in outcome were already apparent at three months, with 19/352 (5%) patients with troponin concentration 0.012–0.049 µg/L dead or readmitted with a myocardial infarction compared with 13/988 (1%) of patients with troponin concentration < 0.012 µg/L (P < 0.001, odds ratio 4.6, 2.5 to 8.5).

Acute coronary syndromes — early discharge and risk stratification after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are characterized as follows: available data suggest that an early discharge strategy of < 3 days from admission is not associated with increased mortality for low-risk patients after STEMI who have undergone PCI; the Zwolle score has been recommended to identify low-risk patients after primary PCI (PPCI) in STEMI, with low-risk patients, score ≤ 3, who can potentially be discharged earlier from the hospital (48 to 72 hours); small retrospective studies have suggested safety of very early or same-day discharge after PCI for patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), with most (71%) of same-day discharge being troponin-negative; patients being considered for early discharge should be clinically stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia, acute kidney injury, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, heart failure (HF), and procedural complications and with adequate postdischarge support, and hospitals and care providers should ensure access to postdischarge prescription medications and adequate follow-up.

### Consideration of a new definition of clinically relevant myocardial infarction after coronary revascularization: an expert consensus document from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) [^111uz3AN]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Patients with elevated baseline cardiac biomarkers — post‑PCI MI diagnosis requires serial measurements and depends on biomarker trends; when cTn or CK‑MB levels are stable or falling, there should be a new CK‑MB elevation by an absolute increment of ≥ 10× ULN or ≥ 70× ULN for cTn I or T from the previous nadir level, and when biomarker levels have not been shown to be stable or falling, there should be a further rise beyond the most recently measured value by an absolute increment of ≥ 10× ULN in CK‑MB or ≥ 70× ULN in cTn plus new ST‑segment elevation or other signs or symptoms consistent with a clinically relevant MI, such as new onset or worsening heart failure or sustained hypotension; chest pain alone is not specific enough for substantial myonecrosis to be used as a criterion.

### Elevations in troponin I after percutaneous coronary interventions are associated with abnormal tissue-level perfusion in high-risk patients with non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndromes [^113iY2TN]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Background

In the setting of non-ST-segment-elevation (NSTE) acute coronary syndromes (ACS), the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) cardiac troponin I (cTnI) elevation remain unclear.

Methods and Results

We evaluated the relationship between troponin elevation and tissue-level perfusion using the TIMI flow grade, corrected TIMI frame count, TIMI myocardial perfusion grade (TMPG), and myocardial contrast enhancement by intracoronary myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) before and immediately after PCI performed within 24 to 48 hours of hospital admission in 42 high-risk (angina at rest, unequivocal ST-segment depression, and cTnI elevation) patients with NSTE-ACS. All patients were treated with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (27 with tirofiban and 15 with abciximab) and had successful PCI. Fourteen patients had a postprocedural cTnI elevation, whereas 28 did not. TMPG 0/1 after PCI was observed more frequently in patients with postprocedural cTnI elevation (43% versus 7%; P < 0.02). cTnI levels were higher among patients with TMPG 0/1 versus patients with TMPG 2/3 (5.3 ± 2.7 versus 1.5 ± 1.3 ng/mL; P < 0.0001). Patients with postprocedural cTnI elevation also presented a significantly lower number of perfused segments at MCE (59% versus 81%; P = 0.02) as well as a lower MCE score index (0.65 ± 0.38 versus 0.89 ± 0.21; P < 0.02).

Conclusions

Postprocedural cTnI elevation in high-risk patients with NSTE-ACS is associated with an abnormal tissue-level perfusion.

### Troponin level at presentation as a prognostic factor among patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^112Z15DM]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Timely reperfusion within 120min is strongly recommended in patients presenting with non-ST-segment myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with very high-risk features. Evidence regarding the use of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) concentration upon admission for the risk-stratification of patients presenting with NSTEMI to expedite percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and thus potentially improve outcomes is limited.

Methods

All patients admitted to a tertiary care center ICCU between July 2019 and July 2022 were included. Hs-cTnI levels on presentaion were recorded, dividing patients into quartiles based on baseline hs-cTnI. Association between initial hs-cTnI and all-cause mortality during up to 3 years of follow-up was studied.

Results

A total of 544 NSTEMI patients with a median age of 67 were included. Hs-cTnI levels in each quartile were: (a) ≤ 122, (b) 123–680, (c) 681–2877, and (d) ≥ 2878ng/L. There was no difference between the initial hs-cTnI level groups regarding age and comorbidities. A higher mortality rate was observed in the highest hs-cTnI quartile as compared with the lowest hs-cTnI quartile (16.2% vs. 7.35%, p = .03) with hazard ratio (HR) for mortality of 2.6 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23–5.4; p = .012) in the unadjusted model, and HR of 2.06 (95% CI: 1.01–4.79; p = .047) with adjustment for age, gender, serum creatinine, and significant comorbidities.

Conclusions

Patients with NSTEMI and higher hs-cTnI levels upon admission faced elevated mortality risk. This underscores the need for further prospective investigations into early reperfusion strategies' impact on NSTEMI patients' mortality, based on admission troponin elevation.

Same-day discharge after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — scope and assumptions state the pathway applies to elective PCI and excludes acute myocardial infarction presentations: "This ECDP on SDD after PCI is applicable to anyone presenting for an elective PCI but is not applicable to patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)", and "Patients with presentations of STEMI or NSTEMI should be hospitalized ≥ 1 night in the inpatient setting for postprocedural monitoring based on presentation and clinical features, as well as procedure-related considerations". The tool is also "applicable to staged procedures performed after the index PCI procedure for patients who initially presented with NSTEMI or STEMI", including those who "undergo a staged PCI during the index hospitalization for NSTEMI or STEMI, or patients who are discharged home and return for a planned staged PCI". The focus is adult care — "The focus of this ECDP is the role of SDD in an adult population undergoing elective PCI. The pathway does not address the role of SDD in a pediatric population" — and it specifies processes that "should be implemented for successful SDD", including confirmation of a "P2Y12 inhibitor (P2Y12i) prescription", access-site monitoring instructions, and outpatient follow-up, with adaptation to institutional protocols and the checklist format "adapted to fit the needs and processes of individual institutions".

### Relationship between peak troponin values and long-term ischemic events among medically managed patients with acute coronary syndromes [^116yLWTh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The relationship between troponin level and outcomes among patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS is established, but the relationship of troponin level with long-term outcomes among medically managed non-ST-segment elevation ACS patients receiving contemporary antiplatelet therapy is inadequately defined.

Methods and Results

In 6763 medically managed non-ST-segment elevation ACS patients randomized in TRILOGY ACS (Targeted Platelet Inhibition to Clarify the Optimal Strategy to Medically Manage Acute Coronary Syndromes) (prasugrel versus clopidogrel), we examined relationships between categories of peak troponin/upper limit of normal (ULN) ratio within 48 hours of the index ACS event (≈4.5 days before randomization) and 30-month outcomes (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke; cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction; and all-cause death). Patients with peak troponin levels < 1×ULN were younger, were more often women, and had lower GRACE risk scores than those in other troponin groups. Those with ratios ≥ 5×ULN were more frequently smokers but less often had prior myocardial infarction or percutaneous coronary intervention. Diabetes mellitus prevalence, body mass index, serum creatinine, and hemoglobin were similar across groups. For all end points, statistically significant differences in 30-month event rates were observed between peak troponin categories. The relationship was linear for 30-month mortality (< 1×ULN, n = 1849 [6.2%]; 1 to < 3×ULN, n = 1203 [9.6%]; 3 to < 5×ULN, n = 581 [10.8%]; and ≥ 5×ULN, n = 3405 [12.8%]) but plateaued for composite end points beyond peak troponin values ≥ 3×ULN. There was no statistically significant heterogeneity in treatment effect by peak troponin ratio for any end point.

Conclusions

Among medically managed non-ST-segment elevation ACS patients selected for medical management, there was a graded relationship between increasing peak troponin and long-term ischemic events but no heterogeneity of treatment effect for prasugrel versus clopidogrel according to peak troponin.

### Prognostic relevance of type 4a myocardial infarction and periprocedural myocardial injury in patients with non-ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction [^114jcGFd]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Optimizing PMI Diagnosis

In our study, a post-PCI ΔcTnI increase of > 40% was identified as the optimal threshold for diagnosing prognostically relevant PMI. Notably, redefining PMI using this threshold, even when combined with an absolute postprocedural cTnI value ≥ 5 times the 99th percentile URL, was associated with a 4-fold increase in the risk of 1-year all-cause mortality, regardless of the presence of new myocardial ischemia (electrocardiographic, imaging, and angiographic criteria). In contrast, a post-PCI ΔcTnI between 20% and 40% was associated with the same 1-year all-cause mortality and MACE risk as in patients without PMI (post-PCI ΔcTnI ≤ 20%). This finding could be attributed to a higher rate of false-positive identifications, including patients with mild cTn elevations but without clinically significant myocardial injury. Consequently, including patients with minor cTn elevations, up to a post-PCI change of 40%, in the PMI category could attenuate the association between myocardial injury and adverse outcomes, ultimately reducing its prognostic significance. Furthermore, patients with NSTEMI often have comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease, heart failure, or advanced age, which could account for increases in post-PCI cTn values without necessarily indicating new myocardial injury. However, this variability did not affect outcomes; the HRs for adverse events at 1 year were adjusted for the major known predictors of outcome in patients with NSTEMI.

### Relationship between risk stratification by cardiac troponin level and adherence to guidelines for non-ST-Segment elevation acute coronary syndromes… [^112zXMXa]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

We evaluated troponin levels obtained within 24 hours of hospital presentation in patients from the CRUSADE quality improvement initiative19 to characterize the relationship between the degree of troponin elevation and adherence to the ACC/AHA NSTE ACS guidelines and to investigate how the degree of troponin elevation relates to adverse clinical outcomes in routine clinical practice. Patients who transferred from another institution were included if they arrived at the institution participating in CRUSADE within 24 hours of their latest episode of ischemic symptoms.

For patients in whom the highest recorded troponin level occurred more than 24 hours after hospital presentation, the baseline troponin value was used to determine the maximum troponin ratio because maximum troponin results would not have been available to the treating physician during the early care period. Furthermore, our group showed in a separate analysis20 that maximum troponin values were recorded within 20 hours of hospitalization in more than 90% of patients from the CRUSADE population with elevated troponin levels. Of 19 273 patients with elevated troponin levels, 4025 underwent PCI within 24 hours of presentation. Of these 4025 patients, the maximum troponin level recorded within 24 hours was after the time of PCI in 1934 patients.

In contrast, we demonstrated a continuous relationship between the degree of troponin elevation in the first 24 hours and in-hospital mortality rates in a large, diverse cohort of patients with NSTE ACSs from routine practice who commonly had elevated troponin levels identified using local laboratory troponin assays. Because patients with elevated troponin levels are more likely to have intracoronary thrombus and left ventricular dysfunction than patients without troponin elevations, the degree of troponin elevation may relate to mortality risk by reflecting the degree of distal thrombus embolization and subsequent infarct size and left ventricular dysfunction in patients with NSTE ACSs. 12, 13, 25, 26 Nonetheless, the results of this study confirm the findings of previous studies1, 2, 5 that demonstrated that any degree of troponin elevation above prespecified thresholds identifies patients with a higher risk of mortality.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T as a predictor of acute total occlusion in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome [^116sWtgd]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) account for a large percentage of the cardiovascular disease burden and their early diagnosis and risk stratification is an emerging area of interest. 1, 2, 3, 4 ACS refers to a spectrum of clinical presentations that include ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non‐ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and unstable angina. NSTEMI is currently the most frequent manifestation of ACS and represents the largest group of patients to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Despite advances in medical and interventional treatments, the morbidity and mortality of NSTEMI patients remains high. 5 Early invasive strategy with PCI has shown better clinical and angiographic outcomes in high risk patients with NSTEMI than conservative management or late PCI. 6 In this respect, there is a large percentage of patients with total occlusion (TO) of the culprit artery, diagnosed angiographically, presenting with NSTEMI. 7, 8 Recent findings suggest that NSTEMI patients with TO of the culprit artery are at an increased risk of all‐cause mortality and major adverse cardiac events. 9, 10 It is difficult to predict TO of the culprit artery in NSTEMI patients due to the lack of classic electrocardiograms (ECG) findings. Attempts have been made to find a marker that reliably predicts the presence of TO in patients with non‐ST‐segment acute coronary syndrome (NSTE‐ACS) — though without success. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs‐cTnT) to predict acute TO of a coronary artery in patients presenting with NSTE‐ACS.

### Baseline troponin level: key to understanding the importance of post-PCI troponin elevations [^112LA9Vi]. European Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Aims

The adverse prognostic significance of biomarker elevations after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is well established. However, often baseline troponin values are not included in the analysis or sensitive criteria are not employed. Accordingly, we assessed the timing and magnitude of post-PCI troponin T (cTnT) levels and their relationships to outcomes in patients with and without pre-PCI baseline cTnT elevations using a sensitive assay and sensitive cut-off values.

Methods and Results

cTnT was measured at baseline (pre-PCI), 8 and 16 h post-PCI in 2352 patients. A cTnT elevation was defined as ≥ 0.03 ng/mL. No baseline cTnT elevations were detected in 1619 patients undergoing mostly (97%) non-urgent procedures (cTnT = 0.01 ± 0.002 ng/mL; mean ± SD). 733 patients had baseline cTnT elevations. Only the baseline troponin value had prognostic importance. Patients with elevated cTnT baseline levels had a higher overall cumulative 12-month death/MI rate of 11.1% compared with those without elevated baseline levels of 4.7% (P < 0.05). Neither the timing nor the magnitude of the post-procedure cTnT elevations was predictive of long-term death/MI rates when baseline elevations were included in the analysis. Similar findings were observed for baseline creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) levels. Late increases in cTnT levels (16 h post-PCI) presaged in-hospital events only.

Conclusion

Long-term prognosis is most often related to the baseline pre-PCI troponin value and not the biomarker response to the PCI. These results support a re-evaluation of the use of biomarker data in relation to PCI.

### Cardiac troponin T reporting, clinical outcomes, and health care resource use… [^116DLyUy]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The probability of presentation within the unmasked hs-cTnT reporting period was estimated using a logistic regression model that included age, sex, presentation to each metropolitan hospital, maximum observed troponin concentration within 24 hours, prior MI, prior percutaneous coronary intervention, prior coronary artery bypass graft, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, history of heart failure, white blood cell count, platelet count, and hemoglobin on presentation. The baseline characteristics of the final study population are summarized in Table 1. Compared with patients in the conventional troponin reporting group, patients in the unmasked hs-cTnT group were less likely to have a history of hypertension and tobacco smoking but more likely to have a history of MI and previous PCI procedure.

Following the introduction of unmasked hs-cTnT reporting, the median number of troponin tests ordered per patient increased as did the proportion of patients who received 2 or more troponin measurements within 24 hours of their presentation. However, patients in the unmasked hs-cTnT reporting group had a higher risk of subsequent type 2 MI or acute myocardial injury. This increased risk remained when the analysis was limited to patients who had a peak troponin level of less than 30 ng/L during the index presentation.

In this cohort study of South Australian patients presenting to the ED and who had at least 1 troponin test, reporting hs-cTnT results to the lowest quantifiable level was not associated with an increase in the frequency of MI diagnosis or invasive coronary procedures. Despite concerns regarding hs-cTn assays and increased resource use, our observation that unmasked hs-cTnT reporting was associated with shorter LOS and higher ED discharge rates suggests a benefit in health care resource use.

### Prognostic relevance of type 4a myocardial infarction and periprocedural myocardial injury in patients with non-ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction [^112Ycof8]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Limitations

Our findings should be interpreted considering some limitations. First, 1-year follow-up may be considered relatively short to assess clinical outcomes; a longer follow-up might provide further insights into long-term outcomes and confirm the observed associations. Moreover, 2 different cTnI assays (conventional cTnI and hs-cTnI) were used during the study period. However, because each patient was consistently assessed with the same assay over time, the analysis of ΔcTnI variation does not appear to be influenced by the type of cTnI assay used. Indeed, in our study, the post-PCI ΔcTnI values of patients analyzed with conventional cTnI are similar to those of patients analyzed with hs-cTnI. Furthermore, there was no change in the frequency of PMI with or without type 4a MI between the period of conventional cTnI assay and hs-cTnI assay. Finally, our results were validated only in an additional cohort of patients from the same sites; external validation is needed to confirm our findings.

Conclusions

PMI with and PMI without type 4a MI, as defined by the Fourth UDMI criteria, are 2 common PCI-related complications in patients with NSTEMI, with type 4a MI being associated with worse outcomes. We identified a post-PCI change in troponin threshold > 40%, combined with an absolute postprocedural value of ≥ 5 times the 99th percentile URL, as the optimal criterion for diagnosing prognostically relevant PMI. This threshold was strongly linked to increased mortality and MACE, independent of the presence of new myocardial ischemia. These findings may improve risk stratification, guide more tailored management strategies, and ultimately enhance outcomes for patients with NSTEMI undergoing PCI.

### Varying definitions for periprocedural myocardial infarction alter event rates and prognostic implications [^114upza3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Study Population

All patients undergoing PCI at the cardiac catheterization laboratories of Liverpool Hospital (Sydney, Australia) have clinical, angiographic, and procedural data recorded prospectively in cardiology and laboratory databases. These data include procedural indications, patient demographics, medications, angiographic and lesion characteristics, and stent types (drug‐eluting stent [DES] or bare‐metal stent). The current study includes patients undergoing PCI for stable coronary heart disease (CHD), unstable angina, and non‐ST‐segment elevation MI (NSTEMI) from October 1, 2003 to September 2010, who had qualifying cardiac biomarkers measurements before and after PCI. These included normal preprocedural TnT levels, or when pre‐PCI TnT levels were elevated, and 2 stable or falling levels 6 hours apart. Exclusion criteria included ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), missing pre‐ and/or post‐PCI TnT results, post‐PCI TnT and/or CKMB measurements > 48 hours, or elevated pre‐PCI TnT levels within 72 hours that were not stabilized or falling (Figure 1). Post‐PCI outcomes are routinely assessed for quality assurance (project QA2008/034, approved by the Liverpool Hospital Ethics Committee).

Figure 1.

### Troponin level at presentation as a prognostic factor among patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^113Lfp78]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

Despite the prognostic implications of troponin levels in ACS, current guidelines for urgent revascularization in NSTEMI patients do not incorporate this biomarker in their decision‐making process regarding treatment. In our study, we have demonstrated an association between hs‐cTnI levels upon admission and overall survival in patients diagnosed with NSTEMI. Furthermore, we identified a subgroup that is at a heightened risk of mortality according to their initial hs‐cTnI level. Interestingly, this association becomes less significant when early reperfusion strategy is considered. These findings may suggest that initial hs‐cTnI levels could be an additional factor when determining reperfusion strategies in NSTEMI patients. Further prospective studies are warranted to investigate the impact of early reperfusion strategies on mortality in NSTEMI patients categorized by their initial presenting troponin levels.

### Breaking the code: what is the best post-PCI MI definition? [^117P42Qd]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

Various definitions of post-PCI MI have been recommended by different professional societies and studies. This present study suggests that the troponin-based 3rd universal definition of post-PCI MI has prognostic value for recurrent MI but not mortality alone, unlike the CK-MB based SCAI definition. Absent a consensus on the best definition, clinical trials should report outcomes based on multiple definitions of post-PCI MI.

### Role of endothelin in microvascular dysfunction following percutaneous coronary intervention for non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes: a single-centre randomised controlled trial [^112tLFb1]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Plasma ET-1 levels are known to rise acutely following an MI. The highest ET-1 expression in atherosclerotic arteries occurs in active plaques and in response to mechanical stretch during PCI.ET-1 levels peak at ∼1 hour post-PCI, and we hypothesise that vascular injury is likely to occur in this time window. Adjunctive ET A antagonism during PCI likely diminishes vasoconstriction, by inhibiting the direct and indirect (via augmenting angiotensin II, norepinephrine and serotonin) effects of ET-1.

Endothelin antagonists have been approved for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension and have been investigated in heart failure. BQ-123 is a peptide consisting of five amino acids. Several clinical studies in coronary and peripheral circulation with BQ-123 have been published. Dosing of BQ-123 in the present study was based on the observation that in patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries and in those with mild coronary atherosclerosis, intracoronary infusion of BQ-123, at doses ranging from 40 to 300 nmol/min, dilates the epicardial and microvessels and improves endothelial dysfunction. Our work extends the findings of Adlbrecht et al, who randomly assigned patients to receive intravenous BQ-123 at 400 nmol/min or placebo over 60 min, starting at the onset of primary PCI for ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Improved microvascular function was detected in the BQ-123 group using cardiac MRI at 6 days after PCI. This was associated with smaller enzymatic infarct sizes. Also, at 6 months, left ventricular ejection fraction was noted to be significantly higher in the BQ-123 group compared to the placebo group (63% (58–69) vs 59% (51–66); p = 0.047).

Elevations in cardiac biomarkers in NSTACS identify patients with severe and complex coronary lesions and a greater thrombus burden. However, more recent investigations in NSTACS patients have demonstrated that elevations in cardiac biomarkers are also a marker of impaired myocardial perfusion. Accordingly, in the present study, the fact that improved parameters of CBF with BQ-123 were associated with a diminished increase of CK-MB and troponin following PCI suggests that the augmented microvascular perfusion is likely to lead to clinically meaningful benefits. Our findings mirror those of Adlbrecht et al who reported smaller infarct sizes in STEMI patients treated with BQ-123 during primary PCI.

Studies have previously reported that in patients undergoing PCI, elevated cardiac biomarkers are associated with higher subsequent coronary events and mortality. Furthermore, the risk of adverse outcomes increases with any level of rise in cardiac enzymes.

### Prognostic relevance of type 4a myocardial infarction and periprocedural myocardial injury in patients with non-ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction [^114VzoVy]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Periprocedural myocardial injury (PMI) with or without type 4a myocardial infarction (MI) might occur in patients with non-ST-segment-elevation MI (NSTEMI) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This study investigated the incidence and prognostic relevance of these events, according to current definitions, in patients with NSTEMI undergoing PCI. The best cardiac troponin I (cTnI) threshold of PMI for prognostic stratification is also suggested.

Methods

Consecutive patients with NSTEMI from January 2017 to April 2022 undergoing PCI with stable or falling pre-PCI cTnI levels were enrolled. According to the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction, the study population was stratified into those experiencing (1) PMI with type 4a MI, (2) PMI without type 4a MI, or (3) no PMI. Post-PCI cTnI increase > 20% with an absolute postprocedural value of ≥ 5 times the 99th percentile upper reference limit within 48 hours after PCI was used to define PMI. The primary end point was 1-year all-cause mortality, and the secondary end point consisted of major adverse cardiovascular events at 1 year, including all-cause mortality, nonfatal reinfarction, urgent revascularization, nonfatal ischemic stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure. Internal validation was performed in patients enrolled between May 2022 and April 2023.

Results

Among 1412 patients with NSTEMI undergoing PCI with stable or falling cTnI levels at baseline, 240 (17%) experienced PMI with type 4a MI, 288 (20.4%) experienced PMI without type 4a MI, and 884 (62.6%) experienced no PMI. PMI was associated with an increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes, with patients with type 4a MI demonstrating the highest rates of 1-year all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events. A post-PCI ΔcTnI > 20% but ≤ 40% showed similar outcomes to patients without PMI, whereas > 40% was identified as the optimal threshold for prognostically relevant PMI, confirmed in an internal validation cohort of 305 patients.

Conclusions

Periprocedural ischemic events were frequent in patients with NSTEMI undergoing PCI with prognostic implications. A post-PCI ΔcTnI > 40%, combined with an absolute postprocedural value of ≥ 5 times the 99th percentile upper reference limit, was identified as the optimal threshold for diagnosing prognostically relevant PMI. Recognizing these events may improve risk stratification and management of patients with NSTEMI.

Exposure and Outcome

Exposure was defined as treatment with PCI, and the reference was defined as no PCI treatment. Conservative treatment was defined as guideline‐recommended medical management of NSTEMI, except for PCI. Primary outcome was all‐cause mortality, whereas secondary outcomes were bleeding and new myocardial infarction in hospital after the admission date for NSTEMI. Bleeding was defined as major when there was > 50 g/dL decrease of hemoglobin or intracranial bleeding leading to death, whereas bleeding was defined as minor when there was > 30 g/dL decrease of hemoglobin or bleeding requiring transfusion. 12, 13 New myocardial infarction or reinfarction was defined as new troponin increase of a minimum of > 100% of reference level during admission or > 50% increase of the previous maximum documented troponin level.

Follow‐Up

Follow‐up started at the admission date, and ended when the patient died or at the end of follow‐up, which was March 10, 2016, whichever came first.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of emergency department patients with suspected Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes [^1127fQxG]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) — evidence on the immediacy of nonaspirin antiplatelet administration is limited because few studies isolate a single agent and most included aspirin and heparin; although 3 Class I studies 99–101 were included, a recommendation higher than level C was not made because none directly addressed immediacy, and as for the 2 Class II studies,102,103 neither showed a benefit from early intervention. Drug selection and route often hinges on the need for urgent cardiac catheterization and the potential for emergency cardiac bypass; it is not always apparent whether a diagnosed NSTEMI patient will proceed to catheterization, and the decision about selection and timing should be made in collaboration with local cardiovascular specialists. Future research focusing on nonaspirin antiplatelet agents in highest-risk NSTEMI — patients with ongoing chest pain, significant ischemic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, or candidates for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — may help identify a subset in whom immediate administration in the emergency department (ED) improves patient-important outcomes. Disclosure notes state there were no relevant industry relationships disclosed by the subcommittee members for this topic.

Non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) — risk stratification and diagnostics: Women with NSTE-ACS are more likely to present without typical symptoms and may have up to 50% higher in-hospital and long-term mortality after a non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI); in a patient-level meta-analysis, benefits of an early invasive strategy were limited to a Global Registry of Acute Events (GRACE) risk score > 140 (relative risk [RR] for death 0.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52–0.95) and to biomarker-positive patients (RR for death 0.76, 95% CI 0.58–1.00) independent of sex, and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays with sex-specific thresholds increased acute MI detection by 11.5% in women and 8.9% in men compared with standard assays.

### Isolated troponin increase after percutaneous coronary interventions: does it have prognostic relevance? [^111Fv6Zd]. Atherosclerosis (2012). Low credibility.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is often "associated" with myocardial injury. This event has been considered in the past as an acceptable trade-off for an optimal stent deployment. More recently, in the Universal Definition of myocardial infarction (MI), an increase of either cardiac troponins or creatine kinase-MB > 3 times the upper reference limit (URL) has been defined as MI. Although there is no doubt on the accuracy of cardiac troponins in the diagnosis of spontaneous MI, existing data do not support the hypothesis that an isolated elevation of cardiac troponins over such threshold is associated with an adverse prognosis after PCI.

### Relationship between troponin on presentation and in-hospital mortality in patients with ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention [^117Mw5V2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Troponin levels on presentation provide prognostic value for STEMI patients treated with primary PCI, and mortality increases with increasing admission troponin levels, regardless of baseline clinical risk. A low or undetectable troponin level on presentation, an objective measure of a shorter prehospital ischemic time, was present in nearly half of our patients and portends a good prognosis. The substantial number of patients who present with markedly elevated troponins in the setting of an acute infarction, and their relatively worse outcomes, highlights the continued need for improvement in prehospital STEMI detection and care.

### Prognostic role of cardiac troponin I after percutaneous coronary intervention in stable coronary disease [^112KYsPZ]. Heart (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the role of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in predicting outcome after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Methods and Results

cTnI was measured immediately before and at 6, 14, and 24 hours after PCI in 316 consecutive patients with stable symptoms and native coronary artery disease. The study end point was the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 30 days and at 18 months after PCI: death, Q wave myocardial infarction (MI), or repeat revascularisation in hospital. Postprocedural cTnI increased in 31% of patients. The cumulative MACE rate at 18 months was 25% (17.7% due to repeat PCI procedures). There was a significant association between postprocedural cTnI increase and death, Q wave MI, or both (odds ratio (OR) 3.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7 to 6.4, p = 0.01). Post-PCI cTnI increase had a positive predictive value (PPV) for adverse events at 18 months of 0.47 and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.96 (OR 18.9, 95% CI 9.7 to 37, p < 0.0001). The presence of both a postprocedural cTnI rise and a procedural angiographic complication gave a PPV for adverse events of 0.69 and an NPV of 0.92 (OR 22.6, 95% CI 2.6 to 68.6, p = 0.0005).

Conclusions

cTnI increased post-procedurally in one third of this stable patient population undergoing elective PCI and was independently and significantly predictive of an increased risk of adverse events at 18 months, predominantly in the form of repeat PCI.

### Relationship between peak troponin values and long-term ischemic events among medically managed patients with acute coronary syndromes [^1169e9Ww]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

This secondary analysis of TRILOGY ACS demonstrates a novel correlation between troponin elevation and prognosis in a study sample selected for medical management of NSTE ACS. One of the strengths of our analysis is that it used data collected as part of a large, multinational, randomized trial, which enhances data consistency and eliminates bias in the assessment of overall treatment effects. Because of the large number of subjects, the results are statistically robust. However, because these results are drawn from a patient population selected for a randomized clinical trial, they may not be generalizable to the broader population of medically managed patients in general practice. Troponin values used for our analysis were collected up to 48 hours after presentation, consistent with contemporary clinical practice. It is possible that by limiting our analysis to values within 48 hours of presentation, a higher peak value could have been missed, but this rule was applied consistently to all patients. Peak troponin data within 48 hours were not available in about 25% of study participants, eliminating this group from our analysis. Although there were differences between those included or not, most were modest and would not be expected to alter the relationships we observed (Table S5). Troponin assays were not standardized across participating sites. Thus, they reflect a wide variety of individual assays with variable assay performance characteristics, and potentially varying site‐specific ULNs for the same assay. However, this reflects the state of actual clinical practice, and we attempted to account for this by normalizing the reported values using a ratio of the reported value to the ULN reported for the assay. This variability and resultant "noise" introduced would be expected to result in an underestimation of the relationship between increasing troponin level and outcomes. Additionally, it is possible that some patients with elevated troponin levels who were included in TRILOGY ACS did not have significant coronary artery disease. In this case, the true association of troponin with long‐term ischemic outcomes may have been underestimated. Of the patients who underwent angiography, however, very few had absence of obstructive coronary disease, and when we excluded those patients from our analyses, there were no differences in our findings. Although designed to evaluate medically managed patients, a small number of patients (7.1%) underwent postindex revascularization at a median of 120.5 days after the index event. Because of the infrequency of downstream revascularization in our study sample and that it occurred late relative to the time of troponin sampling, we believe the commitment to an initial medical management strategy was met and that it is unlikely that our results were significantly affected. Finally, it is possible that because we defined peak troponin using values collected within 48 hours after the index event, the true peak troponin value was missed. However, it is important to note that the impact of missing the true peak would tend to underestimate the relationship between peak troponin level and adverse outcomes. Despite its limitations, our analysis shows the prognostic importance of higher levels of troponin for long‐term outcomes among medically managed patients with NSTE ACS, even in the setting of treatment with modern, potent antiplatelet agents, and the effect is not related to the degree of platelet inhibition as assessed by the P2Y12 assay.

### Cardiac enzyme elevation after coronary revascularization [^115265S6]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Low credibility.

CK-MB elevation post-PCI correlates with procedural complications, diffuse atherosclerosis, and adverse long-term prognosis. Troponin elevation has an earlier pattern of rise than CK-MB and can be used as a surrogate. High sensitivity troponin can enable ruling out enzymatic elevation very early after PCI and facilitate discharge timing.

### Cardiac troponin after percutaneous coronary intervention and 1-year mortality in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome using systematic evaluation of biomarker trends [^117A5XpR]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to review cardiac troponin (cTn) trends during non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE ACS) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the EARLY ACS (Early Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Inhibition in Non-ST-Segment Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes) and SYNERGY (Superior Yield of the New Strategy of Enoxaparin, Revascularization and Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Inhibitors) studies and to study the relationship between post-PCI cTn and mortality.

Background

The prognostic value of cTn post-PCI is controversial. In patients with NSTE ACS, it is especially difficult to distinguish between cTn elevations due to PCI or index myocardial infarction (MI).

Methods

Time and cTn (indexed by upper limit of normal [ULN]) data pairs were plotted for 10,199 patients and independently reviewed by 2 physicians to identify patients in whom post-PCI cTn elevation could be distinguished from that of index MI. Post-PCI cTn peak was identified for each plot, and its relationship with 1-year mortality was evaluated using Cox modeling, correcting for 15 clinical variables from the EARLY ACS 1-year mortality model (including baseline cTn). We used an identical methodology to assess the association between creatine kinase-myocardial band and 1-year mortality.

Results

Patients with cTn (re-)elevation post-PCI not evaluable were identified and excluded from further analysis (4,198 [41%] with cTn rising prior to PCI; 229 [2%] with missing cTn). Among the remainder (n = 5,772 [57%]), in the multivariable model, peak cTn post-PCI was associated with a 7% increase in mortality (hazard ratio [HR] for 10 × ULN increase: 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02 to 1.11; p = 0.0038). Peak post-PCI creatine kinase-myocardial band was significantly associated with 1-year mortality (HR for 1 × ULN increase: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.21; p = 0.0013).

Conclusions

We used a methodology that differentiated post-PCI cTn (re-)elevation from that of presenting MI in more than one-half of patients with NSTE ACS undergoing PCI. This identified a highly significant relationship between post-PCI cTn and 1-year mortality, with implications for both incorporating a cTn post-PCI MI definition and preventing PCI-related myonecrosis.

Non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes — benefits and harms of accelerated troponin protocols: The application of an accelerated serial troponin testing protocol in suspected NSTE ACS has the potential to decrease ED length of stay and avoid further unnecessary testing or hospitalization, but despite the very low risk of 30-day MACE after a negative ADP a few patients may still experience MI or other MACE, and the low specificity of ADPs can lead to false positives causing unnecessary testing or hospital admission in some patients without disease.

### Troponin level at presentation as a prognostic factor among patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^116RqZGm]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The main findings of our study are (a) we have demonstrated that in patients presenting with NSTEMI, elevated baseline hs‐cTnI levels were associated with increased risk of 3‐year all‐cause mortality, (b) there was a dose–response relationship between baseline hs‐CTnI and mortality with highest risk of mortality observed in patients with highest baseline hs‐cTnI levels, and (c) even after adjusting the baseline hs‐cTnI mortality association for potential confounders, initial high hs‐cTnI levels remained an independent predictor of all‐cause mortality.

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the association between hs‐cTnI levels upon hospital admission and long‐term overall survival in patients diagnosed with NSTEMI. Prior studies that have examined the association between initial troponin levels and mortality have included patients with a broader range of diagnoses, encompassing all types of acute myocardial infractionor patients presenting with chest pain. Another significant distinction between our study and previous ones is our focus on examining troponin levels at presentation, as opposed to peak troponin levels or changes in troponin during admission course, which has been linked to adverse clinical outcomes and mortality.

Our first finding further supports the conclusions of Antman et al. regarding the role of troponin level upon hospital admission and short‐term mortality in ACS patients. The identification of a higher‐risk subgroup with hs‐cTnI levels greater or equal to 2878 ng/L is very intriguing, as this subgroup did not exhibit any distinctive baseline characteristics or complications. We hypothesized that the heightened risk of mortality in those patients is likely a result of later changes that occur in the myocardium of NSTEMI patients, such as remodeling, which is related to elevated risk of death. Hence, there were no between‐group differences in the short‐term period. In a large observational study comprising 4123 patients with non‐ST‐segment elevation ACS, Kontos et al. demonstrated a gradual rise in cardiac mortality as peak cTnI levels increased at 30‐day and 6‐month follow‐up intervals. Our results are consistent with these findings. However, our aim was to investigate specifically the association between initial cTnI levels and mortality over a longer follow‐up period. From a clinical perspective, our results might have greater clinical implications due to the dynamic nature of ACS patients.

### Immediate and early percutaneous coronary intervention in very high-risk and high-risk non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction patients [^1157HTpi]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

Patients were derived from the ACS Israeli Survey (ACSIS). Details about this registry have been previously reported. In brief, the ACSIS is a nationwide survey conducted during March and April of 2016 and 2018 in all 25 cardiac units and cardiology wards operating in Israel. Local ethics committee approval was received from each hospital. Participants provided their written informed consent to participate in the study. The study population comprised all patients admitted with ACS.

Prespecified forms were used to collect demographic and clinical data. The discharge diagnoses were determined by the attending physician based on clinical, electrocardiogram, and biochemical tests. Patients' treatment was determined by the decision of the attending physician.

2.1 Study population

The study population consisted of patients included in the ACSIS surveys in 2016 and 2018 with the diagnosis of NSTEMI, which was defined according to contemporary guidelines. Patients were considered to have NSTEMI if they had acute chest discomfort with no persistent ST‐segment elevation and elevated troponin. The ECG findings ranged from normal ECG to changes that may include transient ST‐segment elevation, persistent or transient ST‐segment depression, T‐wave inversion, flat T waves, or pseudonormalization of T waves. Patients' risk stratification was performed according to the 2015 ESC guidelines. Very high‐risk patients were defined when they had one or more of the following: hemodynamic instability or cardiogenic shock; ongoing or recurrent pain refractory to medical treatment; life‐threatening arrhythmias or cardiac arrest; mechanical complications; or an acute heart failure. High‐risk patients were defined by one or more of the following: rise or fall in troponin compatible with myocardial infarction (MI); dynamic ST‐segment or T‐wave changes; or GRACE score higher than 140. The investigators who determined the risk category were blinded to clinical outcomes. Time to coronary angiography was divided into three categories: immediate coronary angiography was done < 2 h from admission; early coronary angiography was done < 24 h from admission; and late coronary angiography was done for > 24 h from admission. We defined 30‐days major cardiovascular adverse events (MACE) as the occurrence in 30 days of either: mortality, UA pectoris, MI, stent thrombosis, urgent revascularization, and cerebrovascular event.

### Small changes in troponin T levels are common in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and are linked to higher mortality [^116Lr2iK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to examine the extent of change in troponin T levels in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

Background

Changes in cardiac troponin T (cTnT) levels are required for the diagnosis of NSTEMI, according to the new universal definition of acute myocardial infarction. A relative change of 20% to 230% and an absolute change of 7 to 9 ng/l have been suggested as cutoff points.

Methods

In a clinical setting, where a change in cTnT was not mandatory for the diagnosis of NSTEMI, serial samples of cTnT were measured with a high-sensitivity cTnT (hs-cTnT) assay, and 37 clinical parameters were evaluated in 1,178 patients with a final diagnosis of NSTEMI presenting < 24 h after symptom onset.

Results

After 6 h of observation, the relative change in the hs-cTnT level remained < 20% in 26% and the absolute change < 9 ng/l in 12% of the NSTEMI patients. A relative hs-cTnT change < 20% was linked to higher long-term mortality across quartiles (p = 0.002) and in multivariate analyses (hazard ratio: 1.61 [95% confidence interval: 1.17 to 2.21], p = 0.004), whereas 30-day mortality was similar across quartiles of relative hs-cTnT change.

Conclusions

Because stable hs-TnT levels are common in patients with a clinical diagnosis of NSTEMI in our hospital, a small hs-cTnT change may not be useful to exclude NSTEMI, particularly as these patients show both short-term and long-term mortality at least as high as patients with large changes in hs-cTnT.

### 2021 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on same-day discharge after percutaneous coronary intervention: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^112Rs3gM]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Same-day discharge after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — pathway summary graphic presents entry conditions, pre- and postprocedure considerations, and a pre-discharge checklist to support decision-making. The figure specifies "Non-urgent PCI, no NSTEMI or STEMI" and organizes steps into "Pre-PCI considerations", "Post-PCI considerations", and a "Pre-Discharge Checklist". Pre-PCI clinical factors include "Physician's input about whether patient is a candidate for SDD", with social and systems factors such as "Patient/caregiver can call 911", "Caregiver available if needed", "Patient willing to go home", and "Scheduler informs patient about possibility of SDD, schedules PCI early enough in the day to allow for reasonable observation before SDD". Post-PCI clinical review includes "Complications during/after procedure", "Success of PCI", "Exacerbation of disease", and "Change in mental status from baseline", with the social check "Patient willing to go home". The pre-discharge checklist states that plans have been made for "Administration of P2Y12i loading dose", "Prescriptions for P2Y12i, aspirin, and statin", "Referral to cardiac rehab", a "Follow-up call with patient", and "Follow-up appointment", plus education on "Monitoring access site" and an "Emergency number to call". The figure notes that the "Physician concludes that same-day discharge is or is not reasonable", and clarifies that clinical, social, staff/systems, and checklist completion factors "all influence the decision on SDD". Abbreviations are defined as "NSTEMI = non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction; P2Y12i = P2Y12 inhibitors; PCI = percutaneous coronary intervention; SDD = same-day discharge; STEMI = ST-elevation myocardial infarction".

### Relationship between troponin on presentation and in-hospital mortality in patients with ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention [^1118mLtb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The primary findings of this study are that nearly half of patients with STEMI had troponin levels that were undetectable or within the reference range on hospital presentation, and that the degree of troponin elevation on admission is a strong and independent predictor of in‐hospital mortality for STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI, even after adjustment for other baseline demographic and clinical factors. Patients with low or undetectable troponins experienced lower‐than‐expected mortality, regardless of their predicted risk based on demographic and clinical risk factors. Conversely, those with markedly elevated troponins on presentation had mortality rates that were higher than anticipated by the clinical risk model.

It is thought that the onset of myocardial infarction precedes a clinically abnormal troponin elevation by 3 to 4 hours when standard (ie, non‐high‐sensitivity) TnT and TnI assays are used, with a peak in enzyme levels at 12 to 24 hours depending on successful reperfusion. 4 Though the rapid rise in biomarkers following reperfusion of the infarct‐related artery by thrombolysis and angioplasty in STEMI patients has been well described 18 and can be used to predict the success of thrombolytic therapy, 19 an elevated presenting troponin in an unrevascularized STEMI patient should never be confused with the "washout phenomenon" that accompanies successful reperfusion. Whereas peak troponin levels are driven by the success of revascularization and the territory of myocardium at risk from the infarct‐related artery, 1, 2, 3 troponin release kinetics dictate that the levels observed in the early acute phase are highly dependent on the time of ischemia. Our findings suggest that admission levels may provide an important objective insight into the degree and duration of prehospital ischemia, and that increased ischemic time is a significant driver of increased mortality for those in high‐troponin groups.

### How can we optimize the processes of care for acute coronary syndromes to improve outcomes? [^116wXkKs]. American Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS), either ST-elevation myocardial infarction or non-ST-elevation ACS, are still one of the most common cardiac emergencies with substantial morbidity and mortality. The availability of evidence-based treatments, such as early and intense platelet inhibition and anticoagulation, and timely reperfusion and revascularization, has substantially improved outcomes in patients with ACS. The implementation of streamlined processes of care for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST-elevation ACS over the last decade including both appropriate tools, especially cardiac troponin, for rapid diagnosis and risk stratification and for decision support, and the widespread availability of modern antithrombotic and interventional treatments, have reduced morbidity and mortality to unprecedented low levels. These changes in the process of care require a synchronized approach, and research using a team-based strategy and effective regional networks has allowed healthcare systems to provide modern treatments for most patients with ACS. There are still areas needing improvement, such as the delivery of care to people in rural areas or with delayed time to treatment.

### Troponin level at presentation as a prognostic factor among patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^111wjKpF]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Bagai et al. showed that there is a differential relationship between the magnitude of peak troponin elevation and long‐term mortality in ACS patients treated with and without revascularization. Our findings also suggest better prognosis after revascularization regarding the association between initial hs‐cTnI levels and mortality, although this was not the aim of our study and it was not powered for that. The association between initial hs‐cTnI levels and mortality, and the lower mortality rate in revascularized patients, imply that initial hs‐cTnI levels may be useful in determining the need for urgent revascularization in NSTEMI patients. Current NSTEMI guidelines advise revascularization within 120 min in patients with very high‐risk characteristics, regardless of the level of cardiac biomarkers. However, based on our results and previous important studies, initial hs‐cTnI may further contribute to the decision‐making process for urgent revascularization among NSTEMI patients, to reduce the higher mortality rates that we have observed in NSTEMI patients with high baseline hs‐cTnI levels.

4.1 Study limitations

Our study has several limitations: (1) The study was conducted in a single tertiary‐care ICCU, resulting in a relatively small study population of 544 patients. Nevertheless, we included all‐comers in a real‐life setting. (2) Our analysis was based on overall mortality rather than cardiovascular mortality. Though mortality statistics in Israel closely resemble those of the European Union, where cardiovascular death is the second most prevalent cause of death following cancer.(3) There may be unmeasured clinical variables that could explain our observations, including the time elapsed between symptom onset to hs‐cTnI testing, details regarding coronary angiography beyond the culprit vessel, including lesion description and the exact type of stents employed in the PCI group. (4) While independent associations have been demonstrated, causality could not be established due to study design; hence, the superiority of one treatment modality over another is not supported by our findings.

### Consideration of a new definition of clinically relevant myocardial infarction after coronary revascularization: an expert consensus document from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) [^112cZpdd]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) expert consensus — For myocardial infarction (MI) after coronary revascularization, the universal definition designates post procedural biomarker thresholds for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)-related MI (type 4a) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)-related MI (type 5), but these are described as of uncertain prognostic importance, and for both types troponin is recommended as the biomarker of choice though its prognostic significance is less well validated than CK-MB. The document cautions that widespread adoption of a MI definition not clearly related to subsequent adverse events may have serious consequences for device/therapy assessment, clinical care pathways, and interpretation of physician competence. Rather than employing a MI definition sensitive for small degrees of myonecrosis, it is instead recommended that a threshold level of biomarker elevation strongly linked to subsequent adverse events in clinical studies be used to define a "clinically relevant MI".

### Failure to launch: targeting inflammation in acute coronary syndromes [^116KJBC1]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2017). Low credibility.

Given the promising results for P-selectin inhibition in animal models of vascular injury, inclacumab was developed as a highly specific human recombinant monoclonal antibody against P-selectin. In the phase 2 SELECT-ACS (Effects of the P-Selectin Antagonist Inclacumab on Myocardial Damage after Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction) trial, 544 patients with NSTEMI who were scheduled to undergo coronary angiography were randomized to an infusion of placebo, a 5-mg/kg inclacumab infusion, or a 20-mg/kg inclacumab infusion, between 1 and 24 h before PCI. The primary endpoint was change in troponin I level from baseline at 16 and 24 h. There was no significant difference in change in placebo-adjusted geometric mean percent change in troponin I levels at 16 and 24 h from baseline in the group who received the 5-mg/kg inclacumab infusion compared with placebo. However, in the group that received the 20-mg/kg inclacumab infusion compared with placebo, there was a significant difference in placebo-adjusted geometric mean percent change in troponin I levels at 24 h (decrease by 23.8%; p = 0.05) but not at 16 h (decrease by 22.4%; p = 0.07). The dose-dependent effect of inclacumab on infarct size as assessed by change in troponin I levels at 24 h in SELECT-NSTEMI suggested that inhibition of P-selectin with inclacumab could be a viable treatment for patients with NSTEMI. Ultimately, a large phase 3 trial will be needed to determine if the use of inclacumab in patients with NSTEMI translates into an actual improvement in clinical outcomes, including rates of post-MI heart failure and mortality.

### Cardiac troponin thresholds and kinetics to differentiate myocardial injury and myocardial infarction [^115RRzAg]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although the 99th percentile is the recommended diagnostic threshold for myocardial infarction, some guidelines also advocate the use of higher troponin thresholds to rule in myocardial infarction at presentation. It is unclear whether the magnitude or change in troponin concentration can differentiate causes of myocardial injury and infarction in practice.

Methods

In a secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized controlled trial, we identified 46092 consecutive patients presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentrations at presentation and on serial testing were compared between patients with myocardial injury and infarction. The positive predictive value and specificity were determined at the sex-specific 99th percentile upper reference limit and rule-in thresholds of 64 ng/L and 5-fold of the upper reference limit for a diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction.

Results

Troponin was above the 99th percentile in 8188 patients (18%). The diagnosis was type 1 or type 2 myocardial infarction in 50% and 14% and acute or chronic myocardial injury in 20% and 16%, respectively. Troponin concentrations were similar at presentation in type 1 (median [25th-75th percentile] 91 [30–493] ng/L) and type 2 (50 [22–147] ng/L) myocardial infarction and in acute (50 [26–134] ng/L) and chronic (51 [31–130] ng/L) myocardial injury. The 99th percentile and rule-in thresholds of 64 ng/L and 5-fold upper reference limit gave a positive predictive value of 57% (95% CI, 56%-58%), 59% (58%-61%), and 62% (60%-64%) and a specificity of 96% (96%-96%), 96% (96%-96%), and 98% (97%-98%), respectively. The absolute, relative, and rate of change in troponin concentration were highest in patients with type 1 myocardial infarction (P < 0.001 for all). Discrimination improved when troponin concentration and change in troponin were combined compared with troponin concentration at presentation alone (area under the curve, 0.661 [0.642–0.680] versus 0.613 [0.594–0.633]).

Conclusions

Although we observed important differences in the kinetics, cardiac troponin concentrations at presentation are insufficient to distinguish type 1 myocardial infarction from other causes of myocardial injury or infarction in practice and should not guide management decisions in isolation.

### Acute coronary syndrome: diagnosis and initial management [^114W9z4a]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to cardiac troponin, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain high-sensitivity cardiac troponin measurement in patients with acute chest pain and high suspicion of ACS at initial presentation and 3 hours after symptom onset.

ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) definitions — adult emergency department population: This policy refers only to adult (> 18 years) patients with possible cardiac ischemia and excludes acute STEMI defined by the Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction, which requires ST elevation as > 0.1 mV in 2 contiguous leads with specific cut points in V2 - V3 of > 0.2mV in men > 40 years, > 0.25 mV in men less than 40 years, and > 0.15 mV in women; without these electrocardiographic changes, the goal is to diagnose NSTE ACS, and NSTEMI is defined by a significant Δ increase in troponin level without ST-segment elevation in the appropriate clinical context suggestive of myocardial ischemia.

### Merits of invasive strategy in diabetic patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome [^112AT84X]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

One of the major shortcomings of the study is that the investigators examined an outdated definition of early invasive strategy. According to both the American and European NSTE‐ACS guidelines, 7, 8 an early invasive strategy is currently defined as a strategy implemented within 24 hours of presentation whereas a delayed invasive strategy is implemented within 25 to 72 hours. This artificial delineation is meant to help clinicians triage patients and streamline their flow into the cardiac catheterization laboratory, but is also driven by evidence from clinical trials. The TIMACS (Timing of Intervention in Acute Coronary Syndromes) study was the largest trial (N = 3031 patients) comparing a true invasive (≤ 24 hours) versus a delayed invasive strategy (≥ 36 hours). 9 Although the primary study end point was not met, an early invasive strategy was associated with a significant reduction in the composite secondary end point of death, MI, or refractory ischemia at 6 months, which was driven by a 70% reduction in refractory ischemia. 9 The reduction in recurrent ischemia with an early invasive strategy was subsequently confirmed by additional meta‐analyses 10 and was associated with a significant reduction in the length of stay (by 28% in 1 report 10) and costs (even when 50% of NSTE‐ACS patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention during weekends). 11 Notably, an early invasive strategy carries no safety issues, even when implemented very early — within < 6 hours 12 — or as an immediate strategy. 13 Although considered a soft end point, reducing recurrent or refractory ischemia post‐NSTE‐ACS is clinically important and is supported by evidence from the literature. In the TIMACS trial, refractory ischemia was associated with more than a 4‐fold increase in subsequent MI. 9 The ACUITY investigators demonstrated that a delayed percutaneous coronary intervention approach (> 24 hours) post‐NSTE‐ACS was associated with worse 30‐day composite of death or MI and was an independent predictor of short‐term and 1‐year major cardiac adverse events. 14 Therefore, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines 7, 15 recommended an early invasive strategy for NSTE‐ACS patients who are at high risk, such as those with a Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk score > 140, new or presumably new ST depression, or significant temporal changes in troponin levels. Moderate‐risk patients with NSTE‐ACS can receive a delayed approach (within 25–72 hours), including those with diabetes mellitus. 7 Notably, a small proportion of patients will need an urgent or immediate invasive approach, such as those with refractory angina and hemodynamic or electrical instability. 7 It is unfortunate that the investigators did not examine the merits of a true invasive strategy (within < 24 hours) in their current report, 6 which might have been explored in secondary analyses and which could have influenced clinical practice and guideline recommendations in diabetic patients.

### Periprocedural myocardial injury during elective percutaneous coronary intervention: is it important and how can it be prevented? [^115FGiNh]. Heart (2010). Low credibility.

Periprocedural myocardial injury (PMI) is common after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Periprocedural infarction (myocardial infarction type 4a) occurs after at least 10% of PCI procedures and has an impact on long-term prognosis. Measurement of biomarkers to allow assessment of PMI is an important tool for clinical and research purposes and should be routine after every PCI (troponin I or T and CK-MB). The importance of oral and intravenous antiplatelet agents and other drugs which have been proven to reduce PMI is discussed.

### Prognostic value of troponin after elective percutaneous coronary intervention: a meta-analysis [^1146S9qh]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Although the prognostic importance of troponin in patients with anacute coronary syndrome is clear, the significance of troponin elevation after elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a subject of debate. However, most studies up to now had a small sample size and insufficient events during follow-up.

Methods

Electronic and manual searches were performed of studies reporting on prognosis of troponin after elective PCI. A meta-analysis was done of all suitable studies, with death in follow-up as primary endpoint and the combination of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction in follow-up as secondary endpoint.

Results

20 studies involving 15,581 patients were included. These studies were published between 1998 and 2007. Overall, troponin was elevated after elective PCI in 32.9% of patients. The follow-up period varied between 3 and 67 months (mean 16.3). Increased mortality was significantly associated with troponin elevation after PCI (4.4% vs. 3.3%, P = 0.001; OR 1.35). Furthermore, the combined endpoint of mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction also occurred more often in patients with post-procedural troponin elevation (8.1% vs. 5.2%, P < 0.001; OR 1.59).

Conclusions

According to this meta-analysis, troponin elevation after elective PCI provides important prognostic information.

### Prognostic value of new-generation troponins in ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction in the modern era: the RUTI-STEMI study [^113EzVc6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The high clinical sensitivity and myocardial tissue specificity of troponins have positioned them as the quintessential biomarker for myocardial damage and the preferred biomarker for diagnosing myocardial infarction (MI). 1 However, in the setting of ST‐segment–elevation MI (STEMI), diagnosis does not require troponin measurement: symptoms and ECG data are sufficient to activate a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

It is well known that, after an STEMI, cardiac troponins correlate with infarct size in the short‐term phase 2, 3 and with left ventricular remodeling during the long‐term. 4 Nevertheless, it is uncertain whether serial troponin measurements provide true value in clinical predictions of STEMI in the era of primary PCI. Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of peak troponin levels in patients with STEMI over standard prognosticators. We measured troponins with a sensitive‐contemporary troponin I (sc‐TnI) assay and a high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs‐TnT) assay.

### Prognostic value of cardiac troponin I re-elevation following percutaneous coronary intervention in high-risk patients with acute coronary syndromes [^116Heens]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Troponin I is a predictive marker of short- and intermediate-term adverse cardiac events in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). These high-risk patients may benefit from early percutaneous coronary intervention. However, whether additional myocardial injury, defined as postprocedural troponin I elevation, may be associated with adverse short- and intermediate-term outcomes has not been fully explored. Accordingly, we studied 132 consecutive patients with non-ST-elevation ACS (62% with non-Q-wave myocardial infarction) and elevated troponin I levels at admission (> 0.15 ng/ml) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention ≥ 48 hours after admission. Troponin I levels were routinely measured at 6 and 18 to 24 hours after intervention and patients were stratified according to the presence or absence of troponin I re-elevation, defined as postprocedural troponin I levels > 1 times the admission levels. In-hospital and cumulative 6-month clinical outcomes were compared between groups. Patients with troponin I re-elevation (n = 51) were older (68 ± 13 vs 64 ± 12 years, p = 0.05) and had experienced prior myocardial infarction more frequently (92.5 vs 82.1, p = 0.09), but otherwise had similar baseline clinical characteristics. Patients with troponin I re-elevation had significantly higher in-hospital mortality (9.8% vs 0%, p = 0.016) and a higher 6-month cumulative death rate (24% vs 3.7%, p = 0.001). There was a trend for an increased 6-month myocardial infarction rate in patients with troponin I re-elevation (13.7% vs 3.7%, p = 0.11) and target vessel revascularization was similar between groups (16.7% vs 17.4%, p = 0.92). By multivariate analysis, troponin I re-elevation (odds ratio [OR] 6.2, p = 0.011) and diabetes mellitus (OR 5.7, p = 0.014) were the strongest independent predictors for increased 6-month cumulative mortality, whereas creatine kinase MB-fraction re-elevation had no prognostic value. We conclude that troponin I re-elevation after percutaneous coronary intervention in high-risk patients with ACS is associated with a substantial increase in mortality and reduced event-free survival at 6-month follow-up.

### Comparison of immediate vs early invasive strategy in patients with first acute non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^111C89gF]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The best timing for coronary angiography (immediate vs early) in patients with acute non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is controversial.

Hypothesis

Evaluate in NSTEMI patients the effects of an immediate compared to an early invasive strategy on microvascular damage, myocardial perfusion, and infarct size.

Methods

We randomized 54 consecutive patients with first episode of NSTEMI: 27 patients (22 males, age 58.8 ± 9.4 years, group A) underwent immediate (≤ 6 hours) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with a double bolus of eptifibatide, and 27 patients (24 males, age 59.7 ± 9.8 years, P = 0.72, group B) underwent early (7–72 hours) PCI with upstream eptifibatide. Microvascular damage was evaluated at predischarge by myocardial contrast echocardiography, and the contrast defect length was calculated.

Results

There were no significant differences in pre-PCI myocardial blush grade (MBG) (41% MBG 0 or 1 in group A vs 37% MBG 0 or 1 in group B, P = 0.78), in post-PCI MBG (7.4% MBG 0 or 1 in both groups, P = 1.00), and in contrast defect length (4.5% in group A vs 2.8% in group B, P = 0.56). However, group A showed a significant reduction in creatine kinase myocardial band isoenzyme peak (26 ± 26 ng/mL in group A vs 69 ± 79 ng/mL in group B, P = 0.01) and in troponin T peak (0.84 ± 1.2 ng/mL in group A vs 1.8 ± 2.1 ng/mL in group B, P = 0.048).

Conclusions

In patients with NSTEMI treated with eptifibatide, immediate PCI is associated with less increase in myonecrosis markers compared with PCI within 72 hours. There were no significant differences in myocardial perfusion between the 2 strategies.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^115MNXjp]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) — the Academic Research Consortium-2 (ARC-2) suggests a postprocedural cardiac troponin (cTn) value ≥ 35 times the 99th percentile URL for both PCI and CABG in patients with a normal baseline cTn or elevated but stable/falling values, and ARC-2 proposes that 1 ancillary criterion be required in addition to the ≥ 35 cTn rise (ancillary criteria are ≥ 1 of: new significant Q waves, flow-limiting angiographic complications in a major epicardial vessel or > 1.5 mm diameter branch, or substantial new loss of viable myocardium on echocardiography). ARC-2 further defines stand-alone criteria for significant procedural myocardial injury if the rise in cTn is ≥ 70 times the 99th percentile URL.

### Cardiac troponin I for prediction of clinical outcomes and cardiac function through 3-month follow-up after primary percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^114NyGZH]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Circulating levels of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are associated with infarct size and chronic left ventricular dysfunction, but the relation to clinical end points and biochemical measures of global cardiac function remains less well defined.

Methods

One thousand sixty-six patients receiving primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the PROTECTION AMI trial were studied in a post hoc analysis. Cardiac troponin I was measured at several time points during the index hospitalization, and patients were followed up for 3 months before reassessment including N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurements.

Results

The median (quartile 1–3) cTnI levels were 0.4 (0.1–0.4) μg/L at admission, 33.1 (12.8–72.1) μg/L after 16 to 24 hours, and 9.1 (3.9–17.5) μg/L after 70 to 80 hours. In adjusted models, all post-PCI single points, peak, and area under curve were found to be independently associated with clinical events, NT-proBNP > 118 pmol/L, or LVEF < 40% (P for all < .001). When cTnI was added to a baseline risk model for prediction of clinical events, the C statistic improved from 0.779 to 0.846 (16–24 hours) and 0.859 (70–80 hours). Quantified by integrated discrimination improvement, the addition of cTnI significantly augmented prediction ability (relative integrated discrimination improvement 44%-154%; P for all ≤ .001). Consistent improvements in discrimination of NT-proBNP > 118 pmol/L and LVEF < 40% were observed.

Conclusions

Cardiac troponin I measured after primary PCI for STEMI is independently associated with clinical outcomes and cardiac function through 3-month follow-up. These results suggest that cTnI levels are a useful risk stratification tool in STEMI patients.

### Comparative prognostic value of postprocedural creatine kinase myocardial band and high-sensitivity troponin T in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^116jXcov]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to assess the prognostic value of postprocedural creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB) and cardiac troponin (cTn) in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

Background

Whether postprocedural CK-MB or cTn is a better biomarker to stratify the risk after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains unknown.

Methods

This study included 2,077 patients with NSTEMI undergoing early PCI. Peak postprocedural values of CK-MB and high-sensitivity cTn T (hs-cTnT) were analyzed. The primary outcome was 3-year mortality.

Results

The median values of peak postprocedural CK-MB and hs-cTnT were 18.3 U L -1 and 0.140 µg L -1, respectively. Overall, 211 patients died during follow-up. There were 129 deaths in patients with CK-MB > the median value and 82 deaths in those with CK-MB ≤ the median value (Kaplan-Meier estimates of 3-year mortality, 18.9% and 14.0%, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] = 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16–2.01; P < 0.001). There were 134 deaths in patients with hs-cTnT > the median value and 77 deaths in patients with hs-cTnT ≤ the median value (Kaplan-Meier estimates of 3-year mortality, 19.9% and 13.2%, respectively; HR = 1.90 [1.44–2.52]; P < 0.001). After adjustment, peak postprocedural CK-MB (adjusted HR = 1.05 [1.02–1.07], P < 0.001 for each 24 U L -1 increment) and hs-cTnT (adjusted HR = 1.12 [1.01–1.25], P = 0.037 for each unit higher log hs-cTnT) remained independently associated with the risk of 3-year mortality. The C-statistic(s) of the model with CK-MB and hs-cTnT were 0.789 [0.757–0.817] and 0.793 [0.762–0.821], respectively (P = 0.585).

Conclusion

In patients with NSTEMI undergoing early PCI, peak postprocedural CK-MB and hs-cTnT are independently associated with the risk of 3-year mortality. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### SCAI expert consensus statement on sex-specific considerations in myocardial revascularization [^111Rh9dk]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2022). High credibility.

Central illustration — outcome gaps for women across chronic and acute coronary syndromes emphasize needed randomized comparisons and sex-specific pathways. In chronic coronary syndromes (CCS), needed studies include randomized evaluation of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) versus percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in women with multivessel disease (MVD) and left main disease (LMD), and optimal revascularization strategy and guidance. For non–ST‑elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), gaps include the impact of high‑sensitivity cardiac troponin assays on time‑to‑treatment intervals and optimal tools for reliable diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of young women. For ST‑elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), identified gaps include management and timing of non‑culprit lesions in women with multivessel disease, sex‑specific algorithms for cardiogenic shock, and sex‑specific pathogenesis and recurrence risk factors for spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) and takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

### Troponin: an important prognostic marker and risk-stratification tool in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes [^112LLxUX]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Over the past decade, there has been a progressive evolution of cardiac marker testing in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). This has not only resulted in a dramatic shift in how we view the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI), but it has also extended the role of cardiac marker testing into risk stratification and guidance of treatment decisions. By the year 2000, the development of highly sensitive and cardiac-specific troponin assays had resulted in a consensus change in the definition of MI, placing increased emphasis on cardiac-marker testing with troponins as the new gold standard. Furthermore, and perhaps more importantly, the role of the troponins as superior markers of subsequent cardiac risk in ACS patients became firmly established. Most recently, the supportive role of these markers in identifying patients with ACS who may derive particular benefit from potent anti-thrombotic and anti-platelet therapy or early invasive treatment strategies has been demonstrated. This paper will review the evolution of these important roles of troponin testing for risk stratification in ACS.

### Intravenous thrombolysis before percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome and acute ischaemic stroke: a subanalysis of the PRAISE study [^116PFmx6]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the standard treatment for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS). Rapid intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) with tissue plasminogen activator is recommended only for patients diagnosed with STEMI within 12 hours of symptom onset if PCI is not an immediate option. In contrast, IVT is the standard of care for patients with acute ischaemic stroke (AIS). IVT provides an additive, beneficial effect on functional outcome when given prior to endovascular thrombectomy.

In the PRAISE study (PRediction of Acute coronary syndrome in acute Ischemic StrokE; NCT 03609385) of patients with AIS and elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) levels meeting the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 'rule-in' criteria for suspected myocardial infarction (MI), dynamic changes in hs-cTn in AIS survivors did not identify type 1 or type 2 MI. Instead, very high levels of hs-cTn detected type 1 MI with moderate power. In this multicentre, prospective, observational study, 247 patients with AIS who also met ESC guideline rule-in criteria for suspected NSTE-ACS underwent coronary angiography. An independent endpoint adjudication committee (EAC) diagnosed MI in 126 (51%) of the patients enrolled, including 50 (20%) with type 1 MI and 76 (31%) with type 2 MI. A total of 73 suspected culprit lesions were treated with PCI. Of these, 29 (40%) had received IVT with alteplase for AIS prior to PCI. The PRAISE cohort thus provides a unique patient population that allows for the address of the unanswered question of whether IVT before PCI is associated with a higher degree of epicardial coronary flow after intervention compared with direct PCI.

### Troponin level at presentation as a prognostic factor among patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^116MgPgm]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Timely reperfusion within 120 min is strongly recommended in patients presenting with non‐ST‐segment myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with very high‐risk features. Evidence regarding the use of high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs‐cTn) concentration upon admission for the risk‐stratification of patients presenting with NSTEMI to expedite percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and thus potentially improve outcomes is limited.

Methods

All patients admitted to a tertiary care center ICCU between July 2019 and July 2022 were included. Hs‐cTnI levels on presentaion were recorded, dividing patients into quartiles based on baseline hs‐cTnI. Association between initial hs‐cTnI and all‐cause mortality during up to 3 years of follow‐up was studied.

Results

A total of 544 NSTEMI patients with a median age of 67 were included. Hs‐cTnI levels in each quartile were: (a) ≤ 122, (b) 123–680, (c) 681–2877, and (d) ≥ 2878 ng/L. There was no difference between the initial hs‐cTnI level groups regarding age and comorbidities. A higher mortality rate was observed in the highest hs‐cTnI quartile as compared with the lowest hs‐cTnI quartile (16.2% vs. 7.35%, p = .03) with hazard ratio (HR) for mortality of 2.6 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23–5.4; p = .012) in the unadjusted model, and HR of 2.06 (95% CI: 1.01–4.79; p = .047) with adjustment for age, gender, serum creatinine, and significant comorbidities.

Conclusions

Patients with NSTEMI and higher hs‐cTnI levels upon admission faced elevated mortality risk. This underscores the need for further prospective investigations into early reperfusion strategies' impact on NSTEMI patients' mortality, based on admission troponin elevation.

At 30 days, there was a significant 53% relative reduction. in the risk of death or MI among those with elevated cTnI that was comparable to the 50% relative risk reduction in patients with elevated cTnT. 8 As such, the risk of recurrent events associated with elevated cardiac troponin was substantially attenuated by the early invasive strategy. For. absolute and a 39% relative reduction in risk of the primary end point at 6 months. We also demonstrate that among patients with clinically documented UA/NSTEMI even "minor" elevation of cardiac troponins confers increased risk and predicts significant benefit of an early invasive strategy. These findings were consistent between cTnI and cTnT. Thus, even low-level elevation of cardiac.

### Effects of the P-selectin antagonist inclacumab on myocardial damage after percutaneous coronary intervention for non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: results of the SELECT-ACS trial [^114ojUFx]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The study aimed to evaluate inclacumab for the reduction of myocardial damage during a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.

Background

P-selectin is an adhesion molecule involved in interactions between endothelial cells, platelets, and leukocytes. Inclacumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody against P-selectin, with potential anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, and antiatherogenic properties.

Methods

Patients (N = 544) with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction scheduled for coronary angiography and possible ad hoc PCI were randomized to receive 1 pre-procedural infusion of inclacumab 5 or 20 mg/kg or placebo. The primary endpoint, evaluated in patients who underwent PCI, received study medication, and had available efficacy data (n = 322), was the change in troponin I from baseline at 16 and 24 h after PCI.

Results

There was no effect of inclacumab 5 mg/kg. Placebo-adjusted geometric mean percent changes in troponin I with inclacumab 20 mg/kg were -24.4% at 24 h (p = 0.05) and -22.4% at 16 h (p = 0.07). Peak troponin I was reduced by 23.8% (p = 0.05) and area under the curve over 24 h by 33.9% (p = 0.08). Creatine kinase-myocardial band yielded similar results, with changes of -17.4% at 24 h (p = 0.06) and -16.3% at 16 h (p = 0.09). The incidence of creatine kinase-myocardial band increases > 3 times the upper limit of normal within 24 h was 18.3% and 8.9% in the placebo and inclacumab 20-mg/kg groups, respectively (p = 0.05). Placebo-adjusted changes in soluble P-selectin level were -9.5% (p = 0.25) and -22.0% (p < 0.01) with inclacumab 5 and 20 mg/kg. There was no significant difference in adverse events between groups.

Conclusions

Inclacumab appears to reduce myocardial damage after PCI in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. (A Study of RO4905417 in Patients With Non ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction [Non-STEMI] Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; NCT01327183).

Introduction

Cardiac troponin levels are routinely measured in the setting of known or suspected myocardial infarction. Though not part of formal diagnostic criteria, baseline troponin levels are frequently collected in the emergency department evaluation of patients with ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Troponin release has predictable kinetics in the setting of acute infarction, and peak levels correlate with both ischemic time and quantity of myocardium at risk. 1, 2, 3, 4 A previous investigation has shown that troponin kinetics can be used to estimate the onset of ischemia in STEMI patients, and this "biochemical ischemic time" correlates well with infarct size and long‐term mortality. 5 Despite the potential value of admission troponin as an indicator of prehospital ischemia, there is a paucity of research evaluating the relationship between the magnitude of admission troponin and mortality for STEMI patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In this context, we examined the association between admission troponin level and in‐hospital mortality for a large, contemporary cohort of patients who underwent primary PCI for the treatment of STEMI.

### Diagnosis of myocardial infarction using troponin I algorithm… [^114M3eSi]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Therefore, current European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend the use of high-sensitivity troponin assays on admission and after 3 hours. A value above the 99th percentile of the specific assay and a relative rise or fall is the recommended cutoff for a diagnosis of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. 6, 7 Recent studies suggest that AMI can be diagnosed earlier than 3 hours, when values below the 99th percentile are used as cutoff values. To identify NSTEMI, the following algorithms based on troponin I levels were considered: 1 hour after admission a value higher than 6 ng/L combined with an increase or decrease of at least 12 ng/L from the admission value was defined to identify NSTEMI; and 3 hours after admission a value higher than 6 ng/L combined with an increase or decrease of at least 12 ng/L from the admission value was defined as NSTEMI.

When we used the 1-hour algorithm with 2 consecutive measurements of troponin I levels, the NPV for NSTEMI type 1 after 1 hour was 99. 8%; after 3 hours,
100. 0%. The PPV was 82. 8% using the 1-hour algorithm and
78. 6% after 3 hours for patients with NSTEMI type 1. When a relative delta of 20% was used, the PPV for patients with NSTEMI was
39. 9% after 1 hour and 40. 1% after 3 hours. The PPV after 1 hour was 80. 4%; after 3 hours,
68. 8%. Both cohorts analyzed NSTEMI as the final diagnosis and did not differentiate between NSTEMI types 1 and 2.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Pre-procedure cardiac troponin (cTn) before PCI — prognostic implications and baseline assessment: Prior studies reported that only pre-procedure cTn elevations are correlated with subsequent mortality. In an analysis of 5,487 patients undergoing nonemergent PCI, an abnormal pre-PCI cTnI level independently predicted death (median follow-up of 28 months), but PCI-related myonecrosis did not whether defined by > 3x elevation in cTn or creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB). In a separate study, baseline cTn was > ULN in 6.0% of 2,382 patients undergoing elective PCI and was an independent predictor of in-hospital death or myocardial infarction (MI). Thus, interpretation of post-PCI biomarker elevations may be erroneous if baseline levels are not assessed, and the accurate diagnosis of post-PCI MI is challenging among patients with baseline biomarker elevations. The 2012 task force suggests that "If the baseline cTn values are elevated and are stable or falling, then a rise of > 20% is required for the diagnosis of a type 4a MI, as with re-infarction". These recommendations were based on recent data from TRITON-TIMI 38, and the prognostic relevance of post-PCI biomarker markers in the patient with a recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has not been sufficiently validated to be applied clinically.

### Relationship between troponin on presentation and in-hospital mortality in patients with ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention [^112yuGiX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Troponin Levels

Baseline troponin levels were obtained for all patients on presentation before PCI using each hospital's standard clinical troponin I (TnI) or troponin T (TnT) assay. Values from point‐of‐care assays were not included in the study. In most cases, the troponin draw occurred in the emergency department during the initial patient assessment. Each center's clinical laboratory was queried to determine the institution‐specific fourth‐generation assay and reference ranges in use during the study period. To adjust for interhospital heterogeneity in troponin assay use and differences in assay calibration between TnI and TnT, 10 values were transformed into "troponin folds", calculated using the ratio of the absolute value of the patient's presenting troponin level to the site‐specific assay's upper limit of normal, an approach that has been used previously in the analysis of multicenter cardiac biomarker data. 11 A troponin fold of 1 represents a value matching the upper limit of the reference range. Patients with an undetectable troponin level were assigned a troponin fold of 0.

### Evaluation of troponin T criteria for periprocedural myocardial infarction in patients with acute coronary syndromes [^112pwayo]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

In patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), the diagnosis of periprocedural myocardial infarction is often problematic when the pre-PCI levels of cardiac troponin T (TnT) are elevated. Thus, we examined different TnT criteria for periprocedural myocardial infarction when the pre-PCI TnT levels were elevated and also the associations between the post-PCI cardiac marker levels and outcomes. We established the relation between the post-PCI creatine kinase-MB (CKMB) and TnT levels in 582 patients (315 with acute coronary syndromes and 272 with stable coronary heart disease). A post-PCI increase in the CKMB levels to 14.7 μg/L (3 × the upper reference limit [URL] in men) corresponded to a TnT of 0.23 μg/L. In the 85 patients with acute coronary syndromes and normal CKMB, but elevated post peak TnT levels before PCI (performed at a median of 5 days, interquartile range 3 to 7), the post-PCI cardiac marker increases were as follows: 21 (24.7%) with a ≥ 20% increase in TnT, 10 (11.8%) with an CKMB level > 3 × URL, and 12 (14%) with an absolute TnT increase of > 0.09 μg/L (p < 0.005 for both). In the patients with stable coronary heart disease and post-PCI cardiac markers > 3× URL compared to those without markers elevations, the rate of freedom from death or nonfatal myocardial infarction was 88% for those with TnT elevations versus 99% (p < 0.001, log-rank) and 84% for those with CKMB elevations versus 98% (p < 0.001, log-rank). Of the patients with acute coronary syndromes, the post-PCI marker levels did not influence the outcomes. In conclusion, in patients with acute coronary syndromes and elevated TnT levels undergoing PCI several days later, ≥ 20% increases in TnT were more common than absolute increments in the TnT or CKMB levels of > 3× URL. Also, periprocedural cardiac marker elevations in patients with acute coronary syndromes did not have prognostic significance.

### Effect of percutaneous coronary intervention on quality of life: a consensus statement from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions [^115F59e7]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes (ST-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] and non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome [NSTE-ACS]) — primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and invasive strategies are associated with fewer adverse events and early quality of life (QoL) gains. In pooled analyses, primary PCI is associated with reduced mortality, stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, reinfarction, and recurrent ischemia compared with fibrinolysis, and re-PCI for recurrent nonfatal MI is considerably lower in PCI cohorts than in fibrinolytic-treated patients. For STEMI, use of stent, or intervention with balloon angioplasty is associated with early (i.e., 6 months) improvement in QoL. In NSTE-ACS, a routine invasive strategy reduces the composite risk of death or nonfatal MI, severe angina, and rehospitalization over the ensuing 1–2 years versus an ischemia-guided approach, and compared with a non-invasive strategy, an invasive strategy reduces duration of initial hospital stay, readmission rate, anginal symptoms, and the number of required anti-anginal medications.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^1144Bv5h]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Procedural myocardial injury — cardiac troponin (cTn) sampling and attribution: Where the second value is rising, further sampling should be performed to document the peak cTn value. Increasing levels after the procedure can only be attributed with certainty to procedural myocardial injury when the preprocedural cTn values are normal (≤ 99th percentile URL), or if they are stable or falling. For patients with only a single preprocedural baseline value that is normal or mildly elevated followed by postprocedural values that continue to increase, the postprocedural increase should be attributed to the index event. To diagnose procedural myocardial injury when only a single preprocedural cTn value exists, cTn values need to be stable or falling postprocedure, then show a subsequent increase that exceeds the 99th percentile URL, and if not returned to baseline the increase should be ≥ 20% with an absolute value greater than the 99th percentile URL.

### Influence of timing of troponin elevation on clinical outcomes and use of evidence-based therapies for patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes [^111A9fBA]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Previous studies in clinical trial populations have demonstrated that patients presenting with positive troponin levels have a higher risk of mortality than patients with later positive troponin levels, but the influence of the timing of troponin elevation has not been previously characterized. We evaluate the impact of the timing of troponin elevation on clinical outcomes and adherence to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association acute care guidelines for patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes.

Methods

We examined inhospital outcomes and use of acute (< 24 hours) medications and invasive cardiac procedures in 23,184 high-risk patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (positive cardiac markers or ischemic ST-segment changes) during 2001 to 2002 from 396 US hospitals participating in the Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress ADverse Outcomes with Early Implementation of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines (CRUSADE) Initiative. Baseline and peak troponin values were recorded and were designated as positive if above the cutoff value used at each institution to designate definite myocardial necrosis.

Results

In the study cohort, 53.2% of patients presented with baseline positive troponin levels, 30.6% had baseline negative/later positive troponin levels, and 16.2% had negative troponin levels during the entire hospitalization. Patients with baseline positive troponin levels had a higher risk of inhospital mortality than patients with baseline negative/later positive troponin levels (6.5% versus 4.1%) and were less likely to undergo early cardiac catheterization or percutaneous coronary intervention. The use of acute aspirin (in approximately 91% of patients), heparin (85%), and beta-blockers (78%) was similar in patients with baseline-positive versus later-positive troponin levels.

Conclusion

These findings demonstrate that evidence-based therapies and interventions for non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes are underused in patients with elevated troponin levels, but baseline troponin elevations, which are associated with a higher risk of inhospital mortality, do not stimulate more aggressive care.

### Prognostic relevance of type 4a myocardial infarction and periprocedural myocardial injury in patients with non-ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction [^111hFFgx]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

Periprocedural myocardial injury (PMI) with or without type 4a myocardial infarction (MI) might occur in patients with non–ST-segment–elevation MI (NSTEMI) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This study investigated the incidence and prognostic relevance of these events, according to current definitions, in patients with NSTEMI undergoing PCI. The best cardiac troponin I (cTnI) threshold of PMI for prognostic stratification is also suggested.

METHODS:

Consecutive patients with NSTEMI from January 2017 to April 2022 undergoing PCI with stable or falling pre-PCI cTnI levels were enrolled. According to the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction, the study population was stratified into those experiencing (1) PMI with type 4a MI, (2) PMI without type 4a MI, or (3) no PMI. Post-PCI cTnI increase > 20% with an absolute postprocedural value of ≥ 5 times the 99th percentile upper reference limit within 48 hours after PCI was used to define PMI. The primary end point was 1-year all-cause mortality, and the secondary end point consisted of major adverse cardiovascular events at 1 year, including all-cause mortality, nonfatal reinfarction, urgent revascularization, nonfatal ischemic stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure. Internal validation was performed in patients enrolled between May 2022 and April 2023.

RESULTS:

Among 1412 patients with NSTEMI undergoing PCI with stable or falling cTnI levels at baseline, 240 (17%) experienced PMI with type 4a MI, 288 (20.4%) experienced PMI without type 4a MI, and 884 (62.6%) experienced no PMI. PMI was associated with an increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes, with patients with type 4a MI demonstrating the highest rates of 1-year all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events. A post-PCI ΔcTnI > 20% but ≤ 40% showed similar outcomes to patients without PMI, whereas > 40% was identified as the optimal threshold for prognostically relevant PMI, confirmed in an internal validation cohort of 305 patients.

CONCLUSIONS:

Periprocedural ischemic events were frequent in patients with NSTEMI undergoing PCI with prognostic implications. A post-PCI ΔcTnI > 40%, combined with an absolute postprocedural value of ≥ 5 times the 99th percentile upper reference limit, was identified as the optimal threshold for diagnosing prognostically relevant PMI. Recognizing these events may improve risk stratification and management of patients with NSTEMI.

Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE ACS) in adult emergency department (ED) patients — initial risk stratification recommendations state: Level A recommendations: None specified. Level B recommendations: In adult patients without evidence of ST-elevation ACS, the History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, Troponin (HEART) score can be used as a clinical prediction instrument for risk stratification, and a low score (≤ 3) predicts 30-day MACE miss rate within a range of 0% to 2%. Level C recommendations: In adult patients without evidence of ST-elevation ACS, other risk-stratification tools, such as Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI), can be used to predict rate of 30-day MACE. Potential Benefit of Implementing the Recommendations includes decreased use of limited resources, and Potential Harm of Implementing the Recommendations is the potential for missed cases of preventable MI or death.

Methods

The database used for this analysis is not available for wider sharing given the limitations of the data‐use agreements with participating institutions. Study code is available upon reasonable request.

Cohort

The Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Cardiovascular Consortium is an ongoing, prospective, multicenter quality‐improvement registry of all patients undergoing PCI at every nonfederal hospital in the state of Michigan. The consortium includes a total of 47 hospitals, and details of the registry's formation and data collection procedures have been described previously. 6, 7 Briefly, participating centers collect demographic, clinical, procedural, and in‐hospital outcomes data for consecutive patients undergoing PCI for all indications. Data collection procedures and diagnostic definitions are based on those used in the NCDR (National Cardiovascular Data Registry) CathPCI database. 8 STEMI patients are identified based on clinical symptoms and standard ECG criteria. 9 All participating sites undergo a periodic audit (including clinical and ECG data) by a central auditor to ensure the reliability of patient diagnoses and clinical data entry.

Our study cohort for this analysis included patients who presented to the emergency department and underwent primary PCI for STEMI over a 6‐year period from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2015. Patients who were transferred to another facility for PCI or those who had PCI while admitted for another reason were excluded. We also excluded patients without baseline troponin levels obtained at hospital presentation and those who suffered prehospital cardiac arrest, were on chronic dialysis therapy, or had missing demographic or clinical data for estimation of predicted mortality risk. The primary outcome of interest was in‐hospital mortality following PCI.

### Glycoprotein IIb-IIIa inhibitors in the emergency department for patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes: principles and practices [^115fTxHT]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although the benefit of platelet inhibition by glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa inhibitors in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is well established, emergency physicians and cardiologists have different perspectives regarding their optimum administration, especially upstream before PCI. In this article, two emergency physicians and two cardiologists analyze data and discuss relevant issues, including the ischemic benefits vs. the risk of bleeding associated with GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors in appropriate patients, for example, those with an elevated troponin level or who undergo revascularization. The emergency physicians support early identification of high-risk non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome patients and early administration of GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors, which are linked to improved patient outcomes. The cardiologists emphasize risk stratification to identify patients in whom the expected reduction in ischemic complications outweighs the risk of increased bleeding with these agents. GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors should be considered in patients with unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) in whom PCI is planned, especially those with high-risk features or elevated serum troponin levels. It is reasonable to start this treatment upstream of intervention, pending further studies investigating the optimal timing of initiation of therapy in appropriate patients.

### Ability of minor elevations of troponins I and T to predict benefit from an early invasive strategy in patients with unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction: results from a randomized trial [^111gziGF]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Context

Cardiac troponins I (cTnI) and T (cTnT) are useful for assessing prognosis in patients with unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI). However, the use of cardiac troponins for predicting benefit of an invasive vs conservative strategy in this patient population is not clear.

Objective

To prospectively test whether an early invasive strategy provides greater benefit than a conservative strategy in acute coronary syndrome patients with elevated baseline troponin levels.

Design

Prospective, randomized trial conducted from December 1997 to June 2000.

Setting

One hundred sixty-nine community and tertiary care hospitals in 9 countries.

Participants

A total of 2220 patients with acute coronary syndrome were enrolled. Baseline troponin level data were available for analysis in 1821, and 1780 completed the 6-month follow-up.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive (1) an early invasive strategy of coronary angiography between 4 and 48 hours after randomization and revascularization when feasible based on coronary anatomy (n = 1114) or (2) a conservative strategy of medical treatment and, if stable, predischarge exercise tolerance testing (n = 1106). Conservative strategy patients underwent coronary angiography and revascularization only if they manifested recurrent ischemia at rest or on provocative testing.

Main Outcome Measure

Composite end point of death, MI, or rehospitalization for acute coronary syndrome at 6 months.

Results

Patients with a cTnI level of 0.1 ng/mL or more (n = 1087) experienced a significant reduction in the primary end point with the invasive vs conservative strategy (15.3% vs 25.0%; odds ratio [OR], 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40–0.73). Patients with cTnI levels of less than 0.1 ng/mL had no detectable benefit from early invasive management (16.0% vs 12.4%; OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.89–2.05; P < .001 for interaction). The benefit of invasive vs conservative management through 30 days was evident even among patients with low-level (0.1–0.4 ng/mL) cTnI elevation (4.4% vs 16.5%; OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.08–0.69). Directionally similar results were observed with cTnT.

Conclusion

In patients with clinically documented acute coronary syndrome who are treated with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, even small elevations in cTnI and cTnT identify high-risk patients who derive a large clinical benefit from an early invasive strategy.
