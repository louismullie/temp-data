## Question

A 58-year-old woman presents to your clinic with complaints of aching and heaviness in her lower legs, especially after standing for long periods at her job as a cashier. On examination, she has mild bilateral lower leg edema and visible varicose veins. She has no signs of acute thrombosis or arterial insufficiency. She asks what non-pharmacological measures she can take to help with her symptoms.

According to current guidelines, what advice should you give this patient regarding exercise for her chronic venous insufficiency symptoms?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what exercise advice to give a 58-year-old woman with symptomatic chronic venous insufficiency and varicose veins, including how to reconcile guideline recommendations with the limited quality of evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and CEAP classification. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines actually recommend about exercise. Next, I will appraise the evidence quality and magnitude of benefit. After that, I need to translate this into practical, individualized exercise guidance. Finally, I should integrate exercise with other nonpharmacologic measures and set expectations about outcomes and follow-up, making sure I cite the best sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and classification. The patient has symptomatic varicose veins with edema and occupational prolonged standing, which places her at CEAP C2S (varicose veins with symptoms) and possibly C3 if edema is persistent, and there is no evidence of acute DVT or arterial disease, so exercise is not contraindicated from a vascular standpoint [^notfound].

> Next, I should review authoritative guideline positions on exercise. The ESVS 2022 guideline explicitly recommends advising exercise to reduce venous symptoms in patients with symptomatic chronic venous disease, which directly applies to her presentation, and this is echoed across multiple ESVS sections addressing nonpharmacologic care in CVD [^6e8c465c] [^1fb746d1]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify whether this is a strong or conditional recommendation and how it integrates with other therapies. ESVS frames exercise within a broader conservative approach that includes compression and lifestyle measures, but the direction is consistent: exercise is advised for symptom relief in symptomatic CVD [^6e8c465c].

> I will now examine the evidence quality. The 2023 Cochrane review of exercise for non-ulcerated CVI included only five small RCTs with 146 participants and found very low-certainty evidence, unable to demonstrate clear, consistent benefits across symptom scales, hemodynamics, or quality of life, and concluded that evidence is insufficient to make firm claims about exercise efficacy in this population [^9eba7527]. Wait, let me verify the earlier review; the 2016 Cochrane review similarly concluded insufficient evidence due to small samples and high risk of bias, reinforcing the uncertainty signal [^decce190]. So, while guidelines recommend exercise, the certainty of benefit is low, and patients should be counseled accordingly [^9eba7527].

> But wait, what if exercise still helps mechanistically even if trials are small? Let me consider the pathophysiology. Chronic venous insufficiency reflects venous hypertension from valvular incompetence and impaired calf muscle pump function; activating the calf muscle pump during walking and targeted exercises can reduce ambulatory venous pressure and improve symptoms, which is why guidelines still endorse exercise despite limited trial data, particularly in patients with occupational standing exposure where pump activation is otherwise limited [^6e8c465c] [^cc382c73]. I should double-check that this mechanism is consistently cited; yes, contemporary reviews and guidelines continue to emphasize calf muscle pump activation as a rationale for exercise in CVD [^cc382c73].

> Now, translating this into practical advice, I need to ensure the plan is realistic for a cashier who stands all day. I would recommend daily walking for at least 30 minutes, ideally in intervals during breaks or before/after shifts, because rhythmic calf contraction enhances venous return; if continuous walking is not feasible, 10-minute bouts three times daily are reasonable [^notfound]. Let me think about specific exercises; simple seated or standing calf raises, ankle dorsiflexion/plantarflexion, and toe curls can be done discreetly at work or at home to strengthen the gastrocnemius-soleus complex and improve pump efficiency, and I should emphasize consistency rather than intensity to avoid discouragement [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify that these are the types of exercises linked to improved calf pump function; although high-quality RCTs are sparse, physiologic studies and guideline statements support calf muscle activation improving hemodynamics, which justifies prescribing these low-risk, low-cost maneuvers [^6e8c465c] [^cc382c73].

> I need to ensure the exercise plan is integrated with other nonpharmacologic measures. Compression therapy remains first-line for symptom control and edema reduction; I would offer below-knee graduated compression stockings at 15–20 mmHg for symptom relief, escalating to 20–30 mmHg if edema persists, and counsel on proper fit and adherence, as guidelines strongly support compression for symptomatic CVD and edema [^87177320] [^b4ac8104]. I should also reinforce leg elevation when feasible, weight management, and skin care to prevent dermatitis, since these adjuncts synergize with exercise to mitigate venous hypertension and symptoms [^750c045f] [^002bcab6].

> Let me set expectations transparently. Given the very low certainty of evidence, I cannot promise large, guaranteed symptom reductions from exercise alone, but the physiologic rationale is sound, the risks are minimal, and guidelines still advise exercise as part of comprehensive care; benefits, if present, are likely modest and cumulative with adherence over weeks to months [^9eba7527] [^6e8c465c]. I should confirm that patients understand this uncertainty and are motivated to trial exercise for 6–8 weeks with symptom tracking, adjusting the plan based on response and tolerability [^notfound].

> Next, I should review follow-up and safety. I would reassess symptoms and edema in 6–8 weeks to gauge response, reinforce adherence, and adjust compression or exercise intensity as needed; if symptoms progress or skin changes develop, I should escalate compression, consider venoactive drugs, or evaluate for interventional options per ESVS pathways for symptomatic CVD [^a530b8a5] [^cb15005d]. Hold on, I should verify that we are not missing arterial disease; given her age and risk profile, a quick ABI would be reasonable if pulses are diminished or symptoms atypical, but her presentation is classic for primary venous disease without arterial insufficiency, so exercise remains safe to prescribe [^notfound].

> In summary, I should advise her that current guidelines recommend regular exercise to reduce venous symptoms, even though high-quality evidence is limited; a practical, sustainable plan of daily walking and calf-muscle activation during shifts, combined with compression and elevation, is reasonable, safe, and aligned with best practice, with modest, individualized benefits expected over time and close follow-up to tailor therapy [^6e8c465c] [^87177320] [^9eba7527].

---

Exercise is recommended for patients with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) because it **activates the calf muscle pump** [^cc382c73], reduces venous hypertension, and improves symptoms such as edema, heaviness, and fatigue [^6e8c465c]. Guidelines advise **regular walking** [^6e8c465c] or cycling for 30–60 minutes most days, plus calf raises and ankle pumps to strengthen the pump and reduce reflux [^notfound]. Exercise is safe, with no increase in thrombotic risk, and should be combined with compression and leg elevation for best results [^87177320] [^750c045f]. Benefits are modest and may take 4–6 weeks to appear, so adherence is key [^notfound].

---

## Physiological rationale for exercise in CVI

Exercise improves CVI symptoms via **calf muscle pump activation**, which propels blood upward and reduces venous pressure; stronger calf muscles sustain this effect even at rest [^cc382c73]. Exercise also lessens reflux and edema, improving comfort and function [^8c3b38de].

---

## Evidence supporting exercise in CVI

Although high-quality RCTs are limited, guidelines and reviews support exercise for symptom relief in non-ulcer CVI [^6e8c465c]. The 2023 Cochrane review found **very low-certainty evidence** that exercise may improve symptoms and quality of life, but larger, better trials are needed [^9eba7527]. Still, physiologic benefits and guideline endorsements support recommending exercise [^6e8c465c].

---

## Specific exercise recommendations

Guidelines and expert opinion support the following **practical regimen**:

| **Exercise type** | **Frequency** | **Intensity** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Walking | 5–7 days/week | Moderate (brisk) | 30–60 minutes |
| Cycling (stationary or outdoor) | 3–5 days/week | Moderate | 30–45 minutes |
| Calf raises | 2–3 sets/day | 10–15 reps/set | 2–3 minutes |
| Ankle pumps | 2–3 sets/day | 10–15 reps/set | 2–3 minutes |

---

These activities are **safe, feasible, and effective** for most patients with CVI [^notfound].

---

## Safety considerations and precautions

Exercise is generally safe for CVI, with **no increase in thrombotic risk**; patients with active ulcers or severe pain should use caution and coordinate with their clinician [^notfound]. Key precautions include:

- **Start slowly**: Gradually increase intensity and duration to avoid discomfort or injury.
- **Use compression**: Wear graduated compression stockings during exercise to enhance venous return and reduce edema [^87177320].
- **Elevate legs**: Elevate legs above heart level for 15–30 minutes after exercise to reduce swelling [^750c045f].
- **Monitor symptoms**: Stop if pain, swelling, or fatigue worsens significantly.

---

## Integration with other non-pharmacological interventions

Exercise is most effective when combined with:

- **Compression therapy**: Graduated stockings (15–20 mmHg) reduce edema and symptoms [^87177320] [^b4ac8104].
- **Leg elevation**: 15–30 minutes, 2–3 times daily, to reduce edema and improve comfort [^750c045f].
- **Weight management**: Weight loss reduces venous pressure and symptom burden [^05526f5c].
- **Skin care**: Moisturize and protect skin to prevent dermatitis and ulcers [^e2ca3d5c].

---

## Expected outcomes and timeline

Patients can expect **modest improvements** in edema, heaviness, and fatigue within 4–6 weeks of regular exercise, with greater benefits after 3 months. Adherence is critical, and combining exercise with compression and elevation yields the best results [^87177320] [^750c045f].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

Tailor exercise to **age, comorbidities, and preferences**. Older adults or those with arthritis may prefer pool-based or seated exercises; supervised programs can improve adherence and outcomes [^bfc63932].

---

Exercise is a **core non-pharmacologic therapy** for CVI: it activates the calf pump, lowers venous pressure, and improves symptoms. A program of walking or cycling plus calf raises, with compression and elevation, is safe and effective; benefits are modest and build over weeks, so persistence matters [^6e8c465c] [^87177320].

### Physical exercise for the treatment of non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency [^9eba7527]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a condition related to chronic venous disease that may progress to venous leg ulceration and impair quality of life of those affected. Treatments such as physical exercise may be useful to reduce CVI symptoms. This is an update of an earlier Cochrane Review.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of physical exercise programmes for the treatment of individuals with non-ulcerated CVI.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 28 March 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing exercise programmes with no exercise in people with non-ulcerated CVI.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were intensity of disease signs and symptoms, ejection fraction, venous refilling time, and incidence of venous leg ulcer. Our secondary outcomes were quality of life, exercise capacity, muscle strength, incidence of surgical intervention, and ankle joint mobility. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included five RCTs involving 146 participants. The studies compared a physical exercise group with a control group that did not perform a structured exercise programme. The exercise protocols differed between studies. We assessed three studies to be at an overall unclear risk of bias, one study at overall high risk of bias, and one study at overall low risk of bias. We were not able to combine data in meta-analysis as studies did not report all outcomes, and different methods were used to measure and report outcomes. Two studies reported intensity of CVI disease signs and symptoms using a validated scale. There was no clear difference in signs and symptoms between groups in baseline to six months after treatment (Venous Clinical Severity Score mean difference (MD) -0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.02 to 2.26; 28 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence), and we are uncertain if exercise alters the intensity of signs and symptoms eight weeks after treatment (MD -4.07, 95% CI -6.53 to -1.61; 21 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in ejection fraction between groups from baseline to six months follow-up (MD 4.88, 95% CI -1.82 to 11.58; 28 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Three studies reported on venous refilling time. We are uncertain if there is an improvement in venous refilling time between groups for baseline to six-month changes (MD 10.70 seconds, 95% CI 8.86 to 12.54; 23 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence) or baseline to eight-week change (MD 9.15 seconds, 95% CI 5.53 to 12.77 for right side; MD 7.25 seconds, 95% CI 5.23 to 9.27 for left side; 21 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in venous refilling index for baseline to six-month changes (MD 0.57 mL/min, 95% CI -0.96 to 2.10; 28 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). No included studies reported the incidence of venous leg ulcers. One study reported health-related quality of life using validated instruments (Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study (VEINES) and 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS)). We are uncertain if exercise alters baseline to six-month changes in health-related quality of life between groups (VEINES-QOL: MD 4.60, 95% CI 0.78 to 8.42; SF-36 PCS: MD 5.40, 95% CI 0.63 to 10.17; SF-36 MCS: MD 0.40, 95% CI -3.85 to 4.65; 40 participants, 1 study; all very low-certainty evidence). Another study used the Chronic Venous Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (CIVIQ-20), and we are uncertain if exercise alters baseline to eight-week changes in health-related quality of life between groups (MD 39.36, 95% CI 30.18 to 48.54; 21 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). One study reported no differences between groups without presenting data. There was no clear difference between groups in exercise capacity measured as time on treadmill (baseline to six-month changes) (MD -0.53 minutes, 95% CI -5.25 to 4.19; 35 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if exercise improves exercise capacity as assessed by the 6-minute walking test (MD 77.74 metres, 95% CI 58.93 to 96.55; 21 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Muscle strength was measured using dynamometry or using heel lifts counts. We are uncertain if exercise increases peak torque/body weight (120 revolutions per minute) (changes from baseline to six months MD 3.10 ft-lb, 95% CI 0.98 to 5.22; 29 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference between groups in baseline to eight-week change in strength measured by a hand dynamometer (MD 12.24 lb, 95% CI -7.61 to 32.09 for the right side; MD 11.25, 95% CI -14.10 to 36.60 for the left side; 21 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if there is an increase in heel lifts (n) (baseline to six-month changes) between groups (MD 7.70, 95% CI 0.94 to 14.46; 39 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference between groups in ankle mobility measured during dynamometry (baseline to six-month change MD -1.40 degrees, 95% CI -4.77 to 1.97; 29 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if exercise increases plantar flexion measured by a goniometer (baseline to eight-week change MD 12.13 degrees, 95% CI 8.28 to 15.98 for right leg; MD 10.95 degrees, 95% CI 7.93 to 13.97 for left leg; 21 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). In all cases, we downgraded the certainty of evidence due to risk of bias and imprecision.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of physical exercise in people with chronic venous disease. Future research into the effect of physical exercise should consider types of exercise protocols (intensity, frequency, and time), sample size, blinding, and homogeneity according to the severity of disease.

### Physical exercise for the treatment of non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency [^decce190]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a common disease that causes discomfort and impairs the quality of life of affected persons. Treatments such as physical exercise that aim to increase the movement of the ankle joint and strengthen the muscle pump in the calf of the leg may be useful to reduce the symptoms of CVI.

Objectives

To assess and summarise the existing clinical evidence on the efficacy and safety of physical exercise programmes for the treatment of individuals with non-ulcerated CVI.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register (May 2016). In addition, the CIS searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 4) and trial databases for details of ongoing or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing exercise with no exercise programmes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the search results and selected eligible studies. We resolved disagreements by discussion. We summarised and double-checked details from included studies. We attempted to contact trial authors for missing data, but obtained no further information.

Main Results

We included two trials involving 54 participants with CVI. Many of our review outcomes were not reported or reported by only one of the two studies. The intensity of disease signs and symptoms was measured in both studies but using different scales; we were therefore unable to pool the data. One study reported no difference between the exercise and control groups whereas the second reported a reduction in symptoms in the exercise group. In one study, increases in change in ejection fraction compared with baseline (mean difference (MD) 4.88%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.16 to 6.60; 30 participants; P < 0.00001), half venous refilling time (MD 4.20 seconds, 95% CI 3.28 to 5.12; 23 participants; P < 0.00001) and total venous refilling time (MD 9.40 seconds, 95% CI 7.77 to 11.03; 23 participants; P < 0.00001) were observed in the exercise group compared with the control group. One study reported no difference between the exercise and control groups with regard to quality of life or ankle range of motion. Although muscle strength assessed by dynamometry at slow speed did not differ between the two groups in this study, variable peak torque at fast speed was lower in the control group than in the exercise group (2.8 ± 0.9 compared with -0.3 ± 0.6, P < 0.03). The incidence of venous leg ulcers, incidence of surgical intervention to treat symptoms related to CVI and exercise capacity were not assessed or reported in either of the included trials. We rated both included studies as at high risk of bias; hence, these data should be interpreted carefully. Due to the small number of studies and small sample size, we were not able to verify indirectness and publication bias. Therefore, we judged the overall quality of evidence as very low according to the GRADE approach.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently insufficient evidence available to assess the efficacy of physical exercise in people with CVI. Future research into the effect of physical exercise should consider types of exercise protocols (intensity, frequency and time), sample size, blinding and homogeneity according to the severity of disease.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for preventing venous insufficiency in a standing worker population [^ee2b675b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a common problem, affecting up to 50% of the population in industrialised countries. It is a chronic condition which, if untreated, can progress to serious complications that in turn can interfere with working ability. Standing at work is a known risk factor for CVI, yet the true effect of non-pharmacological preventive strategies remains unknown. This is an update of a review first published in 2012.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of non-pharmacological strategies and devices to prevent CVI in a standing worker population.

Search Methods

For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched September 2013) and CENTRAL (2013, Issue 8). We also handsearched reference lists of relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and non-randomised controlled trials that recruited standing workers to evaluate non-pharmacological devices or strategies used to prevent CVI were eligible for inclusion. Trials had to report an objective measure of clinical features of CVI or complaints associated with this condition in order to be included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Selection of the trials, quality assessment and data abstraction were completed independently by two review authors. We resolved disagreements by discussion. Only one trial was eligible for inclusion in the review so we did not perform meta-analyses.

Main Results

The primary outcomes of this review were clinical features of CVI and its associated symptoms. No new included studies were identified for this update. One prospective cross-over trial was included in this review. It measured the effect of no compression followed by two phases with different gradients of compression stockings on symptoms in 19 female flight attendants who were required to stand, almost continuously, for long periods of time. The included study provided some evidence that compression stockings improved symptoms of leg fatigue in standing workers. However, the strength of the evidence in this review is weak as it is based on only one very small trial which was at high risk of bias. The included study did not address any of the secondary outcomes including quality of life or economic impact of the interventions. Nor did the study report the length of time that the population were required to stand at work. Furthermore, no trials were found which measured the effectiveness of other non-pharmacological interventions or strategies aimed at preventing CVI in standing workers.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to the extremely limited number of trials, there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for preventing CVI in standing workers. Further large-scale studies examining all possible non-pharmacological interventions and outcomes are required.

### Physical activity in patients with venous leg ulcer – between engagement and avoidance. A patient perspective [^a05f465f]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

Physical activity as (ii) 'instructions and support'

In this category the chronic nature of venous disease and the importance of physical activity to increase circulation were understood. However, individuals lacked the ability to initiate or perform exercise on their own. Physical activities required external support and reminders, as individuals lacked initiative or discipline or were overwhelmed by barriers. The lack of initiative and discipline was reinforced by insufficient and contradictory information. Physical activity as a treatment strategy was understood as the responsibility of the caregivers, leading to a wish for someone else to take the responsibility or at least share the responsibility with the individuals. They were disappointed in health care providers who focused solely on ulcer care and not on the patient's well-being.

No, no. They didn't say anything about what I could do myself. There was just concentration on getting rid of that sore. (P 19)

The patient isn't encouraged to contribute himself in any way… If the patient doesn't realize what he or she can do, even the best doctor's no help. (P 22)

When you turn up for treatment only for your leg you could be pushed a bit. I think you're at your most receptive then… They look at sores and change bandages and do what they can with that and don't bother so much about the rest of the person. (P 14)

Individuals in this category want to follow given advice, and clear written exercise programmes, adapted and adjusted for each one, preferably including instructions. Physical activity should be prescribed, not only generally recommended. Individuals demonstrated the belief that frequent encouragement and reminders would facilitate physical activity.

Not just changing the bandage but 'do so-and-so, this-and-that exercise'. Then get a leaflet with exercises and illustrations. And then people will do this. They want to get rid of their ulcers. No one thinks they're any fun. This should be a must. (P 22)

Actually I'm a bit lazy, I'd need someone to say 'now it's ten o'clock, now we're going for a walk'. Someone who gets you going, you get… once the ulcer has healed, then it's fine. (P 3)

And once again it was the physios that nagged [laughter]. We need that nagging, it's good. (P 16)

### Physical activity in patients with venous leg ulcer – between engagement and avoidance. A patient perspective [^003c86d3]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

Briggs and Flemmingsuggested that a change in care focus was required, among both health care professionals and patients, from viewing leg ulceration as an acute event, to viewing it as a chronic condition with needs comparable to those of other chronic conditions. The shift from specialists' healing rates to self-care and symptom management (reducing pain and improving mobility) may in turn affect healing, as also argued by Persoon et al.

Irrespective of category, few of our participants had been encouraged by health care providers to consider physical activity as an optional treatment strategy or to find ways to exercise despite the inconveniences of venous insufficiency and recurrent leg ulcer. This is worrying, as clinical guidelines state the importance of encouraging mobility and physical activity to prevent ulcers. Vague and inaccurate lifestyle advice such as 'live as usual' and contradictory exercise advice, as found through the present study, are not fruitful strategies. This was especially evident in patients who felt that physical activity was the responsibility of health care providers – as in the category 'instruction and support' – and patients who felt that physical activity was risk-taking – as in 'fear of injury'.

Health professionals' ability to impart clear-cut and consistent information must be strongly improved, likewise their ability to support and encourage physical activity. However, as demonstrated by our participants in the categories 'fear of injury' and 'a wish to stay normal', some patients are reluctant or unable to absorb information. This in turn may make them deny that there is anything wrong, as in 'a wish to stay normal' or to wrongly believe and expect that physical activity will cause injury – 'fear of injury'.

In our study, the perception of physical activity was closely related not only to the 'chronic–acute' dimension (Figure 1), but also to personal factors such as initiative, discipline, self-confidence, skills, past experience, health beliefs, motivation, insecurity and fear. We named this dimension 'engagement–avoidance' as these personal factors influence the ways barriers and limitations to physical activity are confronted or avoided.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of exercise therapy for venous leg ulcer healing and recurrence [^12107554]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

National guidelines in the United Kingdom have recommended regular exercise for individuals with venous leg ulceration. However, data on the effects of exercise on ulcer healing and recurrence are sparse. In the present study, we aimed to quantify the evidence for exercise regarding venous ulcer healing with respect to the primary outcomes of the proportion of healed ulcers and rate of ulcer recurrence. The secondary outcomes were improvement in ulcer symptoms, ulcer healing time, quality of life, compliance, and adverse events reported.

Methods

The review followed PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) guidelines using a registered protocol (CRD42021220925). The MEDLINE and Embase databases and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, European Union Clinical Trials, and International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registries were searched up to April 6, 2022 and included studies comparing exercise therapy and compression vs compression alone. Data for the proportion of healed ulcers were pooled using a fixed effects meta-analysis.

Results

After screening 1046 reports, 7 were included, with 121 participants allocated to exercise therapy and 125 to compression alone. All the reports were of randomized controlled trials and had reported ulcer healing at 12 weeks, with a pooled relative risk of ulcer healing of 1.38 for exercise vs compression (95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.71). Only one study had reported on recurrence; thus, data pooling was not performed. No differences between exercise and usual care were demonstrated. Compliance with exercise ranged from 33% to 81%. The included studies demonstrated low enrollment and a high risk of bias. Also, most of the trials had failed to demonstrate any differences in activity completed between the intervention and control arms.

Conclusions

A paucity of studies has examined leg ulcer recurrence after exercise programs, with no evidence to show that exercise is beneficial. Furthermore, the quality of evidence supporting exercise as an adjunct to ulcer healing is very low, and the trials demonstrated serious methodologic flaws, chiefly in recording the activity undertaken by the participants in the intervention arm. Future randomized controlled trials should implement activity monitoring and standardize the reporting of key patient, ulcer, and reflux characteristics to enable future meaningful meta-analyses to determine the role of exercise as an adjunct to venous leg ulceration healing.

### Supervised exercise training as an adjunct therapy for venous leg ulcers: a randomized controlled feasibility trial [^cc5a92e4]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Almost 70% of all leg ulcers have a venous component. 1 Occurrence of venous leg ulcers (VLUs) increases with age, with the U.K. prevalence in those > 65 years of age being estimated at about 3%. 2 VLUs arise from venous valve incompetence and calf muscle pump insufficiency, which leads to venous stasis and hypertension. This results in microcirculatory changes and localized tissue ischaemia. 3, 4 The natural history of VLUs is of a continuous cycle of healing and breakdown over decades: 5 VLUs are typically painful and heal slowly, resulting in an impaired quality of life (QoL), social isolation and reduced work productivity. 6 Treatment of this major health problem results in a considerable cost to the National Health Service (NHS): each ulcer costs up to £1981 per year; 7 estimated total healthcare costs are between £198 million and £400 million per year, 8, 9 with 65% of these costs occurring in the community. 10

Lower‐limb compression therapy is an established first‐line therapy for VLUs, 11 with approximately 50% of VLUs closing within 24 weeks. 10 Nevertheless, recurrence rates remain high (up to 56% within 4 years). 12 Furthermore, up to 30% of VLUs do not respond to compression alone, remain open after 1 year of treatment and need an average of 51 treatment visits to heal. 10, 11, 13 Therefore, it is important to develop adjunct therapies to compression, which would improve healing outcomes.

Lifestyle factors, including nutrition, exercise and smoking, are mentioned in guidelines on the management of VLUs but receive relatively little emphasis. 14 Exercise training might enhance ulcer healing and other aspects of health, and is routinely prescribed for other cardiovascular diseases (e.g. peripheral arterial disease and coronary artery disease). 15, 16 In patients with VLUs, supervised calf muscle exercise has been shown to increase calf muscle pump function and improve lower‐limb haemodynamics, 17, 18 as well as mobility and QoL. 19, 20, 21 A recent systematic review suggested further research to determine whether exercise training has an effect on ulcer healing and QoL. 22

### Prevention and treatment of the post-thrombotic syndrome [^e4210ed6]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a complication that develops in up to 50% of patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and manifests as symptoms and signs of chronic venous insufficiency of varying severity. PTS negatively affects patient's quality of life and causes significant burden to the healthcare system. The risk for PTS development can be markedly reduced by preventing DVT and providing appropriate anticoagulation once it develops. Patients with extensive proximal (iliofemoral) DVT may benefit from invasive interventions, such as catheter-directed thrombolysis. The effectiveness of elastic compression stockings (ECS) for PTS prevention has not been conclusively demonstrated in randomized trials. Treatment of PTS is primarily based on ECS, exercise and lifestyle modifications. The effectiveness of various pharmacologic agents for PTS treatment remains controversial. Surgical or radiological interventions for vein reconstruction or revascularization may be considered in refractory cases. This review summarizes current evidence regarding prevention and treatment of PTS of the lower limbs in adults.

### Balneotherapy for chronic venous insufficiency [^b277e76f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a progressive and common disease that affects the superficial and deep venous systems of the lower limbs. CVI is characterised by valvular incompetence, reflux, venous obstruction or a combination of these symptoms, with consequent distal venous hypertension. Clinical manifestations of CVI include oedema, pain, skin changes, ulcerations and dilated skin veins in the lower limbs. It places a large financial burden on health systems. There is a wide variety of treatment options for CVI, ranging from surgery and medication to compression and physiotherapy. Balneotherapy (treatments involving water) may be a relatively cheap and efficient way to deliver physiotherapy to people with CVI. This is an update of a review first published in 2019.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of balneotherapy for the treatment of people with chronic venous insufficiency.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 28 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing balneotherapy to no treatment or other types of treatment for CVI. We also included studies that used a combination of treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. disease severity, 2. health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and 3.

Adverse Effects

Our secondary outcomes were 1. pain, 2. oedema, 3. leg ulcer incidence and 4. skin pigmentation changes. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included nine randomised controlled trials involving 1126 participants with CVI. Seven studies evaluated balneotherapy versus no treatment, one study evaluated balneotherapy versus a phlebotonic drug (melilotus officinalis), and one study evaluated balneotherapy versus dryland exercises. We downgraded our certainty in the evidence due to a lack of blinding of participants and investigators, participant-reported outcomes and imprecision. Balneotherapy versus no treatment Balneotherapy compared to no treatment probably results in slightly improved disease severity signs and symptoms scores as assessed by the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS; mean difference (MD) -1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.02 to -0.49; 3 studies, 671 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy compared to no treatment may improve HRQoL as assessed by the Chronic Venous Insufficiency Quality of Life Questionnaire 2 (CIVIQ2) at three months, but we are very uncertain about the results (MD -10.46, 95% CI -19.21 to -1.71; 2 studies, 153 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The intervention may improve HRQoL at 12 months (MD -4.48, 95% CI -8.61 to -0.36; 2 studies, 417 participants; low-certainty evidence). It is unclear if the intervention has an effect at six months (MD -2.99, 95% CI -6.53 to 0.56; 2 studies, 436 participants; low-certainty evidence) or nine months (MD -6.40, 95% CI -13.84 to 1.04; 1 study, 59 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy compared with no treatment may have little or no effect on the occurrence of adverse effects. The main adverse effects were thromboembolic events (odds radio (OR) 0.35, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.42; 3 studies, 584 participants; low-certainty evidence), erysipelas (OR 2.58, 95% CI 0.65 to 10.22; 2 studies, 519 participants; low-certainty evidence) and palpitations (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.52; 1 study, 59 participants; low-certainty evidence). No studies reported any serious adverse effects. Balneotherapy compared with no treatment may improve pain scores slightly at three months (MD -1.12, 95% CI -1.35 to -0.88; 2 studies, 354 participants; low-certainty evidence); and six months (MD -1.02, 95% CI -1.25 to -0.78; 2 studies, 352 participants; low-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy compared with no treatment may have little or no effect on oedema (measured by leg circumference) at 24 days to three months, but we are very uncertain about the results (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.32 cm, 95% CI -0.70 to 1.34; 3 studies, 369 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy compared with no treatment may have little or no effect on the incidence of leg ulcers at 12 months, but we are very uncertain about the results (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.27 to 4.14; 2 studies, 449 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy compared with no treatment may slightly reduce skin pigmentation changes as measured by the pigmentation index at 12 months (MD -3.60, 95% CI -5.95 to -1.25; 1 study, 59 participants; low-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy versus melilotus officinalis For the comparison balneotherapy versus a phlebotonic drug (melilotus officinalis), there was little or no difference in pain symptoms (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.87; 1 study, 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or oedema (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.27; 1 study, 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but we are very uncertain about the results. The study reported no other outcomes of interest. Balneotherapy versus dryland exercise For the comparison balneotherapy versus dryland exercise, evidence from one study showed that balneotherapy may improve HRQoL as assessed by the Varicose Vein Symptom Questionnaire (VVSymQ), but we are very uncertain about the results (MD -3.00, 95% CI -3.80 to -2.20; 34 participants, very low-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy compared with dryland exercises may reduce oedema (leg volume) after five sessions of treatment (right leg: MD -840.70, 95% CI -1053.26 to -628.14; left leg: MD -767.50, 95% CI -910.07 to -624.93; 1 study, 34 participants, low-certainty evidence). The study reported no other outcomes of interest.

Authors' Conclusions

For the comparison balneotherapy versus no treatment, we identified moderate-certainty evidence that the intervention improves disease severity signs and symptoms scores slightly, low-certainty evidence that it improves pain and skin pigmentation changes, and very low-certainty evidence that it improves HRQoL. Balneotherapy compared with no treatment made little or no difference to adverse effects, oedema or incidence of leg ulcers. Evidence comparing balneotherapy with other interventions was very limited. To ensure adequate comparison between trials, future trials should standardise measurements of outcomes (e.g. disease severity signs and symptoms score, HRQoL, pain and oedema) and follow-up time points.

SCAI chronic venous disease — compression therapy for symptomatic lower-extremity disease is addressed as follows. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins and/or chronic venous insufficiency, the SCAI guideline panel suggests compression therapy rather than no compression therapy (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). For patients with venous ulcers, the SCAI guideline panel recommends compression therapy rather than no compression therapy (strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). Remarks indicate that some patients may prefer interventional alternatives such as sclerotherapy, phlebectomy, or ablation if appropriate, and that stronger grades of compression therapy may be more effective.

### How to evaluate and choose the proper treatments for patients with lower extremity venous disease [^3ced44c1]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

With an increasing number of interventional and noninterventional treatment options available for venous disorders, it is important that patients undergo a thorough and systematic evaluation. Clinical evaluation should include a personal and family history of venous thromboembolism (VTE), varicose veins, and thrombophilia as these factors affect response and recurrence of disease. Patient should undergo diagnostic and quality of life assessment using validated tools to monitor response to treatment. Duplex ultrasound, both deep and superficial veins, documenting both obstruction and reflux is initial imaging with CT and MRI indicated to document pelvic, iliac vein, and IVC patency and pathology. Conservative therapy including compression, healthy lifestyle with diet, and exercise. New and novel interventional therapies are available for patients with venous disease with recent randomized controlled trials and multisocietal guidelines providing evidence-based recommendations for patients with superficial and deep venous disease. Since the use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies post venous intervention is not well studied nor standardized, patients should routinely undergo evaluation for ongoing risk of recurrent thrombosis and stent occlusion. Finally, patients should be counseled that superficial and deep venous disease is a chronic and often progressive disease, and follow-up at least annually is recommended.

### Effects of preventive use of compression stockings for elderly with chronic venous insufficiency and swollen legs: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^78b15a5d]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic venous insufficiency refers to a condition with impaired blood flow in the deep leg veins, and is usually caused by inadequate venous valves. The condition is characterized by symptoms like oedema, skin changes, fatigue, leg pain and a sensation of heaviness in the leg, and can be diagnosed by using ultrasound techniques to detect venous reflux and pooling of blood in deep leg veins. Venous insufficiency may develop into chronic leg ulcer and deep vein thrombosis. Venous thrombosis may damage the valves, and symptoms and signs of chronic venous insufficiency following a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are called post-thrombotic syndrome. The Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification is an accepted standard for classifying chronic venous disorders. The chronic venous disorders are classified from C0 to C6 based on the severity of venous symptoms. The prevalence of venous insufficiency varies considerably between genders, ethnic backgrounds and age groups. A German cross-sectional study from 2008 included more than 3000 people aged 18 to 79 years, and estimated the overall prevalence of venous insufficiency to 31%. The risk of venous insufficiency increases with age.

Physical activity, smoking cessation, weight reduction, leg elevation, anticoagulant drugs and medical compression stockings may reduce symptoms and prevent progress of chronic venous insufficiency. External compression, such as medical compression stockings, may reduce oedema and swelling, and improve microcirculation. Medical compression stockings reach the knee or the hip and usually exert a pressure of 20 to 40 mmHg. Different standards exist, but according to the European standard, compression stockings are categorised into four classes. Class 1 stockings exert pressures below 20 mmHg and are used to prevent oedema. Class 2 stockings exert pressures between 20 and 30 mmHg and are used in the prevention of venous insufficiency and varicose veins. Class 3 stockings result in high compressions between 30 and 40 mmHg and are used for chronic venous insufficiency, whereas class 4 stockings exert very high compression above 40 mmHg and are primarily used in the treatment of lymphoedema.

### Systematic review of adapted physical activity and therapeutic education of patients with chronic venous disease [^bfc63932]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic venous disease (CVD), comprising impaired lower limb venous return, will lead to chronic distal venous pressure overload manifested by various clinical signs and symptoms and resulting in diminished quality of life. The CEAP (Clinical, Etiology, Anatomy, and Pathophysiology) classification of CVD distinguishes six stages (C0-C6) using clinical, etiologic, anatomic, and pathophysiologic parameters. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of adapted physical activity (APA) and patient-oriented therapeutic education (PTE) programs on the clinical signs, symptoms, and quality of life of patients with CVD.

Methods

Our analysis, in accordance with the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) recommendations, included a search of PubMed, CINAHL and LiSSa databases, using a single search equation.

Results

A total of 21 studies were selected for analysis. The analysis revealed first, that patients at stage C0 to C5 had had access to an APA program. This therapy alleviated the clinical signs and symptoms and improved the patients' quality of life. The beneficial effects of APA were greater in the programs that had included aquatic activities than in the program that were exclusively dry-land programs. Second, patients at stage C6 had predominantly followed a PTE program. This therapy showed beneficial effects on the clinical signs and symptoms. However, the quality of life had rarely been assessed.

Conclusions

At present, APA and PTE programs comprise useful and complementary therapeutic options for the care of patients with CVD. Two of the studies included in our review had evaluated the effects of combining these two approaches, notably in the context of balneotherapy, and reported promising results.

### Society of Interventional Radiology position statement on the management of chronic iliofemoral venous obstruction with endovascular placement of metallic stents [^03a6d01a]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Chronic iliofemoral venous obstruction — conservative therapy should precede stenting: In patients with chronic iliofemoral venous obstruction, efforts to alleviate symptoms and optimize limb function using conservative means should be made before placing stents (Level of Evidence E, Strength of Recommendation Strong). Patients should be educated about venous disease and efforts made to counter misperceptions, ongoing risk factors for DVT recurrence should be reviewed and appropriate antithrombotic therapy provided, and patients with symptoms should be encouraged to utilize compression therapy unless it is contraindicated. Compression therapy is more likely to be effective with active efforts to size garments properly and other adherence supports, and for stockings, compliance may be aided by starting with garments of lower strength (eg, 20–30 mm Hg) and increasing as dictated by residual symptoms and patient tolerance. Although large definitive trials have not been completed, oral diosmin and supervised exercise therapy may also reduce symptoms in selected patients, and when benign compressive mass lesions are present, treatments targeted to the specific lesion may be reasonable prior to venous stent placement.

### Treatment of superficial venous disease of the lower leg [^f2154693]. AVLS (2013). Medium credibility.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework — these recommendations have been determined by the method suggested by the GRADE working group. For each guideline, the letter A, B or C marks the quality of current evidence as high, medium or low quality. The grade of recommendation of a guideline can be strong (1) or weak (2), depending on the risk and burden of a particular diagnostic test or a therapeutic procedure to the patient vs. the expected benefit. The words 'we recommend' are used for GRADE 1 — strong recommendations — if the benefits clearly outweigh risks and burdens, or vice versa; the words 'we suggest' are used for GRADE 2 — weak recommendations — when the benefits are closely balanced with risks and burdens. Where current evidence is weak or lacking, the degree of consensus of the committee reflects the grade with the quality of the recommendation adjusted accordingly.

### Balneotherapy for chronic venous insufficiency [^ff12158f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a progressive and common disease that affects the superficial and deep venous systems of the lower limbs. CVI is characterised by valvular incompetence, reflux, venous obstruction, or a combination of these with consequent distal venous hypertension. Clinical manifestations of CVI include oedema, pain, skin changes, ulcerations and dilated skin veins in the lower limbs. It can result in a large financial burden on health systems. There is a wide variety of treatment options or therapies for CVI, ranging from surgery and medication to compression and physiotherapy. Balneotherapy (treatments involving water) is a relatively cheap option and potentially efficient way to deliver physical therapy for people with CVI.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of balneotherapy for the treatment of people with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI).

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED and CINAHL databases, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the Clinical Trials.gov trials register to August 2018. We searched the LILACS and IBECS databases. We also checked references, searched citations and contacted study authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing balneotherapy with no treatment or other types of treatment for CVI. We also included studies that used a combination of treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently reviewed studies retrieved by the search strategies. Both review authors independently assessed selected studies for complete analysis. We resolved conflicts through discussion. We attempted to contact trial authors for missing data, obtaining additional information. For binary outcomes (leg ulcer incidence and adverse events), we presented the results using odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes (disease severity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), pain, oedema, skin pigmentation), we presented the results as a mean difference (MD) with 95% CI.

Main Results

We included seven randomised controlled trials with 891 participants (outpatients in secondary care). We found no quasi-randomised controlled trials. Six studies (836 participants) evaluated balneotherapy versus no treatment. One study evaluated balneotherapy versus a phlebotonic drug (melilotus officinalis) (55 participants). There was a lack of blinding of participants and investigators, imprecision and inconsistency, which downgraded the certainty of the evidence. For the balneotherapy versus no treatment comparison, there probably was no improvement in favour of balneotherapy in disease severity signs and symptom score as assessed using the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) (MD -1.66, 95% CI -4.14 to 0.83; 2 studies, 484 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy probably resulted in a moderate improvement in HRQoL as assessed by the Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire 2 (CVIQ2) at three months (MD -9.38, 95% CI -18.18 to -0.57; 2 studies, 149 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), nine months (MD -10.46, 95% CI -11.81 to -9.11; 1 study; 55 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and 12 months (MD -4.99, 95% CI -9.19 to -0.78; 2 studies, 455 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in HRQoL between balneotherapy and no treatment at six months (MD -1.64, 95% CI -9.18 to 5.89; 2 studies, 445 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Balneotherapy probably slightly improved pain compared with no treatment (MD -1.23, 95% CI -1.33 to -1.13; 1 study; 390 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no clear effect related to oedema between the two groups at 24 days (MD 43.28 mL, 95% CI -102.74 to 189.30; 2 studies, 153 participants; very-low certainty evidence). There probably was no improvement in favour of balneotherapy in the incidence of leg ulcers (OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.82 to 3.48; 2 studies, 449 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was probably a reduction in incidence of skin pigmentation changes in favour of balneotherapy at 12 months (pigmentation index: MD -3.59, 95% CI -4.02 to -3.16; 1 study; 59 participants; low-certainty evidence). The main complications reported included erysipelas (OR 2.58, 95% CI 0.65 to 10.22; 2 studies, 519 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), thromboembolic events (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.42; 3 studies, 584 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and palpitations (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.52; 1 study; 59 participants; low-certainty evidence), with no clear evidence of an increase in reported adverse effects with balneotherapy. There were no serious adverse events reported in any of the studies. For the balneotherapy versus a phlebotonic drug (melilotus officinalis) comparison, we observed no clear difference in pain symptoms (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.87; 1 study; 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and oedema (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.27; 1 study; 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence). This single study did not report on the other outcomes of interest.

Authors' Conclusions

We identified moderate- to low-certainty evidence that suggests that balneotherapy may result in a moderate improvement in pain, quality of life and skin pigmentation changes and has no clear effect on disease severity signs and symptoms score, adverse effects, leg ulcers and oedema when compared with no treatment. For future studies, measurements of outcomes such as disease severity sign and symptom score, quality of life, pain and oedema and choice of time points during follow-up must be standardised for adequate comparison between trials.

### 2025 SCAI clinical practice guidelines for the management of chronic venous disease: this statement was endorsed by the Society for Vascular Medicine (SVM) [^3cf07881]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2025). High credibility.

SCAI chronic venous disease guideline — compression therapy for symptomatic varicose veins — states: For patients with symptomatic varicose veins, the SCAI guideline panel suggests compression therapy rather than no compression therapy (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Remarks note that some patients who value more rapid resolution of symptoms and are less concerned with potential complications may prefer interventional alternatives such as sclerotherapy, phlebectomy, or ablation if appropriate, and that stronger grades of compression therapy may be more effective. The guideline panel identified 7 randomized controlled trials that compared compression with no therapy; three RCTs measured discomfort and 2 studies reported adverse events, while quality of life was reported in 2 of the studies and edema in 1. Most studies assessed improvement in discomfort using a numerical rating scale from 0 or 1 (least pain) to 10 (most pain). Compression therapy may have little to no effect on wound complications, there was no clinically meaningful increase in adverse events, and for patients with advanced peripheral artery disease the panel agreed the risk of limb ischemia is negligible. Implementation considerations include nonadherence due to discomfort and difficulty to apply and remove garments, exacerbated by obesity, pregnancy, joint disease, frailty, and lack of flexibility; within the US, compression hosiery and donning devices are typically not reimbursed and payers are encouraged to cover donning devices. Compression therapy is suggested for symptom and edema relief in CVD of the lower extremities.

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

A single-blind, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in patients with CVI at a physiotherapy center specialized in the treatment of venous and lymphatic vascular conditions in Ávila (center of Spain) between October 2022 and September 2023. An experienced vascular therapist carried out the selection phase, gathering data on gender, age, body mass index (BMI), profession, affiliation, personal and family history of vascular and other diseases, as well as lifestyle habits such as smoking, physical exercise, and its intensity. The same therapist then performed an exploratory clinical examination to identify patients with stages C1, C2, C3, or C4 (C1, telangiectasis or reticular veins; C2, varicose veins; C3, edema; C4, skin changes), following the criteria proposed by the American Venous Forum committee. The examination was carried out in two positions (standing and supine) for both lower limbs to assess clinical signs of CVI and measure leg volume. The eligibility criteria for inclusion in the study were age between 35 and 75 years and the presence of mild, moderate, or severe CVI (grades C2, C3, and C4 on the Clinical, Etiologic, Anatomic, Pathophysiologic [CEAP] scale). Patients with uncompensated acute cardiac, hepatic and renal disease, acute obstructive vascular disease, acute trauma, primary lymphedema (negative Stemmer sign), and acute skin infections were excluded. Additionally, patients who were currently receiving CDT treatment or had received it in the last 6 months were excluded from this study.

Of the 25 patients recruited from the accessible population, 21 met these selection criteria and were assigned randomly to either an experimental group (n = 12) for CDT application or a control group (n = 9). Participants in the control group did not received any treatment. The physiotherapist who selected the patients and collected the initial data randomized the participants and did not participate in the post-intervention data collection, in addition to being blinded to the treatment to which the patients were subjected and another physiotherapist collected data on the severity of the disease, symptoms, centimetric measurements (CM) of the limb, impedance measurements, and QoL of the patients. Finally, a specialist radiologist performed an ultrasound study of the lower extremities, diagnosing the participants and collecting VF measurements. The CDT intervention was performed by a vascular physiotherapist who was also masked to the outcome measures and initial examination findings.

Chronic venous disease (CVD) is a common medical condition that results from venous hypertension of the limbs, leading to significant morbidity. The diagnosis is quite straightforward from patient history and obvious clinical manifestations. In the recent past, the availability of various invasive and noninvasive treatments has assisted in evaluation of such cases. Although compression therapy is the mainstay of management, newer surgical and other interventional techniques are now being considered for patients who do not respond to conventional medical management. The second part of this two-part review article will outline a diagnostic approach in cases of CVD and discuss the management principles encompassing conservative, pharmacological and interventional options.

### Physical activity in patients with venous leg ulcer – between engagement and avoidance. A patient perspective [^91d04e91]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

The present study addresses the perceived utility of physical activity in the context of venous leg ulcer in a group of 22 patients living with chronic venous insufficiency. A two-dimensional construct emerged from participants' experiences of physical activity based on (1) perception of venous leg ulcer as a chronic or acute condition, and (2) engagement or avoidance behaviour toward physical activity. Chronicity and behaviour combined together forms a 2 × 2 square housing four qualitatively different categories of perception and comprehension of physical activity that patients with venous leg ulcer might hold: (i) 'self-management', (ii) 'instructions and support', (iii) 'fear of injury' and (iv) 'a wish to stay normal'

Barriers to physical activity such as pain, chafing bandages and problems with shoes were experienced and expressed by the participants irrespective of way of thinking about physical activity (category). Information regarding the importance and benefits of physical activity as a treatment strategy was not given as routine and physiotherapy was not presented as a treatment option in primary care. Hence, understanding of the potential effect of physical activity and exercise on ulcer-healing and the prevention of recurrence was generally poor, as was understanding of the importance of adherence to compression therapy to optimize the effect of physical activity on venous circulation. These findings are consistent with those of Edwards et al.who reported that patients' knowledge of their condition was poor, with little understanding of the underlying pathology.

Whether or not leg ulceration was viewed as a chronic or an acute event was an important aspect of various ways of perceiving and understanding physical activity. The participants who understood the chronic nature of venous insufficiency as the cause of leg ulcer saw physical activity as a plausible treatment strategy, as seen in the categories 'self-management' and 'instruction and support'. This was in contrast with patients who conceived leg ulceration as an acute event, as in 'fear of injury' and 'a wish to stay normal' These findings are consistent with those of Flaherty, who found that participants who were fairly well-informed made conscious decisions about life-style changes, including exercise, whereas participants who displayed poor understanding of the disease and the treatment, especially of the chronicity of venous insufficiency, viewed their previous ulceration as an acute episode that had healed and considered themselves cured.

### Appropriateness of care in superficial venous disease [^5bb4db20]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic superficial venous disease, including superficial venous insufficiency, superficial venous thrombosis, and aneurysms, are prevalent conditions that affect millions of individuals worldwide. With chronic venous insufficiency specifically, the advent of office-based minimally invasive procedures in recent decades has significantly expanded access to outpatient treatment. However, as venous insufficiency is rarely life- or limb-threatening, the clinical diagnosis, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment indications should be considered carefully when recommending elective intervention. Appropriateness of care guidelines intend to aid providers and patients in the decision-making process, based on the available evidence in the scientific literature, to select the best care for the patient when treating their superficial venous disease.

### Treatment of superficial venous disease of the lower leg [^235e18b4]. AVLS (2013). Medium credibility.

Summary of guidelines for treatment of venous disease — compression therapy: We recommend against compression therapy as a prerequisite therapy for symptomatic venous reflux disease when other definitive treatments such as endovenous ablation are appropriate, and after interventional treatment, we recommend the use of a compression garment in the postoperative period; there is extra benefit to the patient in the form of reduced pain after use of compression, and the compression dosage and duration is at the discretion and clinical judgment of the treating physician. Compression therapy is an effective method for the management of symptoms related to superficial disease but it does not correct the source of reflux, and when patients have a correctable source of reflux definitive treatment should also be offered unless it is contraindicated or unwanted. Superficial venous insufficiency is a chronic disease and we recommend that patients with this disease be counseled to wear a compression garment even after definite treatment has been provided, and we suggest the treatment of some CEAP C2 patients with isolated varices by medical compression hose alone, with a short 1–2 week trial of compression hose appropriate where an alternative etiology of symptoms is considered.

### Varicose veins [^0135f599]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Varicose veins are caused by poorly functioning valves in the veins, and decreased elasticity of the vein wall, allowing pooling of blood within the veins, and their subsequent enlargement. Varicose veins affect up to 40% of adults, and are more common in obese people, and in women who have had more than two pregnancies.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in adults with varicose veins? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to January 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 39 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: compression stockings, endovenous laser, injection sclerotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, self-help (advice, avoidance of tight clothing, diet, elevation of legs, exercise), and surgery (stripping, avulsion, powered phlebectomy).

Results

Seven randomized trials and two prospective observational studies were included. Early exercise, compared with bed rest, was associated with a similar short-term risk of pulmonary embolism in patients with acute DVT and led to more rapid resolution of limb pain. In patients with acute DVT, a 6 month daily walking program led to similar degrees of vein recanalization and improvement in quality of life as controls. In patients with previous DVT, 30 min of vigorous treadmill exercise did not worsen venous symptoms and improved calf muscle flexibility; a 6 month exercise training program improved calf muscle strength and pump function; and high levels of physical activity at one month tended to be associated with reduced severity of postthrombotic symptoms during the subsequent 3 months.

Conclusions

Early walking exercise is safe in patients with acute DVT and may help to reduce acute symptoms. Exercise training does not increase leg symptoms acutely in patients with a previous DVT and may help to prevent or improve the postthrombotic syndrome.

### Medical management of venous ulcers [^e2ca3d5c]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Venous disease is the most common cause of chronic leg ulceration and represents an advanced clinical manifestation of venous insufficiency. Due to their frequency and chronicity, venous ulcers have a high socioeconomic impact, with treatment costs accounting for 1% of the health care budget in Western countries. The evaluation of patients with venous ulcers should include a thorough medical history for prior deep venous thrombosis, assessment for an hypercoagulable state, and a physical examination. Use of the CEAP (clinical, etiology, anatomy, pathophysiology) Classification System and the revised Venous Clinical Severity Scoring System is strongly recommended to characterize disease severity and assess response to treatment. This venous condition requires lifestyle modification, with affected individuals performing daily intervals of leg elevation to control edema; use of elastic compression garments; and moderate physical activity, such as walking wearing below-knee elastic stockings. Meticulous skin care, treatment of dermatitis, and prompt treatment of cellulitis are important aspects of medical management. The pharmacology of chronic venous insufficiency and venous ulcers include essentially two medications: pentoxifylline and phlebotropic agents. The micronized purified flavonoid fraction is an effective adjunct to compression therapy in patients with large, chronic ulceration.

### Effects of preventive use of compression stockings for elderly with chronic venous insufficiency and swollen legs: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ad57eaca]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Study selection, data extraction and analysis

We included systematic reviews (SRs) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) according to the following criteria: (a) study population of elderly (≥ 70 years) with venous insufficiency and swollen legs without recent (≤ 2 years) deep vein thrombosis; (b) evaluating the preventive effects of European standard compression stockings class 2 or 3; (c) compared to a different class of compression stockings, other interventions to promote venous backflow or no intervention; (d) assessed on thrombosis, leg ulcer and mobility (primary outcomes) or other health related outcomes such as pain, discomfort, quality of life or post-thrombotic syndrome (secondary outcomes). Compliance was not defined as an outcome in the original protocol, but following feedback, we included compliance as a secondary outcome post hoc.

Two reviewers independently assessed the titles and abstracts of records identified by the search. Records appearing to meet the inclusion criteria and those with insufficient details were obtained in full text. Two reviewers independently assessed the full text publications according to a pre-defined inclusion form. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

The first author (KTD) described the included trials with regard to population, intervention, comparison, outcome and main results in tables. Another reviewer (HTM) checked the extracted information. Two reviewers (KTD, HTM) independently assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the Risk of Bias assessment tool.

We conducted meta-analysis in Review Manager (RevMan5.3) software, when studies were sufficiently similar in terms of design, population, interventions and outcomes. We calculated relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, both with 95% confidence interval (CI). We used a random effects model to account for pooling effects due to the clinical heterogeneity of the included studies. Double-data entries were performed. We planned to do subgroup analysis based on population and degree of compression, but due to the small number of studies, this was not feasible.

We assessed the quality of the evidence by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). The assessment involves within-study risk of bias, directness of evidence, inconsistency of effect estimates (heterogeneity), precision of effect estimate and risk of publication bias. The GRADE assessment indicates the extent to which we can have confidence in the effect estimate. Confidence of the effect estimates were described as high, moderate, low and very low (Table 1).

### Compression therapy for occupational leg symptoms and chronic venous disorders-a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^41b9a810]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Leg discomfort and oedema are commonly attributed to a venous disorder (CVD) or chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) and treated with compression hosiery. The pressure needed to achieve clinical benefit is a matter of debate.

Design

We performed a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCT) that compared stockings exerting an ankle pressure of 10-20mmHg with placebo or no treatment and with stockings exerting a pressure of more than 20mmHg.

Methods

RCT were retrieved and analysed with the tools of the Cochrane Collaboration. Each study was reviewed independently. Subjective dichotomous and continuous factors and objective findings were pooled for statistical treatment.

Results

Eleven RCT fulfilled the predefined criteria. They included 1453 randomised subjects, 794 healthy people exposed to various forms of stress, 552 patients with a chronic venous disorder or chronic venous insufficiency and 141 patients after varicose vein surgery. Over all, compression with 10-20mmHg had a clear effect on oedema and symptoms as compared with < 10mmHg pressure, placebo stockings, or no treatment (p < .0001). No study showed a difference between 10–20 and > 20mmHg stockings.

Conclusions

Despite important methodological heterogeneity and sometimes sub-standard reporting the meta-analysis suggests that leg compression with 10-15mmHg is an effective treatment for CVD. Less pressure is ineffective and higher pressure may be of no additional benefit.

Calcium dobesilate — clinical benefit and safety in chronic venous disease: In adults with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) including CEAP C2, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported calcium dobesilate suggested as more effective than placebo in improving symptoms, with higher efficacy in more severe disease. In adults with chronic venous disease (CVD), a systematic review and meta-analysis of 45 RCTs with a separated analysis of 17 observational studies reported calcium dobesilate the most effective treatment in reducing leg volume. Safety data from a review state the risk of an adverse event with calcium dobesilate is low, with 13 known cases of agranulocytosis, less than incidence in the general population.

Chronic limb-threatening ischemia — exercise and rehabilitation: Regular exercise must be stressed as extremely important for both life and limb. Although CLTI studies are not available, numerous trials have confirmed the benefits of supervised exercise in IC, and exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation reduces the risk of subsequent myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality; it therefore seems reasonable to suggest that a postrevascularization walking-based exercise program would also benefit CLTI patients who are cleared for full weight-bearing.

### Management of chronic venous insufficiency in older adults [^579b32c8]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) develops as a consequence of valvular incompetence or venous obstruction over time and can significantly impair quality of life. Its prevalence and burden are highest among older adults, as the physiological changes of aging predispose to the onset and progression of CVI. We present an overview of the evaluation and management of CVI in older adults, with a focus on superficial venous disease. Current treatment modalities for superficial venous disease and their outcomes in older adults are discussed.
