## Question

Why hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in anuria?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in anuria and what the rationale is behind that contraindication. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanism of hydrochlorothiazide and where it acts in the nephron. Then, I should verify how anuria alters renal physiology and tubular delivery of filtrate. Next, I will examine whether thiazides can still be effective in severe renal impairment and where they lose utility. After that, I need to check the regulatory language across FDA labels to confirm the contraindication. Finally, I will synthesize the mechanistic and clinical reasoning and consider guideline implications and safer alternatives in this setting.

> Let me first confirm the drug's mechanism and site of action. Hydrochlorothiazide inhibits the sodium–chloride cotransporter (NCC) in the distal convoluted tubule, producing natriuresis and diuresis; this requires delivery of filtrate to the distal nephron to be effective, and the drug is eliminated unchanged by the kidney, which becomes relevant in renal failure [^112Cp5Ss] [^114yYzbH].

> Now, I need to define the pathophysiology of anuria. Anuria is essentially absent urine output, typically less than 100 mL per day, reflecting a catastrophic loss of glomerular filtration with no meaningful filtrate reaching downstream nephron segments; in this state, there is no delivery to the distal tubule where thiazides act, so the pharmacologic prerequisite for effect is missing [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify whether thiazides retain any efficacy in severe CKD before concluding they are useless in anuria. Thiazide diuretics become progressively less effective as eGFR declines below about 45 mL/min/1.73 m² and are generally considered ineffective below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² because tubular secretion and delivery to the distal tubule are impaired; this mechanistic limitation underpins guideline recommendations to prefer loop diuretics in advanced CKD, and it is even more extreme in anuria where there is essentially no filtrate at all [^113SDYtt] [^117JZ2ik] [^116S5khD].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory position across labels. Multiple FDA labels explicitly list anuria as a contraindication for hydrochlorothiazide-containing products, including standalone HCTZ, HCTZ with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and HCTZ with potassium-sparing agents; this aligns with the same contraindication for loop diuretics like furosemide, underscoring that the issue is class-wide in the setting of absent urine output [^115NsTdv] [^115nfLgt] [^113e5U8e] [^117C7PM6] [^1143UZ8K].

> I will now examine the clinical rationale. Administering a thiazide in anuria cannot produce diuresis because there is no filtrate to modify, yet the drug can still cause harm via electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, metabolic alkalosis) and volume shifts without therapeutic benefit; in severe renal disease, thiazides can also precipitate azotemia and worsen uremic symptoms, reinforcing that the risk–benefit calculus is unfavorable in anuria [^113hQ7S3] [^112FDEXK].

> But wait, what if the intent is antihypertensive rather than diuretic? Let me consider that nuance. Even though thiazides have early natriuretic and later vasodilatory effects, in the complete absence of urine output the hemodynamic milieu is unstable and electrolyte/fluid management is typically dialysis-driven; thus, attempting thiazide therapy in anuria offers no proven blood pressure advantage and may complicate volume and electrolyte management, so guideline-concordant care favors avoiding thiazides and relying on dialysis-based strategies and non-diuretic antihypertensives as appropriate [^115cnZuz].

> Next, I should review safer alternatives and guideline direction. In patients with advanced kidney disease or anuria who require diuresis, loop diuretics are preferred when there is any residual urine output because they act at the thick ascending limb and can still be effective at low flow, whereas in true anuria the appropriate management is renal replacement therapy; contemporary guidance also emphasizes close monitoring of electrolytes and kidney function when initiating or adjusting any diuretic in CKD, which is not feasible to fulfill meaningfully in anuria with thiazides [^117JZ2ik] [^113SDYtt] [^115jZRBm].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion ties mechanism to regulation to clinical practice. Hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in anuria because its action requires delivery of filtrate to the distal tubule, which is absent in anuria; administering it provides no therapeutic benefit while exposing patients to electrolyte and volume-related harms, and this is reflected consistently across FDA labeling and supported by pathophysiologic reasoning and guideline recommendations to avoid thiazides in severe renal dysfunction and to use loop diuretics or dialysis-based management instead [^115NsTdv] [^113SDYtt] [^117JZ2ik].

Hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in anuria because it **requires intact renal blood flow and tubular function** to deliver drug to its distal nephron site of action and to excrete sodium and water [^112Cp5Ss]. In anuria, there is **no urine flow to the distal tubule**, so HCTZ cannot produce diuresis and may worsen electrolyte imbalances and renal function without benefit [^113SDYtt]. Use of HCTZ in anuria risks **harm without therapeutic effect**, so it is contraindicated [^115NsTdv].

---

## Pharmacological mechanism of hydrochlorothiazide

HCTZ **inhibits the sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC)** in the distal convoluted tubule, reducing sodium and chloride reabsorption and increasing their excretion, which produces diuresis and natriuresis [^112Cp5Ss]. This effect depends on **adequate renal blood flow and tubular function** to deliver the drug to its site of action and to excrete sodium and water [^113SDYtt].

---

## Pathophysiology of anuria

Anuria is the **absence of urine output** — typically < 100 mL/day — and reflects severe renal dysfunction or obstruction, with little to no glomerular filtration and minimal or no urine flow through the nephron. This profoundly impairs drug delivery to the distal tubule and the kidney's ability to excrete sodium and water [^notfound].

---

## Rationale for contraindication in anuria

HCTZ is contraindicated in anuria because:

- **Lack of urine flow**: With no urine reaching the distal tubule, HCTZ cannot exert its diuretic effect, rendering it ineffective [^notfound].

- **Risk of electrolyte imbalance**: HCTZ can cause hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and metabolic alkalosis; in anuria, these may be severe and difficult to correct [^113hQ7S3].

- **Potential for renal harm**: In anuria, HCTZ may worsen renal function and electrolyte disturbances without benefit, increasing morbidity [^113hQ7S3].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

Clinical guidelines and FDA labeling consistently **contraindicate HCTZ in anuria** [^115NsTdv]. The FDA label states HCTZ is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to sulfonamide-derived drugs [^113izvhE]. Similarly, combination products containing HCTZ (e.g. losartan/HCTZ, valsartan/HCTZ) carry the same contraindication due to the HCTZ component [^115nfLgt] [^113e5U8e].

---

## Alternative therapeutic strategies

In patients with anuria, **management focuses on**:

- **Identifying and treating the underlying cause**: Address prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal causes to restore urine output [^notfound].

- **Dialysis**: Use hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis for fluid and electrolyte management when renal function is absent [^notfound].

- **Avoidance of thiazide diuretics**: Do not use HCTZ or other thiazides in anuria due to lack of efficacy and potential harm [^115NsTdv].

---

## Clinical consequences of ignoring contraindication

Using HCTZ in anuria can cause:

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Severe hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and metabolic alkalosis that are hard to correct [^113hQ7S3].

- **Worsening renal function**: Further renal impairment without therapeutic benefit [^113hQ7S3].

- **Increased morbidity**: Higher risk of arrhythmias, neuromuscular complications, and other adverse outcomes [^113hQ7S3].

---

Hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in anuria because it **requires urine flow to the distal tubule** to work; in anuria, there is no flow, so the drug is ineffective and may cause harm. Management should focus on correcting the cause and using dialysis as needed, while avoiding thiazide diuretics [^115NsTdv].

### Case report: a thiazide diuretic to treat polyuria induced by tolvaptan [^1176JHsX]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by the formation of numerous cysts in both kidneys, leading to renal function loss, with eventually need for renal replacement therapy in the majority of patients. ADPKD is the most common hereditary renal disease and occurs in 3 to 4 per 10,000 people in the general population, accounting for 10% of all patients receiving renal replacement therapy.

Tolvaptan, a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist, has recently been registered as the first treatment for ADPKD in Europe, Japan and Canada. In the TEMPO 3:4 trial, performed in ADPKD patients with relatively preserved kidney function and large kidneys, tolvaptan slowed the annual rate of renal function decline by 26% from − 3.70 to − 2.72 mL/min/1.73 m² when compared to placebo. Recently, the REPRISE trial demonstrated tolvaptan efficacy in later-stage ADPKD. Being a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist, tolvaptan causes aquaretic side-effects, such as polyuria (6.0 ± 1.8 l per day), thirst, nocturia and polydipsia. These side-effects impact quality of life and were the main reason for tolvaptan discontinuation in the major trials.

Additional treatment to reduce polyuria may be an option to improve tolvaptan tolerability. Since the polyuria is caused by a pharmacological blockade of the vasopressin V2 receptor, it is of interest to study drugs that are known to effectively reduce polyuria in a situation when vasopressin V2 receptor function is absent, such as in patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. In such patients hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) is known to reduce polyuria by up to 50%.

The Summary of Medicinal Products Characteristics of tolvaptan cautions that HCT is relatively contraindicated during tolvaptan use, because of the theoretical risk that concomitant use of tolvaptan (an aquaretic) and HCT (a diuretic, or better a saluretic), may cause severe dehydration.

In our center, 33 patients started tolvaptan treatment as part of the TEMPO 3:4 trial. We report data on one of these patients, who received HCT despite the aforementioned relative contraindication, as treatment for difficult-to-manage hypertension. This thiazide diuretic influenced his urinary volume notably.

### Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^113xwVaU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Fetal Toxicity

Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Thiazides cross the placenta and use of thiazides during pregnancy is associated with a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults.

5.2 Hypotension in Volume or Salt-Depleted Patients

Excessive reduction of blood pressure was rarely seen in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with irbesartan alone (< 0.1%) or with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (approximately 1%). Initiation of antihypertensive therapy may cause symptomatic hypotension in patients with intravascular volume or sodium depletion, e.g., in patients treated vigorously with diuretics or in patients on dialysis. Such volume depletion should be corrected prior to administration of antihypertensive therapy.

If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.

5.3 Hypersensitivity Reaction

Hydrochlorothiazide

Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history.

5.4 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

Hydrochlorothiazide

Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus.

Materials and Methods

Patients

Japanese patients aged ⩾20 years were enrolled in this study if they had essential hypertension, were already taking two or three antihypertensive drugs (at the time of the visit for signing the informed consent form), had a mean (of three measurements in one visit) seated DBP ⩾90 and ≤ 114 mm Hg at week −6 and week 0 (see Figure 1 for details of visits), had a mean seated systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≤ 200 mm Hg at week −6 and week 0, were an outpatient, were able to stop all current antihypertensive drugs (other than study medication) from week −6 through to the end of the study without risk and if they provided informed consent. Patients were excluded if they had any of the following: known or suspected secondary hypertension, cardiac disorders, a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack within the past 6 months, hepatic or renal dysfunctions, biliary atresia or cholestasis, hyperkalemia, anuria or blood dialysis, hyponatremia, malignant tumor or a disease requiring immunosuppressants. Patients were also excluded if they were < 80% or > 120% compliant during the run-in period. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval was acquired from all institutional review boards and all patients provided written informed consent that they were free to withdraw at any time during the study.

### Thiazides for kidney stone recurrence prevention [^115o6Vka]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

(ii) There was a trend for lower urine citrate among patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide compared to patients receiving placebo during follow-up. Reduction of urine citrate is a well known adverse effect of thiazides. The mechanism is thought to be thiazide-induced hypokalemia resulting in intracellular acidosis, stimulating avid citrate reabsorption in the proximal tubule. Indeed, patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide displayed a dose-dependent decrease in plasma potassium.

Nonadherence in NOSTONE was defined as missing > 20% of the daily doses of hydrochlorothiazide or placebo on the basis of patient report, and further separated into medical reasons (e.g. adverse effects necessitating a treatment discontinuation) and nonmedical reasons. Nonadherence was not different in patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide compared to patients receiving placebo. However, significant nonadherence was observed, ranging from 15% in the 12.5-mg hydrochlorothiazide group, to 24% in the 25-mg hydrochlorothiazide group, and to 26% in the 50-mg hydrochlorothiazide and placebo groups, respectively. To assess if nonadherence could explain the lack of a treatment benefit with hydrochlorothiazide, a per-protocol analysis was conducted. This analysis yielded very similar results as the intention-to-treat analysis, indicating that poor adherence cannot explain the trial results. Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that the high incidence of nonadherence may have biased the treatment effects in favor of the null hypothesis.

No significant variation was observed among the groups in terms of serious adverse events. But patients assigned to hydrochlorothiazide had a higher incidence of adverse events of particular concern, including newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus, hypokalemia, gout, and deteriorated kidney function, than those assigned to the placebo. Clearly, these adverse events observed in a trial with a median duration of 3 years need to be reconciled with the fact that thiazides are typically prescribed on a long-term basis, and in the case of kidney stone prevention, treatment is frequently initiated in young adults.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^117AiwWk]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

As all monogenic forms of hypertension have sodium retention as the main mechanism of the increase in blood pressure, increasing urinary sodium excretion is a logical and fundamental part of treatment of hypertension. Consistent with this understanding, thiazide diuretics are listed in hypertension guidelines as one of three equally weighted first-line antihypertensive options alongside calcium channel blockers and blockers of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS). Indeed, randomized control trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that when compared with placebo or no treatment, blood pressure lowering by these antihypertensive drug classes is accompanied by significant reductions of stroke and major cardiovascular events. In order to differentiate between the three options, a lot of discussion has been directed at side effect profiles. Multiple meta-analyses, for instance, have documented concerns that treatment with diuretics could lead to disruptions in electrolyte levels, to unfavorable metabolic effects, and to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. These data, though important, have generated a perhaps disproportionate fear of the side effects that can be associated with diuretic treatment.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^112SptCD]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease — medication dosing and safety — provides dosing with a dose "when waking up and 15mg 8 hours later)" as initial dosing and a range indicating doses "waking up and 15mg/30mg/30 mg 8 hours later". The medication is noted as being under a program "under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)". Contraindications are listed as: "Contraindications: History of significant liver impairment or injury, concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, abnormal blood sodium concentrations, unable to sense or respond to thirst, hypovolemia, uncorrected urinary outflow obstruction, anuria, pregnancy, breastfeeding" (CYP3A4: cytochrome P450 3A4). Adverse effects are listed as: "May cause: Polyuria, nocturia, polydipsia, frequent urination, hepatotoxicity, dizziness, hypovolemia, dehydration". Monitoring guidance states: "Monitor: Liver function tests, clinical signs/symptoms of hepatotoxicity, fluid status, potassium, sodium".

### Hydrochlorothiazide is America's most popular thiazide, but should It Be? [^114T3Cvz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

These key pharmacologic differences have contributed to the long‐standing debate among clinicians and hypertension experts about whether chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide is superior. Multiple systematic reviews and meta‐analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have previously demonstrated that the thiazide‐like diuretics better prevent cardiovascular events and all‐cause mortality compared with the thiazide‐type diuretics. These systematic reviews and meta‐analyses, however, included many RCTs conducted before 1990 and few RCTs of indapamide. Consequently, the generalizability of the findings to the current era may be limited as the prevalence and nature of cardiovascular disease risk factors have evolved and as we have refined our knowledge about which classes should be used first line for hypertension treatment. Observational studies have provided contrasting conclusions on this debate, with one finding no difference between chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazidewhereas another one showed better outcomes with hydrochlorothiazide, not chlorthalidone. However, the follow‐up period in these observational studies was probably too brief to detect differences in clinical end points and the conflicting findings are likely due to residual confounding. For these reasons, the available meta‐analyses and observational studies offer little practical guidance in thiazide selection. Instead, what may be more helpful for current clinicians is to recall the findings from more recent, large RCTs that have critically appraised these agents. The Table, lists several pivotal RCTs of the thiazides published since 2000 relevant to common and everyday clinical scenarios. Chlorthalidone and indapamide treat hypertension effectively and safely in several clinical settings, including in patients with multiple coronary artery disease risk factors, prior stroke, elderly age, and advanced chronic kidney disease. Additionally, small RCTs have demonstrated that combination therapy containing chlorthalidone provides superior hypertension treatment compared with combination therapy containing hydrochlorothiazide and to combination therapy without any thiazide diuretic, including among patients with stage 2 hypertension. Finally, the thiazide‐like diuretics offer pleiotropic protection against cardiovascular diseases independently of blood pressure reduction. In contrast, no cardiovascular benefit with hydrochlorothiazide treatment has been consistently found. Despite these randomized data, the hydrochlorothiazide‐versus‐chlorthalidone debate has continued in part because until recently no trial had directly compared the 2.

### Summary of revisions for the 2009 clinical practice recommendations [^111DXbTp]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Prevention and Management of Diabetes Complications:

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) cut points for use of thiazide or loop diuretics have been revised.
Pharmacologic therapy for patients with diabetes and hypertension should be with a regimen that includes either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. If needed to achieve blood pressure targets, a thiazide diuretic should be added to those with an estimated GFR (see below) ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and a loop diuretic for those with an estimated GFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m². (C)
Several dyslipidemia recommendations have been revised. If drug-treated patients do not reach the above targets on maximal tolerated statin therapy, a reduction in LDL cholesterol of ∼30–40% from baseline is an alternative therapeutic goal. (A) If targets are not reached on maximally tolerated doses of statins, combination therapy using statins and other lipid-lowering agents may be considered to achieve lipid targets but have not been evaluated in outcome studies for either CVD outcomes or safety. (E)
Several antiplatelet agent recommendations have been revised and/or the level of evidence has been changed. Use aspirin therapy (75–162 mg/day) as a primary prevention strategy in those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes at increased cardiovascular risk, including those who are > 40 years of age or who have additional risk factors (family history of CVD, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, or albuminuria). (C) For patients with CVD and documented ASA (acetylsalicylic acid, aspirin) allergy, clopidogrel (75 mg/day) should be used. (B) Combination therapy with aspirin (75–162 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) is reasonable for up to a year after an acute coronary syndrome. (B)
Coronary heart disease treatment recommendations have been revised and/or the level of evidence has been changed. In patients with known CVD, ACE inhibitor (C), aspirin (A), and statin therapy (A) (if not contraindicated) should be used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. In patients > 40 years of age with another cardiovascular risk factor (hypertension, family history, dyslipidemia, microalbuminuria, cardiac autonomic neuropathy, or smoking), aspirin and statin therapy (if not contraindicated) should be used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. (B) In patients with coronary heart failure (CHF), thiazolidinedione use is contraindicated. (C) Metformin may be used in patients with stable CHF if renal function is normal. It should be avoided in unstable or hospitalized patients with CHF. (C)
The recommendation in the "Retinopathy screening and treatment" section has been revised. Adults and children aged 10 years or older with type 1 diabetes should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist within 5 years after the onset of diabetes. (B)
One recommendation in the "Neuropathy screening and treatment" section has been moved to the "Foot care" section, and one has been revised. Screening for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy should be instituted at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Special testing is rarely needed and may not affect management or outcomes. (E)
The "Foot care" section has been extensively revised, including the recommendations. For all patients with diabetes, perform an annual comprehensive foot examination to identify risk factors predictive of ulcers and amputations. The foot examination should include inspection, assessment of foot pulses, and testing for loss of protective sensation (10-g monofilament plus testing any one of: vibration using 128-Hz tuning fork, pinprick sensation, ankle reflexes, or vibration perception threshold).

### Thiazides for kidney stone recurrence prevention [^116u2fPf]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

NOSTONE KEY FINDINGS AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS

NOSTONE enrolled 416 patients at 12 sites throughout Switzerland. Median follow-up time was 2.92 years, and 387 patients (93%) completed follow-up as planned. In the placebo group, 60 of 102 patients (59%) experienced the primary composite end point of symptomatic or radiologic recurrence. Numbers in the hydrochlorothiazide arms were 62 of 105 patients (59%) receiving 12.5 mg [rate ratio as compared to placebo (RR), 1.33; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.92–1.93], 61 of 108 patients (56%) receiving 25 mg (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.86–1.79), and 49 of 101 patients (49%) receiving 50 mg (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.63–1.36). There was no relation between hydrochlorothiazide dose and the primary end point (ratio of rate ratios, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.87–1.09; test for trend, P = 0.66). These results were confirmed by several sensitivity analyses, and subgroup analyses showed no evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect.

The NOSTONE results indicate that hydrochlorothiazide is not efficiently preventing recurrence of kidney stones. This presents a significant deviation from prevailing recommendations and the majority of prior thiazide trials, thus necessitating an extensive analysis. We highlight in the following section several important aspects of the NOSTONE trial design, and reconcile NOSTONE trial findings with the existing trial literature pertaining to the prevention of kidney stones.

NOSTONE selected patients with recurrent idiopathic calcium kidney stones, that would be treated with a thiazide according to current guidelines. However, as it was the case in most prior thiazide trials, NOSTONE did not specifically select patients with hypercalciuria. Indeed, urine calcium is a continuous risk factor for stone formation, and current guidelines recommend thiazides in all patients with recurrent calcium stones. Median baseline urine calcium in NOSTONE was 244 mg/24 h (6.1 mmol/24 h), and 63% of participants were hypercalciuric (defined as urine calcium > 200 mg/24 h or > 5 mmol/24 h). A subgroup analysis of the NOSTONE trial showed no benefit of hydrochlorothiazide compared to placebo in patients with hypercalciuria.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^117Corcw]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — therapeutic strategies for hypertension are as follows: In patients with diabetic or non-diabetic CKD, it is recommended that an office blood pressure (BP) of ≥ 140/90 mmHg be treated with lifestyle advice and BP-lowering medication, and it is recommended to lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) to a range of 130–139 mmHg; individualized treatment should be considered according to its tolerability and impact on renal function and electrolytes. Renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blockers are more effective at reducing albuminuria than other antihypertensive agents and are recommended as part of the treatment strategy in hypertensive patients in the presence of microalbuminuria or proteinuria; a combination of a RAS blocker with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) or a diuretic is recommended as initial therapy, whereas combinations of two RAS blockers are not recommended. In case of reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), specifically eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², avoid thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics and consider using a loop diuretic if required.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide (lisinopril with hydrochlorothiazide) [^116H42yQ]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

Pharmacodynamics

Administration of lisinopril to patients with hypertension results in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is usually not observed although it can occur and should be anticipated in volume and/or salt-depleted patients. (See WARNINGS .)

In most patients studied, onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour after oral administration of an individual dose of lisinopril, with peak reduction of blood pressure achieved by six hours.

In some patients achievement of optimal blood pressure reduction may require two to four weeks of therapy.

At recommended single daily doses, antihypertensive effects have been maintained for at least 24 hours, after dosing, although the effect at 24 hours was substantially smaller than the effect six hours after dosing.

The antihypertensive effects of lisinopril have continued during long-term therapy. Abrupt withdrawal of lisinopril has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure; nor with a significant overshoot of pretreatment blood pressure.

In hemodynamic studies in patients with essential hypertension, blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance with little or no change in cardiac output and in heart rate. In a study in nine hypertensive patients, following administration of lisinopril, there was an increase in mean renal blood flow that was not significant. Data from several small studies are inconsistent with respect to the effect of lisinopril on glomerular filtration rate in hypertensive patients with normal renal function, but suggest that changes, if any, are not large.

In patients with renovascular hypertension lisinopril has been shown to be well tolerated and effective in controlling blood pressure(see PRECAUTIONS).

Hydrochlorothiazide

The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown. Thiazides do not usually affect normal blood pressure.

Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic and antihypertensive. It affects the distal renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption. Hydrochlorothiazide increases excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of potassium and bicarbonate.

After oral use diuresis begins within two hours, peaks in about four hours and lasts about 6 to 12 hours.

Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidney. When plasma levels have been followed for at least 24 hours, the plasma half-life has been observed to vary between 5.6 and 14.8 hours. At least 61 percent of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood-brain barrier.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116nK1wj]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension — diuretics (potassium-sparing) dosing and cautions are as follows: Amiloride 5–10 with daily frequency 1 or 2 and triamterene 50–100 with daily frequency 1 or 2; as monotherapy, these agents are minimally effective antihypertensive agents, combination therapy with a thiazide-type diuretic can be considered in patients with hypokalemia on thiazide-type diuretic monotherapy, and clinicians should avoid use in patients with significant CKD (eg, GFR < 45 mL/min).

### Diuretic treatment of hypertension [^112cmVxo]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The results of this study raised the question whether all thiazide-type diuretics are equal. Several successful diuretic studies used chlorthalidone in a dose of up to 25 mg/day. A meta-analysis of trials done until 2004 reported similar clinical CV outcomes across the class. However, these studies used doses of these agents that were higher than the 12.5–25 mg/day dose of hydrochlorothiazide used in the ACCOMPLISH study. Recent data suggest that chlorthalidone is 1.5- to 2-fold more potent in lowering BP than hydrochlorothiazide. Thus, to achieve the beneficial effect with diuretics, one should use hydrochlorothiazide in a dose of up to at least 37.5 mg/day. Another thiazide-like diuretic that is less discussed is indapamide. This agent has less adverse effect on metabolic parameters than other diuretics, is more effective than enalapril in reducing left ventricular mass, is equivalent to enalapril in reducing microalbuminuria, and is effective in reducing CV morbidity and mortality in clinical trials. Thus, the use of indapamide as a leading diuretic agent may be worthwhile.

### Quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide [^115vWVx9]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

To minimize dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy.

Therapy Guided by Clinical Effect

Patients whose blood pressures are not adequately controlled with quinapril monotherapy may instead be given quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 10/12.5 or 20/12.5. Further increases of either or both components could depend on clinical response. The hydrochlorothiazide dose should generally not be increased until 2 to 3 weeks have elapsed. Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 25 mg of daily hydrochlorothiazide, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen, may achieve blood pressure control with less electrolyte disturbance if they are switched to quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 10/12.5 or 20/12.5.

Replacement Therapy

For convenience, patients who are adequately treated with 20 mg of quinapril and 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide and experience no significant electrolyte disturbances may instead wish to receive quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 20/25.

Use in Renal Impairment

Regimens of therapy with quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets need not take account of renal function as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2(serum creatinine roughly ≤ 3 mg/dL or 265 µmol/L). In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides. Therefore, quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets is not recommended for use in these patients.

### Understanding physicians' behavior toward alerts about nephrotoxic medications in outpatients: a cross-sectional analysis [^113t4HV4]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Although most outpatients are relatively healthy, many have chronic renal insufficiency, and high override rates for suggestions on renal dosing have been observed. To better understand the override of renal dosing alerts in an outpatient setting, we conducted a study to evaluate which patients were more frequently prescribed contraindicated medications, to assess providers' responses to suggestions, and to examine the drugs involved and the reasons for overrides.

Methods

We obtained data on renal alert overrides and the coded reasons for overrides cited by providers at the time of prescription from outpatient clinics and ambulatory hospital-based practices at a large academic health care center over a period of 3 years, from January 2009 to December 2011. For detailed chart review, a group of 6 trained clinicians developed the appropriateness criteria with excellent inter-rater reliability (κ = 0.93). We stratified providers by override frequency and then drew samples from the high- and low-frequency groups. We measured the rate of total overrides, rate of appropriate overrides, medications overridden, and the reason(s) for override.

Results

A total of 4120 renal alerts were triggered by 584 prescribers in the study period, among which 78.2% (3,221) were overridden. Almost half of the alerts were triggered by 40 providers and one-third was triggered by high-frequency overriders. The appropriateness rates were fairly similar, at 28.4% and 31.6% for high- and low-frequency overriders, respectively. Metformin, glyburide, hydrochlorothiazide, and nitrofurantoin were the most common drugs overridden. Physicians' appropriateness rates were higher than the rates for nurse practitioners (32.9% vs. 22.1%). Physicians with low frequency override rates had higher levels of appropriateness for metformin than the high frequency overriders (P = 0.005).

Conclusion

A small number of providers accounted for a large fraction of overrides, as was the case with a small number of drugs. These data suggest that a focused intervention targeting primarily these providers and medications has the potential to improve medication safety.

### Thiazide treatment in primary hyperparathyroidism – A new indication for an old medication? [^114QnBj3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Context

There is no therapy for control of hypercalciuria in nonoperable patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Thiazides are used for idiopathic hypercalciuria but are avoided in PHPT to prevent exacerbating hypercalcemia. Nevertheless, several reports suggested that thiazides may be safe in patients with PHPT.

Objective

To test the safety and efficacy of thiazides in PHPT.

Design

Retrospective analysis of medical records.

Setting

Endocrine clinic at a tertiary hospital.

Patients

Fourteen male and 58 female patients with PHPT treated with thiazides.

Interventions

Data were compared for each patient before and after thiazide administration.

Main Outcome Measures

Effect of thiazide on urine and serum calcium levels.

Results

Data are given as mean ± standard deviation. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 50 mg/d led to a decrease in mean levels of urine calcium (427 ± 174 mg/d to 251 ± 114 mg/d; P < 0.001) and parathyroid hormone (115 ± 57 ng/L to 74 ± 36 ng/L; P < 0.001), with no change in serum calcium level (10.7 ± 0.4 mg/dL off treatment, 10.5 ± 1.2 mg/dL on treatment, P = 0.4). Findings were consistent over all doses, with no difference in the extent of reduction in urine calcium level or change in serum calcium level by thiazide dose.

Conclusion

Thiazides may be effective even at a dose of 12.5 mg/d and safe at doses of up to 50 mg/d for controlling hypercalciuria in patients with PHPT and may have an advantage in decreasing serum parathyroid hormone level. However, careful monitoring for hypercalcemia is required.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on clinical assessment, management, and trajectory of patients hospitalized with heart Failure focused update: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^116E5MVj]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Dual nephron blockade and adjunct diuretic strategies — when high furosemide doses are not effective, dual nephron blockade with the addition of either a thiazide-like diuretic or a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (acetazolamide) can be considered. In the CLOROTIC trial of patients with acute HF, adding hydrochlorothiazide to an IV loop diuretic resulted in an increased diuretic response and more weight loss without a change in patient-reported dyspnea, although those receiving hydrochlorothiazide exhibited increases in serum creatinine, hypokalemia, and impaired kidney function compared with placebo, and the study was stopped prematurely due to slow enrollment, making clinical safety conclusions difficult to assess. Chlorothiazide has a short elimination half-life but is substantially more expensive, and observational data suggest that it does not increase net 24-hour urine output when compared with oral metolazone. Metolazone can be added to the IV loop diuretic at 2.5- to 5-mg doses once or twice daily. In the ADVOR trial, acetazolamide added to a loop diuretic for 3 days exhibited a greater rate of successful decongestion (42.2% vs 30.5%; P < 0.001) and a shorter duration of hospital stay compared with placebo, with no statistically significant differences in renal safety, hypokalemia, or hypotension between groups. The randomized PUSH-AHF trial showed greater natriuresis when diuretic agents were guided by spot urine sodium concentrations, without a difference in mortality or HF rehospitalization.

### Revisiting diuretic choice in chronic kidney disease [^1123ZWMM]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Existing guidelines offer little direction about the use of thiazide and loop diuretics in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This review summarizes recent studies impacting indications and safety considerations for these agents in patients with CKD.

Recent Findings

Chlorthalidone reduces blood pressure compared to placebo in patients with advanced CKD, challenging the belief that thiazide diuretics lose efficacy at lower glomerular filtration rates (GFR). Existing studies show no clear impact of thiazide or loop diuretic use on kidney or cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CKD. Sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have diuretic effects, but concomitant use of a diuretic does not diminish the preventive benefits of these agents against acute kidney injury (AKI). Despite theoretical concerns, thiazide diuretics likely do not worsen circulating vasopressin levels or cyst progression in polycystic kidney disease and may be useful for alleviating polyuria from tolvaptan. Diuretics cause multiple adverse effects, including electrolyte abnormalities, hemodynamic-mediated decrease in estimated GFR, and AKI.

Summary

Recent evidence supports expanded indications for diuretics in patients with kidney disease, including chlorthalidone for hypertension in advanced CKD. Monitoring electrolytes and estimated GFR is critical to ensure patient safety when prescribing these agents for patients with CKD.

### Thiazide diuretics as chronic antihypertensive therapy in patients with severe renal disease – is there a role in the absence of diuresis? [^115cnZuz]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether thiazides have a chronic antihypertensive effect, in the absence of diuresis, in patients with severe renal disease (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) or in those receiving dialysis.

Data Sources

A search was performed in PubMed, CENTRAL, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, using MeSH terms and/or key words. MeSH terms included kidney failure, chronic and exploded terms hydrochlorothiazide, renal dialysis, and thiazides. Key words included thiazide*, hydrochlorothiazide, chlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, indapamide, metolazone, methyclothiazide, bendroflumethiazide, hemodialysis, dialysis, kidney failure, renal failure, renal insufficiency, hypertension, vasodilation, vascular, and diuretics.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All relevant English-language publications were evaluated. Studies evaluating the efficacy of thiazides in renal insufficiency or dialysis were limited to those that included blood pressure measurements. Studies were included only if treatment duration was at least 4 weeks to evaluate chronic antihypertensive effects.

Data Synthesis

Thiazide diuretics are associated with a chronic reduction in peripheral vascular resistance secondary to a purported vasodilatory effect. However, few clinical studies have evaluated the chronic antihypertensive efficacy of thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics in patients with severe renal disease or those on dialysis. Agents studied include hydrochlorothiazide, chlorothiazide, indapamide, and metolazone, with results varying by drug and patient population. Hydrochlorothiazide 25–200 mg daily, chlorothiazide 500 mg twice daily, and indapamide 2.5 mg daily provided long-term blood pressure reduction in patients with severe renal disease who were not on dialysis. In studies involving patients on dialysis, hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg daily and metolazone 5 mg daily did not affect blood pressure; however, 1 study suggested that indapamide 2.5 mg daily may confer an antihypertensive effect. All studies were small (≤ 12 subjects) and had methodological limitations.

Conclusions

Thiazide diuretics may decrease peripheral vascular resistance independent of natriuresis. However, because current clinical data are inconclusive as to the efficacy of these agents at chronically lowering blood pressure in patients with severe renal disease or in those on dialysis, thiazide diuretics cannot be routinely recommended for this indication.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide [^115kLDnV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Phrmacodynamics

Administration of lisinopril to patients with hypertension results in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is usually not observed although it can occur and should be anticipated in volume and/or salt depleted patients. (See WARNINGS .)

In most patients studied, onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour after oral administration of an individual dose of lisinopril, with peak reduction of blood pressure achieved by six hours.

In some patients achievement of optimal blood pressure reduction may require two to four weeks of therapy.

At recommended single daily doses, antihypertensive effects have been maintained for at least 24 hours after dosing, although the effect at 24 hours was substantially smaller than the effect six hours after dosing.

The antihypertensive effects of lisinopril have continued during long-term therapy. Abrupt withdrawal of lisinopril has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure; nor with a significant overshoot of pretreatment blood pressure.

In hemodynamic studies in patients with essential hypertension, blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance with little or no change in cardiac output and in heart rate. In a study in nine hypertensive patients, following administration of lisinopril, there was an increase in mean renal blood flow that was not significant. Data from several small studies are inconsistent with respect to the effect of lisinopril on glomerular filtration rate in hypertensive patients with normal renal function, but suggest that changes, if any, are not large.

In patients with renovascular hypertension lisinopril has been shown to be well tolerated and effective in controlling blood pressure (see PRECAUTIONS).

Hydrochlorothiazide

The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown. Thiazides do not usually affect normal blood pressure.

Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic and antihypertensive. It affects the distal renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption. Hydrochlorothiazide increases excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of potassium and bicarbonate.

After oral use diuresis begins within two hours, peaks in about four hours and lasts about 6 to 12 hours.

Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidney. When plasma levels have been followed for at least 24 hours, the plasma half-life has been observed to vary between 5.6 and 14.8 hours. At least 61 percent of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood-brain barrier.

### Aliskiren hemifumarate and hydrochlorothiazide (Tekturna HCT) [^117ARipA]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

14.4 Aliskiren in Patients with Diabetes Treated with an ARB or ACEI (ALTITUDE study)

Patients with diabetes with renal disease (defined either by the presence of albuminuria or reduced GFR) were randomized to aliskiren 300 mg daily (n = 4296) or placebo (n = 4310). All patients were receiving background therapy with an ARB or ACEI. The primary efficacy outcome was the time to the first event of the primary composite endpoint consisting of cardiovascular death, resuscitated sudden death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, unplanned hospitalization for heart failure, onset of end stage renal disease, renal death, and doubling of serum creatinine concentration from baseline sustained for at least 1 month. After a median follow up of about 32 months, the trial was terminated early for lack of efficacy. Higher risk of renal impairment, hypotension and hyperkalemia was observed in aliskiren compared to placebo treated patients, as shown in Table 5.

The risk of stroke (3.4% aliskiren versus 2.7% placebo) and death (8.4% aliskiren versus 8.0% placebo) were also numerically higher in aliskiren-treated patients.

Study population

Eligibility criteria

Participants will be recruited according to the eligibility criteria detailed in Table 2.

Table 2
Eligibility criteria of the NOSTONE study

Criteria for withdrawal / discontinuation of participants

Criteria of IMP discontinuation or study discontinuation are listed in Table 3. Participants who permanently discontinue the IMP are expected to continue in the follow-up period and to attend all protocol-specified study visits. If study visits are not possible, a telephone consultation will be performed to determine if relevant health events / endpoints have occurred. A study participant who discontinues study participation prematurely for any reason is defined as dropout if the participant has already been randomized. A study participant who terminates the study before randomization is regarded as a screening failure.

Criteria for withdrawal / discontinuation of participants

Study assessments

Outpatients referred to stone clinics for metabolic stone work-up will be recruited for the trial. For work-up and follow-up visits of participants, the NOSTONE protocol strictly adheres to recommendations of the American and European guidelines on nephrolithiasis with regard to scheduling of patient visits, lab analyses and imaging. Prior to randomization, patients will undergo a screening visit to check health status (including lab values), eligibility and determine stone history. At randomization, eligible patients will undergo a low-dose, renal-limited non-iv contrast CT and receive the assigned IMP. Participants enrolled in the trial will be followed-up 3 months after randomization and thereafter with yearly visits and every 3 months through phone calls. Symptomatic recurrence will be assessed at follow-up visits and during phone calls between visits. Radiologic recurrence will be assessed at treatment end by a low-dose, renal-limited non-iv contrast CT.

### A European renal association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^116S5khD]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The 2023 ESH Guidelines emphasize that most individuals with CKD will not achieve target BP control with ACEi or ARB monotherapy, and dual combination by adding a dihydropyridine CCB or a diuretic should almost always be used to initiate the treatment in hypertensive patients with CKD as in most patients with hypertension. Nevertheless, the majority of patients with CKD would need triple combination to achieve target BP (Fig. 3). Dihydropyridine CCBs were shown to increase proteinuria when used in the absence of a RAS blocker in patients with proteinuric CKD. However, in the general hypertensive population, where the majority of patients do not have moderately or severely increased albuminuria, dihydropyridine CCBs have similar effects on kidney outcomes with RAS blockers or diuretics. Moreover, in a study of hypertensive patients of which 19% had moderately and 5% severely increased albuminuria at baseline, a combination of RAS blocker with a dihydropyridine CCBs was superior in reducing kidney outcomes compared with a RAS blocker–thiazide combination.

Diuretics are particularly useful in CKD patients, as these individuals are most often sodium-sensitive (especially if older, diabetic or obese) and have high prevalence of treatment resistant hypertension. Furthermore, diuretics were shown to effectively reduce proteinuria when added to RAS blockers in proteinuric CKD. When GFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m², thiazide diuretics become less effective, as they cannot reach their tubular site of action due to competition for tubular secretion with other substances that accumulate in CKD. This is theoretically also the case for thiazide-like diuretics, but recent RCT evidence indicated that at least chlorthalidone is clinically effective in lowering BP in patients with G4 CKD. In general, in patients with CKD G3b (eGFR 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m²), diuretic therapy should be modified and the dosing individualized, while in patients with CKD G4 (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), thiazides should be substituted with a loop diuretic. Within this class, torasemide might be preferred to furosemide because of its longer half-life, which allows a less frequent dosing scheme and a better adherence to treatment.

### Hydrochlorothiazide is America's most popular thiazide, but should It Be? [^1124uqff]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Reducing hypertension undertreatment at the population level is a simple but important goal for cardiovascular disease prevention, which we believe can be successfully addressed in part by leveraging currently available medications. A refined approach to thiazide prescribing is one potential cost‐effective strategy. To have more evidence‐based thiazide use, indapamide or chlorthalidone should be strongly considered over hydrochlorothiazide in certain contexts. We recommend indapamide or chlorthalidone as part of initial therapy when the target blood pressure is unlikely to be reached with a single agent; as additive therapy when the blood pressure remains well above goal despite initial treatment with non‐thiazide agents; when ambulatory blood pressure monitoring discovers nocturnal hypertension; in patients with prior stroke; in patients with hypertension at heightened risk for cardiovascular diseases; in patients with hypertension and chronic or advanced kidney disease; and in the very elderly with hypertension. For this strategy to work, we need additional solutions to allow for practical prescribing. Increasing the number of fixed‐dosed combinations with chlorthalidone or indapamide would improve access to these agents in addition to promoting adherence. Unfortunately, multiple barriers currently exist that limit the availability and use of fixed‐dosed combination pills, including technical challenges in combining multiple drugs and lacking incentives for manufacturers to create new combination pills containing generic medications. Thus, a collaborative effort from the Food and Drug Administration, drug manufacturers, and academic societies will be needed. Hydrochlorothiazide may be the most popular thiazide prescribed today, but part of the solution for better blood pressure control, and ultimately improved cardiovascular disease prevention, for our patients should include the more frequent use of chlorthalidone and indapamide.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^113RmDvq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Ménière's disease (MD) — oral diuretics for maintenance: Diuretics are believed to alter the electrolyte balance in endolymph, subsequently reducing endolymph volume. The most commonly prescribed diuretics are thiazides with or without potassium-sparing agents such as hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene or spironolactone, and the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide (Diamox) is used as a second-line therapy. Thiazides are contraindicated in patients with gout, and potassium-sparing diuretics are contraindicated in patients with acute or severe renal failure; since the prolonged use of thiazides can precipitate gout, other diuretic options should be considered, and clinicians should monitor electrolytes and blood pressure in patients who are prescribed diuretics. Evidence from a Cochrane systematic review identified 10 studies but none met inclusion due to allocation problems (not randomized, n = 4; unclear allocation, n = 2; or not placebo controlled, n = 7) or problems extracting data (n = 2); crossover trials comparing hydrochlorothiazide or triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide with placebo lacked pre-crossover data, and while effects on MD could not be rigorously evaluated due to a lack of high-quality studies, some studies reported improvement in vertigo with diuretics.

These blood pressure-independent effects are likely to be fundamental contributors to the differences in long-term endpoints between thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics. They are also likely to be the result of pleiotropic effects that are not governed by the targeting of the kidney.

### Severe hyponatremia associated with thiazide diuretic use [^112smTo7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Thiazide diuretics are commonly used as first-line antihypertensive agents. Hyponatremia is a reported, though uncommon, complication of thiazide use. Although the exact mechanism of thiazide-induced hyponatremia (TIH) is unclear, it can be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.

Case Report

We report a 69-year-old man with generalized weakness beginning 2 weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). Evaluation revealed a serum sodium level of 120 mmol/L. The patient was admitted and successfully treated with free water restriction and discontinuation of the HCTZ. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Hyponatremia is an uncommon complication of thiazide diuretic use, which frequently presents with nonspecific symptoms. Identification of TIH is crucial to prevent its potentially life-threatening complications.

### Which drug should be used to treat patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension? [^113Q8d68]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review recent data and guidelines on selecting the initial antihypertensive drug.

Recent Findings

The main driver of benefit from blood pressure-lowering therapy is blood pressure reduction, and there is little evidence supporting additional drug class-specific benefits in primary prevention of major cardiovascular outcomes. The results also confirm that in the patient with uncomplicated hypertension as well as in those patients with diabetes without nephropathy, initial therapy with 'newer therapies' (i.e. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin receptor blockers) are effective, but not more effective than thiazide diuretics, at reducing stroke, coronary heart disease, morbidity or mortality, or all-cause mortality.

Summary

While compelling indications may exist for specific drug classes in those with specific target organ damage (i.e. heart failure, renal insufficiency, and coronary artery disease), thiazide diuretics remain unsurpassed in lowering blood pressure and in preventing hypertension-related clinical outcomes. Despite a more favorable metabolic profile, alpha-blockers are less effective in preventing cardiovascular disease, especially heart failure and stroke. Calcium channel blockers produce a similar reduction in blood pressure and cardiovascular disease outcomes compared with thiazide-type diuretics, although they are consistently less effective in preventing heart failure. In the absence of heart failure or renal disease, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have shown little advantage in clinical trials over diuretics in preventing cardiovascular disease and are not indicated as an initial therapy in Blacks.

### Does hydrochlorothiazide prevent recurrent urinary tract infection in children with idiopathic hypercalciuria? [^113Dgm45]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Idiopathic hypercalciuria (IHC) has been recognized as a common disorder in childhood, and is a major factor in the formation of renal stones and urinary tract infections (UTIs). Since hydrochlorothiazide ameliorates hypercalciuria, we assessed its efficacy in preventing recurrent UTIs in hypercalciuric girls.

Materials and Methods

This research was a single blind randomized clinical trial. One hundred 1‒12-year-old girls, who were followed in pediatric nephrology outpatient clinics of two referral hospitals in Markazi Province of Iran, were recruited. All patients had IHC and at least two UTIs in 1 year, without any underlying anatomic or functional abnormality of urinary tract. Patients were randomly divided into two equal groups. One group received instructions regarding general preventive measures for UTI and the other group, in addition to these measures, received 1 mg/kg/day hydrochlorothiazide as morning dose. Then recurrence of UTI in the two groups was evaluated.

Results

The mean age was 7.28 ± 1.9 years. In both groups, the incidence of UTI recurrence was 66%.

Conclusion

On the basis of these results, we reject the hypothesis that treating hypercalciuria is beneficial in preventing repeated UTIs. The association between UTIs and IHC needs to be more closely studied and attention to eliminating confounding factors is necessary.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115jZRBm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Kidney dysfunction/injury — monitoring and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi) effects are outlined with explicit thresholds. Estimated GFR using serum creatinine should be measured 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of antihypertensive medications. RAASi may cause an expected short-term dip in eGFR of up to 30% that is associated with preservation of kidney function and should not lead to discontinuation unless the decline in eGFR is persistently > 30%. A referral to a nephrologist is appropriate to evaluate other causes, and new dysfunction after adding or increasing diuretics should prompt evaluation of volume status; it may be appropriate to initially hold or reduce the diuretic dose and then advance more slowly.

### Blood pressure-lowering efficacy of monotherapy with thiazide diuretics for primary hypertension [^1179wYUi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. Although it is established that low-dose thiazides reduce mortality as well as cardiovascular morbidity, the dose-related effect of thiazides in decreasing blood pressure has not been subject to a rigorous systematic review. It is not known whether individual drugs within the thiazide diuretic class differ in their blood pressure-lowering effects and adverse effects.

Objectives

To determine the dose-related decrease in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure due to thiazide diuretics compared with placebo control in the treatment of patients with primary hypertension. Secondary outcomes included the dose-related adverse events leading to patient withdrawal and adverse biochemical effects on serum potassium, uric acid, creatinine, glucose and lipids.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to February 2014), Ovid EMBASE (1974 to February 2014) and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fixed-dose thiazide diuretic monotherapy with placebo for a duration of 3 to 12 weeks in the treatment of adult patients with primary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened articles, assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and determined risk of bias. We combined data for continuous variables using a mean difference (MD) and for dichotomous outcomes we calculated the relative risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

Main Results

We included 60 randomized, double-blind trials that evaluated the dose-related trough blood pressure-lowering efficacy of six different thiazide diuretics in 11,282 participants treated for a mean duration of eight weeks. The mean age of the participants was 55 years and baseline blood pressure was 158/99 mmHg. Adequate blood pressure-lowering efficacy data were available for hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone and indapamide. We judged 54 (90%) included trials to have unclear or high risk of bias, which impacted on our confidence in the results for some of our outcomes. In 33 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 155/100 mmHg, hydrochlorothiazide lowered blood pressure based on dose, with doses of 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day lowering blood pressure compared to placebo by 4 mmHg (95% CI 2 to 6, moderate-quality evidence)/2 mmHg (95% CI 1 to 4, moderate-quality evidence), 6 mmHg (95% CI 5 to 7, high-quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence), 8 mmHg (95% CI 7 to 9, high-quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence) and 11 mmHg (95% CI 6 to 15, low-quality evidence)/5 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 7, low-quality evidence), respectively. Direct comparison of doses did not show evidence of dose dependence for blood pressure-lowering for any of the other thiazides for which RCT data were available: bendrofluazide, chlorthalidone, cyclopenthiazide, metolazone or indapamide. In seven trials with a baseline blood pressure of 163/88 mmHg, chlorthalidone at doses of 12.5 mg to 75 mg/day reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 12.0 mmHg (95% CI 10 to 14, low-quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 5, low-quality evidence). In 10 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 161/98 mmHg, indapamide at doses of 1.0 mg to 5.0 mg/day reduced blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg (95% CI 7 to 10, low-quality evidence)/4 (95% CI 3 to 5, low-quality evidence). We judged the maximal blood pressure-lowering effect of the different thiazides to be similar. Overall, thiazides reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg (95% CI 9 to 10, high-quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence). Thiazides as a class have a greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure, therefore thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 mmHg to 6 mmHg, an amount that is greater than the 3 mmHg seen with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors, and the 2 mmHg seen with non-selective beta-blockers. This is based on an informal indirect comparison of results observed in other Cochrane reviews on ACE inhibitors, ARBs and renin inhibitors compared with placebo, which used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria to the present review. Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides. These effects were dose-related and were least for hydrochlorothiazide. Chlorthalidone increased serum glucose but the evidence was unclear for other thiazides. There is a high risk of bias in the metabolic data. This review does not provide a good assessment of the adverse effects of these drugs because there was a high risk of bias in the reporting of withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review shows that hydrochlorothiazide has a dose-related blood pressure-lowering effect. The mean blood pressure-lowering effect over the dose range 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day is 4/2 mmHg, 6/3 mmHg, 8/3 mmHg and 11/5 mmHg, respectively. For other thiazide drugs, the lowest doses studied lowered blood pressure maximally and higher doses did not lower it more. Due to the greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure, thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 mmHg to 6 mmHg. This exceeds the mean 3 mmHg pulse pressure reduction achieved by ACE inhibitors, ARBs and renin inhibitors, and the 2 mmHg pulse pressure reduction with non-selective beta-blockers as shown in other Cochrane reviews, which compared these antihypertensive drug classes with placebo and used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria. Thiazides did not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects in these short-term trials but there is a high risk of bias for that outcome. Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides.

### Efficacy of standard and low dose hydrochlorothiazide in the recurrence prevention of calcium nephrolithiasis (NOSTONE trial): protocol for a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^1161ey6K]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Nephrolithiasis is a global healthcare problem with a current lifetime risk of 18.8% in men and 9.4% in women. Given the high cost of medical treatments and surgical interventions as well as the morbidity related to symptomatic stone disease, medical prophylaxis for stone recurrence is an attractive approach. Thiazide diuretics have been the cornerstone of pharmacologic metaphylaxis for more than 40years. However, evidence for benefits and harms of thiazides in the prevention of calcium containing kidney stones in general remains unclear. In addition, the efficacy of the currently employed low dose thiazide regimens to prevent stone recurrence is not known.

Methods

The NOSTONE trial is an investigator-initiated 3-year prospective, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of standard and low dose hydrochlorothiazide treatment in the recurrence prevention of calcium containing kidney stones. We plan to include 416 adult (≥ 18years) patients with recurrent (≥ 2 stone episodes in the last 10years) calcium containing kidney stones (containing ≥ 50% of calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate or a mixture of both). Patients will be randomly allocated to 50mg or 25mg or 12.5mg hydrochlorothiazide or placebo. The primary outcome will be incidence of stone recurrence (a composite of symptomatic or radiologic recurrence). Secondary outcomes will be individual components of the composite primary outcome, safety and tolerability of hydrochlorothiazide treatment, changes in urinary biochemistry elicited by hydrochlorothiazide treatment and impact of baseline disease severity, biochemical abnormalities and stone composition on treatment response.

Discussion

The NOSTONE study will provide long-sought information on the efficacy of hydrochlorothiazide in the recurrence prevention of calcium containing kidney stones. Strengths of the study include the randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled design, the large amount of patients studied, the employment of high sensitivity and high specificity imaging and the exclusive public funding support.

### Aliskiren hemifumarate and hydrochlorothiazide (Tekturna HCT) [^111eYfVx]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There is no information regarding the presence of Tekturna HCT or aliskiren in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published studies report that hydrochlorothiazide is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects hydrochlorothiazide on the breastfed infant or the effects of hydrochlorothiazide on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including hypotension, electrolyte imbalances and renal impairment in nursing infants, advise a nursing woman that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Tekturna HCT.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of Tekturna HCT in pediatric patients have not been established.

Preclinical studies indicate a potential for substantial increase in exposure to aliskiren in pediatric patients [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)].

Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to Tekturna HCT:

If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In the short-term controlled clinical trials of Tekturna HCT, 325 (19.6%) patients treated with Tekturna HCT were 65 years and older and 53 (3.2%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

8.6 Renal Impairment

Safety and effectiveness of Tekturna HCT in patients with severe renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 30 mL/min] have not been established [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14)].

No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild (CrCl 60 to 90 mL/min) or moderate (CrCl 30 to 60 mL/min) renal impairment.

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Aliskiren

No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild-to-severe liver disease [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)

Minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease.

### Aldosterone-targeted therapies: early implementation in resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease [^112DGCT3]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Thiazide, thiazide-like diuretics, and loop diuretics

Chlorthalidone, a thiazide-like diuretic, is often used to lower BP and may help mitigate the risk of hyperkalaemia in patients with CKD. In the CLICK trial including 160 patients with uncontrolled hypertension and Stage 4 CKD, the addition of chlorthalidone 12.5 mg/day vs placebo lowered 24-h ambulatory systolic BP by 10–14 mmHg and decreased albuminuria levels over 12 weeks. However, chlorthalidone also significantly increased plasma renin and aldosterone levels, and co-administration of MRAs has been suggested. Switching from hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide, to chlorthalidone resulted in additional BP reduction in several studies. However, in a trial of 13 523 hypertensive patients on hydrochlorothiazide, the rates of primary CV outcomes and acute kidney injury-related hospitalizations were similar between those who continued hydrochlorothiazide and those switched to chlorothiazide.

Furthermore, in patients with GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², an adequately up-titrated loop diuretic is an option for managing TRH. Torsemide, a long-acting loop diuretic, inhibited aldosterone secretion by adrenal cells in a preclinical studyand may be preferable to shorter-acting agents such as bumetanide or furosemide.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^115mohmS]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Diuretics are listed in hypertension guidelines as one of three equally weighted first-line treatment options. In order to differentiate between antihypertensives, a lot of discussion has been directed at side effect profiles and as a result, has created a perhaps disproportionate fear of the metabolic effects that can be associated with diuretics. Data, however, show that the risk of a clinically meaningful change in laboratory parameters is very low, whereas the benefits of volume control and natriuresis are high and the reductions in morbidity and mortality are clinically significant. Moreover, as clinically significant differences in safety and efficacy profiles exist among diuretics, several international guidelines have started making a distinction between thiazides (hydrochlorothiazide) and thiazide-like (chlorthalidone, indapamide) diuretics; and some of them now recommend longer acting thiazide-like diuretics. In time, pending more data, chlorthalidone and indapamide may need to be subdivided further into separate classifications.

### Effect of hydrochlorothiazide on urinary calcium excretion in dent disease: an uncontrolled trial [^117W9YGw]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Thiazide doses equivalent to 1 to 2 mg/kg/d of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) have been proposed to correct hypercalciuria and prevent kidney failure in patients with Dent disease. However, they can cause adverse metabolic effects in the long term. In treating hypertension in children, lower thiazide doses have been shown to be as effective and well tolerated.

Study Design

Uncontrolled trial, with forced-titration sequential open-label study design.

Setting & Participants

7 boys with genetically confirmed Dent disease and mild phenotype (neither overt sodium wasting nor kidney failure).

Intervention

After a 1-month run-in period, patients sequentially received amiloride (5 mg/d) alone (1 month) and then for 3 periods of 2 months in association with increasing doses of HCTZ (< 0.2, 0.2 to 0.4, and 0.4 to 0.8 mg/kg/d).

Outcomes

Urinary calcium excretion and extracellular volume indicators.

Measurements

At the end of each period, 2 daily 24-hour urinary collections were performed on the days preceding admission. Blood and spot urine samples also were collected.

Results

A greater HCTZ dose increased renin, aldosterone, and plasma protein concentrations. Amiloride alone had no effect on calcium excretion. The greatest HCTZ doses decreased spot urinary calcium excretion by 42% compared with baseline (median, 0.3; minimum, maximum, 0.2, 0.8 versus median, 0.8; minimum, maximum, 0.4, 1.1, respectively; P = 0.03). However, patients developed adverse reactions, including muscle cramps (n = 2), biological (n = 7) or symptomatic hypovolemia (n = 1), hypokalemia (n = 4), and hyponatremia (n = 1), which all corrected after treatment withdrawal.

Limitation

Small sample size and absence of a control group.

Conclusion

HCTZ doses greater than 0.4 mg/kg/d decreased calcium excretion, but were associated with significant adverse events. Thiazide diuretic therapy should be considered with caution in children with Dent disease.

### Thiazide diuretic monotherapy for hypertension: diuretic's dark side just got darker [^116L4XGA]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

Diuretic monotherapy is the current recommendation of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure for initial antihypertensive therapy. There is mounting concern, however, that the benefits of diuretic's superior blood pressure control may be offset by its multiple metabolic disturbances that increase cardiovascular risk. Reungjui et al. document a new concern, nephrotoxicity by thiazide monotherapy. This and other recently published evidence of diuretic's 'dark side' is discussed.

### Effects of sodium restriction and hydrochlorothiazide on RAAS blockade efficacy in diabetic nephropathy: a randomised clinical trial [^113jv2mt]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Reduction of dietary sodium intake or diuretic treatment increases renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade efficacy in non-diabetic nephropathy. We aimed to investigate the effect of sodium restriction and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, separately and in combination, added to RAAS blockade on residual albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy.

Methods

In this multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover randomised trial, we included patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Main entry criteria were microalbuminaria or macroalbuminuria, and creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or higher with less than 6 mL/min decline in the previous year. We tested the separate and combined effects of sodium restriction (dietary counselling in the outpatient setting) and hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg daily), added to standardised maximal angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition (lisinopril 40 mg daily), on albuminuria (primary endpoint). Patients were given hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg per day) or placebo during four treatment periods of 6 weeks. Both treatments were combined with regular sodium diet or sodium restriction (target sodium intake 50 mmol Na(+) per day). The 6-week treatment periods were done consecutively in a random order. Patients were randomised in blocks of two patients. The trial was analysed by intention to treat. The trial is registered with TrialRegister.nl, number 2366.

Findings

Of 89 eligible patients, 45 were included in the study. Both sodium restriction and hydrochlorothiazide significantly reduced albuminuria, irrespective of treatment sequence. Residual geometric mean albuminuria with baseline treatment was 711 mg per day (95% CI 485–1043); it was significantly reduced by sodium restriction (393 mg per day [258–599], p = 0·0002), by hydrochlorothiazide (434 mg per day [306–618], p = 0·0003), and to the greatest extent by their combination (306 mg per day [203–461], p < 0·0001). Orthostatic complaints were present in two patients (4%) during baseline treatment, five (11%) during addition of sodium restriction, five (11%) during hydrochlorothiazide treatment, and 12 (27%) during combination treatment. No serious adverse events occurred.

Interpretation

We conclude that sodium restriction is an effective non-pharmacological intervention to increase RAAS blockade efficacy in type 2 diabetic nephropathy.

Funding

None.

### Efficacy of standard and low dose hydrochlorothiazide in the recurrence prevention of calcium nephrolithiasis (NOSTONE trial): protocol for a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^113d3Mka]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

The efficacy of thiazides in the recurrence prevention of kidney stones has been studied in several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (Table 1). With the exception of two trials, thiazides significantly reduced stone recurrence compared to placebo or control. However, as detailed in Table 1 and highlighted by a recent systematic review, thiazide RCTs thus far conducted suffer from significant methodological deficiencies, including: use of high thiazide doses, low overall number of patients studied, lack of outcome uniformity, use of outdated dietary recommendations, unclear allocation concealment, lack of double-blinding and intention-to-treat analysis, absence of adverse event and drop out reporting, unknown baseline risk of disease severity and baseline biochemical abnormalities of patients studied, lack of patient stratification and employment of low sensitivity and specificity imaging modalities.

Table 1
Randomized controlled trials of thiazides in the prevention of recurrent nephrolithiasis

a TID, three times daily, b BID, twice times daily, c RR, relative risk

Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) was used in five of the 11 thiazide RCTs for stone prevention and is thus currently the best studied thiazide in the prevention of stone recurrence. However, other thiazides such as bendroflumethiazide, chlorthalidone, trichlormethiazide and indapamide also reduced stone recurrence in one or more trials and seem to be effective as well. In all trials, high thiazide doses were employed, in the case of HCTZ, 50–100 mg daily. In four of the five HCTZ trials, the diuretic was given twice daily, whereas in the treatment of arterial hypertension, HCTZ is typically given once daily. Once daily HCTZ at the dose of 50 mg, 25 mg or 12.5 mg reduces calciuria in healthy volunteers, a surrogate marker for stone prevention. Detailed HCTZ dose-response studies with respect to urinary composition and stone recurrence are lacking. Twice daily HCTZ increases the frequency of side effects and augments diuresis at night and thereby likely affects compliance.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^1111KxQH]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Diuretics are listed in hypertension guidelines as one of three equally weighted first-line treatment options. In order to differentiate between antihypertensives, a lot of discussion has been directed at side effect profiles and as a result, has created a perhaps disproportionate fear of the metabolic effects that can be associated with diuretics. Data, however, show that the risk of a clinically meaningful change in laboratory parameters is very low, whereas the benefits of volume control and natriuresis are high and the reductions in morbidity and mortality are clinically significant. Moreover, as clinically significant differences in safety and efficacy profiles exist among diuretics, several international guidelines have started making a distinction between thiazides (hydrochlorothiazide) and thiazide-like (chlorthalidone, indapamide) diuretics; and some of them now recommend longer acting thiazide-like diuretics. In time, pending more data, chlorthalidone and indapamide may need to be subdivided further into separate classifications.

### Thiazide diuretics and the rate of disease progression in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: an observational study [^117CE6w1]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

At present, there is no compelling evidence as to the most suitable second-line antihypertensive in ADPKD in addition to RAAS inhibition. This study shows that caution does not seem warranted in the case of thiazide diuretics. In our opinion, the choice for a specific antihypertensive should be made based on individual patient preferences and comorbidities. The use of thiazide diuretics in ADPKD could offer additional benefits to blood pressure control, for instance, in case of fluid overload or in combination with a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist to limit the aquaretic side effects of that drug. However, this study did not investigate this specific combination of drugs and such a combination should be avoided until future research confirms its safety and efficacy.

In conclusion, thiazide use was not associated with plasma copeptin concentration or with the rate of ADPKD disease progression when used in addition to RAAS blockade. Therefore this study suggests that thiazide diuretics, especially hydrochlorothiazide, can be prescribed safely in addition to RAAS blockade in ADPKD.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Table 13 — FDA-approved drugs for treatment of hypertension — Loop diuretics (alternative agents) include bumetanide 0.5–2 mg/d (daily frequency 2), furosemide 20–80 mg/d (daily frequency 2), and torsemide 5–10 mg/d (daily frequency 1). These are preferred diuretics in patients with symptomatic HF. They are preferred over thiazide-type diuretics in patients with moderate-to-severe CKD (eg, GFR < 30 mL/min). The longer-acting choice of torsemide is preferred for treatment of hypertension. A loop diuretic is an option for patients who develop thiazide-type diuretic associated hyponatremia.

### Case report: a thiazide diuretic to treat polyuria induced by tolvaptan [^117NBkb2]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary volumes before and during tolvaptan treatment are shown in Fig. 1. In 2011, this patient collected 24-h urine once during the month in which tolvaptan was temporarily stopped. At that time urine volume was 1280 mL and urine osmolality 632 mOsm/kg. Mean 24-h urine volume (based on five measurements) on tolvaptan before HCT initiation was 4867 mL, mean urine osmolality was 212 mOsm/kg (range 164–250 mOsm/kg). After initiation of HCT (12.5 mg q.d.) 24-h urine production declined to 2878 mL, while urine osmolality increased to 290 mOsm/kg. After the increase of HCT to 25 mg q.d. the last 24-h urine collection measured 2699 mL and 280 mOsm/kg. Mean 24-h urine volume had declined during HCT co-treatment by 2078 mL (43%).

Fig. 1
24-h urine volume over time. Urine production increased notably after initiation (in 2008) and re-initiation (in 2011) of tolvaptan. After hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) was added to tolvaptan treatment in 2015, urine volume decreased by 43%

24-h creatinine excretion was used to verify whether urine collections were complete, assuming unchanged muscle mass over time creatinine excretion should be similar between urine collections. Mean 24-h creatinine excretion before start of HCT was 18.1 mmol/24 h, and after start of HCT 16.7 mmol/24 h, indicating no difference in urine collected.

During the nine-year treatment period, serum electrolytes were measured 37 times and stayed within the normal range during the whole period. These electrolytes include potassium (range 3.9–4.6 mmol/L), sodium (range 136–144 mmol/L) and calcium (range 2.34–2.57 mmol/L). There were no differences in average electrolyte concentration between the period with tolvaptan monotherapy and the period with tolvaptan-HCT combination therapy.

### Case report: a thiazide diuretic to treat polyuria induced by tolvaptan [^11125JkD]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Currently, the vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan is the only available treatment for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), but there are tolerability issues due to aquaretic side-effects such as polyuria. A possible strategy to ameliorate these side-effects may be addition of a thiazide diuretic, this is an established treatment in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, a condition where vasopressin V2 receptor function is absent.

Case Presentation

We describe a 46-year-old male ADPKD-patient, who was prescribed tolvaptan, which caused polyuria of around 5 l per day. Hydrochlorothiazide was added to treat hypertension, which resulted in a marked decrease in urine production. While using tolvaptan, rate of eGFR decline was -1.35 mL/min/1.73m 2 per year, whereas after hydrochlorothiazide was initiated this was -3.97 mL/minute/1.73m 2 per year.

Conclusions

This case report indicates that while addition of hydrochlorothiazide may improve tolerability of vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists, co-prescription should only be used with great scrutiny as it may decrease tolvaptan effect on rate of ADPKD disease progression.

### Structural bases for Na-clcotransporter inhibition by thiazide diuretic drugs and activation by kinases [^112Cp5Ss]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Thiazide and loop diuretics promote natriuresis and diuresis by inhibiting two distinct ion transport systems in the kidney, NCC and NKCC2, respectively, although they were developed from the same parental compound called sulfonamide based on the serendipitous discovery that sulfonamide, used as an antibiotic at the time, exhibits diuretic properties. How can thiazide and loop diuretics discriminate NCC and NKCC2 given that both classes of drugs evolved from sulfonamide and retain the sulfamoyl group and that NCC and NKCC2 share high sequence and structure similarity? Breakthroughs in NCC and NKCC1 (an NKCC2 ortholog that is equally inhibited by loop diuretics such as bumetanide) structural pharmacology have started to shed light on this long-standing mystery. Thiazide and loop diuretics assume an almost opposite pose in their respective receptor sites when the shared sulfamoyl group is used as a reference (Fig. 3g). In NCC co-structures, the sulfamoyl group of hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide, and chlorthalidone points downward and almost reaches halfway into the membrane. Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics all bear a chorine atom that clashes with the Cl − site 2. In contrast, our NKCC1/bumetanide co-structure showed that bumetanide occupies a more superficial pocket with its sulfamoyl group pointing toward the extracellular side and its carboxyl group facing down to coordinate a co-occluded K + ion. Atomic-level understanding of thiazide and loop diuretics pharmacology now makes it possible to rationally design NCC and NKCC2 orthosteric site-targeting small molecule therapeutics with improved potency and fewer side effects (e.g. sulfur-free compounds for treating patients who are contraindicated because of sulfur allergy). In the same vein, by exploring an exceptionally vast chemical space afforded by in silico docking based on co-structures of NCC and NKCC1 bound with diuretic drugs, it may be feasible to discover compounds that simultaneously inhibit both NCC and NKCC2; such dual antagonism is desirable to resolve drug-resistant edema that often afflicts patients with congestive heart diseases and liver cirrhosis.

### The evidence-based use of thiazide diuretics in hypertension and nephrolithiasis [^113i7nxS]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Thiazide-type diuretics are commonly used in the treatment of hypertension and nephrolithiasis. Evidence from randomized clinical trials needs to be considered in decisions about agent choice and dose. In nephrolithiasis, one of the major limitations of the literature is a paucity of data on the dose-response effect of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) on urinary calcium excretion. The best available evidence for prevention of stone recurrence suggests the use of indapamide at 2.5 mg/d, chlorthalidone at 25 to 50 mg daily, or HCTZ 25 mg twice a day or 50 mg daily. In hypertension, chlorthalidone (12.5 to 30 mg daily) may be the best choice when a diuretic is used for initial therapy, with indapamide (1.5 mg daily) being a valuable alternative for older patients. When adding a thiazide to other drug classes, indapamide (2.5 mg daily) has demonstrated value in hypertensive patients who have had a stroke, and HCTZ (12.5 to 25 mg daily) has a safe track record in several patient groups. Although chlorthalidone has not been tested as add-on therapy, the authors believe it is a safe option in such cases.

### Chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide and kidney outcomes in patients with hypertension: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^115Ebvfh]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Hypertension is a risk factor for the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear whether different thiazide diuretics have a differential impact on kidney outcomes.

Objective

To compare kidney outcomes in patients with hypertension taking chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prespecified secondary analysis of the Diuretic Comparison Project, a randomized clinical trial comparing chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide for the treatment of hypertension, was conducted between June 1, 2016, and June 1, 2022, through Veterans Affairs facilities nationwide. This analysis extended follow-up to December 31, 2023. Veterans 65 years or older with hypertension who were taking hydrochlorothiazide were included.

Intervention

The Diuretic Comparison Project randomized 13 523 participants to continue hydrochlorothiazide or switch to chlorthalidone.

Main Outcome and Measures

The main kidney outcome was CKD progression, defined as doubling of serum creatinine level from baseline, a terminal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 15 mL/min, or dialysis initiation.

Results

Analysis included 12 265 participants (90.7%) with a baseline and 1 or more follow-up creatinine measurements (median [IQR] age, 71 [69–75] years; 3.2% female and 96.8% male). The mean (SD) study duration was 3.9 (1.3) years. Chlorthalidone was not superior to hydrochlorothiazide at preventing kidney outcomes (369 of 6118 [6.0%] vs 396 of 6147 [6.4%]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.94; 95% CI, 0.81–1.08; p = 0.37). Similar results were observed when a 40% or greater reduction of eGFR was substituted for doubling of creatinine in the above outcome, as well as any of the components of the primary composite outcome. There was no difference in the incidence of CKD (961 of 4520 [21.3%] for chlorthalidone vs 939 of 4518 [20.8%] for hydrochlorothiazide; p = 0.59) or acute kidney injury requiring hospitalization (391 [6.4%] for chlorthalidone vs 379 [6.2%] for hydrochlorothiazide; p = 0.63) between groups. However, a statistically significant increased incidence of hypokalemia for chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide was observed (545 [8.9%] vs 426 [6.9%]; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Chlorthalidone was not superior to hydrochlorothiazide for kidney outcomes but was associated with an increased risk for hypokalemia. Given these findings, clinicians should feel confident using either agent for the treatment of hypertension and kidney outcomes.

### Case report: a thiazide diuretic to treat polyuria induced by tolvaptan [^117VcGq3]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our case suggests that prescription of HCT during tolvaptan use in ADPKD may lead to less polyuria. This improvement in tolerability, however, was accompanied by a rise in copeptin and a possibly accelerated rate of eGFR decline. Furthermore, there theoretically may be risks with respect to hydration status and serum electrolyte concentrations during combined tolvaptan-HCT use, although we found no indications for this in our patient. Taken together these findings indicate that, until further research suggests otherwise, tolvaptan-HCT co-prescription should only be used with great scrutiny.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^113SDYtt]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Thiazide and thiazide‑like diuretics in hypertension — There has been debate about whether thiazide‑like diuretics should be preferred over classical thiazides, but superiority on outcomes has not been tested in head‑to‑head randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Chlorthalidone and indapamide are more potent per milligram than hydrochlorothiazide with a longer duration of action and no evidence of more side effects, and lower dose thiazide‑like diuretics have more RCT evidence for reductions in CV events and mortality compared with lower dose thiazide diuretics. Thiazide and thiazide‑like diuretics can reduce serum potassium and have a less favourable side‑effect profile than RAS blockers, including dysmetabolic effects that increase insulin resistance and the risk of new‑onset diabetes; addition of a potassium‑sparing diuretic may reduce adverse glucose effects. Renal function modifies efficacy: both thiazides and thiazide‑like agents are less effective with reduced kidney function and become ineffective at lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) thresholds (eGFR < 45 mL/min; eGFR < 30 mL/min). In such circumstances, loop diuretics such as furosemide or torasemide should replace thiazides and thiazide‑like diuretics to achieve an antihypertensive effect, and, recognizing available evidence and single‑pill combinations, we recommend that thiazides, chlorthalidone, and indapamide can all be considered suitable antihypertensive agents.

### Thiazide-associated hyponatremia: clinical manifestations and pathophysiology [^111oUoRs]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia can complicate thiazide use in a minority of susceptible individuals and can result in significant morbidity and even mortality. Risk factors for thiazide-associated hyponatremia include age, female sex, and possibly low body mass. A genetic susceptibility has recently been uncovered. Although frequently developing early after thiazide treatment initiation, many cases of hyponatremia present after months or years of use. Many cases are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, but seizures and/or coma may develop, especially in those with acute onset. The pathophysiology is incompletely understood and includes some combination of excessive fluid intake, cation (sodium and potassium) depletion, osmotic inactivation of sodium, and reduced ability to excrete free water. Reduced distal delivery of filtrate, reduced solute load (urea), direct inhibition of the sodium-chloride cotransporter, and increased collecting duct permeability to water mediated by some combination of antidiuretic hormone, prostaglandins, and thiazides themselves may contribute to this diluting defect. The predominant pathophysiologic mechanism(s) varies from patient to patient. The cornerstone of therapy is cessation of thiazide use, cation repletion, and oral fluid restriction. If severely symptomatic, 3% saline solution may be indicated. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia must be avoided in all cases.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^117FjXZ5]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Salt-sensitive and low-renin hypertension

Lastly, though not addressed in most guidelines, patients with salt-sensitive hypertension and/or low-renin hypertension have characteristics that lend themselves well to treatment with a diuretic. In most cases, low levels of renin are an indication that the RAS is suppressed because of volume overload and sodium retention. In such patients, as well as in salt-sensitive patients, treatment with diuretics, which reduce volume and increase sodium excretion, would be expected to be efficacious, whereas treatment with RAS inhibitors would be expected to suppress the RAS further. In fact, in the few clinical trials that have looked at patients with low-plasma renin activity and/or salt sensitivity, effective blood pressure lowering strategies include HCTZ, chlorthalidone, indapamide, or spironolactone.

As salt-sensitive hypertension is especially common in black patients, older adults, and in patients with more severe blood pressure or with comorbidities, such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease and as low-renin hypertension is particularly common in African Americans, the elderly, and patients with resistant hypertension, it is not surprising that diuretics have been shown to be particularly effective in these patient populations.

Methods

Study Design and Population

The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be made available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the procedure. Details of the HOPE‐3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00239681) have been reported. 12, 13, 14, 15 Briefly, HOPE‐3 was an international, double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled trial with a 2×2 factorial design performed in 12 705 participants without CVD but at intermediate cardiovascular risk.

Participants from 21 countries (in South and North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia) were men aged ≥ 55 years and women aged ≥ 65 years with at least 1 additional CVD risk factor or women aged ≥ 60 years with 2 additional risk factors. The risk factors were family history of premature coronary artery disease, elevated waist/hip ratio, recent or current tobacco use, dysglycemia, concentration of high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol < 1.0 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) for men and < 1.3 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) for women, and mild renal dysfunction (microalbuminuria, creatinine > 124 but < 180 μmol/L [> 1.4 but < 2.0 mg/dL], or estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 but > 45 mL/min per 1.73 m²). Participants were excluded if they had preexisting CVD; had renal dysfunction (1 value outside the study's eligibility range); were taking an angiotensin modulator, hydrochlorothiazide or a statin; had contraindications to these medications; or had debilitating disease reducing their life expectancy to < 5 years. The ethics committee at each center approved the HOPE‐3 protocol, and all participants provided written informed consent.

### Amlodipine valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (Exforge HCT) [^113hQ7S3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.4 Impaired Renal Function

Changes in renal function, including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on Exforge HCT. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on Exforge HCT [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.5 Potassium Abnormalities

In the controlled trial of Exforge HCT in moderate to severe hypertensive patients, the incidence of hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) at any time post-baseline with the maximum dose of Exforge HCT (10/320/25 mg) was 10% compared to 25% with HCTZ/amlodipine (25/10 mg), 7% with valsartan/HCTZ (320/25 mg), and 3% with amlodipine/valsartan (10/320 mg). One patient (0.2%) discontinued therapy due to an adverse event of hypokalemia in each of the Exforge HCT and HCTZ/amlodipine groups. The incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) was 0.4% with Exforge HCT compared to 0.2% to 0.7% with the dual therapies.

Some patients with heart failure have developed increases in potassium on valsartan. These effects are usually minor and transient, and they are more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of the diuretic and/or valsartan may be required.

Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

If hypokalemia is accompanied by clinical signs (e.g., muscular weakness, paresis, or ECG alterations), Exforge HCT should be discontinued. Correction of hypokalemia and any coexisting hypomagnesemia is recommended prior to the initiation of thiazides.

### Thiazide and the thiazide-like diuretics: review of hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, and indapamide [^117XP6yg]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

The term thiazide is universally understood to refer to diuretics that exert their principal action in the distal tubule. The thiazide class is heterogenous and can be further subdivided into compounds containing the benzothiadiazine ring structure-the thiazide-type (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide)-and those lacking the benzothiadiazine ring-the thiazide-like (e.g., chlorthalidone and indapamide) drugs. Thiazide-like agents are longer acting and constitute the diuretics used in most of the cardiovascular outcome trials that established benefits of treatment with diuretics, but pragmatic aspects, such as lack of availability in convenient formulations, limit their use. Regardless of class heterogeneity, thiazides have retained importance in the management of hypertension for over 60 years. They are reliably effective as monotherapy in a majority of hypertensive patients, and augment the efficacy of other classes of antihypertensives when used in combination. Importantly, a thiazide-based treatment regimen lowers cardiovascular events, and their sturdy effect reinforces their place among the recommended first-line agents to treat hypertension in major domestic and international hypertension guidelines. There are few head-to-head comparisons within the class, but potential differences have been explored indirectly as well as in non-blood pressure mechanisms and potential pleiotropic properties. Until proven otherwise, the importance of these differences remains speculative, and clinicians should assume that cardiovascular events will be lowered similarly across agents when equivalent blood pressure reduction occurs. Thiazides remain underutilized, with only about one-third of hypertensive patients receiving them. For many patients, however, a thiazide is an indispensable component of their regimen to achieve adequate blood pressure control.

### The place of diuretics in preventing cardiovascular events [^115xgoAp]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Low-dose diuretics are recommended for the initial choice of antihypertensive therapy in the 7th US Joint National Committee report and are accepted as an appropriate choice among other classes of drugs in the 2003 European Society of Hypertension guidelines. The rationales for the use of low-dose diuretics include the following: Renal dysfunction interfering with normal natriuresis is likely a fundamental defect in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Subtle renal insufficiency that interferes with sodium excretion is a common consequence of uncontrolled hypertension. Diuretic-based therapy has been clearly documented in placebo-controlled, randomized trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, particularly in the treatment of elderly hypertensives. In multiple comparative trials, diuretic-based therapy has been shown to provide equal cardiovascular protection to that provided by newer agents. Diuretics enhance the antihypertensive efficacy of all other classes of agents. As lower blood pressure goals of therapy have been found to be needed, diuretic enhancement of other agents' efficacy has become even more essential. With such low doses, side effects are minimal in degree and infrequent in appearance.

### Dapagliflozin reduces albuminuria in patients with diabetes and hypertension receiving renin-angiotensin blockers [^113PTcLm]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

As SGLT2 inhibition has been shown to increase urinary glucose excretion and reduce eGFR, there have been concerns around renal safety. There have also been concerns of unfavourable volume loss attributable to the diuretic action. In the present analysis in patients with albuminuria and a renal function mainly within CKD stage 1 and 2 categories, there were numerically more laboratory‐associated AEs related to renal function with dapagliflozin than with placebo, mainly as a result of increases in blood creatinine. This was an expected finding, given dapagliflozin's mode of action. Importantly, none of these events was classified as serious by the investigators. There was also no increase in the proportion of patients with more pronounced creatinine increases (≥ 1.5× baseline values) as compared with placebo. The proportion of patients with a marked increase in serum potassium was also similar to placebo. Although there were more patients with potentially volume‐related AEs as compared with placebo, none of these AEs was classified as serious. As observed in previous studies, more patients receiving dapagliflozin experienced a urinary tract infection, although the total number was low. Overall, this post hoc analysis indicated a beneficial renal profile in the studied CKD categories.

The present study has some limitations that should be taken into consideration. First, this was a post hoc analysis of two randomized controlled trials, and the original studies were not designed to assess the effect of dapagliflozin on renal variables. The results can therefore only be interpreted as hypothesis‐generating. The study did not include an active comparator to prospectively determine whether the albuminuria‐lowering effects were independent of glucose or blood pressure control. A study design with two additional treatment arms including a sulphonylurea derivative to control HbA1c and hydrochlorothiazide to control blood pressure could add to the interpretation. UACR was measured in a single spot urine sample. It is known that the day‐to‐day variability in spot urine samples is larger than first morning void samples. The use of single spot urine samples in the present study may have resulted in a lower precision (larger standard error) of the treatment effect compared with when first morning void samples were used; however, despite the use of single spot urine samples, a clear and highly significant treatment effect could still be detected. Finally, renal blood flow and filtration fraction were not measured to determine with 'gold‐standard' techniques the effect of dapagliflozin on intraglomerular pressure. The lack of measured GFR and use of eGFR, which is less accurate, may explain why the effect of dapagliflozin on albuminuria was not mediated by changes in GFR.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^116sKgzC]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

SELECTING THE RIGHT TERMINOLOGY: DIFFERENT MECHANISMS OF ACTION

Historically, thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics were grouped together as they target the same segment of the distal convoluted tubule. It was thought that the targeting of the sodium-chloride transporter in this part of the kidney tubule mediated the decreases in blood pressure and cardiac output by causing volume loss. The mechanism of action for the blood pressure-lowering effect of diuretics is, in fact, more complex. Only the initial blood pressure reduction (1–2 weeks) is mediated by the kidney: the hypovolemia rapidly stimulates the activation of RAS, which stalls the decrease in blood pressure and results in volume and cardiac output returning almost to baseline. It is the second phase, during which the diuretic treatment targets peripheral vascular resistance and vasodilation that mediates the bulk of the ongoing (4–8 weeks) and long-term blood pressure reduction.

Hydrochlorothiazide

The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown. Thiazides do not usually affect normal blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic and antihypertensive. It affects the distal renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption. Hydrochlorothiazide increases excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of potassium and bicarbonate. After oral use diuresis begins within two hours, peaks in about four hours and lasts about 6 to 12 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidney. When plasma levels have been followed for at least 24 hours, the plasma half-life has been observed to vary between 5.6 and 14.8 hours. At least 61 percent of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood-brain barrier.

### Long-term adherence to medications in secondary prevention of urinary tract stones [^114XTVa7]. Journal of Endourology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose: To reduce the high recurrence rate of nephrolithiasis, patients are routinely prescribed secondary chemoprevention therapy with alkali citrate (Alkasolve ®; Sam-On Ltd) for uric acid stones and hypocitraturia or hydrochlorthiazide (Disothiazide ®; Dexcel Ltd) for hypercalciuria. However, data on adherence to these regimens are limited. The aim of this study was to assess rates of long-term adherence to alkali citrate and hydrochlorothiazide and reasons for nonadherence. Materials and Methods: Patients on follow-up for kidney stone disease at a dedicated tertiary stone clinic, from 2010 to 2016, were asked to complete a telephone survey on adherence to secondary prevention medications and reasons for nonadherence. Compliance was also verified by actual drug distribution as reported through a computerized monitoring system. Results: The cohort included 356 patients with mean age of 58 years, 199 (64% men, 36% women) treated with alkali citrate and 143 (68% men, 32% women) treated with hydrochlorothiazide. Adherence rates were 42% in the alkali citrate group and 52% in the hydrochlorothiazide group (p = 0.05). The main reason for noncompliance in the alkali citrate group (22%) was the number of pills needed to be taken daily. Adverse drug effects were the most common reason for noncompliance in the hydrochlorothiazide group (24%) and in 10% of the alkali citrate group (p < 0.0005). Adherence was poorer in younger patients who did not regularly take other medications than in older patients with other chronic diseases and polypharmacy. Conclusions: About half the patients with clear metabolic abnormalities who were prescribed secondary chemoprevention with hydrochlorothiazide and alkali citrate failed to adhere to the prescribed regimen. Reasons for noncompliance differed between both drugs. The findings of this study may help clinicians to identify patients at risk for nonadherence and suggests potential means to improve compliance rates.
