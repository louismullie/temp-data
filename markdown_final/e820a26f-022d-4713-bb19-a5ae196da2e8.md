## Question

Junctional bradycardia summary

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a summary of junctional bradycardia, including its definition, mechanisms, ECG features, etiologies, evaluation, acute and chronic management, special populations, and a concise clinical overview. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how junctional bradycardia is defined and where it fits within bradyarrhythmia taxonomy. Then, I should verify the underlying mechanisms and the anatomic substrate. Next, I will review ECG recognition and pitfalls, followed by a careful enumeration of causes. After that, I need to outline the diagnostic evaluation strategy, including when to pace and when to monitor. Then, I will examine acute management and pharmacologic nuances, followed by chronic management and pacing indications. Finally, I should consider special populations and synthesize a practical clinical summary with key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't mislabel the rhythm. Junctional bradycardia is a slow junctional rhythm arising from the AV junction with a ventricular rate typically less than 60 bpm, often in the 40–60 bpm range, and it is categorized within sinus node dysfunction as a subsidiary escape rhythm when the sinus node fails or is blocked, with guideline algorithms explicitly listing junctional rhythm among SND phenotypes when the heart rate is less than 50 bpm while awake [^113X3qVz] [^115tXvzd] [^112iErYf].

> I need to check the mechanism next. Junctional bradycardia reflects automaticity from the AV junction acting as a protective escape pacemaker when sinus node automaticity is suppressed or when AV conduction is impaired. AV nodal-level block tends to have a more reliable junctional escape than infra-Hisian block, which carries slower and less predictable ventricular escape, and this distinction guides urgency and pacing decisions [^111aJn64] [^116d7xwm].

> Now, I will examine the ECG features and make sure I don't overcall AV dissociation. The hallmark is a regular narrow-QRS rhythm, usually 40–60 bpm, with absent, retrograde, or dissociated P waves; retrograde P waves may follow the QRS with short RP intervals, and isorhythmic AV dissociation can occur when atrial and junctional rates are similar, which can mimic complete AV block if I'm not careful; I should double-check for dropped P waves to distinguish true AV block from dissociation due to near-simultaneous rates [^116d7xwm] [^114wmuEn] [^115PA8dB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology without a structured list. Junctional bradycardia can be physiologic in athletes with high vagal tone, but it is also commonly pathologic: primary SND with sinus node failure, AV nodal block of varying degrees, ischemia or infarction, drug toxicity such as digoxin, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or antiarrhythmics, electrolyte derangements including hyperkalemia, hypoxemia, sleep apnea, and postoperative states including congenital heart disease repairs. I should also remember rare toxicologic causes like ciguatera and systemic illnesses such as COVID-19 that can precipitate bradyarrhythmias [^116HXvXp] [^112emZQQ] [^113k3uAr] [^112KkpeH] [^1115x1MC].

> Next, I should review the evaluation strategy and ensure I correlate symptoms with rhythm. A 12-lead ECG is mandatory to document rhythm, rate, and conduction and to screen for structural clues; ambulatory monitoring links symptoms to bradycardia; echocardiography assesses structure and function; exercise testing evaluates chronotropic competence; and I must actively search for reversible causes such as hypoxia, ischemia, electrolytes, medications, and sleep apnea before labeling a primary conduction disorder; EPS is rarely needed for bradycardia alone and should be reserved for nondiagnostic noninvasive evaluations or concurrent issues [^113HSWBH] [^117JiAG1] [^112iErYf] [^115tXvzd] [^114rwnv7].

> Wait, let me verify the acute management steps so I don't miss temporizing therapy. For unstable patients with hypotension, altered mentation, ischemic chest discomfort, or shock, immediate atropine is first-line, with dopamine or epinephrine infusions if atropine fails; isoproterenol can promote junctional escape but increases myocardial oxygen demand and may worsen ischemia, so I should avoid it when coronary ischemia is suspected; if drugs fail, transcutaneous pacing pads should be placed urgently and transvenous pacing pursued if needed, while simultaneously treating reversible causes such as hyperkalemia, hypoxia, or drug toxicity [^112NhGqp] [^113q5YFZ] [^117Waxmm] [^116EtUiC] [^112XnBtd].

> I should confirm the chronic management and pacing indications, and I need to ensure I don't over-pacemake. Permanent pacing is indicated for symptomatic bradycardia attributable to SND or AV block after reversible causes are excluded, with shared decision-making to align therapy with patient goals; pacing is not indicated for asymptomatic junctional rhythm or sleep-related bradycardia without other indications; in adults with congenital heart disease, loss of AV synchrony from junctional rhythm can worsen AV valve regurgitation and heart failure, so atrial-based pacing may be favored to restore AV synchrony even when symptoms are subtle; I should also consider physiologic pacing strategies when feasible to minimize ventricular pacing burden [^1141nbG9] [^115stakQ] [^111MDTgL] [^111nTM2s].

> But wait, what if the patient is a Fontan or has complex ACHD; I should double-check those nuances. In Fontan physiology, junctional rhythm and SND are common and can impair hemodynamics; expert consensus supports atrial pacing for symptomatic SND or documented adverse hemodynamic effects, and some clinicians consider pacing in selected asymptomatic Fontan patients undergoing surgery, though data are limited and decisions should be individualized; ambulatory monitoring and exercise testing help define chronotropic incompetence and symptom correlation in this population [^1122pE9e] [^111nTM2s] [^115kVwG6].

> Let me reconsider the key differentials so I don't misclassify mimics. Junctional bradycardia must be distinguished from sinus bradycardia with sinus P waves, accelerated junctional rhythm with rates above 60 bpm, and very slow AVNRT that can masquerade as junctional rhythm; careful ECG analysis, vagal maneuvers, and, when needed, electrophysiology can clarify mechanism and prevent inappropriate pacing or ablation decisions [^113MpeEk] [^116Cvwga].

> In summary, I need to ensure the clinical message is precise: junctional bradycardia is a narrow-QRS escape rhythm under 60 bpm arising from the AV junction, most often reflecting sinus node failure or AV block. Evaluation prioritizes ECG documentation, ambulatory correlation, and reversal of causes. Acute therapy for instability follows atropine, catecholamines, and pacing while treating precipitants. Chronic pacing is reserved for symptomatic patients after reversible causes are excluded, with shared decision-making and special attention to ACHD where AV synchrony matters. I should double-check for hyperkalemia, drug toxicity, ischemia, and sleep apnea before committing to device therapy [^113X3qVz] [^112NhGqp] [^1141nbG9] [^113k3uAr].

Junctional bradycardia is a **regular, narrow-QRS rhythm** of 40–60 bpm arising from the AV junction, with absent or retrograde P waves and AV dissociation [^notfound]. It is most often due to **increased vagal tone**, sinus node dysfunction, or AV block, and can also result from ischemia, electrolyte disturbances, or drugs such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, or amiodarone [^111i8w1c] [^112emZQQ]. Evaluation includes a 12-lead ECG, ambulatory monitoring, and targeted labs; management is cause-directed, with atropine, isoproterenol, or temporary pacing for instability, and permanent pacing for persistent symptomatic or high-grade AV block after reversible causes are excluded [^113HSWBH] [^117JiAG1] [^112NhGqp] [^112zcvaG].

---

## Electrocardiographic features

- **Heart rate**: Typically 40–60 bpm.
- **QRS complex**: Narrow (< 120 ms), indicating supraventricular origin.
- **✱✱ p waves**: Absent, retrograde (inverted in inferior leads), or dissociated from QRS.
- **AV dissociation**: Common, with atrial and ventricular rhythms independent [^116d7xwm].

---

## Clinical significance and symptoms

Junctional bradycardia may be **physiologic in athletes** or during sleep, but when pathologic it can cause:

- **Dizziness or lightheadedness**: From reduced cerebral perfusion [^111S3gZT].
- **Syncope or presyncope**: Especially with sudden rate drops [^115aCZMK].
- **Fatigue or reduced exercise tolerance**: Due to low cardiac output [^1172pub7].
- **Chest discomfort or dyspnea**: From inadequate perfusion [^115ZqKuq].

---

## Etiology and contributing factors

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Physiologic | - Increased vagal tone <br/> - Athletes <br/> - Sleep [^113X3qVz] |
| Pathologic | - Sinus node dysfunction <br/> - AV block (first-degree, second-degree, third-degree) <br/> - Myocardial infarction <br/> - Ischemia <br/> - Hypoxia <br/> - Electrolyte disturbances (hyperkalemia, hypokalemia) <br/> - Hypothyroidism <br/> - Infections (e.g. Lyme disease, Chagas disease) [^116d7xwm] [^113k3uAr] |
| Pharmacologic | - Beta-blockers <br/> - Calcium channel blockers <br/> - Digoxin <br/> - Amiodarone <br/> - Antiarrhythmics [^111i8w1c] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **12-lead ECG**: Essential to document rhythm, rate, and conduction; screen for structural disease [^113HSWBH].
- **Ambulatory ECG monitoring**: Holter or event monitors to correlate symptoms with rhythm [^117JiAG1].
- **Laboratory tests**: Electrolytes, thyroid function, troponin, drug levels.
- **Echocardiography**: Evaluate structural heart disease or ischemia [^112iErYf].
- **Electrophysiology study**: Consider if noninvasive evaluation is nondiagnostic [^114rwnv7].

---

## Management strategies

### Acute management

- **Identify and treat reversible causes**: Hypoxia, electrolyte imbalance, drug toxicity, ischemia [^112XnBtd].
- **Atropine**: 0.5–1 mg IV every 3–5 min (max 3 mg) for symptomatic bradycardia [^112NhGqp].
- **Isoproterenol or dopamine**: For atropine-refractory cases or unstable patients [^117Waxmm].
- **Temporary pacing**: Transcutaneous or transvenous pacing for hemodynamic instability or drug-refractory bradycardia [^116uzyy5].

---

### Chronic management

Permanent pacing is indicated for **symptomatic junctional bradycardia** due to sinus node dysfunction or AV block after reversible causes are excluded [^112zcvaG]. Shared decision-making is essential to incorporate patient preferences, comorbidities, and prognosis [^115stakQ].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis depends on the **underlying cause**, reversibility, and treatment. Persistent junctional bradycardia can cause loss of AV synchrony, worsening AV valve regurgitation, heart failure, and atrial arrhythmias, especially in congenital heart disease [^112rdvnR]. Untreated significant bradycardia may lead to syncope, falls, and reduced quality of life [^111S3gZT].

---

## Special considerations

In **congenital heart disease**, junctional rhythm is common after Mustard, Senning, Glenn, or Fontan procedures; atrial pacing may be needed to restore AV synchrony and improve hemodynamics [^112D4uw9] [^111nTM2s]. In athletes, it is often benign and may not require intervention if asymptomatic [^1172pub7].

---

Junctional bradycardia is a narrow-QRS escape rhythm of 40–60 bpm with absent or retrograde P waves; evaluate with ECG and monitoring, treat reversible causes, and use pacing for persistent symptomatic or high-grade block.

### Junctional bradycardia caused by ciguatera intoxication [^112KkpeH]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Ciguatera is a common but underreported tropical disease caused by the consumption of coral reef fish contaminated by ciguatoxins. Gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms predominate, but may be accompanied by cardiovascular features such as hypotension and sinus bradycardia. Here, we report an unusual case of junctional bradycardia caused by ciguatera in the Caribbean; to our knowledge, the first such report from the region. An increase in global sea temperatures is predicted to lead to the spread of ciguatera beyond traditional endemic areas, and the globalisation of trade in coral reef fish has resulted in sporadic cases occurring in developed countries far away from endemic areas. This case serves as a reminder to consider environmental intoxications such as ciguatera within the differential diagnosis of bradycardias.

Introduction

Bradycardia is a common finding in the emergency department (ED) and presents along a clinical spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic to hemodynamic compromise and cardiac arrest.

Objective

This manuscript evaluates the management of bradycardia through a discussion of several cases.

Discussion

Bradycardia may result in severe hemodynamic compromise and is defined as a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute (bpm). There are a variety of causes and associations, including physiologic, pathologic, and pharmacologic. Patients may present with a range of signs and symptoms, from no symptoms to hemodynamic collapse. Obtaining an electrocardiogram is essential, which will determine the severity of bradycardia and underlying rhythm, including first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, second-degree AV block, and third-degree AV block, among others. Management is based on the underlying etiology and patient hemodynamic status, aiming to improve the heart rate and address the underlying cause. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable require resuscitation with chronotropic agents and transcutaneous or transvenous pacing.

Conclusion

Severe bradycardia requires emergent management, and a knowledge of the treatment strategies can optimize patient care.

Isoproterenol, dopamine, and atropine for bradycardia — key evidence and dosing: Because isoproterenol increases myocardial oxygen demand while decreasing coronary perfusion, it is best avoided in settings where there is concern for coronary ischemia, and from a clinical standpoint it is predominantly used in the electrophysiology laboratory (1–20 mcg/ min intravenously); two RCTs of isoproterenol as adjunctive therapy in the setting of cardiac arrest did not show improved return of spontaneous circulation or survival to hospital discharge. In a trial of 82 patients with unstable bradycardia refractory to intravenous fluid bolus and atropine randomized to transcutaneous pacing or dopamine at doses of 5 mcg/ kg/ min, titrated every 2 minutes by 5 mcg/ kg/ min to a maximum of 20 mcg/ kg/ min, there was no difference in survival to hospital discharge or serious adverse events. In a study of 25 patients who had undergone heart transplant, atropine at standard clinical doses resulted in paradoxical heart block or less commonly sinus arrest in 20%, and evidence for parasympathetic reinnervation after orthotopic heart transplant was far less common, 34% versus 11% in 1 series using heart rate variability response to neck suction to test autonomic responses.

Sinus node dysfunction (SND) — pathophysiology and structural correlates: The pathophysiology of SND is varied and usually involves complex electrophysiologic and structural remodeling, with the sinoatrial node comprised of pacemaker, transitional, endothelial, and fibroblast cells plus extracellular scaffolding, and characterized by a unique ion channel and connexin expression profile that results in chronotropic automaticity. Genome-wide association analyses have identified multiple loci in ion channel and channel interacting proteins related to resting heart rates, and specialized cardiomyocytes are insulated by connective tissue that protects pacemaker cells from hyperpolarization by adjacent myocytes. With aging, atrial collagen increases and this fibrosis is correlated with slower heart rate; a histopathologic study of 111 patients showed an association between more extensive fibrosis and SND or tachy-brady syndrome, and fibrosis of the sinus node was also associated with fibrosis in the atrioventricular node. Asymptomatic sinus bradycardia has not been associated with adverse outcomes.

### PACES / HRS expert consensus statement on the recognition and management of arrhythmias in adult congenital heart disease: developed in partnership between the Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society (PACES) and the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS). Endorsed by the governing bodies of PACES, HRS, the American college of cardiology (ACC), the American Heart Association (AHA), the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), the Canadian Heart Rhythm Society (CHRS), and the international society for adult congenital heart disease (ISACHD) [^112rdvnR]. Heart Rhythm (2014). Medium credibility.

Sinus node dysfunction in adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) — mechanisms, risks, and device considerations: Sinus node dysfunction may be observed in rare variants of heterotaxy syndrome (polysplenia, left atrial isomerism) with congenital absence of a sinoatrial node and reliance on a slower atrial or junctional escape for effective atrial depolarization, and postoperative sinus bradycardia or junctional rhythm, with loss of AV synchrony, is a late acquired condition following cardiac surgery. Loss of AV synchrony can markedly worsen AV valve regurgitation, increase atrial arrhythmias, and contribute to hepatic congestion and thrombosis. Years of sinus node dysfunction in adults with CHD results in ineffective atrial hemodynamics that, in conjunction with scar, anatomic obstacles, and atrial hypertension, establish a milieu for atrial tachyarrhythmias. Although sinus bradycardia and sinus arrest have not been identified as risk factors for sudden cardiac death in adults with CHD, atrial arrhythmias, which may be precipitated by sinus node dysfunction, may be a major risk factor for sudden cardiac death. Intra-atrial reentry tachycardia (IART) tends to propagate at atrial rates of 150–250 bpm; 1:1 AV conduction in patients with healthy AV nodes is not uncommon, and the risk of sudden cardiac death in patients with poorly controlled IART is 4-fold and likely related to 1:1 AV conduction degenerating to ventricular tachycardia. In addition, an abnormal heart rate response to exercise in adults with CHD may be associated with IART and confers a higher mortality risk, and any consideration for pacemaker implant among such patients must entail a determination of the risk/benefit of specific devices: those with just brady- versus antitachycardia capabilities, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), or an ICD.

Bradycardia — clinical manifestations and definition state that bradycardia can be broadly classified into 2 general categories: sinus node dysfunction (SND) and atrioventricular block, with SND electrocardiographic findings including sinus bradycardia, ectopic atrial rhythm, junctional rhythm or ventricular escape, intermittent sinus pauses, and blunted heart rate response with exercise (chronotropic incompetence). Vagally mediated atrioventricular block during sleep can be recognized by concomitant sinus node slowing (P–P prolongation), and a sudden increase in parasympathetic tone with vasovagal syncope can cause bradycardia, usually sinus node slowing or sinus arrest but sometimes atrioventricular block. The term "symptomatic bradycardia" is used and defined as a documented bradyarrhythmia directly responsible for syncope or presyncope, transient dizziness or lightheadedness, heart failure symptoms, or confusional states from cerebral hypoperfusion attributable to slow heart rate, and direct attribution of bradycardia as the sole source of symptoms is challenging with nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue being multifactorial and difficult to correlate particularly in modest resting sinus bradycardia or with exercise.

Atrioventricular block — definitions and ECG interpretation are described as follows: First-degree atrioventricular block is each P wave conducted with a prolonged PR interval > 200 ms. Second-degree atrioventricular block is sub-classified into Mobitz I (Wenckebach conduction) and Mobitz II, where Mobitz I follows gradual PR prolongation and Mobitz II does not, and the ECG will show group beating due to "dropped" QRS complexes. Atrioventricular block with only 2:1 block cannot be classified as Mobitz I or II. High-grade, high-degree, or advanced atrioventricular block refers to situations where ≥ 2 consecutive P waves at a normal rate are not conducted without complete loss of atrioventricular conduction, and high-degree atrioventricular block is generally considered to be intra- or infra-Hisian and treated with pacing. Third-degree or complete atrioventricular block implies no conduction at all from atria to ventricles and may be paroxysmal or persistent with a junctional or ventricular escape mechanism, and complete atrioventricular block may be imputed in atrial fibrillation (AF) when the ventricular response is slow (< 50 bpm) and regular. Careful evaluation of the ECG is required because a 1:1 relationship between P waves and QRS complexes may not be present when atrial and ventricular rates are similar (isorhythmic dissociation) or when the atrial rate is slower than the ventricular rate from sinus bradycardia with an accelerated junctional rhythm; in atrial bigeminy premature atrial contractions can lead to an erroneous diagnosis, and in unusual circumstances a vagal etiology may be considered especially when the QRS in narrow.

### Very slow atrioventricular nodal reentry masquerading as junctional rhythm: diagnostic challenges and mechanistic insights [^116Cvwga]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Very slow atrioventricular node reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) can mimic non-reentrant accelerated junctional rhythm (AJR) or junctional tachycardia (JT) OBJECTIVE: Describe the clinical features and mechanism of slow AVNRT masquerading as AJR or JT (collectively called junctional rhythms, JR).

Methods

We reviewed all AVNRT and JT ablations performed at Ascension St. Vincent Hospital, Indianapolis, from July 2016 to June 2024. Patients with a tachycardia cycle length (TCL) ≥ 500 ms were analyzed, focusing on clinical characteristics and electrophysiological findings.

Results

Among 556 AVNRT ablations, 22 patients had TCL ≥ 500 ms. Nine were clinically diagnosed with JR based on one or more of the following: initiation with junctional beats (4), an apparent accelerating junctional rhythm merging into sinus rhythm (3), slow tachycardia rates in the 70–110 bpm (8), incessant slow tachycardia with simultaneous atrial and ventricular activation identified on implantable cardioverter-defibrillator interrogation (1). Five of these 9 patients with JR diagnosis also had a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) diagnosis. During EP study, HrPAC perturbed the next His in all 22 cases, confirming AVNRT. The mean TCL was 578ms (range, 500–670ms). Two patients each had initiation with junctional beats and isorhythmic dissociation with sinus rhythm at onset of AVNRT. Radiofrequency ablation successfully modified the slow pathway and eliminated AVNRT in 21 of 22 patients.

Conclusions

Clinically apparent JR are often very slow AVNRT in patients referred for ablation. The mechanism of AVNRT initiation with isorhythmic dissociation with sinus rhythm may be concurrent JR and AVNRT or 2-for-1 AV nodal conduction and AVNRT competing with sinus rhythm.

Rhythm and conduction disturbances

Bradyarrhythmias and conduction disturbances

Sinus node dysfunction

Sinus bradycardia and sinus arrhythmia are common findings in active people; these findings often normalise during exercise and are usually asymptomatic. Individuals who maintain cardiovascular fitness also often have increased vagal tone, and may have a higher incidence of junctional rhythm, and increased heart rate variability. These findings, in isolation, are compatible with all aircrew duties, including in single seat, high performance aircraft.

In contrast, aircrew with syncope or presyncope caused by sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest or sino-atrial block should be grounded. In asymptomatic individuals, sino-atrial arrest > 3 s during the daytime and > 4 s at night should also lead to temporary withdrawal of aircrew privileges (table 4). Such individuals require further investigation to confirm or exclude underlying cardiac disease.

### PACES / HRS expert consensus statement on the recognition and management of arrhythmias in adult congenital heart disease: developed in partnership between the Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society (PACES) and the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS). Endorsed by the governing bodies of PACES, HRS, the American college of cardiology (ACC), the American Heart Association (AHA), the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), the Canadian Heart Rhythm Society (CHRS), and the international society for adult congenital heart disease (ISACHD) [^111nTM2s]. Heart Rhythm (2014). Medium credibility.

Sinus node dysfunction in adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) — assessment and pacing management are outlined as follows: Sinus node dysfunction is typically best assessed noninvasively with ECGs, ambulatory Holter or event monitors, and exercise stress tests, and heart rate response is the limiting factor in roughly 20% of adults with CHD and chronotropic incompetence. Chronotropic incompetence in the absence of exercise intolerance should not be a clinical indication for a permanent pacemaker, and a pacemaker is recommended for isolated sinus node dysfunction in adults with CHD if there are clinical symptoms related to bradycardia or loss of AV synchrony, exercise intolerance secondary to chronotropic incompetence, or bradyarrhythmia-related adverse hemodynamic effects documented by noninvasive or invasive testing. Worsened AV valve regurgitation or heart failure secondary to loss of AV synchrony (junctional rhythm) should prompt consideration for atrial-based pacing to restore AV synchrony. For patients with bradycardia–tachycardia syndromes and IART, consideration should be given to implanting pacemakers with atrial antitachycardia pacing (ATP) features; atrial ATP requires atrial and ventricular leads, since a 2:1 AV ratio is generally required to trigger therapy, and to minimize associated risks, a concomitant AV nodal blocking agent is strongly advised. For programming and mode selection, AAI or DDD pacing is preferred over isolated VVI pacing in adults with CHD and sinus node dysfunction, programming to reduce the percentage of ventricular pacing should be an important goal, and novel pacemaker algorithms have been developed to reduce ventricular pacing and should be considered in this population.

Atrioventricular block classification and ECG interpretation — Mobitz I (Wenckebach conduction) occurs after gradual PR prolongation whereas Mobitz II does not; atrioventricular block with only 2:1 conduction cannot be classified as Mobitz I or II, making it important to elucidate the level of block. High‑grade, high‑degree, or advanced atrioventricular block refers to situations where ≥ 2 consecutive P waves at a normal rate are not conducted, and high‑degree atrioventricular block is generally considered intra‑ or infra‑Hisian and treated with pacing. Third‑degree or complete atrioventricular block implies no atrioventricular conduction, may be paroxysmal or persistent, and is usually associated with a junctional or ventricular escape mechanism; in atrial fibrillation, complete block may be imputed when the ventricular response is slow (< 50 bpm) and regular. Careful ECG evaluation is required because a 1:1 relationship between P waves and QRS complexes may not be present with isorhythmic dissociation or when sinus bradycardia is coupled with an accelerated junctional rhythm without consistent retrograde ventriculoatrial conduction, and atrial bigeminy with premature atrial contractions may mimic atrioventricular block due to normal conduction, delay, or blocked conduction.

Atrioventricular block — definitions and ECG characteristics include the following: First-degree atrioventricular block is a misnomer with a prolonged PR interval > 200 ms and no true block, more accurately referred to as first-degree atrioventricular delay.

Additionally, atrioventricular block within or below the His bundle may progress rapidly and unexpectedly, is associated with a slower and more unpredictable ventricular escape mechanism, and will not respond to atropine but may improve with catecholamines.

Shared decision-making process — The bradycardia guideline writing committee endorses shared decision-making as part of the general care for patients with symptomatic bradycardia, and a commonly accepted definition of shared decision-making includes 4 components: 1) at least 2 participants, the clinician and patient; 2) both participants share information with each other; 3) both parties build a consensus about the preferred treatment; and 4) an agreement is reached on the treatment to implement. Notably, a recommendation based on evidence or guidelines alone is not shared decision-making, and if time permits the patient should be directed to trusted material which supports and itemizes appropriate considerations which should be factored into their decision-making.

### External validation and update of the early detection rule for severe hyperkalemia among patients with symptomatic bradycardia [^111SyyqN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Chon et al. suggested a high prevalence of severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 6.0 mEq/L with electrocardiographic [ECG] changes) among patients with symptomatic or extreme bradycardia. Despite the urgent need to detect and treat severe hyperkalemia, serum potassium result may be available too late and is often spuriously high. Meanwhile, the traditional, descriptive ECG findings of severe hyperkalemia have shown unsatisfactory diagnostic powers. To overcome these diagnostic problems, they outlined the following quantitative rules to facilitate its early detection: Maximum precordial T wave ≥ 8.5 mV (2), atrial fibrillation/junctional bradycardia (1), heart rate (HR) ≤ 42/min (1) with (original rule)/without (ECG-only rule) diltiazem medication (2), and diabetes mellitus (1). Here we report on our external validation of these rules and the resulting updates.

Methods

This retrospective, cross-sectional study included all adults with symptomatic (HR ≤ 50/min with syncope/pre-syncope/dizziness, altered mentality, chest pain, dyspnea, general weakness, oliguria, or shock) or extreme (HR ≤ 40/min) bradycardia who visited a university emergency department from 2014 to 2019. After validating the abovementioned rules externally, we selected risk factors of severe hyperkalemia among the ECG findings and easy-to-assess clinical variables by multiple logistic regression analysis. After modelling the updated 'ECG-only' and 'ECG-plus' indices, we internally validated the better of the two by bootstrapping with 1000 iterations.

Results

Among 455 symptomatic/extreme bradycardia cases (70.3 ± 13.1 years; 213 females [46.8%]), 70 (15.4%) had severe hyperkalemia. The previous ECG-only rule showed a c-statistic of 0.765 (95% CI: 0.706–0.825), Hosmer-Lemeshow test of p < 0.001, and a calibration slope of 0.719 (95% CI: 0.401–1.04). On updating, the ECG-plus index summing junctional bradycardia/atrial fibrillation (1), maximum precordial T wave ≥ 8.0 mV (2), general weakness as the chief complaint (2), oxygen demand (1), and dialysis (2) outperformed the ECG-only index (c-statistic, 0.832; 95% CI, 0.785–0.880 vs. 0.764; 95% CI, 0.700–0.828; p = 0.011). On bootstrapping, the c-statistic was 0.832 (95% CI: 0.786–0.878). For scores ≥ 3 (positive likelihood ratio ≥ 5.0), the sensitivity and specificity were 0.514 and 0.901, respectively. For scores ≤ 1, negative likelihood ratio was ≤ 0.2.

Conclusions

Previous rules showed less satisfactory calibration but fair discrimination to detect severe hyperkalemia in patients with symptomatic or extreme bradycardia. We propose the ECG-plus index as the optimum tool to facilitate its early detection.

### Premature A-V junctional contractions… [^114VaWTB]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The term "A-V junctional" has replaced "A-V nodal" in recent years, owing to sound arguments voiced by many researchers. A brief review of recent anatomic and electrophysiologic data is necessary to explain this change, since the substitution transcends a simple semantic decree.

1. The A-V node lies at the base of the interatrial septum between the coronary sinus and the medial tricuspid valve leaflet. It connects to the sinus node by three distinct anatomic pathways which may provide a functional route for rapid transmission of the sinus impulse through the atria to the A-V node. 2 In addition to these internodal pathways, anatomically distinct pathways bypassing all or part of the A-V node have been implicated in the interpretation of a number of electrocardiographic phenomena, 3 and will be discussed in the future. Past teaching has indicated that the site of the pacemaker focus during nodal beats lay within the Zipes DP, Fisch C. Premature A-V Junctional Contractions.

Junctional tachycardia — ongoing management recommendations — Oral beta blockers are reasonable for ongoing management in patients with junctional tachycardia, and oral diltiazem or verapamil is reasonable for ongoing management in patients with junctional tachycardia. Flecainide or propafenone may be reasonable for ongoing management in patients without structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease who have junctional tachycardia, and catheter ablation may be reasonable in patients with junctional tachycardia when medical therapy is not effective or contraindicated.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Junctional tachycardia — definition and related rhythm — Junctional tachycardia is a rapid, occasionally irregular, narrow-complex tachycardia with rates typically of 120 bpm to 220 bpm that arises from the atrioventricular (AV) junction, and AV dissociation (often isorhythmic) when present excludes the misdiagnosis of AVRT and makes AVNRT highly unlikely. If it is irregular, junctional tachycardia may be misdiagnosed as AF or MAT, and the mechanism for junctional tachycardia is enhanced (abnormal) automaticity from an ectopic focus in the AV junction. Junctional tachycardia is uncommon in adults; it is typically seen in infants postoperatively, after cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease; as such, there is limited evidence with regard to diagnosis and management of junctional tachycardia in adult patients. A related rhythm, nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia (more commonly known as accelerated AV junctional rhythm), is far more common in adults than paroxysmal junctional tachycardia, is associated with automaticity or triggered activity, occurs at a slower rate (70 bpm to 130 bpm), is often due to digoxin toxicity or myocardial infarction, and treatment of this rhythm centers on addressing the underlying condition.

Sinus node dysfunction (SND) initial evaluation algorithm — Begin by addressing reversible causes: "Treat underlying cause as needed, e.g., sleep apnea (Class I)", and if therapy is effective or unnecessary then "Observe". Evaluate cardiac structure with "Transthoracic echocardiography (Class IIa)" and, when there is "Suspicion for infiltrative CM, endocarditis, ACHD", pursue "Advanced imaging† (Class IIa)". If there are no "Symptoms", "Observe"; if symptoms are "Exercise related", perform "If not already performed: Exercise ECG testing (Class IIa)". When testing is not diagnostic, use "If not already performed: Ambulatory ECG monitoring (Class I)", and reserve "Electrophysiology study† (if performed for other reasons) (Class IIb)" for cases already undergoing EP testing; "The electrophysiology test should not be done primarily for sinus node dysfunction", and if EP testing is for another reason "evaluation of sinus node function may be useful to help inform whether an atrial lead for atrial pacing would have potential benefits". Evidence for SND includes "Sinus pause, sinus bradycardia, junctional rhythm, ectopic atrial rhythm (all with heart rates < 50 bpm) while awake".

Vagally mediated atrioventricular block — features and management explain that it may be an incidental finding that occurred while the patient was sleeping or in other cases be associated with syncope and is felt to be attributable to neural reflexes, which result in simultaneous bradycardia and hypotension, with typically sinus rate slowing in conjunction with the onset of atrioventricular block and the atrioventricular block can be high grade or complete; atrioventricular block attributable to high vagal tone, such as during sleep, is almost always asymptomatic, the level of the block is at the atrioventricular node with normal atrioventricular nodal function when tested at EPS, and if asymptomatic, medical treatment or pacemaker implantation is not warranted; if the patient is having frequent syncopal episodes, treatment may be warranted if bradycardia appears to be the dominant factor, and although PPM implantation is a relatively low-risk cardiac procedure, procedural complications and death directly related to implant can occur, and implanted leads have long-term management implications.

Vagally mediated atrioventricular block — features and management: Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring may reveal episodes during sleep or associated with syncope, attributable to neural reflexes causing simultaneous bradycardia and hypotension, with typical sinus rate slowing and block that can be high grade or complete. Atrioventricular block from high vagal tone, such as during sleep, is almost always asymptomatic; the level of block is at the atrioventricular node with normal atrioventricular nodal function when tested at electrophysiology study (EPS). If asymptomatic, medical treatment or pacemaker implantation is not warranted; if frequent syncopal episodes occur, treatment may be warranted if bradycardia appears dominant in these episodes.

Shared decision-making principles for bradycardia pacing — definition and risk–benefit context: "A commonly accepted definition of shared decision-making includes 4 components: 1) at least 2 participants, the clinician and patient; 2) both participants share information with each other; 3) both parties build a consensus about the preferred treatment; and 4) an agreement is reached on the treatment to implement". "Notably, a recommendation based on evidence or guidelines alone is not shared decision-making". While "pacemaker implantation or revision are commonly performed heart procedures and are not typically associated with high procedural risk in most patients", adverse events "such as pneumothorax and cardiac tamponade can complicate the procedure". Moreover, "patients with significant comorbid conditions may not derive the intended benefit of pacing support or an improved QOL", and "the benefit-risk ratio is not favorable if the probable benefit is also quite low", particularly in terminal progressive illness where "the benefits of pacing support may not be realized and are unlikely to positively impact the overall outcome".

By contrast, block "within or below the His bundle may progress rapidly and unexpectedly", has a "slower and more unpredictable ventricular escape mechanism", "may not respond to atropine but will sometimes improve with catecholamines". "First-degree atrioventricular block is a misnomer; true block is not present, as each P wave is conducted, but with a prolonged PR interval > 200 ms", and is "more accurately referred to as first-degree atrioventricular delay".

Isoproterenol, dopamine, and atropine — clinical considerations: Because isoproterenol increases myocardial oxygen demand and decreases coronary perfusion, it is best avoided where coronary ischemia is a concern and has only a second-line role in resuscitation, with two randomized trials in cardiac arrest showing no improvement in return of spontaneous circulation or survival. In unstable bradycardia refractory to fluids and atropine, a trial of 82 patients randomized to transcutaneous pacing or dopamine showed no difference in survival to hospital discharge or serious adverse events. In heart transplant recipients, atropine at standard clinical doses resulted in paradoxical heart block or sinus arrest in 20% of 25 patients, and parasympathetic reinnervation was far less common, 34% versus 11% in 1 series.

Clinical manifestation of bradycardia and conduction disorders — clinical manifestations of bradycardia vary widely and "can vary widely from insidious symptoms to episodes of frank syncope", and bradycardia "can be broadly classified into 2 general categories: SND and atrioventricular block". In SND, electrocardiographic findings are varied and diagnosis may be considered in patients "with sinus bradycardia or atrial depolarization from a subsidiary pacemaker other than the sinus node (i.e., ectopic atrial rhythm, junctional rhythm, or ventricular escape), intermittent sinus pauses, or a blunted heart rate response with exercise (chronotropic incompetence)". For atrioventricular block, manifestations depend on "whether the atrioventricular block is fixed or intermittent and the ventricular rate or duration of ventricular asystole associated with atrioventricular block", and symptoms "will vary depending on underlying cause and timing". Vagally mediated atrioventricular block may be asymptomatic "if the periods of atrioventricular block occur at night while sleeping when parasympathetic tone is increased" and "can be recognized by the presence of concomitant sinus node slowing (P-P prolongation)". Conversely, "the sudden increase in parasympathetic tone with vasovagal syncope can cause bradycardia (usually sinus node slowing or sinus arrest, but sometimes with atrioventricular block)".

Indications for atrial pacing

Atrial pacing is generally accepted to be beneficial for symptomatic Fontan patients with SND. The most recent 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society Guideline on the Evaluation and Management of Patients With Bradycardia and Cardiac Conduction Delay include atrial pacing as a Class I recommendation in this context. While such recommendations are helpful, it may be exceedingly difficult to determine when Fontan patients are truly "symptomatic". Many are accustomed to living with severe, functional limitations for the entirety of their lives, and such individuals may experience significant clinical improvement with pacing. Conversely, nonspecific symptoms attributed to mild bradycardia may not improve.

In cases of asymptomatic SND, indications for PPM implantation are less certain. Given inherent risks associated with PPM placement after the Fontan operation, providers are often hesitant to refer such patients for a PPM. The decision to undergo an invasive procedure must be weighed against the poorly understood effects of chronic bradycardia and junctional rhythm on Fontan physiology. Currently, the 2014 Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society (PACES)/HRS Expert Consensus Statement on Arrhythmias in Adults with Congenital Heart Disease provides a class IIa recommendation for permanent pacing in patients with a resting heart rate < 40 beats per second, ventricular pauses > 3 seconds, impaired hemodynamics resulting from the bradyarrhythmia, and/or for the prevention of intra-atrial reentry tachycardia. Although similar recommendations (Class IIa) were included in the 2021 PACES expert consensus statement, there is a paucity of data that support such thresholds. Additional work is needed to better understand optimal metrics for PPM implantation; and while current guidelines may help providers identify patients with the most to gain from pacing, implantation must always be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Despite established physiologic importance, management of asymptomatic junctional rhythm after the Fontan operation is perhaps most controversial. In a survey of 154 electrophysiologists and congenital cardiologists, most felt that junctional rhythm in an asymptomatic Fontan patient was a benign finding, with consideration of further evaluation only after the development of symptoms. However, respondents also stated that they would place a PPM in a Fontan patient with junctional rhythm undergoing cardiac surgery for unrelated reasons, even when asymptomatic.

Sinus node dysfunction — natural history and treatment — has a highly variable natural history; the majority of patients who have experienced syncope because of a sinus pause or marked sinus bradycardia will have recurrent syncope, the incidence of sudden death is extremely low, and survival does not appear to be affected whether untreated or treated with pacemaker therapy. The only effective treatment for symptomatic bradycardia is permanent cardiac pacing, and it is crucial to distinguish physiological bradycardia due to autonomic conditions or training effects from circumstantially inappropriate bradycardia that requires permanent pacing.

We describe a case illustrating the potential challenges in distinguishing AV nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) from automatic junctional tachycardia (JT). While an early atrial extrastimulus advanced the next His and ventricular depolarization without tachycardia termination, suggesting JT, other features indicated the correct diagnosis of AVNRT. This teaching case demonstrates a novel exception to a recently reported diagnostic pacing maneuver and illustrates the importance of considering response to multiple maneuvers in reaching a diagnosis of SVT mechanism.

### Bradydysrhythmias and atrioventricular conduction blocks [^115PA8dB]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Bradydysrhythimas include sinus bradycardia, junctional brady-cardia, and idioventricular rhythm, which can be distinguished by examining the tracing for the presence or absence of P waves, noting the morphology of these P waves, and determining the width of the QRS complex. Sinoatrial blocks may occur in either first, second, or third degree varieties. Only second degree sinoatrial block can be detected on the 12-lead ECG. Sinus pause and sinus arrest may mimic second degree sinoatrial block, but their periodicity is irregular. The cyclic variability of sinus arrhythmia is unique; as with the other bradydysrhythmias, it may be innocent or pathologic depending upon clinical circumstances. Atrioventricular blocks may occur, and, similar to sinoatrial blocks, they are also categorized as first-, second-, or third degree. These are of greater clinical relevance than their sinoatrial counterparts.

### Severe bradycardia from severe hyperkalemia: patient characteristics, outcomes and factors associated with hemodynamic support [^113k3uAr]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Bradycardia is an under-studied manifestation of hyperkalemia potentially associated with adverse outcomes. We sought to systematically describe emergency department (ED) patients that present with severe bradycardia (heart rate < 50) associated with severe hyperkalemia (potassium ≥ 6.0 mEQ/L) and identify factors associated with the receipt of hemodynamic support.

Methods

Retrospective, single-center, case series performed at an urban, tertiary-care hospital from 1/1/2014 to 6/30/2020. We included consecutive adult ED patients presenting simultaneously with severe bradycardia and severe hyperkalemia. Patients with prehospital cardiac arrest, hemolyzed potassium specimens, or only point-of-care lab results were excluded. Detailed information, including chronic medications, electrocardiogram (ECG) features, and potassium/heart rate-directed treatments, was abstracted from the ED medical record. Intensive care utilization and in-hospital outcomes were also recorded. Factors associated with receipt of bradycardia-targeted treatment in the ED were determined with univariate comparisons.

Results

We screened 319 records and included 87 patients [mean age 72.5 (95% CI 53–92), 55% female, median heart rate 43 (38–47) beats/min, mean potassium 7.1 (95% CI 5.6–8.7) mEQ/L]. Cardiovascular (hypertension 82%, congestive heart failure 28%) and renal (dialysis dependence 30%) comorbidities were common. Many patients were prescribed negative chronotropic agents (84%) or potassium-retaining (52%) chronic medications. Common presenting scenarios were missed hemodialysis, isolated acute renal failure, or acute renal failure in the setting of concomitant critical illness. ECG revealed: junctional rhythm (39%), peaked T waves (27%), and QRS prolongation (30%). Twenty-eight (32%) patients exhibited hypotension and 34 (40%) altered mentation. Thirty-three (38%) patients received hemodynamic support, including 12 (14%) requiring temporary cardiac pacing. Forty-two (48%) patients received emergent renal replacement therapy and 57 (66%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. Hospital mortality was 10%. Factors associated with receipt of hemodynamic-targeted treatment included a lack of dialysis dependence, junctional rhythm, and concomitant presentation with hypothermia, acidemia, or sepsis.

Conclusions

Patients presenting with severe bradycardia represent a unique phenotype of ED patients with hyperkalemia that may require significant resuscitation and critical care resources. Further research on the treatment of this uncommon, but potentially life-threatening condition is needed.

ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia — resting electrocardiogram (ECG): In patients with suspected bradycardia or conduction disorder, a 12-lead ECG is recommended to document rhythm, rate, and conduction, and to screen for structural heart disease or systemic illness (Class I, Level of Evidence B-NR). The resting ECG is an essential component of the initial evaluation of those with known or suspected bradycardia or conduction disorder, and an appropriately timed ECG during a symptomatic episode may provide a definitive diagnosis.

Bradycardia guideline — initial evaluation of suspected or documented sinus node dysfunction (SND) proceeds by first assessing for a reversible or physiologic cause; when present, "Treat underlying cause as needed, e.g., sleep apnea (Class I)". If there is "Suspicion for structural heart disease", perform "Transthoracic echocardiography (Class IIa)", and if there is "Suspicion for infiltrative CM, endocarditis, ACHD", consider "Advanced imaging† (Class IIa)". For symptomatic assessment, if exercise-related, the algorithm includes "If not already performed: Exercise ECG testing (Class IIa)", and rhythm correlation is addressed with "If not already performed: Ambulatory ECG monitoring (Class I)". Invasive testing is limited to "Electrophysiology study† (if performed for other reasons) (Class IIb)", and "The electrophysiology test should not be done primarily for sinus node dysfunction". The figure also specifies SND manifestations as "Sinus pauses, sinus bradycardia, junctional rhythm, ectopic atrial rhythm (all with heart rates < 50 bpm) while awake".

Use of ECGs in adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) evaluation includes rhythm identification and postoperative surveillance, such as "identification of sinus bradycardia or junctional rhythm in patients at risk of sinus node dysfunction (especially after the Mustard, Senning, Glenn, or Fontan procedure)" and "identification of clinically inapparent intra-atrial re-entry tachycardia in patients who have had atriotomy". Additional uses include conduction and QRS assessment and arrhythmia detection, for example "measurement of QRS duration in patients after repair of TOF and as part of CRT evaluation" and "postoperative to identify arrhythmias (e.g., atrial ectopic tachycardia, atrial flutter, AF, junctional ectopic tachycardia, atrioventricular block)", along with diagnosis and acute care applications such as "diagnosis of Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome in patients with Ebstein anomaly" and "initial evaluation of suspected acute coronary syndromes".

Clinical manifestations of bradycardia — symptoms and definitions: Bradycardia can be broadly classified into 2 general categories: SND and atrioventricular block. The electrocardiographic findings in patients with SND are varied and the diagnosis may be considered in patients with sinus bradycardia or atrial depolarization from a subsidiary pacemaker other than the sinus node (ie, ectopic atrial rhythm, junctional rhythm, or ventricular escape), intermittent sinus pauses, or a blunted heart rate response with exercise (chronotropic incompetence). Sudden increase in parasympathetic tone with vasovagal syncope can cause bradycardia (usually sinus node slowing or sinus arrest, but sometimes with atrioventricular block). Regardless of whether the bradycardia is caused by SND or atrioventricular block, the term "symptomatic bradycardia" is used throughout this document and has been defined as a "documented bradyarrhythmia that is directly responsible for development of the clinical manifestations of syncope or presyncope, transient dizziness or lightheadedness, heart failure symptoms, or confusional states resulting from cerebral hypoperfusion attributable to slow heart rate". Direct attribution of bradycardia as the sole source of symptoms is challenging, and nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue can be multifactorial and therefore difficult to correlate with bradycardia particularly in the setting of modest resting sinus bradycardia or with exercise.

### Evaluating and managing bradycardia [^1172pub7]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Bradycardia is a commonly observed arrhythmia and a frequent occasion for cardiac consultation. Defined as a heart rate of less than 50–60 bpm, bradycardia can be observed as a normal phenomenon in young athletic individuals, and in patients as part of normal aging or disease (Table 1). Pathology that produces bradycardia may occur within the sinus node, atrioventricular (AV) nodal tissue, and the specialized His-Purkinje conduction system. Given the overlap of heart rate ranges with non-pathologic changes, assessment of symptoms is a critical component in the evaluation and management of bradycardia. Treatment should rarely be prescribed solely on the basis of a heart rate lower than an arbitrary cutoff or a pause above certain duration. In the 2018 ACC/AHA/HRS Guideline on the Evaluation and Management of Patients with Bradycardia and Cardiac Conduction Delay (referred to hereafter as the 2018 Bradycardia Guideline), there was a significant shift in emphasis from prior guidelines that emphasized device-based implantation recommendations to a focus on evaluation and management of disease states [1,2]. In this review, we will highlight the changes in the new guideline as well as describe the key elements in evaluation and management of patients presenting with bradycardia.

### Clinical implication of COVID-19 associated bradycardia [^1115x1MC]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Kumar and colleagues performed a large‐scale multicenter retrospective study including more than 1000 COVID‐19 patients and found that bradycardia was prevalent and associated with higher mortality among them. Their findings are of great interest because infection and high fever are, in general, associated with tachycardia. Several concerns have been raised.

To further clarify the mechanism of COVID‐19 associated bradycardia, it is of great interest to investigate the type of bradycardia: sinus bradycardia, AV block, or atrial fibrillation. Noncardiac causes should be carefully excluded, including sedation, conduction‐suppressive medications, and hypothyroidism.

The causality between bradycardia and mortality remains unclear. Bradycardia might be a marker of the advanced stage of COVID‐19 or a direct cause of death. Bradycardia might be more prevalent in patients with COVID‐19 associated myocarditis with incremental troponin level. On the other hand, bradycardia might cause low cardiac output accompanying cardiogenic shock. If bradycardia is harmful, aggressive intervention to bradycardia, including pacemaker therapy, would be beneficial. In their study, was the dominant cause of death in patients with bradycardia respiratory failure or heart failure?
