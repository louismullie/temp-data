## Question

What drawbacks does a KOH preparation have when compared with fungal culture?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the drawbacks of potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation relative to fungal culture. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic accuracy trade-offs, including sensitivity and specificity across clinical contexts. Then, I should verify limitations related to species identification, viability assessment, and downstream testing. Next, I will examine operator dependence and specimen-related pitfalls. After that, I need to check practical barriers such as regulatory and workflow issues. Finally, I will synthesize how guidelines position KOH vs culture and outline when each is appropriate in practice, making sure I cite supporting evidence throughout.

> Let me first confirm the comparative framework: KOH is a rapid, point-of-care microscopy that visualizes fungal elements but does not recover organisms, whereas culture recovers viable fungi at the cost of longer turnaround time; this means I need to balance speed against completeness of data and consider disease-specific pretest probabilities and guideline recommendations before drawing conclusions [^116L3nTz] [^112z1b2x] [^114GGrew].

> I will now examine diagnostic accuracy, but wait, let me verify yields in well-described settings such as pulmonary blastomycosis first: across noninvasive respiratory specimens, KOH microscopy yielded 36% on a single sample and 46% with multiple specimens, whereas culture achieved 75% per single sample and up to 86% with multiple specimens, albeit with results that may take up to 5 weeks, indicating a substantial sensitivity gap favoring culture for definitive diagnosis [^116L3nTz] [^111oTQq5]; in onychomycosis, both KOH and culture can be falsely negative, further underscoring sensitivity limitations of KOH when used alone [^1146mKHQ]; in fungal keratitis, KOH with calcofluor white (KOH+CFW) shows context-dependent sensitivity that can be modest early (about 61%) and better in advanced disease but may drop to 29% in low-incidence settings, reinforcing that performance varies with disease stage and epidemiology [^1147WNWY] [^1155U2kM]; hold on, I almost concluded KOH is uniformly low sensitivity, but in one keratitis dataset the KOH smear reported high sensitivity (96%) with lower specificity versus culture — this likely reflects case mix and labeling issues, so I should caution that KOH sensitivity is variable and setting-dependent, not uniformly high [^113HeQ22].

> Next, I should review specificity and false-positive risks, and I need to ensure I separate analytic from clinical specificity: in the same keratitis work, KOH showed lower specificity (59.2%) against culture as ground truth, implicating non-viable elements or artifacts that may be read as positive, which can prompt unnecessary treatment unless confirmed by culture or other methods [^113HeQ22]; let me consider microscopy pitfalls — textile fibers and debris in KOH smears can mimic hyphae, so operator misclassification is a realistic hazard under routine conditions, especially outside clean validation settings [^117XGMew].

> Now, I should confirm functional limitations: KOH does not provide an isolate, so you cannot perform species-level identification, antifungal susceptibility testing, or molecular typing, all of which are routinely enabled by culture and increasingly necessary for therapy optimization and public health use cases [^112z1b2x] [^114qACBY] [^114wQKYD] [^117JLATh]; hold on, I should verify guideline language — candidiasis guidelines explicitly recommend species identification from culture isolates and endorse platforms such as MALDI-TOF, chromogenic media, PCR, and sequencing when needed, illustrating why a culture isolate remains central to modern mycology workflows [^112z1b2x] [^114qACBY] [^1165hwy7] [^115yr5Je].

> Let me think about operator dependence and inter-reader variability, because this directly affects KOH's real-world performance: interpretation of KOH smears requires significant expertise and shows notable inter-expert variability, with moderate agreement and the need for adjudication in a substantial fraction of cases, making results more fragile when recent hands-on experience is limited [^115Ni1qB] [^113HeQ22]; I should double-check that this limitation is less severe for culture, where growth and downstream identification are less operator-dependent once colonies are obtained and standardized identification workflows are in place [^114qACBY] [^114wQKYD].

> I will now examine specimen quality and morphologic pitfalls, but wait, let me verify common confounders: routine clinical samples often contain detritus and fibers that can obscure or mimic fungal elements on KOH, and morphologic classification in tissue-based methods can also be error-prone, highlighting the broader challenge of morphology-only diagnostics without culture confirmation or molecular adjuncts [^117XGMew] [^1142h3bG].

> Next, I should review practical and implementation barriers, and hold on, I need to separate perception from reality: although KOH is rapid, many dermatology practices rarely perform it, often due to lack of CLIA certification or the perception that it takes too long or is redundant with clinical diagnosis, which can limit uptake despite its low cost and speed [^114T6ZE6]; I should confirm the counterpoint that culture, while more definitive, often requires prolonged incubation, which can delay targeted therapy up to several weeks in endemic mycoses like blastomycosis, so clinicians must balance immediacy against completeness [^116L3nTz].

> But wait, what if disease prevalence or severity changes the calculus; let me reconsider context-specific performance: in low-incidence regions for fungal keratitis, KOH+CFW may perform no better than clinical impression, whereas in high-incidence settings or advanced disease, KOH microscopy can be highly informative at the slit lamp, yet guidelines for respiratory endemic mycoses still recommend using multiple modalities in parallel rather than relying on KOH or culture alone to optimize sensitivity and timeliness [^1155U2kM] [^1147WNWY] [^116L3nTz] [^114GGrew].

> I need to synthesize the comparative drawbacks explicitly: KOH trades speed for completeness — it lacks species identification, viability confirmation, antifungal susceptibility data, and molecular/epidemiologic utility; its accuracy is operator- and context-dependent with potential for false positives and false negatives, whereas culture, despite slower turnaround, yields viable organisms for definitive identification, susceptibility testing, and public health functions, aligning with contemporary guideline algorithms for invasive candidiasis and endemic mycoses [^112z1b2x] [^117JLATh] [^114qACBY] [^116L3nTz] [^114GGrew].

> Finally, I should confirm practical guidance and guardrails: use KOH to rapidly triage and support early empiric decisions, but hold on, I should verify that authoritative sources recommend confirmatory testing before committing to systemic therapy — indeed, primary care and regulatory guidance advise confirming dermatophyte infections with KOH, culture, or PAS before systemic antifungals, while culture or molecular methods should follow to secure species-level data and enable susceptibility testing when management hinges on precise identification or resistance concerns; in ocular or pulmonary mycoses, pair KOH with culture and antigen/serology per guideline-directed multimodal algorithms, and consider fluorescence brighteners or molecular tools to improve early detection where available [^114T6ZE6] [^11785pbJ] [^115EPLK3] [^114qACBY] [^1165hwy7] [^115icmVr] [^1147WNWY] [^1155U2kM] [^116L3nTz] [^114GGrew].

KOH prep is **rapid and inexpensive** [^112cyXJs] but has key limitations versus culture: it **cannot provide species-level identification** [^114wQKYD] or antifungal susceptibility [^117JLATh], and its accuracy is **operator-dependent** [^113HeQ22], with false positives from artifacts [^117XGMew] and false negatives from low organism burden or prior therapy [^1146mKHQ]. It is also **less sensitive than culture** for many pathogens [^116L3nTz] and **cannot detect mixed infections** [^115yr5Je], making it unsuitable for definitive diagnosis or guiding targeted therapy [^112z1b2x]. Culture, although slower, enables species identification [^114wQKYD], susceptibility testing [^112z1b2x], and detection of mixed infections [^115yr5Je], supporting precise treatment decisions [^117JLATh].

---

### Diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity

- **Sensitivity and specificity**: KOH prep has moderate sensitivity and specificity [^1146mKHQ], with false negatives from low organism burden or prior antifungal use, and false positives from artifacts (e.g. fibers, debris) [^117XGMew].

- **Operator dependence**: Accuracy depends on operator skill and experience, causing variability and potential misinterpretation [^113HeQ22] [^115Ni1qB].

- **Comparison with culture**: Culture is more sensitive for many pathogens [^116L3nTz], especially in low-burden or mixed infections [^115yr5Je].

---

### Species identification and antifungal susceptibility

- **Species identification**: KOH cannot provide species-level identification [^114wQKYD], limiting its utility for targeted therapy [^1146mKHQ].

- **Antifungal susceptibility**: KOH does not allow susceptibility testing, so it cannot guide therapy or detect resistance [^117JLATh] [^112z1b2x].

- **Culture advantage**: Culture enables species identification [^114wQKYD] and susceptibility testing [^112z1b2x], supporting precise therapy and resistance detection.

---

### Detection of mixed infections

Mixed infections are **not reliably identified by KOH**, leading to incomplete diagnosis and suboptimal therapy. In contrast, culture can **detect mixed infections** [^115yr5Je], enabling comprehensive diagnosis and appropriate therapy.

---

### Turnaround time and clinical decision-making

- **Rapid results**: KOH provides rapid results (minutes to hours), aiding early clinical decisions [^112cyXJs].

- **Delayed results**: Culture requires days to weeks, potentially delaying definitive diagnosis and therapy [^116L3nTz].

- **Clinical implications**: KOH's speed supports early empiric therapy, but its limitations mean culture is needed for definitive diagnosis and targeted therapy [^114GGrew].

---

### Practical limitations and clinical scenarios

KOH is **useful for rapid screening of superficial infections** (e.g. dermatophytes) [^112cyXJs], but culture is needed for definitive diagnosis and species identification [^114wQKYD] [^1146mKHQ]. It is **inadequate for invasive infections**, for which culture and susceptibility testing are essential for management [^116L3nTz]. In resource-limited settings, KOH is valuable for initial assessment, but its limitations necessitate confirmatory testing when possible [^115Ni1qB].

---

### Summary of limitations

| **Limitation** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Sensitivity and specificity | - Moderate accuracy [^1146mKHQ] <br/> - False positives/negatives common [^113HeQ22] [^117XGMew] |
| Operator dependence | Accuracy varies with operator skill [^113HeQ22] [^115Ni1qB] |
| Species identification | Cannot provide species-level identification [^1146mKHQ] [^114wQKYD] |
| Antifungal susceptibility | Cannot guide therapy or detect resistance [^117JLATh] |
| Mixed infections | Cannot reliably detect mixed infections [^115yr5Je] |
| Definitive diagnosis | Not suitable for definitive diagnosis or targeted therapy [^112z1b2x] |

---

KOH prep is **rapid and inexpensive** [^112cyXJs] but limited by moderate accuracy, operator dependence, and inability to provide species identification or susceptibility testing [^117JLATh]; culture, though slower, **enables definitive diagnosis** [^112z1b2x], species identification [^114wQKYD], susceptibility testing, and detection of mixed infections [^115yr5Je], supporting targeted therapy.

### Microscopically differentiating dermatophytes from sock fibers [^117XGMew]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Dermatophytes are responsible for numerous superficial fungal infections affecting millions worldwide. During microscopic observation using a potassium hydroxide (KOH) fungal smear, various filamentous materials, such as common textile fibers from socks, can obfuscate proper discernment of dermatophytes.

- **Objective**: To differentiate dermatophytes from 9 common sock fibers.

- **Methods**: Nine different textile fiber samples were microscopically analyzed using a KOH direct smear test; their defining structural features were compared and contrasted with those of dermatophytes.

- **Results**: Although there are several similarities, sock fibers tend to have a non-septate, uniform structure, which differentiates them from dermatophytes. Sock fibers are also significantly larger than dermatophytes and can be viewed better at lower magnifications.

- **Limitations**: There is a lack of sock samples with 100% textile fiber composition. Additionally, fibers were examined in a clean setting, without the detritus that normally accompanies dermatophytes in a clinical setting.

- **Conclusion**: While textile fibers may be present in KOH preparations, their general appearance typically differs from that of dermatophytes. An observer who is familiar with these distinctions will be able to differentiate between the two.

### Automated detection of filamentous fungal keratitis on whole slide images of potassium hydroxide smears with multiple instance learning [^113HeQ22]. Ophthalmology Science (2024). Low credibility.

Comparison with traditional methods revealed that DSMIL outperformed traditional CNNs on the slide level. Convolutions in traditional CNNs are unable to detect small details in images of this scale. In addition, CNNs need to scale down the image, resulting in the loss of microscopic resolution crucial for accurate diagnosis. We found that the DSMIL approach results in a model with fairly high accuracy in cases where human graders are in agreement, yet its performance diminishes in situations where confidence in the ground truth is low, indicating more challenging images. Our analysis highlights both the potential and the challenges of using deep learning models for this application, particularly in terms of variability in human labeling and the intrinsic difficulties of interpreting KOH smears.

Labeling KOH smears on WSIs is inherently challenging and subject to operator-dependent variability and interpretation. The moderate agreement between labelers, with a kappa score of 0.45, and the need for adjudication in approximately 38.3% of cases underscores the difficulty in this task. Factors contributing to this challenge include potential quality loss during WSI conversion and the intrinsic difficulty of interpreting KOH smears.

The KOH smear test demonstrated high sensitivity (96.0%) but lower specificity (59.2%) when compared with fungal cultures as ground truth. This finding aligns with other studies, which also report high false-positive rates due to the non-growth of fungi in culture. This discrepancy reveals the inherent limitations of KOH smears, where the presence of fungi might be falsely indicated.

### Antifungal susceptibility testing and identification [^117JLATh]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

The requirement for antifungal susceptibility testing is increasing given the availability of new drugs, the growing populations of individuals at risk for fungal infection, and emerging multiresistant fungi. Rapid and accurate fungal identification remains at the forefront of laboratory efforts to guide empiric therapy. Antifungal susceptibility testing methods have greatly improved but are subject to variation in results between methods. Careful standardization, validation, and extensive training of users are essential to ensure susceptibility results are clinically useful and interpreted appropriately. Interpretive criteria for many drugs and species are still lacking, but this will continue to evolve.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for invasive candidiasis, more specifically with respect to fungal culture, the ASM/ECMM/ISHAM 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining identification of Candida to the species level when treatment is being considered. This is to guide empirical management, detect outbreaks, and support surveillance efforts. It is advised to use algorithms incorporating clinical risk as a guide for identifying when yeast cultured from different specimen types.

### Comparison of diagnostic methods in the evaluation of onychomycosis [^1146mKHQ]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common problem seen in clinical practice. Given the differential diagnosis of dystrophic nails, it is helpful to obtain a definitive diagnosis of dermatophyte infection before the initiation of antifungal therapy. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation and fungal culture, which are typically used in the diagnosis of these infections, often yield false-negative results. Recent reports have suggested that nail plate biopsy using periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain may be a very sensitive technique for the diagnosis of onychomycosis.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to compare KOH preparation, culture, Bx/PAS stain, and calcofluor white (CW) stain in the diagnosis of onychomycosis and to determine their sensitivity and specificity.

- **Methods**: We evaluated 105 patients with suspected onychomycosis using four diagnostic methods: KOH preparation, culture, Bx/PAS, and CW stain. CW stain binds to cellulose and chitin and fluoresces when exposed to UV radiation. It is a highly sensitive and specific technique for the detection of dermatophytes. To determine the clinical usefulness and performance characteristics of each test, CW was chosen as the gold standard for statistical analysis.

- **Results**: Of the patients, 93 had at least one of the four diagnostic methods positive for the presence of organisms. The following were calculated for each test: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. The sensitivities of each of the techniques were as follows: KOH 80%; Bx/PAS 92%; and culture 59%.

### Touch preparation for the rapid diagnosis of disseminated aspergillosis [^116PHLh5]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

A variety of histologic stains can aid in identifying fungal organisms on direct microscopy of touch preparations. Many stains target chitin in fungal cell walls, although there are differences in the drying time and specificity of components stained. KOH may be used to help clear the specimen of debris, and other stains can be added after the application of KOH. Chlorazol Black E, used in this case, can be applied directly to the touch preparation tissue smear with staining sufficient to distinguish fungal elements in as little as 5 minutes.

- **Staining techniques**: A staining procedure designed for blood smears, marketed as Quik-Dip (Mercedes Medical, Sarasota, FL), was used on a touch preparation to diagnose cutaneous cryptococcal infection. Parker blue ink, as a component of Swartz Lamkins fungal stain, has been reported in touch preparations for cutaneous zygomycosis. Grocott and Gomori methenamine silver stains, hematoxylin-eosin stain, and periodic acid-Schiff with diastase are all routinely used in processed tissue samples and are necessary for confirmation of any presumptive diagnosis based on touch preparation. A simple technique using a spatula and tape has also been described for quickly mounting intact fungal organisms from a tube culture onto a slide for microscopic examination.

### Is the physical functioning of older adults with diabetes associated with the processes and outcomes of care? Evidence from Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD) [^11133ARB]. Diabetic Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

To examine the relationship between physical function limitations and diabetes self-management, processes of care, and intermediate outcomes in adults aged 65 years and older with Type 2 diabetes, we studied 1,796 participants in managed care health plans enrolled in Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD). Physical functioning was assessed at baseline with the Physical Component Summary of the Short Form-12 Health Survey. Diabetes self-management was assessed with follow-up surveys. Processes of care, including eye examinations, urine microalbumin testing, and foot examinations, as well as intermediate health outcomes such as HbA(1c), blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol, were assessed with medical chart reviews. Multivariate regression models were constructed to examine the associations between physical function limitations and outcomes.

- **Results**: Frequency of eye examinations (odds ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.49–0.99) was the only process of care that was worse for participants with physical function limitations (n = 573) compared with those without limitations (n = 618). Neither self-management nor intermediate outcomes differed by whether patients had or did not have physical function limitations.

- **Conclusion**: Limitations in physical functioning as assessed by the Short Form-12 were not associated with substantial differences in diabetes care in adults aged 65 years and older enrolled in managed care health plans.

### Microbiological laboratory testing in the diagnosis of fungal infections in pulmonary and critical care practice. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^116L3nTz]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Microscopic visualization of typical blastomycosis organisms in freshly prepared respiratory secretions or in histopathology can rapidly confirm the diagnosis of infection. The diagnostic yield of visualized organisms on KOH preparations of respiratory secretions, including BAL, was reported as 36% when a single sample was studied and 46% in confirmed cases with multiple specimens. The diagnostic yield of culture was up to 86% across multiple specimens from the same patient and 75% from a single specimen; however, culture positivity could take up to 5 weeks for completion.

- **Recommendations**: In patients with appropriate geographic exposure and illness compatible with infection or pneumonia due to blastomycosis, it is suggested to use more than one diagnostic test. This includes direct visualization and culture of sputum BAL or other biopsy material, urine antigen testing, and serum antibody testing. The evidence cannot support a single best test as being sensitive enough to be ordered in isolation of other tests. The approach should be tailored based on the severity of the illness, the clinical context, and the availability of tests (conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

	- **Technical remark**: Although microscopic visualization and culture to identify blastomycosis organisms are quite specific, they lack sensitivity; hence, the addition of serum antibody testing and urine antigen testing increases the overall diagnostic yield.

In patients with suspected blastomycosis, it is suggested that serum antibody testing be specifically directed against the antigen.

### Cost-effective method for identification of dimorphic fungi [^115S2quM]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

Traditional methods to identify dimorphic fungi dictate that the mold be converted to the yeast phase at 35 to 37 degrees Celsius. We present a time- and cost-saving method of confirming the identification of a dimorph by using special stains to demonstrate the yeast phase directly growing in the original clinical specimens.

### Rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis: Pictorial review [^115tYpJk]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Direct microscopy, histopathology, and fungal culture of surgical specimens form the cornerstones in the diagnosis of MCR. Hyphae of Mucorales demonstrate a broad (6–25 μm), non-septate, branching (90° bifurcations) morphology and can be detected using direct microscopy or on a potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mount preparation. Neutrophilic or granulomatous inflammation is the predominant finding on histopathology. Prominent necrosis and angioinvasion are common. Histopathological tissue diagnosis is still one of the most accurate and fast diagnostic modalities for MCR. All Mucorales species grow rapidly — within days — on Sabouraud dextrose agar at a temperature of 25–30 °C. Recently introduced molecular assays, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques, aid in rapid diagnosis and speciation of Mucorales from a variety of specimens.

- **Figures**:

### Utility of touch preparation for rapid diagnosis of cutaneous mucormycosis [^113DzMLF]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Touch preparations have been described extensively in the literature as a diagnostic tool for solid and hematologic malignancies. The usefulness of touch preparation for rapid diagnosis of invasive cutaneous infections has been reported in only six cases. However, three of the reports (including the Case) were from residents trained at the same hospital program in this simple technique with reproducible success. Multiple stains can highlight fungal organisms, including but not limited to potassium hydroxide, periodic acid–Schiff, Gomori methenamine silver, and even Gram stain.

In our case, the use of a touch preparation with Swartz Lamkins (Delasco), which contains potassium hydroxide, allowed for identification of fungal organisms even before tissue culture and pathology results were available, permitting early intervention. Demonstration of the organism in tissue biopsy specimen and confirmation of the species by culture still remain the gold standard for diagnosis of opportunistic infection. Dermatologists should become familiar with a touch preparation because it is easy to perform and may allow for the rapid bedside diagnosis of mycotic and protozoan infections in acutely ill immunocompromised patients.

### Comparison of different methods of isolation of DNA of commonly encountered Candida species and its quantitation by using a real-time PCR-based assay [^116DMNyv]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

Molecular diagnosis based on genomic amplification methods, such as real-time PCR assay, has been reported as an alternative to conventional culture for early detection of invasive candidiasis. However, a major limitation of the molecular method is the difficulty associated with breaking fungal cell walls, since the DNA extraction step still requires more than half of a working day. It has been suggested that PCR detection of free template DNA in serum is preferred over the use of whole blood for the diagnosis of systemic candidiasis.

In this study, two conventional procedures were evaluated:

- **The HLGT method**: Boiling sera in an alkaline guanidine-phenol-Tris reagent.

- **The PKPC method**: Using proteinase K digestion, followed by organic extraction.

Additionally, three commercially available kits for DNA isolation were evaluated for sensitivity, purity, cost, and use of template for most clinically important Candida species in a TaqMan-based PCR assay. To optimize these procedures, we evaluated the effect of adding 0.5% bovine serum albumin to DNA extracts and found that it decreased the effects of inhibitors.

The QIAamp DNA blood kit significantly shortened the duration of the DNA isolation but was among the most expensive procedures. Furthermore, the QIAamp DNA blood kit proved to be as sensitive as the HLGT DNA isolation method for PCR amplification from 52 serum samples from hematology or oncology patients with clinically proven or suspected systemic Candida infections. All PCR-positive samples showed approximately the same Candida species load by both procedures.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for meniscal tears, specifically in relation to physical examination, the APTA 2018 guidelines recommend the following:

- **Activity level assessment**: Consider using the Tegner Activity Scale or the Marx Activity Rating Scale to evaluate activity level before and after interventions. These scales help assess physical impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions associated with meniscus lesions.

- **General health assessment**: Use the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey or the European QoL-5 Dimensions to assess general health.

- **Knee-related quality of life assessment**: Consider using the Knee QoL 26-item questionnaire to evaluate knee-related quality of life.

### Evaluation of two MALDI-TOF MS systems and extraction methods for identification of filamentous fungi recovered from clinical specimens [^114Mxub9]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

Filamentous fungi (molds) are commonly found in the environment but can also be important human pathogens. Infections can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates, particularly among immunocompromised patients. A clinical mycology laboratory plays a critical role by culturing and identifying molds. At the time of writing, the standard-of-care (SOC) identification method for molds is phenotypic macroscopic and microscopic characterization. There is growing evidence that matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), which revolutionized clinical bacteriology, can improve mold identification. Potential benefits of using MALDI-TOF MS for mold identification include improved species-level accuracy, shorter turnaround times, and reduced training periods for laboratory staff. This is critical given the labor shortages of medical laboratory technologists and an aging workforce. Another potential advantage of mold identification by MALDI-TOF MS is mitigating laboratory-acquired infections by identifying molds prior to colony maturation.

Two key factors for successful mold identification by MALDI-TOF MS are the extraction step and the robustness of the spectra database. The extraction process is important for inactivating the infectious mold spores and for improving run spectra. Each MALDI-TOF MS manufacturer has a recommended mold extraction protocol, but several studies have reported modified or alternative approaches with varying success and clinical implementation feasibility. The NIH extraction method is one of the more prominent approaches.

### Automated detection of filamentous fungal keratitis on whole slide images of potassium hydroxide smears with multiple instance learning [^112aKeM9]. Ophthalmology Science (2024). Low credibility.

We aimed to use computer vision to enable automated interpretation of KOH smear specimens. This process requires obtaining microscopic photographs, but the high magnification needed to visualize fungal filaments limits the field of view, making this challenging. Implementing a computer vision model trained to interpret standard photomicrographs would require the user to manually identify and photograph any fungal filaments on the KOH slide before inputting the image to the model, which is a level of human expertise that would render the model essentially useless. To develop a model capable of automated KOH smear interpretation without requiring any human expertise or image preselection, we adapted our framework to enable interpretation of photographs of the entire KOH smear obtained using WSI.

The advent of WSI has enabled the digitization of microscopic slides, facilitating remote analysis and potential automation of the diagnostic process. WSIs typically consist of obtaining high-magnification images at different focal planes and magnification powers, collated into a single large file, creating a digital representation of the entire microscopic specimen.

- **Figure 1**: Whole slide image of a KOH smear demonstrating fungal filaments. The WSI file (visualized on the left with low magnification) allows visualization of patches at different magnifications, enabling detailed observation of fungal filaments (see red box). KOH = potassium hydroxide; WSI = whole slide imaging.

Although the KOH smears were labeled by the physician on-site, we needed to rel

### Hints to diagnose stroke in the acute vestibular syndrome: Three-step bedside oculomotor examination more sensitive than early MRI diffusion-weighted imaging [^115Chm3Y]. Stroke (2009). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "HINTS examination for stroke in acute vestibular syndrome" is a valuable tool for assessing acute ischemic stroke in patients experiencing dizziness and vertigo. The HINTS (Head-Impulse, Nystagmus, Test of Skew) examination is employed to evaluate patients who present with acute vestibular syndrome (AVS), which is defined by the sudden onset of prolonged, continuous vertigo, unsteady gait, nausea or vomiting, nystagmus, and intolerance to head motion. This examination helps in distinguishing between a central cause of AVS, such as a stroke, and peripheral causes, like vestibular neuritis.

The HINTS examination includes three components:

- **Head impulse test**: A normal result suggests a "central" pattern indicative of a stroke, while an abnormal result suggests a "peripheral" pattern.

- **Observation for nystagmus**: Direction-changing nystagmus is highly suggestive of a central cause like a stroke.

- **Test of skew**: The presence of skew deviation supports a diagnosis of stroke, whereas its absence tends to indicate a peripheral cause.

The HINTS examination proves to be particularly useful in emergency department settings, aiding in the rapid differentiation between central and peripheral causes of AVS. It has demonstrated greater sensitivity than early MRI in detecting strokes in patients with AVS. Utilizing these three clinical tests systematically facilitates the interpretation of results in distinguishing a potential stroke from benign conditions such as vestibular neuritis.

### Molecular diagnostics in medical mycology [^115icmVr]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

For any diagnostic assay to be successful in the clinical laboratory, ease of use and turnaround time are crucial. Assays that can be completed rapidly with minimal sample preparation are desirable. For fungal infections, in particular, the ability to output quantitative values that help determine fungal load can provide clinicians with useful information for monitoring the effectiveness of treatment. Similarly, particularly for infected tissue, an assay should have a wide analytical range that allows it to be accurate with either minute or large numbers of cells. Unfortunately, as with all microorganisms, antifungal resistance is a growing problem. Thus, there is an increasing need for assays that can yield an identification and simultaneously determine if drug resistance is present.

Different platforms will have different specimen types that can be used. Whole-cell assays may be problematic due to the complex morphology of fungi (e.g. single-celled yeasts, filamentous hyphae, or both [dimorphism]). While yeast cells are usually handled by any instrument that uses whole-cell inputs, analysis of molds may be difficult or impossible due to physical problems posed by hyphae, which can clog channels or tubes, clump, or be unevenly distributed in liquid. Platforms that work on dead or lysed cells are especially valuable due to the increasing need to perform diagnostic tests on fixed specimens. Unfortunately, formalin, typically used in the fixation process, can fragment and crosslink DNA and proteins, inhibiting downstream analysis.

### Validation of a lateral flow immunochromatographic assay for tinea unguium diagnosis [^11455Qp2]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Tinea unguium is a common nail disease caused by dermatophytes. Although direct potassium hydroxide (KOH) microscopy and fungal culture are considered the gold standard for diagnosing this disease, their accuracy is insufficient. A lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFIA) kit, using a monoclonal antibody against Trichophyton rubrum, was developed, and its sensitivity was recently improved by 50% in vitro relative to its earlier version. The present study aimed to validate the clinical utility of this improved LFIA kit for diagnosing tinea unguium in comparison with direct KOH microscopy. A similar trial was simultaneously performed using scale samples from patients with tinea pedis to determine the assay's diagnostic potential.

Nail samples, approximately 2 mg in weight, were collected from 112 untreated tinea unguium patients and 56 non-tinea unguium patients. Samples from 25 tinea pedis patients and 20 non-tinea pedis patients were also collected. The sensitivity and specificity of the LFIA kit for tinea unguium were 84.8% (95/112) (95% confidence interval, 76.8–90.9) and 83.9% (47/56) (95% CI, 71.7–92.4), respectively. The inconsistency rate was 15.5% (26/168) (95% CI, 10.4–21.9). The sensitivity and specificity of the LFIA kit for tinea pedis were 84.0% (21/25) and 100.0% (20/20), respectively.

These results suggest that for diagnosing tinea unguium, the LFIA kit is a useful supplement to, but not a replacement for, direct KOH microscopy. For a definitive diagnosis of suspected cases, appropriate sampling, repeated examinations, and a combination of diagnostic techniques are recommended.

### Polymerase chain reaction in the diagnosis of onychomycosis: a large, single-institute study [^116HngHt]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Tests commonly used in the diagnosis of onychomycosis include potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation, histopathological examination with periodic acid-Schiff stain (PAS), and culture. These tests are either time-consuming or require specially trained personnel. A recently developed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay has the potential to provide a quick, inexpensive, and operator-independent diagnosis of onychomycosis.

- **Objective**: To determine the range of fungal species detected by the PCR technique and to compare this technique with KOH, PAS, and culture on patient specimens.

- **Methods**: A total of 176 dermatophytic and nondermatophytic fungal culture isolates were tested by PCR. Five hundred and fifty nail specimens from 550 patients with suspected onychomycosis were split and tested concurrently with PCR, PAS, KOH, and culture.

- **Results**: PCR was positive in 65 out of 66 dermatophyte culture isolates and negative in all 110 nondermatophyte and yeast isolates. Overall, PAS, PCR, KOH, and culture were positive in 54%, 37%, 40%, and 22% of specimens, respectively. Fifty-two percent were positive for KOH and PCR.

- **Conclusion**: PCR is a specific, relatively sensitive test for onychomycosis. When used in conjunction with KOH, PCR can produce positivity rates similar to those with PAS alone.

### Bacterial keratitis preferred practice pattern® [^117ED5xh]. Ophthalmology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for bacterial keratitis, more specifically with respect to corneal culture, AAO 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining a corneal smear and/or culture in the following circumstances:

- **Central, large (> 2 mm) corneal infiltrate**: Prompt investigation is advised to determine the underlying cause.

- **Associated significant stromal involvement or melting**: In-depth analysis is required to prevent further complications.

- **Chronic or unresponsive infection**: Particularly if the infection does not respond to broad-spectrum antibiotics, further diagnostic procedures are necessary.

- **History of corneal surgery**: Previous surgical interventions can complicate the typical presentation and progression of keratitis.

- **Atypical clinical features suggestive of other infections**: Features indicative of fungal, amoebic, or mycobacterial keratitis necessitate specific testing.

- **Infiltrates in multiple locations on the cornea**: Multiple infiltrations require careful investigation to effectively tailor treatment strategies.

### Agar block smear preparation: A novel method of slide preparation for preservation of native fungal structures for microscopic examination and long-term storage [^116jsjGj]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

We describe a novel method of fungal slide preparation named "agar block smear preparation". A total of 510 agar block smears of 25 fungal strains obtained from culture collections, 90 QC fungal strains, and 82 clinical fungal strains from our clinical microbiology laboratory, which included a total of 137 species of yeasts, molds, and thermal dimorphic fungi, were prepared and examined.

In contrast to adhesive tape preparation, agar block smears preserved the native fungal structures, such as intact conidiophores of Aspergillus species and arrangements of conidia in Scopulariopsis brevicaulis. Furthermore, agar block smears allowed examination of fungal structures embedded in the agar, such as the ascomata with ascomal hairs in Chaetomium funicola; pycnidium of Phoma glomerata; the intercalary ovoidal chlamydospores arranged in chains of Fusarium dimerum; and the lateral, spherical chlamydospores arranged in pairs of Fusarium solani.

After 1 year of storage, morphological integrity was found to have been maintained in 459 (90%) of the 510 agar block smears. After 3 years of storage, morphological integrity was found to have been maintained in 72 (71%) of the 102 smears prepared in 2006. Agar block smear preparation preserves the native fungal structures and allows long-term storage and examination of fungal structures embedded in the agar, hence overcoming the major drawbacks of adhesive tape preparation.

The major roles of agar block smear should be diagnosis for difficult cases, accurate identification of fungal species for clinical management of patients, and epidemiological research.

### Activities of daily living limitations and the use of physical examination among older adults with informal care in China: do gender and residence make differences [^1122BzNa]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Low credibility.

This study investigated the relationship between activities of daily living (ADL) limitations and the use of physical examination among older adults receiving informal care and further examined whether this relationship varies by gender and urban-rural areas.

- **Methods**: The data in this study were obtained from the sixth Health Service of Shandong Province, China. A total of 8,358 older adults aged 60 years or older who received informal care were included in the analysis. Binary logistic regression models were conducted to explore the association between ADL limitations and the use of physical examination and to examine differences between gender and urban-rural areas.

- **Results**: The prevalence of limitations in ADL and physical examination utilization rate among older adults receiving informal care in Shandong Province were 14.12% and 72.31%, respectively. After adjusting for confounders, ADL limitations were negatively correlated with the utilization of physical examination services among older adults receiving informal care (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.87, P < 0.001), and there were gender and rural-urban differences. The association between ADL limitations and the use of physical examination was statistically significant in older women receiving informal care (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.80, P < 0.001). Additionally, only among urban older adults receiving informal care, those with ADL limitations had lower utilization of physical examination services than participants without ADL limitations (OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.74, P < 0.001).

### Antifungal therapy in infants and children with proven, probable or suspected invasive fungal infections [^116QpkUy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Invasive fungal infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in children. Optimal treatment strategies are yet to be defined.

- **Objectives**: This review aims to systematically identify and summarize the effects of different antifungal therapies in children with proven, probable, or suspected invasive fungal infections.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2008), EMBASE (1980 to September 2008), and CINAHL (1988 to September 2008) without language restrictions. We also hand-searched reference lists and abstracts of conference proceedings and scientific meetings and contacted authors of included studies and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing a systemic antifungal agent with a comparator (including placebo) in children (one month to 16 years) with proven, probable, or suspected invasive fungal infection.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently applied selection criteria, performed quality assessment, and extracted data using an intention-to-treat approach. We synthesized data using the random-effects model and expressed results as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

- **Main results**: We included seven trials of antifungal agents in children with prolonged fever and neutropenia (suspected fungal infection) and candidaemia or invasive candidiasis (proven fungal infection). Four trials compared a lipid preparation of ampho

### Challenges and pitfalls of morphologic identification of fungal infections in histologic and cytologic specimens: A ten-year retrospective review at a single institution [^1142h3bG]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Despite the advantages of providing an early presumptive diagnosis, fungal classification by histopathology can be difficult and may lead to diagnostic error. To assess the accuracy of histologic diagnosis of fungal infections versus culture (the "gold standard"), we performed a 10-year retrospective review at our institution. Of the 47 out of 338 positive mold and yeast cultures with surgical pathology evaluation without a known history of a fungal infection, 37 (79%) were correctly identified based on morphologic features in histologic and/or cytologic specimens. The 10 discrepant diagnoses (21%) included misidentification of septate and nonseptate hyphal organisms and yeast forms. Errors resulted from morphologic mimics, use of inappropriate terminology, and incomplete knowledge in mycology. The accuracy did not correlate with preceding antifungal therapy (P = 0.14) or use of special stains (P = 0.34) and was not operator-dependent. Among 8 discrepancies with clinical follow-up available, 2 potentially adverse clinical consequences resulted. While histopathologic identification of fungi in tissue sections and cytologic preparations is prone to error, implementation of a standardized reporting format should improve diagnostic accuracy and prevent adverse outcomes.

### Use of in-office preparations by dermatologists for the diagnosis of cutaneous fungal infections [^114T6ZE6]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cutaneous fungal infections account for millions of office visits per year, yet their varied presentations often lead to misdiagnosis. If dermatology clinics are Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) certified, direct microscopy with potassium hydroxide or other stains can be used to inexpensively and rapidly diagnose fungal infections. In this survey, we examined dermatologists' perceptions of fungal preparations and CLIA certification to identify barriers that prevent the use of these bedside diagnostics.

The response rate was 13% (n = 308, based on the number of emails opened). When a cutaneous fungal infection is suspected, 20.94% of dermatologists rarely or never, and 19.86% sometimes, perform fungal preparations, often because they think clinical diagnosis is adequate or that preparations take too long. Additionally, 21.32% reported not having CLIA certification, most frequently because the process requires too much work or they do not know how to apply. Of providers with CLIA certification, over 25% thought it was difficult to obtain.

Our results demonstrate that numerous barriers prevent the common use of fungal preparations, including the perception that clinical diagnosis is sufficient and the lack of required CLIA certification. These barriers emphasize the need for additional education about cutaneous fungal infections and the use of bedside diagnostics. Additionally, policy-based interventions are necessary to ease the process of CLIA certification.

### Microbiological laboratory testing in the diagnosis of fungal infections in pulmonary and critical care practice. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111rtBM7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

None of the widely available diagnostic approaches for the diagnosis of blastomycosis exhibit consistently high performance characteristics to recommend using a single test in isolation from other approaches. For instance, direct visualization of blastomycosis organisms, though specific and timely, exhibits suboptimal sensitivity and yield. Culture of respiratory secretions, including BAL, has reasonably high sensitivity; yet, the diagnosis may be delayed for up to 5 weeks with this approach. Antigen testing, particularly as applied to urine, can be a useful diagnostic adjunct with good sensitivity; however, antigen assays do exhibit significant cross-reactivity to other endemic mycoses. Serum antibody testing has been variably reported to exhibit low to moderate sensitivity, but again it carries the risk of cross-reactivity with other fungal infections. PCR approaches are emerging but are not yet widely available in clinical settings and have not been analyzed in large clinical studies. The clinician confronted with a case of possible blastomycosis should consider using a variety of assays to optimize the overall diagnostic yield and to prevent overdiagnosis of blastomycosis occurring through cross-reactivity of assays with other fungi, particularly histoplasmosis.

- **Implementation and limitations**: Direct visualization of blastomycosis organisms, such as by KOH-treated preparation of respiratory secretions and BAL, can rapidly and specifically confirm the diagnosis, but it requires local expertise. Culture can also be performed at local or regional referral laboratories.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for community-acquired pneumonia, specifically in relation to fungal testing for coccidioidomycosis, the ATS 2019 guidelines recommend considering more than one diagnostic test. These include direct visualization and culture of sputum bronchoalveolar lavage or other biopsy material, urine and serum antigen testing, and serum antibody testing in patients with appropriate geographic exposure and illness compatible with infection or pneumonia due to coccidioidomycosis. Tailor the testing approach based on the severity of the illness, the clinical context, and the availability of tests.

### Clinical characteristics of people with cystic fibrosis and frequent fungal infection [^116hwAAQ]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2022). Low credibility.

Initially, we compared patients with no fungal positive cultures, rare fungus (one positive), and intermittent fungi (≥ 2 positive but < 50% positive); however, given the limited group sample sizes, we chose to dichotomize fungal exposure to align with previously published literature and to provide greater power for group comparisons. Results from cultures over the 2-year baseline period were used to categorize individuals as either having rare fungus, defined as ≤ 1 positive fungal culture in the baseline period and no positive fungal cultures recorded before baseline, or frequent fungi, defined as having 2 or more positive fungal cultures in the baseline period. Definitions were based on adaptations from previously published fungal and chronic bacterial infection studies in cystic fibrosis.

Given that we defined fungal exposure for individuals in the baseline period, individuals could transition groups during the follow-up period (e.g. those classified as rare could later meet criteria for frequent fungal infection). Participants were considered rare during follow-up if they had 1 positive culture and considered frequent if they met criteria (2 positive cultures) in any year of follow-up. Chronic P. aeruginosa status was defined by a modified Leeds criteria of > 50% positive cultures for P. aeruginosa over at least one 12-month period. Patients were defined as chronic at baseline if they met these criteria for at least one 12-month period in the baseline study period (and similarly defined during the follow-up period).

### Laboratory-based epidemiological study of superficial fungal infections [^115JkXpo]. The Journal of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Dermatophytosis continues to be a worldwide problem, constituting a large bulk of cases attending the dermatology outpatient department in tropical countries. Variable climatic conditions and multiple etiological agents, whose individual prevalence varies with time, prompted an attempt to define the pattern and etiological prevalence in our locality and compare them with earlier studies from different centers. Of consenting patients clinically diagnosed with superficial fungal infections, 1,975 were investigated in the laboratory. All the specimens collected from patient skin, hair, or nails were subjected to direct microscopy examination in 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) and fungal culture. A confirmed diagnosis was made only if the specimen was KOH and/or culture positive.

The male-to-female ratio was 1.65:1. Tinea corporis (21.4%), onychomycoses (14.7%), and tinea capitis (6.2%) were the most common laboratory-confirmed infections. Only 909 patients (47%) out of 1,935 clinically suspected patients had evidence of fungal infection by either microscopy and/or culture. Of these 909 patients, 787 (86.5%) were both KOH and culture positive, 25 (2.7%) were KOH negative and culture positive, while 97 (10.6%) were KOH positive but culture negative. In 1,051 patients (53%), no evidence of fungal infection was seen.

Trichophyton rubrum was the most commonly isolated dermatophyte (55.2%), followed by Trichophyton mentagrophytes (19.6%) and Trichophyton tonsurans (2.9%). Candida species accounted for 16% of all isolates. Non-dermatophyte molds (NDM) were isolated only in patients with onychomycoses.

### Pulmonary blastomycosis: An appraisal of diagnostic techniques [^111oTQq5]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Pulmonary blastomycosis often mimics bacterial pneumonia or bronchogenic carcinoma, which may result in delayed therapy or the performance of unnecessary diagnostic procedures. We have reviewed the utilization of diagnostic techniques in the workup of patients with pulmonary blastomycosis, defined their diagnostic yields, and proposed an optimal diagnostic approach for the patient in whom pulmonary blastomycosis is considered.

- **Design**: Retrospective chart review of all patients with the diagnosis of blastomycosis at a major academic medical center.

- **Results**: Of the 119 patients with blastomycosis, 56 (47%) had pulmonary involvement. A total of 92 specimens were obtained by noninvasive means (sputa, 72 specimens; tracheal secretions, 5 specimens; and gastric washings, 15 specimens) in 35 patients. KOH smears were prepared from 22 of those specimens (24%). The diagnostic yield from these culture specimens obtained by noninvasive means was 86% per patient and 75% per single sample. The diagnostic yields from KOH smears were 46% and 36%, respectively.

	- Flexible bronchoscopy was performed in 24 patients and yielded a diagnosis in 22 (92%). Cultures of bronchial secretions (19 patients) and BAL fluid (6 patients) were positive in 100% and 67% of patients, respectively. The corresponding yields of KOH preparations were 17% (1 of 6 preparations) and 50% (3 of 6 preparations), respectively. Pathology specimens, including those from bronchoscopic lung biopsies (nine patients), bronchial brushings (two patients), and bronchoscopic needle aspiration (one patient), were positive.

### Bacterial keratitis preferred practice pattern® [^1144NmNW]. Ophthalmology (2019). High credibility.

Concerning diagnostic investigations for bacterial keratitis, particularly regarding history and physical examination, the AAO 2019 guidelines recommend performing a physical examination for patients with suspected bacterial keratitis. This examination should include:

- **Measurement of visual acuity**: To document the baseline visual acuity and ensure it is consistent with the anterior segment examination.
- **External examination**: Including the general appearance of the patient, such as skin conditions, facial examination, globe position, eyelids and eyelid closure, conjunctiva, nasolacrimal apparatus, and corneal sensation testing if appropriate.
- **Slit-lamp biomicroscopy**: Including eyelid margins, conjunctiva, sclera, and cornea.
- **Anterior chamber assessment**: For depth and the presence of inflammation, including cell and flare, hypopyon, fibrin, and hyphema.
- **Anterior vitreous assessment**: For the presence of inflammation.
- **Contralateral eye assessment**: For clues to etiology as well as possible similar underlying pathology.

### Diagnosis and treatment outcome of mycotic keratitis at a tertiary eye care center in eastern India [^111zA3Jb]. BMC Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

In the hands of experienced cornea specialists, the clinical acumen to make a diagnosis of mycotic keratitis varies in different studies from 71–100%. Nevertheless, in all studies, the diagnosis of fungal keratitis is remarkably efficient using relatively simple methods such as potassium hydroxide wet mount and Gram stain. In this study, the detection of fungal elements in corneal scrapings was very high at 94.8% by microscopy using KOH+CFW stain. Being a retrospective study, we are aware that this favorable result could be biased as the first scraping was invariably taken for KOH+CFW stain, especially in cases where clinical suspicion of fungal keratitis was high. However, as supported by several studies, calcofluor white is indeed a highly reliable and sensitive stain for fungal detection under a fluorescence microscope.

Since clinical acumen would vary according to the level of training and experience, it seems appropriate for all practitioners to have the minimum laboratory facility available in their clinic for the management of microbial keratitis. When attempted, it is fairly easy to grow and identify fungi from corneal scrapings, and the most common fungi isolated are either Fusarium or Aspergillus spp. The source of these fungi is obviously the environment, which is rife with similar species of fungi. Candida spp. are uncommon causes of mycotic keratitis in almost all studies, including the present study, though Saha et al. have recorded a prevalence of 1.

- **Laboratory procedures**: Specimen collection, inoculation, and organism identification were conducted following standard protocol. Kimura's spatula was used to obtain material from the leading edge and base of the ulcer. The specimen was inoculated directly onto blood agar, chocolate agar, Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA), and thioglycollate broth. Separate glass slides were used for Gram stain, Giemsa stain, and potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mount.

	- For suspected amoebic corneal cases, specimens were inoculated onto non-nutrient agar overlaid with Escherichia coli. All bacterial cultures were incubated aerobically at 37 °C. To ensure 3 to 5% carbon dioxide, incubated chocolate agar plates were placed inside a candle jar.

- **Evaluation**: Cultures on blood agar, chocolate agar, and broth were evaluated daily for up to 72 hours and discarded if there was no growth. Fungal cultures in SDA were incubated at 25 °C and monitored for growth until 1 week, then discarded if no growth was observed. Similarly, cultures on non-nutrient agar overlaid with E. coli were discarded at 1 week if there was no growth.

- **Criteria and identification**: Microbial culture was considered significant if any of the following criteria were satisfied: 1) Growth of the same organism demonstrated on two or more media; 2) Confluent growth at the inoculation site on one solid medium; 3) Growth on one medium consistent with direct microscopy findings (appropriate staining and morphology with Gram stain); and 4) The same organism grown from repeated scraping material. Bacteria identification was based on microscopic morphology and staining.

### Activities of daily living limitations and the use of physical examination among older adults with informal care in China: Do gender and residence make differences [^116ysNsL]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Low credibility.

This study aimed to explore the relationship between activities of daily living (ADL) limitations and the use of physical examination among older adults receiving informal care. It further analyzed gender and rural-urban differences in this association. Our findings suggested that ADL limitations were associated with lower utilization of physical examination services among older adults receiving informal care in Shandong, China. We also found gender and urban-rural disparities in the relationship between ADL limitations and the use of physical examination. Specifically, ADL limitations were negatively associated with the use of physical examination among older women, and a significant correlation was only found in urban areas.

The study indicated that ADL limitations were negatively associated with the use of physical examination among older adults receiving informal care in Shandong, China. This finding was consistent with previous studies that connected ADL limitations with decreased utilization of physical examination services in older adults. Several explanations are possible for this finding.

First, this could be due to a shortage of qualified primary healthcare providers. Informal caregivers generally lack specialized care knowledge and skills training. They tend to focus on health care for the "dysfunction" itself, ignoring the importance of using preventive health services, especially for older adults with ADL limitations. Additionally, due to limited human resources and heavy healthcare tasks, primary healthcare institutions lack sufficient doctors who can provide these services.

### Fungal keratitis: Diagnostic characteristics of the potassium hydroxide preparation with calcofluor white in Northern California [^1155U2kM]. Cornea (2022). Low credibility.

The incidence of fungal keratitis demonstrates significant geographic and climatic variation. We report on the characteristics of the potassium hydroxide/calcofluor white (KOH-CFW) preparation observed at a tertiary center in Northern California, a region with a low incidence of fungal keratitis.

- **Methods**: Culture-proven cases of microbial keratitis during a 5-year period were retrospectively reviewed. The sensitivity, specificity, and posttest probabilities were determined for the KOH-CFW assay. These results were compared with documented clinical impression and values reported in the literature.

- **Results**: Three hundred three of 368 episodes of microbial keratitis during the study period documented the results of a fungal culture, KOH-CFW assay, and a clinical impression. Twenty-one (6.9%) of these cultures were positive for fungal organisms. The sensitivity and specificity of the KOH-CFW test were 29% and 93%, respectively. Clinicians' initial clinical impression, based solely on patients' history and examination without the aid of any histopathologic or biochemical test results, demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 33% and 89%, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: The observed sensitivity and specificity of the KOH-CFW preparation are significantly lower than many previously reported values. In regions with low incidence of fungal keratitis, the KOH-CFW preparation may have diagnostic performance similar to that of the clinical impression formed only on the basis of history and physical examination.

### Pcr-reverse blot hybridization assay for fast and accurate identification of causative species in superficial fungal infections [^116YPdcy]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Superficial fungal infections are a very common problem in dermatological clinics. The diagnostic method of fungal culture is time-consuming and has inconsistent sensitivity; therefore, a practical method for rapid and accurate identification of the species causing superficial fungal infections is needed.

- **Aim**: To compare PCR-reverse blot hybridization assay (PCR-REBA) with conventional fungal diagnostic methods to determine the reliability of PCR-REBA for diagnosis and species identification in superficial fungal infections.

- **Methods**: Potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation, fungal culture, conventional real-time PCR, and PCR-REBA were used to assess 83 specimens. The results from each method were compared.

- **Results**: Of the 83 specimens, 44 specimens that were positive by fungal culture had 62.7% agreement with PCR-REBA. Compared with real-time PCR, there was 68.7% agreement with fungal culture, but 91.6% agreement with PCR-REBA. When the comparison was made using the 55 specimens that gave positive results in both KOH preparation and fungal culture, there was 85.5% agreement with real-time PCR for fungal culture, but 94.5% agreement with PCR-REBA.

- **Conclusions**: Compared with KOH preparation or fungal culture, PCR-REBA has higher sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, PCR-REBA could be a useful method in clinical settings because it can identify species quickly and accurately, and can also determine the existence of pathogens.

### Touch preparation for the rapid diagnosis of disseminated aspergillosis [^1171GZG8]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

In critically ill, immunocompromised patients, aspergillosis is often suspected; however, the most accurate tests, such as bronchial alveolar lavage, may not be feasible. Cultures can take several days to grow, and a negative culture does not rule out a fungal etiology. Computed tomography findings for pulmonary aspergillosis are not specific, as other bacterial or fungal infections may look similar. Serum testing with Galactomannan and β-glucan assays can be helpful; however, false-positive results may occur in the presence of certain antibiotics, other fungi, or bacteria. Other noninvasive methods are being actively investigated, including polymerase chain reaction, lateral flow devices, volatile organic compounds, Aspergillus-derived siderophores, and mass spectrometry, but these have not yet been validated in large, clinical trials.

The touch preparation for direct microscopy of biopsied skin may show fungal organisms that can expedite the initiation of appropriate treatment. Although few cases are reported in the literature, a touch preparation slide takes only a few minutes and may be a useful routine practice when taking skin biopsy specimens from immunocompromised patients. When secondary cutaneous invasive aspergillosis is suspected, it is crucial to ensure that tissue for touch preparation is recovered from the base of the biopsy section. Skin manifestations result from fungal invasion of subcutaneous vessels and fat.

### Activities of daily living limitations and the use of physical examination among older adults with informal care in China: do gender and residence make differences [^116hpBbE]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). High credibility.

This study investigated the relationship between activities of daily living (ADL) limitations and the use of physical examination among older adults receiving informal care, examining whether this relationship varies by gender and urban-rural areas.

- **Methods**: The data for this study were obtained from the sixth Health Service of Shandong Province, China. A total of 8,358 older adults aged 60 years or older who received informal care were included in the analysis. Binary logistic regression models were conducted to explore the association between ADL limitations and the use of physical examination, and to examine the differences between gender and urban-rural areas.

- **Results**: The prevalence of ADL limitations and the physical examination utilization rate among older adults receiving informal care in Shandong Province were 14.12% and 72.31%, respectively. After adjusting for confounders, ADL limitations were negatively correlated with the utilization of physical examination services among older adults receiving informal care (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.87, P < 0.001), with observed gender and rural-urban differences. The association was statistically significant in older women receiving informal care (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.80, P < 0.001). Among urban older adults receiving informal care, those with ADL limitations had lower utilization of physical examination services than participants without ADL limitations (OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.74, P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Our study suggested that the relationship between ADL limitations and the use of physical examination services varies by gender and residence among older adults receiving informal care.

### Use of chlorazol black E mounts of corneal scrapes for diagnosis of filamentous fungal keratitis [^115t7ysN]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether chlorazol black E, a chitin-specific stain, can be used to detect fungal filaments in corneal scrapings. The study also compared its sensitivity as a diagnostic aid for fungal keratitis with that of gram and lactophenol cotton blue stains.

This was a prospective study involving laboratory investigation. Between December 1, 2005, and July 31, 2006, corneal scrapes from 163 patients with ulcerative keratitis were used for culture and to prepare smears stained by lactophenol cotton blue, chlorazol black E, or gram stains. Fungal keratitis was diagnosed if fungal growth occurred on the inoculated areas of multiple culture plates.

The results showed that fungi were isolated from corneal scrapes of 82 patients. Considering fungal culture positivity as the gold standard for diagnosing fungal keratitis, direct microscopic examination of chlorazol black E mounts had a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 98%; culture results and chlorazol black E results were identical in 89.6% of patients. Lactophenol cotton blue mounts and gram-stained smears had a sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 90%-91%, and 88% agreement with culture results.

In conclusion, chlorazol black E can be used for detection of fungal filaments in corneal scrapings; however, it is less sensitive than lactophenol cotton blue and gram stains as a diagnostic aid for fungal keratitis.

### Evaluation of corneal scraping smear examination methods in the diagnosis of bacterial and fungal keratitis: a survey of eight years of laboratory experience [^1147WNWY]. Cornea (2002). Low credibility.

To determine the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of Gram and potassium hydroxide with calcofluor white (KOH+CFW) stains in the diagnosis of early and advanced microbial keratitis, a retrospective analysis of comparative data from a prospectively collected database was done.

Patients with nonviral microbial keratitis seen at L.V. Prasad Eye Institute between February 1991 and December 1998 were included in the study. The type of bacteria seen on Gram stain was determined from 251 corneal scrapings from patients with early keratitis and 841 corneal scrapings from patients with advanced keratitis. The presence of fungi in corneal scrapings was determined by KOH+CFW stain of 114 and 363 scrapings from patients with early and advanced keratitis, respectively. The smear findings were compared with culture results to analyze specificity, sensitivity, and predictive values of the staining techniques.

The sensitivity of Gram stain in the detection of bacteria was 36.0% in early and 40.9% in advanced keratitis cases; however, the specificity was higher in both groups (84.9% and 87.1%, respectively). Comparatively, the sensitivity and specificity of fungal detection were higher using KOH+CFW in early (61.1% and 99.0%, respectively) as well as advanced keratitis (87.7% and 83.7%, respectively). Predictive values were high for KOH+CFW in fungus detection, while they were poor for Gram stain in bacteria detection. In advanced keratitis cases, the false positives were higher in fungal detection (16.3%) than in bacterial detection (10.3%).

### Automated detection of filamentous fungal keratitis on whole slide images of potassium hydroxide smears with multiple instance learning [^115Ni1qB]. Ophthalmology Science (2024). High credibility.

Infectious keratitis is a significant global health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where it ranks among the leading causes of blindness and results in over 2 million preventable cases annually. Timely and accurate diagnosis of these infections is crucial for effective treatment and prevention of severe visual impairment. One of the primary diagnostic tests for identifying fungal keratitis is the potassium hydroxide (KOH) smear. This test involves placing a corneal scraping on a slide and treating it with KOH to dissolve cellular material, allowing visualization of fungal elements under a microscope. The KOH smear can detect fungal keratitis at the point-of-care, unlike cultures that require days or weeks of incubation to provide results.

Despite its timeliness and diagnostic utility, the KOH smear test has several shortcomings. Interpretation requires significant expertise, which may not be readily available in resource-limited settings where the majority of infectious keratitis cases occur. Moreover, the interpretation of the test is subject to significant inter-expert variability, with recent experiences interpreting KOH specimens being a major driver of one's accuracy. Thus, automated solutions using artificial intelligence (AI) may provide an opportunity to increase the accessibility and reliability of KOH interpretation as a diagnostic test for infectious keratitis. In this study, we develop and evaluate machine learning models for automated KOH smear interpretation using whole slide imaging (WSI) with dual stream multiple instance learning (DSMIL).

### Comparison of histopathological analysis, culture, and polymerase chain reaction assays to detect invasive mold infections from biopsy specimens [^111QPg5D]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

With the advent of new antifungal agents, identifying a causative pathogen is crucial to guide the antifungal treatment of invasive mold infections. However, tissue cultures often fail to grow a fungal pathogen in cases of suspected mold infection.

- **Methods**: In a prospective multicenter study, we compared the results of histopathological analysis, culture, and two seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. These assays aimed to identify Aspergillus species and Zygomycetes as causative agents of invasive mold infections using respiratory tract biopsy samples from 56 immunocompromised patients with suspected mold infection.

- **Results**: Mold hyphae were detected histopathologically in 27 (48%) of the tissue specimens. Hyphae corresponded to either aspergillosis (n = 18), zygomycosis (n = 6), or could not be further specified (n = 3). A mold was cultured from 14 of 18 samples with Aspergillus hyphae, 2 of 6 samples with Zygomycetes hyphae, and 1 of 3 samples with unspecified hyphae. PCR was superior to culture in detecting the infecting mold (26 of 27 samples vs. 17 of 27 samples, respectively; p = 0.006) from histopathologically positive samples. Genus or species identification by sequencing of the PCR products was in accordance with culture results in 16 of 18 culture-positive samples. Both PCR assays failed to detect fungal DNA in one sample that had unspecified hyphae and negative culture results.

- **Conclusion**: The PCR assays offer a reliable etiologic diagnosis that is superior to culture in patients with suspected mold infections.

### Activities of daily living limitations and the use of physical examination among older adults with informal care in China: Do gender and residence make differences [^113hBaDv]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Low credibility.

We found a gender disparity in the association between ADL limitations and the use of physical examination. ADL limitations were inversely associated with the use of physical examination only in older women receiving informal care, but not in older men. There is one possible explanation that may account for the gender difference. Women are socialized with an emphasis on home-centered gender roles, especially in China.

Older women generally believe that men are the center of the family and the most important members. Thus, older women with ADL limitations are more concerned about causing problems for their families and neglecting their need for preventive physical examination services. Conversely, older women may have more experience with caregiving than older men. If older women have a spouse with ADL limitations, they may be better able to provide care services than husbands who are less able to care for themselves. This makes it easier for older men with ADL limitations to meet their healthcare needs, including the use of physical examination.

Additionally, medical costs are considered to be a possible barrier to older women using physical examination services. Previous studies have shown that the role of household financial provider is generally assumed by older men. Older women, with limited financial resources and lower incomes, are more likely to be anxious that physical examination would detect health problems and lead to increased expenditures.

### Global guideline for the diagnosis and management of candidiasis: an initiative of the ECMM in cooperation with ISHAM and ASM [^115kLECh]. The Lancet. Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

For the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis, particularly through fungal culture, the ASM/ECMM/ISHAM 2025 guidelines recommend collecting 40–60 mL of blood across 2–3 blood culture sets. These should be incubated for up to 5 days for the conventional diagnosis of candidemia. It is advised to utilize additional lytic or mycoses bottles. To enhance diagnostic yield, it is important to perform direct microscopy in addition to fungal culture. If any blood culture comes back positive, direct Gram staining should be conducted immediately.

### Cost-effectiveness of diagnostic tests for toenail onychomycosis: A repeated-measure, single-blinded, cross-sectional evaluation of 7 diagnostic tests [^114XS3ew]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to estimate and compare the cost-effectiveness of the most commonly used diagnostic tests for onychomycosis. These tests include potassium hydroxide preparation (KOH), interpreted both by a dermatologist (KOH-CLINIC) and a laboratory technician (KOH-LAB); KOH with dimethyl sulfoxide (KOH-DMSO) and with chlorazol black E (KOH-CBE), interpreted by a dermatologist; culture using dermatophyte test medium; culture with Mycobiotic and Inhibitory Mold Agar (Cx); and histopathologic analysis using periodic acid-Schiff stain (PAS).

This repeated-measure, single-blinded, cross-sectional study was conducted at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Inclusion criteria required participants to have at least one toenail with 25% or more clinical disease, defined as subungual debris with onycholysis or onychauxis. Exclusion criteria included other nail dystrophies and the use of oral antifungal medication for two months or longer within the past year, or topical ciclopirox lacquer within six weeks of enrollment. The main outcome measure was the cost-effectiveness (Medicare and non-Medicare costs) of the seven diagnostic tests, with sensitivity (at least three positive tests) as the unit of effectiveness.

Two hundred four participants were enrolled in the study, with an average age of 69.5 years; 95.5% were male. PAS was identified as the most sensitive test at 98.8%, being statistically significantly more sensitive than all other diagnostic tests except KOH-CBE, which had a sensitivity of 94.3%. The dermatophyte test medium was the least sensitive test, measuring 57.3%. KOH-CBE was found to be statistically significantly more cost-effective than any other test.

### Culturing dermatophytes rapidly from each toe web by fingertip [^114eBDbn]. The Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of tinea pedis is usually confirmed by microscopy and culture of skin scrapings. Isolating dermatophytes through fungal culture provides more reliable proof of infection and identifies the causative organisms. Nevertheless, culture examination complements microscopy and is not routinely performed because it is time- and cost-consuming. Herein, we propose a new culturing method, the "finger-sampling method", for collecting dermatophytes from patients' toe webs using the examiner's fingertip as a sample collection tool. Using this method, four toe webs of a foot can be examined at once on a single culture dish. Every toe web of 50 patients with untreated tinea pedis was examined, and dermatophytes were grown from 83 out of 107 (78%) KOH-positive toe webs. The isolation ratio by the finger-sampling method was comparable to that by traditional slant culture of skin scrapings performed by skilled practitioners. Culture results were also positive in 19 out of 53 (36%) diseased but KOH-negative toe webs and in 38 (16%) normal toe webs, suggesting the existence of unidentified infection. Additionally, we confirmed the efficacy of this method for detecting dermatophyte attachment on the healthy toe web skin of volunteers who had just been exposed to contaminated areas, such as Japanese public baths or a bath mat stepped on by a patient disseminating dermatophyte propagules.

### Validation and clinical application of molecular methods for the identification of molds in tissue [^112sjzPQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Invasive fungal infections due to less-common molds are an increasing problem, and accurate diagnosis is difficult.

- **Methods**: We used our previously established molecular method, which allows species identification of molds in histological tissue sections, to test sequential specimens from 56 patients with invasive fungal infections treated at our institution from 1982 to 2000.

- **Results**: The validity of the method was demonstrated with the establishment of a molecular diagnosis in 52 cases (93%). Confirmation of the causative organism was made in all cases in which a mold had been cultured from the tissue specimen. Less-common molds were identified in 7% of cases and appear to be an increasing problem.

- **Conclusions**: Our previously established method has proven to be of value in determining the incidence of invasive infection caused by less-common molds. Institutions should continue to pursue diagnosis of invasive fungal infections by means of tissue culture and microbiologic analysis.

### Oxiconazole nitrate [^115fRZtC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

The following definitions were applied to the clinical and microbiological outcomes in patients enrolled in the clinical trials that form the basis for the approval of oxiconazole nitrate cream:

- **Definitions**:

- **Mycological cure**: No evidence (culture and KOH preparation) of the baseline (original) pathogen in a specimen from the affected area taken at the 2-week post-treatment visit. For tinea (pityriasis) versicolor, mycological cure was limited to KOH only.
- **Treatment success**: Both a global evaluation of 90% clinical improvement and a microbiologic eradication at the 2-week post-treatment visit.

- **Tinea pedis**: There are no head-to-head comparison trials of the oxiconazole nitrate cream and lotion formulations in the treatment of tinea pedis.

The two pivotal trials for the oxiconazole nitrate cream formulation involved 281 evaluable patients (total from both trials) with clinically and microbiologically established tinea pedis. The combined results of these two clinical trials at the 2-week post-treatment follow-up visit indicated that all the improvement and cure rates of the b.i.d.- and q.d.-treated groups did not differ significantly (95% confidence interval) from each other but were statistically superior (95% confidence interval) to the vehicle-treated group.
