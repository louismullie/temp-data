ReStless leg syndrome

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about restless legs syndrome (RLS) management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should assess severity and classify the phenotype. Next, I will screen for secondary causes, especially iron deficiency and renal disease. After that, I will outline nonpharmacologic strategies, followed by pharmacologic choices tailored to severity and comorbidities, with explicit attention to augmentation risk. Finally, I will address special populations, monitoring, and a practical algorithm, while double-checking guideline shifts and evidence strength at each step.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis using the four essential clinical criteria: an urge to move the legs with uncomfortable sensations, symptoms beginning or worsening during rest, partial or complete relief with movement, and a circadian pattern with evening or nighttime predominance; I should also document supportive features such as family history, periodic limb movements, and dopaminergic responsiveness, while remembering there is no definitive diagnostic test and that the diagnosis is clinical, so I need to be careful not to overcall it without these features [^1137xGWH] [^112Y4ndS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — several conditions mimic RLS, so I should actively exclude peripheral neuropathy, nocturnal leg cramps, akathisia, positional discomfort, and vascular claudication; I also need to check for medication-induced RLS or augmentation from dopaminergics, and I should screen for obstructive sleep apnea because OSA is common and can exacerbate RLS phenomenology and sleep fragmentation, which could mislead management if untreated [^113W5JpB] [^115MDcm6] [^116vzYSE].

> Next, I should review severity and classify the phenotype; I will quantify symptom burden with the International Restless Legs Syndrome Severity Scale (IRLS) and classify as intermittent, daily, or refractory, while noting age of onset and family history because early-onset RLS is more likely to be familial and slowly progressive; I need to ensure I document the most bothersome symptom domains — sensory discomfort, sleep disturbance, and daytime impairment — since this will guide therapy selection and expectations [^115g9jw4] [^1116XeDw] [^116UHLvp].

> I will now examine secondary contributors, with iron deficiency as the most critical; I should double-check ferritin and transferrin saturation, ideally in the morning and off iron for 24 hours, and treat if ferritin is 75 ng/mL or less or transferrin saturation is below 20%, using oral ferrous sulfate with vitamin C first-line and reserving IV iron for intolerance or ferritin 75–100 ng/mL; wait, let me verify pediatric thresholds — yes, children warrant supplementation if ferritin is below 50 ng/mL, and I should also screen for CKD/ESRD, pregnancy, and medication triggers that can precipitate or worsen RLS [^115tkuwR] [^114NcAuB] [^112LQezZ] [^113W5JpB].

> Before medications, I need to ensure nonpharmacologic measures are in place; sleep hygiene with consistent bedtime/wake times, avoidance of caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine, moderate exercise, leg massage, warm baths, and cognitive-behavioral strategies can meaningfully reduce symptom burden; I should also consider pneumatic compression devices for patients preferring non-drug options, and I will reserve vibrating pads for subjective sleep concerns rather than RLS symptoms per se, making sure I set expectations about modest effect sizes [^113W5JpB] [^112w4FUG] [^116fKHgq].

> For intermittent or mild symptoms, I should confirm that nonpharmacologic strategies are optimized and consider on-demand therapy only if needed; if I initially think to use pramipexole or ropinirole intermittently, wait, I should verify current guidance — AASM 2025 now suggests against standard use of ropinirole and advises caution with dopamine agonists due to augmentation risk, so I should favor non-dopaminergic options or very low-dose, short-term dopaminergics only when benefits clearly outweigh risks and the patient understands augmentation [^1147DoHD] [^115g9jw4].

> For moderate-to-severe or daily RLS, I should prioritize alpha-2-delta ligands as first-line because they reduce augmentation risk; gabapentin enacarbil has strong AASM support, and pregabalin is also strongly recommended with moderate certainty, while gabapentin is conditionally recommended; I need to check dosing and tolerability, counsel on somnolence and dizziness, and titrate to effect while monitoring for sedation and balance issues, especially in older adults [^112cpwoB] [^116kHzao] [^1131Dk7e].

> But wait, what if augmentation risk is a key concern or the patient has comorbid insomnia or pain; in that case, I should confirm that choosing pregabalin over dopamine agonists is reasonable, as AAN suggests pregabalin when avoidance of augmentation is a deciding factor; I should also remember that gabapentinoids improve sleep quality and quality of life, which aligns with patient-centered goals in many cases [^1159FpY2] [^112cpwoB].

> If dopaminergic therapy is necessary, I should use the lowest effective dose and prefer longer-acting agents to mitigate augmentation; rotigotine transdermal patch can be considered, but I must counsel meticulously on augmentation, impulse control disorders, and daytime sleepiness; hold on, I should verify ESRD-specific guidance — AASM advises against standard use of levodopa or rotigotine in ESRD, so in dialysis patients I should avoid these or use only with explicit informed consent about augmentation and limited evidence [^111qE9tF] [^115g9jw4] [^115Dq3Ui] [^114Qnkrq].

> For refractory RLS or augmentation, I should confirm that IV iron is a strong option when ferritin is 75–100 ng/mL or oral iron is not tolerated; ferric carboxymaltose has strong AASM support with moderate certainty, and I should monitor for hypophosphatemia and dizziness; if iron is not sufficient, I should consider extended-release oxycodone or other low-dose opioids with careful risk mitigation, as AASM gives a conditional recommendation with moderate certainty and highlights efficacy for augmentation rescue and taper support, while reminding me to screen for sleep apnea and respiratory risk [^114adC69] [^111UWkt9] [^114W4pc5].

> I need to ensure I am not overlooking nonpharmacologic device options; bilateral high-frequency peroneal nerve stimulation has emerging evidence and may be considered for select adults, and near-infrared spectroscopy can be offered to patients interested in non-drug approaches, though I should frame these as adjuncts with variable access and evidence quality [^1141Fbwb] [^1113PA4j].

> In pregnancy, I should double-check that RLS is common and often self-limited; first-line is conservative management and iron supplementation if ferritin is low, and I must avoid dopamine agonists in the first trimester and use any pharmacotherapy only after shared decision-making given limited safety data; postpartum, I should reassess iron status and symptom trajectory before escalating therapy [^116CXWFV] [^115tkuwR].

> In pediatrics, I should confirm that iron deficiency is the most common modifiable factor; oral iron is first-line if ferritin is below 50 ng/mL, and I should avoid routine use of adult medications; I need to monitor growth, constipation, and academic/sleep impacts and adjust therapy accordingly, recognizing the evidence base is sparse [^112LQezZ] [^114BkWRx].

> For CKD/ESRD, I should verify that dopaminergic agents are generally discouraged long term due to augmentation and limited benefit; exercise programs, gabapentin, and IV iron may be more appropriate pillars, and I should coordinate with nephrology for iron repletion strategies and dialysis timing considerations [^115Dq3Ui] [^114TpCEH].

> I will now examine monitoring and follow-up; at each visit I should reassess IRLS, sleep quality, daytime function, and screen for augmentation using established criteria such as earlier daily onset, symptom spread, and shorter duration of benefit; I should also monitor for impulse control disorders with dopamine agonists and respiratory depression with opioids, and I should repeat iron studies periodically, especially when symptoms worsen or augmentation emerges [^115g9jw4] [^115kMZuZ] [^115tkuwR].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency: confirm diagnosis and exclude mimics, quantify severity, correct iron deficiency and other secondary causes, implement nonpharmacologic measures, then for intermittent symptoms consider on-demand non-dopaminergic or very cautious dopaminergic use, for moderate-to-severe symptoms prefer alpha-2-delta ligands, and for refractory disease or augmentation consider IV iron and carefully selected opioids, all while aligning choices with comorbidities and patient preferences and documenting shared decision-making about augmentation risks [^113W5JpB] [^115g9jw4].

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a **sensorimotor disorder** characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs, typically worsened by rest and relieved by movement, with a circadian pattern peaking at night. Diagnosis is **clinical**, based on the four essential criteria and exclusion of mimics; iron studies should be checked to identify treatable deficiency [^115tkuwR]. Management starts with nonpharmacologic measures (sleep hygiene, exercise, avoidance of triggers) and escalates to pharmacotherapy for moderate-to-severe symptoms: alpha-2-delta ligands (gabapentin, pregabalin, gabapentin enacarbil) are preferred first-line due to lower augmentation risk; dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine) are effective but carry a higher risk of augmentation; iron replacement is indicated when ferritin is low; opioids are reserved for refractory cases [^113W5JpB] [^116kHzao] [^1131Dk7e] [^1147DoHD] [^114adC69] [^114W4pc5]. Regular monitoring for augmentation and impulse-control disorders is essential, and treatment should be individualized based on comorbidities and patient preference [^116dV3UW] [^115kMZuZ].

---

## Clinical features and diagnostic criteria

RLS presents with the following **clinical features**:

- **Urge to move**: An irresistible urge to move the legs, often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations (paresthesias) [^114SKM7d].

- **Rest-induced**: Symptoms begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity [^1137xGWH].

- **Movement relief**: Symptoms are partially or completely relieved by movement, such as walking or stretching [^112Y4ndS].

- **Circadian pattern**: Symptoms are worse in the evening or at night, following a circadian pattern [^111u27Ub].

The diagnosis of RLS is **clinical**, based on the following **four essential criteria** established by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG):

| **Criterion** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| 1 | An urge to move the legs, usually accompanied by uncomfortable sensations |
| 2 | Symptoms begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity |
| 3 | Symptoms are partially or completely relieved by movement |
| 4 | Symptoms follow a circadian pattern, worsening in the evening or at night |

---

Additional supportive features include a positive family history, periodic limb movements during sleep (PLMS), and a favorable response to dopaminergic therapy [^112Y4ndS]. Polysomnography is not routinely required but may be useful to document PLMS or exclude other sleep disorders [^1137xGWH].

---

## Pathophysiology

The exact pathophysiology of RLS remains incompletely understood, but current evidence suggests **multifactorial mechanisms**:

- **Dopaminergic dysfunction**: Altered dopamine signaling in the central nervous system is strongly implicated, supported by the therapeutic efficacy of dopaminergic agents [^114fVuoJ].

- **Iron deficiency**: Reduced brain iron stores, even in the absence of systemic iron deficiency anemia, are consistently observed in RLS patients [^notfound].

- **Genetic factors**: Familial aggregation and genetic studies have identified several susceptibility loci, including MEIS1, BTBD9, and PTPRD [^notfound].

- **Other neurotransmitters**: Involvement of glutamatergic, adenosine, and nociceptive pathways has been proposed [^114fVuoJ].

---

## Epidemiology

RLS is a **common disorder**, with prevalence estimates varying by population and diagnostic criteria. In adults, prevalence is approximately 5–10% in Europe and North America, with a female predominance and increased prevalence with age [^115oRT1D]. In children, prevalence is lower, around 0.5–1% [^114bmmTt].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Several conditions can mimic RLS, necessitating **careful differentiation**:

- **Peripheral neuropathy**: Characterized by numbness, tingling, or pain, typically not relieved by movement [^notfound].

- **Nocturnal leg cramps**: Sudden, painful muscle contractions, distinct from RLS sensations [^notfound].

- **Akathisia**: Restlessness due to antipsychotic or antidepressant medications [^notfound].

- **Periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD)**: Involuntary limb movements during sleep, often coexisting with RLS but distinct in presentation [^notfound].

---

## Treatment strategies

Treatment of RLS is **individualized**, based on symptom severity, frequency, and patient preferences. Both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions are available [^113W5JpB].

---

### Nonpharmacologic interventions

Nonpharmacologic measures are recommended as **first-line therapy** for mild or intermittent symptoms:

- **Sleep hygiene**: Regular sleep schedules, avoidance of caffeine and alcohol, and maintaining a comfortable sleep environment [^113W5JpB].

- **Exercise**: Moderate aerobic or resistance exercise, particularly in the evening, can reduce symptom severity [^114TpCEH].

- **Pneumatic compression**: Considered for patients preferring nonpharmacological approaches [^112w4FUG].

- **Vibratory stimulation**: May be considered for subjective sleep concerns, though evidence is limited [^116fKHgq].

---

### Pharmacologic interventions

Pharmacologic therapy is indicated for moderate-to-severe RLS or when nonpharmacologic measures are insufficient. Commonly used medications include:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Dopamine agonists | - Pramipexole <br/> - Ropinirole <br/> - Rotigotine | Stimulate dopamine receptors | - Effective but risk of augmentation <br/> - Impulse control disorders <br/> - Daytime sleepiness [^111qE9tF] [^1147DoHD] |
| Alpha-2-delta ligands | - Gabapentin <br/> - Pregabalin <br/> - Gabapentin enacarbil | Inhibit calcium channels | - Effective <br/> - Lower augmentation risk <br/> - Sedation and dizziness [^1131Dk7e] [^116kHzao] |
| Iron supplementation | - Ferrous sulfate <br/> - IV ferric carboxymaltose | Replenish iron stores | - Indicated for ferritin ≤ 75 ng/mL or transferrin saturation < 20% [^114bhdcp] [^115tkuwR] |
| Opioids | - Oxycodone <br/> - Methadone | Mu-opioid receptor agonists | - Reserved for refractory cases <br/> - Risk of dependence and respiratory depression [^114W4pc5] [^116k7xDk] [^1135XTCF] |

---

## Complications and side effects

Long-term pharmacologic treatment of RLS may be associated with **complications**, including:

- **Augmentation**: Worsening of symptoms, earlier onset, and spread to other body parts, particularly with dopaminergic agents [^111bHbh3].

- **Impulse control disorders**: Associated with dopamine agonists [^115xkwuR].

- **Sedation and dizziness**: Common with alpha-2-delta ligands [^117ADTfp].

- **Dependence and respiratory depression**: Risks associated with opioid therapy [^1135XTCF] [^114W4pc5].

---

## Prognosis

RLS is a **chronic condition** with a variable course. Symptoms may fluctuate in severity and frequency over time. With appropriate management, most patients experience significant symptom relief and improved quality of life. However, long-term treatment may be necessary, and regular monitoring for side effects and complications is essential [^115kMZuZ].

---

Restless legs syndrome is a common neurological disorder characterized by an urge to move the legs, with symptoms worsening at night and improving with movement. The diagnosis is clinical, and treatment includes nonpharmacologic measures and pharmacologic agents such as **dopamine agonists**, **alpha-2-delta ligands**, iron supplementation, and **opioids for refractory cases**. Regular monitoring for side effects and complications is essential for effective long-term management.

### Current guidelines and standards of practice for restless legs syndrome [^116UHLvp]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Algorithms for treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) include both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapy. Patients with RLS are divided into 3 groups: (1) those with intermittent RLS symptoms; (2) those with daily RLS symptoms; and (3) those whose symptoms are refractory to standard treatments. Many patients do not require medication, and symptoms often can be relieved with good sleep hygiene and avoidance of medications and factors that provoke symptoms. Recent large-scale clinical trials have proved the efficacy of therapy for RLS when it is required. Several classes of medications are helpful, but dopaminergic therapy appears to be most effective and relieves symptoms rapidly. The first step in managing RLS is to ensure that there is an adequate diagnosis; this involves discriminating RLS from other conditions that may share a number of features. Finally, it is important to tailor treatment to the needs of each individual patient.

### A better future for patients with restless legs syndrome [^114y2FMe]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Despite advances in the management of restless legs syndrome (RLS), there still is a great deal of uncertainty about its etiology, pathophysiology, therapy, and clinical outcomes. Much remains to be learned. Future research on these issues will help identify the optimum therapeutic approach for the diverse group of patients with RLS.

### Latest guidelines and advances for treatment of restless legs syndrome [^111j3X79]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common disorder that can have a considerable impact on a patient's functioning and quality of life. The pharmacologic armamentarium for RLS contains dopamine agonists, a-2d ligands, and opioids, among other agents. Each of these types of drugs has strengths and limitations, and treatment selection should be based on the frequency of RLS symptoms and any accompanying pain. Dopaminergic augmentation, which exacerbates RLS symptoms, is the most common and challenging side effect of long-term RLS treatment with dopamine agonists and requires special clinical consideration. Iron status is also important to the effective management of RLS.

### Restless legs syndrome in women: a review [^114pcGoX]. Journal of Women's Health (2008). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder with significant negative impact on sleep and quality of life, yet data suggest that it is frequently underdiagnosed. The clinical features, diagnosis, epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment options for RLS are reviewed and discussed, with particular emphasis on RLS in women. RLS is characterized by unpleasant sensations causing an urge to move the legs. RLS symptoms are exacerbated by rest, relieved by movement, and worse at night than during the day. The motor and sensory symptoms of RLS can have a negative impact on patients' sleep, resulting in a reduction in daytime functioning and overall quality of life. The prevalence of RLS is reported to increase with age and to be up to almost twice as high in women as in men. The explanation for this is unknown, although there is evidence that parity may be a factor. Diagnosis of RLS is made using four essential criteria based on the patient's report of sensorimotor symptoms. Several large, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated that dopamine agonists, such as ropinirole and pramipexole, are an efficacious first-line therapy for the treatment of RLS symptoms. As RLS is more prevalent in women, professionals working in the field of women's health need to be aware of this condition, its differential diagnosis, and the treatment options available. Accurate diagnosis is essential to facilitate appropriate management and treatment. Dopamine agonists have been shown to be an effective therapy for patients with moderate to severe symptoms of RLS.

### Restless legs syndrome – new insights into clinical characteristics, pathophysiology, and treatment options [^117KDJGe]. Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

We summarize recent advances in the clinical definition of restless legs syndrome (RLS), in understanding the basic mechanisms, and the successful treatments of RLS. New diagnostic instruments and severity scales have been developed for better phenotyping of the individual patient. Iron metabolism related components and the dopaminergic system have been extensively investigated in respect to the pathophysiology of RLS. The presence of mechanical hyperalgesia to pin-prick points towards an involvement of the nociceptive system. Genetic research has reported loci on chromosome 12q and 14q to play a role in the vulnerability to RLS. Placebo-controlled large-scale phase II and III treatment trials have shown that dopamine agonists are safe and efficacious agents for the treatment of this disorder.

### Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and quality of life issues in restless legs syndrome [^116AP8Da]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a generally underdiagnosed and undertreated condition. It is a common cause of sleep disturbance that can severely disrupt normal life functioning. However, because of the failure to recognize RLS as a distinct disorder, clinicians have minimized the significance of the morbidity experienced by some patients. A positive family history is present in > 50% of patients with RLS. Indeed, a person with RLS is 3 to 6 times more likely to have a positive family history of RLS than is an individual who does not have the disease. The differential diagnosis of RLS includes both movement and sleep disorders. Establishing an accurate diagnosis is crucial because effective treatment is available. In 2002, RLS experts revised diagnostic criteria and established 4 essential criteria for the diagnosis. Assessing the most bothersome symptoms and quantifying the severity of RLS are important because not all patients require medical therapy. Moreover, therapy may vary according to which symptom represents the major problem.

### Iron for the treatment of restless legs syndrome [^116dDccQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurologic disorder that is associated with peripheral iron deficiency in a subgroup of patients. It is unclear whether iron therapy is effective treatment for RLS.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral or parenteral iron for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) when compared with placebo or other therapies.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycNFO, and CINAHL for the time period January 1995 to September 2017. We searched reference lists for additional published studies. We searched Clinicaltrials.gov and other clinical trial registries (September 2017) for ongoing or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Controlled trials comparing any formulation of iron with placebo, other medications, or no treatment, in adults diagnosed with RLS according to expert clinical interview or explicit diagnostic criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality, with discussion to reach consensus in the case of any disagreement. The primary outcome considered in this review was restlessness or unpleasant sensations, as experienced subjectively by the patient. We combined treatment/control differences in the outcomes across studies using random-effects meta-analyses. We analysed continuous data using mean differences (MDs) where possible and performed standardised mean difference (SMD) analyses when different measurements were used across studies. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data using the Mantel-Haenszel method and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed study heterogeneity using the I² statistic. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We performed GRADE analysis using GRADEpro.

Main Results

We identified and included 10 studies (428 total participants, followed for 2–16 weeks) in this review. Our primary outcome was restlessness or uncomfortable leg sensations, which was quantified using the International Restless Legs Scale (IRLS) (range, 0 to 40) in eight trials and a different RLS symptom scale in a ninth trial. Nine studies compared iron to placebo and one study compared iron to a dopamine agonist (pramipexole). The possibility for bias among the trials was variable. Three studies had a single element with high risk of bias, which was lack of blinding in two and incomplete outcome data in one. All studies had at least one feature resulting in unclear risk of bias. Combining data from the seven trials using the IRLS to compare iron and placebo, use of iron resulted in greater improvement in IRLS scores (MD -3.78, 95% CI -6.25 to -1.31; I² = 66%, 7 studies, 345 participants) measured 2 to 12 weeks after treatment. Including an eighth study, which measured restlessness using a different scale, use of iron remained beneficial compared to placebo (SMD -0.74, 95% CI -1.26 to -0.23; I² = 80%, 8 studies, 370 participants). The GRADE assessment of certainty for this outcome was moderate. The single study comparing iron to a dopamine agonist (pramipexole) found a similar reduction in RLS severity in the two groups (MD -0.40, 95% CI -5.93 to 5.13, 30 participants). Assessment of secondary outcomes was limited by small numbers of trials assessing each outcome. Iron did not improve quality of life as a dichotomous measure (RR 2.01, 95% CI 0.54 to 7.45; I² = 54%, 2 studies, 39 participants), but did improve quality of life measured on continuous scales (SMD 0.51, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.87; I² = 0%, 3 studies, 128 participants), compared to placebo. Subjective sleep quality was no different between iron and placebo groups (SMD 0.19, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.56; I² = 9%, 3 studies, 128 participants), nor was objective sleep quality, as measured by change in sleep efficiency in a single study (-35.5 ± 92.0 versus -41.4 ± 98.2, 18 participants). Periodic limb movements of sleep were not significantly reduced with iron compared to placebo (SMD -0.19, 95% CI -0.70 to 0.32; I² = 0%, 2 studies, 60 participants). Iron did not improve sleepiness compared to placebo, as measured on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (data not provided, 1 study, 60 participants) but did improve the daytime tiredness item of the RLS-6 compared to placebo (least squares mean difference -1.5, 95% CI -2.5 to -0.6; 1 study, 110 participants). The GRADE rating for secondary outcomes ranged from low to very low. Prespecified subgroup analyses showed more improvement with iron in those trials studying participants on dialysis. The use of low serum ferritin levels as an inclusion criteria and the use or oral versus intravenous iron did not show significant subgroup differences. Iron did not result in significantly more adverse events than placebo (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.25; I² = 45%, 6 studies, 298 participants). A single study reported that people treated with iron therapy experienced fewer adverse events than the active comparator pramipexole.

Authors' Conclusions

Iron therapy probably improves restlessness and RLS severity in comparison to placebo. Iron therapy may not increase the risk of side effects in comparison to placebo. We are uncertain whether iron therapy improves quality of life in comparison to placebo. Iron therapy may make little or no difference to pramipexole in restlessness and RLS severity, as well as in the risk of adverse events. The effect on secondary outcomes such as quality of life, daytime functioning, and sleep quality, the optimal timing and formulation of administration, and patient characteristics predicting response require additional study.

### Restless legs syndrome: contemporary diagnosis and treatment [^114c1oj8]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is characterized by an uncomfortable urge to move the legs while at rest, relief upon movement or getting up to walk, and worsened symptom severity at night. RLS may be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to pregnancy or a variety of systemic disorders, especially iron deficiency, and chronic renal insufficiency. Genetic predisposition with a family history is common. The pathogenesis of RLS remains unclear but is likely to involve central nervous system dopaminergic dysfunction, as well as other, undefined contributing mechanisms. Evaluation begins with a thorough history and examination, and iron measures, including ferritin and transferrin saturation, should be checked at presentation and with worsened symptoms, especially when augmentation develops. Augmentation is characterized by more intense symptom severity, earlier symptom occurrence, and often, symptom spread from the legs to the arms or other body regions. Some people with RLS have adequate symptom control with non-pharmacological measures such as massage or temperate baths. First-line management options include iron-replacement therapy in those with evidence for reduced body-iron stores or, alternatively, with prescribed gabapentin or pregabalin, and dopamine agonists such as pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine. Second-line therapies include intravenous iron infusion in those who are intolerant of oral iron and/or those having augmentation with intense, severe RLS symptoms, and opioids including tramadol, oxycodone, and methadone. RLS significantly impacts patients' quality of life and remains a therapeutic area sorely in need of innovation and a further pipeline of new, biologically informed therapies.

### Restless legs syndrome [^1128dGqf]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome is a common neurologic movement disorder that affects approximately 10 percent of adults. Of those affected with this condition, approximately one third have symptoms severe enough to require medical therapy. Restless legs syndrome may be a primary condition, or it may be secondary to iron deficiency, renal failure, pregnancy, or the use of certain medications. The diagnosis is clinical, requiring an urge to move the legs usually accompanied by an uncomfortable sensation, occurrence at rest, improvement with activity, and worsening of symptoms in the evening or at night. Restless legs syndrome causes sleep disturbances, is associated with anxiety and depression, and has a negative effect on quality of life. Treatment of secondary causes of restless legs syndrome may result in improvement or resolution of symptoms. Currently, there is little information regarding the effects of lifestyle changes on the symptoms of restless legs syndrome. If medications are needed, dopamine agonists are the primary medications for moderate to severe restless legs syndrome. Other medications that may be effective include gabapentin, carbidopa/levodopa, opioids, and benzodiazepines.

### Comorbidities, treatment, and pathophysiology in restless legs syndrome [^114mcTWe]. The Lancet: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Restless legs syndrome, also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a common neurological condition whose manifestation is affected by complex environmental and genetic interactions. Restless legs syndrome can occur on its own, mostly at a young age, or with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and arterial hypertension, making it a difficult condition to properly diagnose. However, the concept of restless legs syndrome as being two entities, primary or secondary to another condition, has been challenged with genetic data providing further insight into the pathophysiology of the condition. Although dopaminergic treatment was formerly the first-line therapy, prolonged use can result in a serious worsening of symptoms known as augmentation. Clinical studies on pregabalin, gabapentin enacarbil, oxycodone-naloxone, and iron preparations have provided new treatment options, but most patients still report inadequate long-term management of symptoms. Studies of the hypoxic pathway activation and iron deficiency have provided valuable information about the pathophysiology of restless legs syndrome that should now be translated into new, more effective treatments for restless legs syndrome.

### Restless legs syndrome [^114SKM7d]. European Journal of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS), first described in 1672 and given its name in 1945, is one of the most common sleep and movement disorders. Modern population-based studies demonstrate a prevalence between 5% and 15% in adult white populations. According to the diagnostic criteria, RLS is defined as an irresistable desire to move limbs, usually associated with paresthesias/dysesthesias and motor restlessness. The symptoms start or worsen at rest and improve with activity. Additionally, the symptoms worsen in the evenings and/or nights, which often results in disturbance of sleep with daytime tiredness. There is often a family history of RLS. Initially, the disease course is usually fluctuating and later may become continuous or chronic-progressive. The diagnosis is based on the patient history and is supported by a normal neurological examination. RLS is confirmed by the finding of periodic limb movements (PLM) in polysomnographic investigations and by a response to dopaminergic medication. A large number of studies have confirmed the effect of levodopa (L-dopa) in the treatment of RLS. A majority of the patients treated over a longer period of time with L-dopa, however, develop problems with an effect called augmentation, where the RLS symptoms begin appearing earlier during the day and involve new parts of the body with increasing severity. A large number of studies have now confirmed that dopamine agonists can also be effective in RLS therapy, and that this treatment seems to involve less risk for augmentation. This paper provides a general review of RLS with a focus on current treatment options.

### Interventions for chronic kidney disease-associated restless legs syndrome [^114TpCEH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is defined as the spontaneous movement of the limbs (mainly legs) associated with unpleasant, sometimes painful sensation which is relieved by moving the affected limb. Prevalence of RLS among people on dialysis has been estimated between 6.6% and 80%. RLS symptoms contribute to impaired quality of life and people with RLS are shown to have increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Various pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have been used to treat primary RLS. However, the evidence for use of these interventions in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not well established. The agents used in the treatment of primary RLS may be limited by the side effects in people with CKD due to increased comorbidity and altered drug pharmacokinetics.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to critically look at the benefits, efficacy and safety of various treatment options used in the treatment of RLS in people with CKD and those undergoing renal replacement therapy (RRT). We aimed to define different group characteristics based on CKD stage to assess the applicability of a particular intervention to an individual patient.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 12 January 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-RCTs that assessed the efficacy of an intervention for RLS in adults with CKD were eligible for inclusion. Studies investigating idiopathic RLS or RLS secondary to other causes were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed studies for eligibility and conducted risk of bias evaluation. Results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes.

Main Results

We included nine studies enrolling 220 dialysis participants. Seven studies were deemed to have moderate to high risk of bias. All studies were small in size and had a short follow-up period (two to six months). Studies evaluated the effects of six different interventions against placebo or standard treatment. The interventions studied included aerobic resistance exercise, gabapentin, ropinirole, levodopa, iron dextran, and vitamins C and E (individually and in combination). Aerobic resistance exercise showed a significant reduction in severity of RLS compared to no exercise (2 studies, 48 participants: MD -7.56, 95% CI -14.20 to -0.93; I² = 65%), and when compared to exercise with no resistance (1 study, 24 participants: MD -11.10, 95% CI -17.11 to -5.09), however there was no significant reduction when compared to ropinirole (1 study, 22 participants): MD -0.55, 95% CI -6.41 to 5.31). There were no significant differences between aerobic resistance exercise and either no exercise or ropinirole in the physical or mental component summary scores (using the SF-36 form). Improvement in sleep quality varied. There was no significant difference in subjective sleep quality between exercise and no exercise; however one study reported a significant improvement with ropinirole compared to resistance exercise (MD 3.71, 95% CI 0.89 to 6.53). Using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale there were no significant differences between resistance exercise and no exercise, ropinirole, or exercise with no resistance. Two studies reported there were no adverse events and one study did not mention if there were any adverse events. In one study, one patient in each group dropped out but the reason for dropout was not reported. Two studies reported no adverse events and one study did not report adverse events. Gabapentin was associated with reduced RLS severity when compared to placebo or levodopa, and there was a significant improvement in sleep quality, latency and disturbance reported in one study when compared to levodopa. Three patients dropped out due to lethargy (2 patients), and drowsiness, syncope and fatigue (1 patient). Because of a short duration of action, rebound and augmentation were noted with levodopa treatment even though it conferred some benefit in reducing the symptoms of RLS. Reported adverse events were severe vomiting, agitation after caffeine intake, headaches, dry mouth, and gastrointestinal symptoms. One study (25 participants) reported iron dextran reduced the severity of RLS at weeks one and two, but not at week four. Vitamins C, E and C plus E (1 study, 60 participants) helped the symptoms of RLS with minimal side effects (nausea and dyspepsia) but more evidence is needed before any conclusions can be drawn.

Authors' Conclusions

Given the small size of the studies and short follow-up, it can only be concluded that pharmacological interventions and intra-dialytic exercise programs have uncertain effects on RLS in haemodialysis patients. There have been no studies performed in non-dialysis CKD, peritoneal dialysis patients, or kidney transplant recipients. Further studies are warranted before any conclusions can be drawn. Aerobic resistance exercise and ropinirole may be suitable interventions for further evaluation.

### Epidemiology, impact, and treatment options of restless legs syndrome in end-stage renal disease patients: an evidence-based review [^117LBSa9]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) (or Willis-Ekbom disease) is a neurological disorder with high prevalence among the end-stage renal disease population. This is one of the most predominant types of secondary RLS, and it is called uremic RLS. Despite the fact that uremic RLS has been less studied compared to idiopathic RLS, recent studies now shed light in many aspects of the syndrome including clinical characteristics, impact, epidemiology, and treatment options. The current review discusses the above topics with special emphasis given on the management of uremic RLS, including the management of symptoms that often appear during a hemodialysis session. Uremic RLS symptoms may be ameliorated by using pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments. Evidence so far shows that both approaches may be effective in terms of reducing the RLS symptom's severity; nevertheless, more research is needed on the efficiency of treatments for uremic RLS.

### New paradigms in the treatment of restless legs syndrome [^1179GWqv]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurologic disorder occurring in 3% to 15% of the general population, which contributes to poor quality of life. Many patients go undiagnosed for years after onset of symptoms, which delays or prevents effective treatment. Extensive research over the past decade has led to a better understanding of RLS and effective treatment options. This review encompasses the most recently published pathophysiology, epidemiology, criteria for diagnosis, and clinical drug efficacy trials to provide clinicians with the information to effectively manage RLS. A comprehensive review of the medical literature was conducted and original research articles pertaining to RLS were evaluated. The pathophysiology of primary RLS is associated with dopaminergic dysfunction and abnormal brain iron metabolism. Secondary RLS is most often a consequence of iron deficiency. The prevalence of primary RLS is twofold greater in women and increases with age in men and women, although onset of symptoms may occur in up to 45% of patients before age 20 years. Patients may present with a variety of complaints including sleep disruption. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of low-dose levodopa and dopamine agonists. Ropinirole is the most widely studied. Other drugs that may help control symptoms include gabapentin, opioids, and clonazepam. Clinicians must be aware of the high prevalence of RLS, the potential for onset before age 20, and the various clinical presentations. Dopamine agonists are first-line therapy and provide symptom relief in 70% to 100% of patients.

### Restless legs syndrome: clinical features, diagnosis and a practical approach to management [^114b5wpe]. Practical Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a chronic neurological disorder that interferes with rest and sleep. It has a wide spectrum of symptom severity, and treatment is started when symptoms become bothersome. Dopamine agonists and calcium channel apha-2-delta antagonists (gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil and pregabalin) are first-line treatments; calcium channel alpha-2-deltas are preferred over dopamine agonists because they give less augmentation, a condition with symptom onset earlier in the day and intensification of RLS symptoms. Dopamine agonists can still be used as first-line therapy, but the dose should be kept as low as possible. Iron supplements are started when the serum ferritin concentration is ≤ 75µg/L, or if the transferrin saturation is less than 20%. For severe or resistant RLS, a combined treatment approach can be effective. Augmentation can be very challenging to treat and lacks evidenced-based guidelines.

### RLS patients: who are they? [^112Y4ndS]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Four essential diagnostic criteria for restless legs syndrome (RLS) have been identified. Patients experience an urge to move the legs, which typically begins or worsens during periods of rest. The symptoms are at least partially relieved by movement, and are typically worse in the evening and night than in the day. All four criteria are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of RLS. In addition, a family history of RLS, the presence of periodic leg movements in sleep, and a positive response to dopaminergic therapy are useful supportive clinical features to confirm the diagnosis. Whilst many cases of RLS are idiopathic, secondary RLS is often observed in pregnant women, patients who have severe renal dysfunction, or in those with iron deficiency. Several other conditions have symptoms similar to those of RLS, but a detailed patient history is usually sufficient to identify these differential diagnoses. The accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of RLS should result in considerable improvements in patients' quality of life.

### Quality measures for the care of adult patients with restless legs syndrome [^115kMZuZ]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Abstract

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) commissioned several Workgroups to develop quality measures for the care of patients with common sleep disorders, including adults with restless legs syndrome (RLS). Using the AASM process for quality measure development, the RLS Work-group developed three target outcomes for RLS management, including improving the accuracy of diagnosis, reducing symptom severity, and minimizing treatment complications. Seven processes were developed to support these outcomes. To achieve the outcome of improving accuracy of diagnosis, the use of accepted diagnostic criteria and assessment of iron stores are recommended. To realize the outcome of decreasing symptom severity, routine assessment of severity and provision of evidence-based treatment are recommended. To support the outcome of minimizing treatment complications, counseling about potential side effects and assessing for augmentation and impulse control disorders, when indicated, are recommended. Further research is needed to validate optimal practice processes to achieve best outcomes in adult patients with RLS.

### Restless legs syndrome: a clinical update [^113JK1HL]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common and often disabling sensorimotor disorder. Epidemiologic studies suggest that RLS is an underrecognized and undertreated disorder affecting both children and adults. The diagnosis is based primarily on the following four essential criteria: (1) an urge to move, usually associated with paresthesias, (2) onset or exacerbation of symptoms at rest, (3) relief of symptoms with movement, and (4) symptoms manifesting in a circadian pattern. Supplemental workup including polysomnography, iron profile, and/or neuropathy screen can provide support for the diagnosis and aid in the treatment strategy. Behavioral techniques, dopaminergic agents, opiates, benzodiazepines, and antiepileptics all have potential value in treating this disorder. Dopaminergic agents continue to be the most effective RLS treatment. However, due to their potential long-term side effects, these agents should not be considered the sole treatment of choice. In the end, the therapeutic plan should be individualized to suit each patient's presentation and needs.

### Update in restless legs syndrome [^112g2vxd]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a disorder recognized in the medical literature since the 17th century, there have only recently been significant clinical and scientific advances in diagnosis, epidemiology and understanding the disorder, mainly due to the advent of dopaminergic treatment.

Recent Findings

Recent discoveries have uncovered the iron-dopamine connection in RLS and the basic dopaminergic pathology related to the RLS symptoms. These have led to new understanding of the morbidity of RLS and the many conditions associated with RLS, which have also supported new approaches to treatment. These developments are each briefly described here.

Summary

Although there has been progress in understanding, diagnosing and treating RLS, it remains an underdiagnosed and undertreated condition severely impairing functioning of patients with moderate-to-severe disease. Much work is needed to improve on current, as well as other novel therapies.

### Controversies and challenges in defining the etiology and pathophysiology of restless legs syndrome [^1116XeDw]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) can occur as a primary disorder, with no apparent cause other than a possible genetic predisposition, or as a secondary condition, most commonly related to iron deficiency, pregnancy, or end-stage renal disease. Recent studies have identified 2 different phenotypes of RLS based on age at onset of symptoms. Persons whose RLS symptoms start at an earlier age (< 45 years) are more likely to have a family history of RLS and tend to have a more slowly progressive development of the disorder compared with individuals who have later onset of symptoms. In the past, our ability to determine either prevalence or population factors associated with increased occurrence of RLS has been limited. However, 4 different diagnostic criteria have been established. Familiarity with diagnostic criteria and clinical characteristics are essential for diagnosis and appropriate treatment, if required.

### Long-term management issues in restless legs syndrome [^116Am2BY]. Movement Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome is a neurologic movement and sleep disorder with lifelong symptoms causing considerable morbidity. Several short-term and some long-term open-label and double-blind clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of dopaminergic treatment in restless legs syndrome. Long-term treatment, however, is associated with the emergence of vexing long-term side effects that pose a challenge for physicians. These long-term complications can be broadly categorized as disease-related (impact on sleep and acute exacerbation of restless legs syndrome symptoms), and medication issues (augmentation, sleep attacks, impulse control disorders, addiction and dependence, site reaction, occasionally sleep apnea, fibrotic complications, and weight gain).

### Therapeutic advances in restless legs syndrome (RLS) [^112b984p]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Levodopa and dopamine agonists have been the main treatment for restless legs syndrome during the past decades. Although their efficacy has been well documented over the short term, long-term dopaminergic treatment is often complicated by augmentation, loss of efficacy, and other side effects. Recent large randomized controlled trials provide new evidence for the efficacy of high-potency opioids and α2δ ligands, and several post hoc analyses, meta-analyses, algorithms, and guidelines have been published, often with a specific focus, for example, on augmentation, or on management of restless legs syndrome during pregnancy. Several new contributions to understanding the pathophysiology of restless legs syndrome have been published, but at this time, whether they will have an impact on treatment possibilities in the future cannot be estimated.

### Pharmacologic therapy for primary restless legs syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117ADTfp]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder characterized by unpleasant sensations in the legs and a distressing, irresistible urge to move them. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate efficacy, safety, and comparative effectiveness of pharmacologic treatments for primary RLS.

Evidence Acquisition

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), published in English, reporting efficacy outcomes and harms of pharmacologic treatments for primary RLS of at least 4 weeks' duration. MEDLINE and other databases were searched through June 2012. Reviewers extracted outcomes and adverse events and rated the strength of evidence.

Results

We identified 29 eligible RCTs. We found high-strength evidence that the proportion of patients who had a clinically important response (International Restless Legs Syndrome [IRLS] responders), defined as a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in mean IRLS symptom scale scores, was greater with dopamine agonist therapy compared with placebo (61% vs 41%) (risk ratio, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.38–1.86]; 7 trials). Dopamine agonists also improved patient-reported sleep scale scores and quality-of-life measures. High-strength evidence demonstrated that calcium channel alpha-2-delta ligands increased the proportion of IRLS responders compared with placebo (61% vs 37%) (risk ratio, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.33–2.09]; 3 trials). Adverse events associated with dopamine agonists included nausea, vomiting, and somnolence. Alpha-2-delta ligands adverse events included somnolence and unsteadiness or dizziness.

Conclusions and Relevance

On the basis of short-term RCTs that enrolled highly selected populations with long-term high-moderate to very severe symptoms, dopamine agonists and calcium channel alpha-2-delta ligands reduced RLS symptoms and improved sleep outcomes and disease-specific quality of life. Adverse effects and treatment withdrawals due to adverse effects were common.

### Strategies for the treatment of restless legs syndrome [^112sekpP]. Neurotherapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological disorder of unknown etiology that is managed by therapy directed at relieving its symptoms. Treatment of patients with milder symptoms that occur intermittently may be treated with nonpharmacological therapy but when not successful, drug therapy should be chosen based on the timing of the symptoms and the needs of the patient. Patients with moderate to severe RLS typically require daily medication to control their symptoms. Although the dopamine agonists, ropinirole and pramipexole have been the drugs of choice for patients with moderate to severe RLS, drug emergent problems like augmentation may limit their use for long term therapy. Keeping the dopamine agonist dose as low as possible, using longer acting dopamine agonists such as the rotigotine patch and maintaining a high serum ferritin level may help prevent the development of augmentation. The α2δ anticonvulsants may now also be considered as drugs of choice for moderate to severe RLS patients. Opioids should be considered for RLS patients, especially for those who have failed other therapies since they are very effective for severe cases. When monitored appropriately, they can be very safe and durable for long term therapy. They should also be strongly considered for treating patients with augmentation as they are very effective for relieving the worsening symptoms that occur when decreasing or eliminating dopamine agonists.

### Augmentation as a treatment complication of restless legs syndrome: concept and management [^111bHbh3]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Augmentation constitutes the main complication of long-term dopaminergic treatment in restless legs syndrome (RLS). Although this condition was first described in 1996, and is characterized by an overall increase in severity of RLS symptoms (including earlier onset of symptoms during the day, faster onset of symptoms when at rest, expansion to the upper limbs and trunk, and shorter duration of the treatment effect), precise diagnostic criteria were not established until 2003. These criteria have recently been updated to form a new definition of augmentation based on multicentric studies. The present article reviews our current knowledge on clinical diagnosis, evaluation, pathophysiology, and treatment recommendations for this condition.

### Opioids for restless legs syndrome [^1135XTCF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a distressing and common neurological disorder that may have a huge impact in the quality of life of those with frequent and intense symptoms. Patients complain of unpleasant sensations in the legs, at or before bedtime, and feel an urge to move the legs, which improves with movement, such as walking. Symptoms start with the patient at rest (e.g. sitting or lying down), and follow a circadian pattern, increasing during the evening or at night. Many pharmacological intervention are available for RLS, including drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease (L-Dopa and dopaminergic agonists), epilepsy (anticonvulsants), anxiety (benzodiazepines), and pain (opioids). Dopaminergic drugs are those most frequently used for treatment of RLS, but some patients do not respond effectively and require other medication. Opioids, a class of medications used to treat severe pain, seem to be effective in treating RLS symptoms, and are recommended for patients with severe symptoms, because RLS and pain appear to share the same mechanism in the central nervous system. All available drugs are associated to some degree with side effects, which can impede treatment. Opioids are associated with adverse events such as constipation, tolerance, and dependence. This justifies the conduct of a systematic review to ascertain whether opioids are safe and effective for treatment of RLS.

Objectives

To asses the effects of opioids compared to placebo treatment for restless legs syndrome in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials, CENTRAL 2016, issue 4 and MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS up to April 2016, using a search strategy adapted by Cochraneto identify randomised clinical trials. We checked the references of each study and established personal communication with other authors to identify any additional studies. We considered publications in all languages.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled clinical trials of opioid treatment in adults with idiopathic RLS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened articles, independently extracted data into a standard form, and assessed for risk of bias. If necessary, they discussed discrepancies with a third researcher to resolve any doubts.

Main Results

We included one randomised clinical trial (N = 304 randomised; 204 completed; 276 analysed) that evaluated opioids (prolonged release oxycodone/naloxone) versus placebo. After 12 weeks, RSL symptoms had improved more in the drug group than in the placebo group (using the IRLSSS: MD -7.0; 95% CI -9.69 to -4.31 and the CGI: MD -1.11; 95% CI -1.49 to -0.73). More patients in the drug group than in the placebo group were drug responders (using the IRLSSS: RR 1.82; 95% CI 1.37 to 2.42 and the CGI: RR1.92; 95% ICI 1.49 to 2.48). The proportion of remitters was greater in the drug group than in the placebo group (using the IRLSSS: RR 2.14; 95% CI 1.45 to 3.16). Quality of life scores also improved more in the drug group than in the placebo group (MD -0.73; 95% CI -1.1 to -0.36). Quality of sleep was improved more in the drug group measured by sleep adequacy (MD -0.74; 95% CI -1.15 to -0.33), and sleep quantity (MD 0.89; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.26). There was no difference between groups for daytime somnolence, trouble staying awake during the day, or naps during the day. More adverse events were reported in the drug group (RR 1.22; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.39). The major adverse events were gastrointestinal problems, fatigue, and headache.

Authors' Conclusions

Opioids seem to be effective for treating RLS symptoms, but there are no definitive data regarding the important problem of safety. This conclusion is based on only one study with a high dropout rate (moderate quality evidence).

### Restless legs syndrome [^112QtCm5]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In the review period since February 2004 a number of papers have been published that make significant contributions to the current understanding of the epidemiology, clinical assessment, pathophysiology and treatment of restless legs syndrome. Those with the most significant findings were selected and will be reviewed.

Recent Findings

Several epidemiological studies about restless legs syndrome have become available in the review period. A new susceptibility locus for restless legs syndrome has been reported. Neuropathological studies have provided profound insights into the key role of iron regulation in the pathophysiology of restless legs syndrome. Several randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated that dopamine agonists are efficacious in the treatment of restless legs syndrome. A few pilot treatment studies with intravenous iron have been performed.

Summary

In this paper, recent advances in the field of restless legs syndrome are reviewed. Special emphasis is placed on pathophysiology and treatment. Restless legs syndrome is still an underdiagnosed disorder. The evidence basis for its treatment has been considerably increased in the review period.

### Restless legs syndrome: diagnostic assessment and the advantages and risks of dopaminergic treatment [^112qY1Rc]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

In the past few years, major advances have been made in the field of restless legs syndrome (RLS). New tools have been developed to assess the presence and severity of RLS and its complications. Furthermore new concepts of the phenotype are emerging. With a high likelihood a slight dopaminergic hypofunction contributes essentially to the pathophysiology of most phenotypes of RLS. Dopaminergic substitution either with L-DOPA or with dopamine agonists ameliorates symptoms in the large majority of patients. Too high of doses of either type of drug may be involved in the development of augmentation caused by treatment-induced alterations in dopaminergic neurotransmission. Dopaminergic agents are currently the agents of first choice to treat RLS, and large multicenter trials support the evidence of efficacy. Very careful tailoring of the dose is required to avoid the development of treatment complications, specifically augmentation.

This condition is characterised by a range of uncomfortable and sometimes distressing motor and sensory symptoms during quiet wakefulness and/or sleep, such as feelings of burning, tickling or crawling, pain, cramping, numbness or weakness in the lower limbs, and, sometimes, also in the trunk and arms. The problem can seriously affect quality of life, yet is frequently dismissed as trivial. Often, it is unrecognised, incorrectly regarded as a neurosis, or managed poorly or not at all. Here we review how people with restless legs can best be helped.

### Restless legs syndrome-current therapies and management of augmentation [^112yEdtM]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic restless legs syndrome (RLS) can severely affect quality of life and disturb sleep, so that pharmacological treatment is necessary, especially for elderly patients. Treatment guidelines recommend initiation of therapy with dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole or the rotigotine transdermal patch, all approved in most countries) or α-2-δ ligands (gabapentin enacarbil, approved in the United States and Japan), depending on the country and availability. Where approved, opioids (prolonged release oxycodone-naloxone, approved in Europe) are also recommended as a second-line therapy for severe RLS. Several iron formulations can be effective but are not yet approved for RLS therapy, whereas benzodiazepines and other anticonvulsants are not recommended or approved. Less is known about effective management of RLS that is associated with other conditions, such as uraemia or pregnancy. Furthermore, very little data are available on the management of RLS when first-line treatment fails or patients experience augmentation. In this Review, we summarize state-of-the-art therapies for RLS in the context of the diagnostic criteria and available guidelines, based on knowledge ranging from Class I evidence for the treatment of idiopathic RLS to Class IV evidence for the treatment of complications such as augmentation. We consider therapies, including combination therapies, that are used in clinical practice for long-term management of RLS, despite a lack of trials and approval, and highlight the need for practical long-term evaluation of current trials.

### Rethinking clinical trials in restless legs syndrome: a roadmap [^114Hb1Qb]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

The number of large clinical trials of restless legs syndrome (RLS) have decreased in recent years, this coincides with reduced interest in developing and testing novel pharmaceuticals. Therefore, the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) formed a task force of global experts to examine the causes of these trends and make recommendations to facilitate new clinical trials. In our article, we delve into potential complications linked to the diagnostic definition of RLS, identify subpopulations necessitating more attention, and highlight issues pertaining to endpoints and study frameworks. In particular, we recommend developing alternative scoring methods for more accurate RLS diagnosis, thereby improving clinical trial specificity. Furthermore, enhancing the precision of endpoints will increase study effect sizes and mitigate study costs. Suggestions to achieve this include developing online, real-time sleep diaries with high-frequency sampling of nightly sleep latency and the use of PLMs as surrogate markers. Furthermore, to reduce the placebo response, strategies should be adopted that include placebo run-in periods. As RLS is frequently a chronic condition, priority should be given to long-term studies, using a randomized, placebo-controlled, withdrawal design. Lastly, new populations should be investigated to develop targeted treatments such as mild RLS, pregnancy, hemodialysis, or iron-deficient anemia.

### Clinical trials in restless legs syndrome – recommendations of the European RLS study group (EURLSSG) [^114CTw36]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

The European Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) Study Group (EURLSSG) is an association of European RLS experts who are actively involved in RLS research. A major aim of the Study Group is the development and continuous improvement of standards for diagnosis and treatment of RLS. Several members developed study designs and evaluation methods in investigator-initiated trials early in the 1990s, and all members have since contributed to many pivotal and nonpivotal drug trials for the treatment of RLS. The recommendations on clinical investigations of pharmacological treatment of RLS patients summarize the group's expertise and knowledge acquired through clinical trials. The recommendations primarily address how to plan and conduct confirmatory, randomized clinical studies in patients with idiopathic RLS. Advice is presented for the diagnosis of RLS and clinical and polysomnographic inclusion and exclusion criteria. Primary and secondary endpoints for an evaluation of efficacy are based on a critical description of validated methods for both short- and long-term trials, also in special populations (children, pregnant women, elderly patients). The recommendations include the assessment of augmentation. Finally, general issues including the evaluation of safety and tolerability, as well as specific neurological and cardiovascular risks and sleep attacks/daytime somnolence, are discussed. The aim of these recommendations is to support research groups or pharmaceutical companies in the design of optimized study protocols.

### Restless legs syndrome [^115tT2w7]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological sensory-motor disorder that is characterized by intense restlessness and unpleasant creeping sensations deep inside the lower legs. Symptoms appear when the legs are at rest and are worst in the evening and at night. They force patients to keep moving their legs, and often to get out of bed and wander about. Periodic limb movements (PLMS) are also common during sleep amongst those suffering from RLS, and sleep efficiency is severely reduced. There are idiopathic as well as symptomatic forms of RLS, the latter being associated with e.g. pregnancy, iron deficiency and chronic renal failure. A family history of RLS is very common and pedigrees in these cases suggest an autosomal-dominant transmission with high penetrance. Genetic investigations have been performed in order to identify genes associated with RLS. Several loci have been found (on chromosomes 12q, 14q, 9p, 2q, 20p and 16p). Pathophysiology of RLS remains incompletely understood. However, advanced brain imaging studies and positive results of dopaminergic treatment suggest that RLS may be generated by dopamine dysfunction locally within the central nervous system. At present, there is a wide range of treatment options including levodopa, dopamine agonists, opioids, benzodiazepines, antiepileptic drugs and iron supplements.

### Restless legs syndrome and periodic leg movements in patients with movement disorders: specific considerations [^113nr7BX]. Movement Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome is a frequent neurological disorder with potentially serious and highly distressing treatment complications. The role and potential implications of periodic leg movements during sleep range from being a genetic risk marker for restless legs syndrome to being a cardiovascular risk factor. The diagnosis of restless legs syndrome in patients with daytime movement disorders is challenging and restless legs syndrome needs to be differentiated from other sleep-related movement disorders. This article provides an update on the diagnosis of restless legs syndrome as an independent disorder and the role of periodic leg movements and reviews the association of restless legs syndrome with Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Common comorbidities and differential diagnosis of restless legs syndrome [^115MDcm6]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sensory motor disorder characterized by the urge to move a leg, which worsens with physical and cognitive inactivity, particularly in the evening and at night, but transiently improves with activity. A number of diseases have symptoms that are often confused with those of RLS, and other conditions are associated with higher rates of RLS. RLS can also be exacerbated by certain medications. Because RLS lacks biomarkers and established tests to aid in its diagnosis, clinicians should be aware of the other disorders that can be confused with or accompany RLS.

### What treatment works best for restless legs syndrome? Meta-analyses of dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic medications [^115pCPYc]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

At the time of writing only dopamine agonists are licensed for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in various countries, but randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been performed with other treatments. We performed comprehensive meta-analyses and indirect comparisons of RCTs for all currently recommended treatments of RLS.

Methods

We searched the Central, Medline, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases. Outcome measures were the international RLS study group severity scale (IRLS), clinical global impression-improvement, (CGI-I), periodic limb movement index (PLMI), and psychosocial parameters such as quality of life (QoL). We also conducted indirect comparisons by testing for heterogeneity between the substance groups.

Results

Placebo (58 trials) and actively (4 trials) controlled RCTs with dopamine agonists (38 trials), levodopa (4 trials), anticonvulsants (13 trials), most of them with α₂δ ligands (11 trials), opioids (1 trial), and iron treatments (6 trials) were included (9596 patients). Although treatment effects showed large variations, changes in the IRLS in the substance groups were comparable (P = 0.78), with a mean reduction in the IRLS of -5.47 points for dopamine agonists, -5.12 points for anticonvulsants (α₂δ ligands and levetiracetam), and -4.59 points for iron treatments. The CGI-I indicated slightly different treatment effects between the substance groups, while PLMI changes during treatment differed (P = 0.002), showing a marked decrease with dopamine agonists (-22.50/h), levodopa (-26.01/h), and oxycodone (-34.46/h) compared with a slight decrease for anticonvulsants (α₂δ ligands and levetiracetam; -8.48/h) and iron treatments (-13.10/h). Quality of sleep and QoL improved moderately in most of the RCTs investigating these parameters (standardized mean difference, SMD) 0.40 and 0.33, respectively). In the few studies evaluating the change of depressive (n = 4) or anxiety symptoms (n = 3), these symptoms improved slightly (SMD -0.24, and -0.21). Adverse effects and dropouts were comparable in number across all substance groups. In meta-regressions, the treatment effect was predicted by the design of the trial (the more sites involved in a trial the lower the effect) and by the duration of action of a medication (the longer the duration of action, expressed as the half-life time of a substance, the greater the improvement), the latter indicating potential superiority of treatments with stable blood concentration.

Conclusion

This first meta-analysis of all RCTs for the pharmacological treatment of RLS provides evidence that, besides the well-defined efficacy of dopaminergic treatment, other treatments with different pharmacological principles show efficacy in small samples and may be well-tolerated alternatives for the treatment of RLS. In the group of anticonvulsants, only the trials performed with α₂δ ligands such as gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, and pregabalin showed good efficacy. This indicates a specific mechanism of action of these substances in RLS. The group of iron treatments consisted of a few trials with different compounds in oral and intravenous application form, respectively. For a more differentiated evaluation of the efficacy of iron treatments further studies are necessary. The large efficacy of one opioid RCT in RLS has to be confirmed in further studies.

Adults with restless legs syndrome (RLS) — gabapentin enacarbil recommendation: In adults with RLS, the AASM recommends the use of gabapentin enacarbil over no gabapentin enacarbil (strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). The TF identified 8 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 3 observational studies in which the pooled estimates demonstrated clinically significant improvements in disease severity, sleep quality, and QOL with a moderate effect size; all 8 RCTs reported on the presence of adverse events leading to study withdrawal and the pooled estimate for the adverse events did not meet clinical significance, with adverse effects including somnolence and dizziness and the undesirable effect size deemed small. The overall certainty of evidence was moderate due to imprecision; since the cost of the medication is considered high, treatment would probably reduce health equity, but direct evidence is lacking; the intervention was feasible to implement; and patients who are at a high risk of side effects with this class of medications may choose other treatment options.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is characterized by an urge to move the legs. The symptoms are more intense in the evening and during periods of inactivity. RLS symptoms are relieved by movement. It is classified as a sleep disorder, but in many ways it is actually a disorder of wakefulness that seems to intrude upon the ability to transition from wakefulness into sleep. Estimates on prevalence vary according to the methodology employed, but it generally affects between 3.9% and 14.3% of the population.(1) About one-third of persons are affected seriously enough to warrant treatment.(2.)

### Restless legs syndrome [^114fVuoJ]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sensorimotor disorder characterized by an urge to move that appears during rest or is exacerbated by rest, that occurs in the evening or night and that disappears during movement or is improved by movement. Symptoms vary considerably in age at onset, frequency and severity, with severe forms affecting sleep, quality of life and mood. Patients with RLS often display periodic leg movements during sleep or resting wakefulness. RLS is considered to be a complex condition in which predisposing genetic factors, environmental factors and comorbidities contribute to the expression of the disorder. RLS occurs alone or with comorbidities, for example, iron deficiency and kidney disease, but also with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and neurological, rheumatological and respiratory disorders. The pathophysiology is still unclear, with the involvement of brain iron deficiency, dysfunction in the dopaminergic and nociceptive systems and altered adenosine and glutamatergic pathways as hypotheses being investigated. RLS is poorly recognized by physicians and it is accordingly often incorrectly diagnosed and managed. Treatment guidelines recommend initiation of therapy with low doses of dopamine agonists or α 2 δ ligands in severe forms. Although dopaminergic treatment is initially highly effective, its long-term use can result in a serious worsening of symptoms known as augmentation. Other treatments include opioids and iron preparations.

### Gabapentin enacarbil for treatment of restless legs syndrome in adults [^111A9aUM]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, drug interactions, precautions, dosing recommendations, and patient counseling for gabapentin enacarbil for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in adults.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted using the terms gabapentin enacarbil, XP13512/GSK1838262, and restless legs syndrome. MEDLINE, Books@Ovid, Journals@Ovid Full Text, BIOSIS Previews, and EMED databases were the primary search sites (2004-October 2011). All English-based articles and abstracts obtained from the literature searches were reviewed. Additional information was obtained from references cited in the articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All gabapentin enacarbil information related to RLS was considered. Study selection included human trials evaluating safety and efficacy of gabapentin enacarbil for the treatment of RLS.

Data Synthesis

Gabapentin enacarbil is a prodrug of gabapentin that is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe primary RLS in adults. In placebo-controlled trials, gabapentin enacarbil demonstrated efficacy in reducing the symptoms of RLS. Most clinical trials assessed gabapentin enacarbil at dosages greater than the FDA-approved 600-mg dosage. For the approved dose of 600 mg, the most commonly reported adverse effects are somnolence and dizziness.

Conclusions

Clinical trials have evaluated gabapentin enacarbil for safety and efficacy in treating moderate-to-severe RLS symptoms for up to 64 weeks. It offers a pharmacokinetic advantage over gabapentin by having improved absorption and a longer duration of action, but clinically significant differences are yet to be determined. Potential disadvantages of gabapentin enacarbil include cost, concerns of suicide risk and pancreatic cancer, and a lack of data for the FDA-approved 600-mg dosage. Overall, gabapentin enacarbil is a viable therapeutic option for adults with moderate-to-severe RLS for whom more conventional therapies have failed.

Consensus guidelines suggest that supplementation of iron in adults with RLS should be instituted with oral or intravenous (IV) iron if serum ferritin ≤ 75 ng/mL or transferrin saturation < 20%, and only with IV iron if serum ferritin is between 75 and 100 ng/mL; in children, supplementation of iron should be instituted for serum ferritin < 50 ng/mL with oral or IV formulations. The first step in the management of RLS should be addressing exacerbating factors, and RLS is common in pregnancy; prescribers should consider the pregnancy-specific safety profile of each treatment being considered.

### Treatment wish of individuals with known and unknown restless legs syndrome in the community [^112iXzQR]. Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a frequent sleep disorder with a prevalence of 5% to 15% in Caucasian populations. Dopaminergic treatment is known to reduce sensorimotor RLS symptoms and is approved for RLS, but not all patients ask for treatment. About 2% to 3% of patients presenting to a primary care physician require RLS-specific treatment. The overall treatment preference of RLS sufferers, however, is still unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and treatment preference in patients with previously diagnosed and those with yet undiagnosed RLS in a population-based survey in Germany.

Design and Setting

Cross-sectional health survey with face-to-face interviews with 1312 participants in the Dortmund Health Study. RLS was assessed with standardized, validated questions addressing the four minimal diagnostic criteria for RLS defined by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group.

Participants

Participants were aged 25 to 75 years and were randomly selected from the city register.

Results

The overall prevalence of individuals with a known doctor diagnosis of RLS was 2.3%. In addition, 6.5% fulfilled the four minimal criteria but did not know about this diagnosis yielding an overall prevalence of 8.8%. Prevalence was higher in women (10.2%) and German descendents (9.2%) compared to men (7.1%) and migrants (6.7%). Almost 60% of all RLS cases reported symptoms at least once a week. 33.3% of cases with a known RLS diagnosis and 14.1% with an unknown diagnosis had an RLS treatment wish. The latter is determined by knowledge of the diagnosis, daily symptoms, diabetes and sleep disturbance.

Conclusion

About every fourth RLS case knows about the diagnosis and overall every fifth RLS case wishes medication to effectively reduce symptoms, corresponding to 1.6% of the whole study population.

### Identification of novel risk loci for restless legs syndrome in genome-wide association studies in individuals of European ancestry: a meta-analysis [^111u27Ub]. The Lancet: Neurology (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite the prevalence of restless legs syndrome being up to 10% in populations of European ancestry, its genetic basis and underlying pathophysiology remain unclear. The restless legs syndrome phenotype is an unusual composite of sensory and motor symptoms that present with distinct circadian rhythmicity. The symptoms worsen or are only present in the evening or at night and markedly lessen in the early morning. Patients feel an overwhelming urge to move, often in conjunction with unpleasant sensations, usually in the legs. Rest and inactivity provoke the symptoms, whereas movement and other external stimuli lead to temporary relief. Due to the chronic progressive nature of the disorder, it has long-lasting effects on patients' mental and physical health. People with restless legs syndrome have substantially impaired sleep, reduced overall quality of life, and increased risk of depression, anxiety disorders, hypertension, and, possibly, cardiovascular disease. Around 2–3% of the general population have severe restless legs syndrome, and most need chronic treatment with dopaminergics, α 2 δ ligands, or even opioids. However, long-term use of dopaminergics can lead to severe side-effects, including the worsening of symptoms (augmentation). Hence, there is an urgent need for alternative treatments.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed for articles published up to July, 2017, with combinations of the search term "restless legs AND (genomewide OR genome-wide OR GWAS)", without restrictions on language of publication. This search yielded 42 original articles, including reports on genetic linkage analyses and genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Although linkage results on restless legs syndrome have not been reproducible, GWASs so far have revealed six risk loci, with the strongest signal being in MEIS1, a member of the three aminoacid loop extension homeobox gene class. Subsequent studies have suggested altered embryonic development of the striatum is also important in the aetiology of restless legs syndrome. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis needs further elucidation. Changes in dopaminergic signalling and brain iron deficiency seem to be involved and are targeted by approved drugs. Other suggested causes include peripheral hypoxia and unknown metabolic factors related to uraemia and pregnancy. The current recommended treatment for restless legs syndrome, although effective, can lead to serious adverse effects, including worsening of symptoms, thus alternatives are needed.

### New concepts in the management of restless legs syndrome [^115oRT1D]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease (WED) is a neurological condition with an overall prevalence in adults of 5–10% in Europe and North America. It is characterised by strong feelings of restlessness and distressing paraesthesia-like sensations in the lower legs, particularly when at rest. The symptoms vary considerably in severity and frequency. RLS/WED has a variable clinical expression influenced by genetic, environmental, and medical factors. Research into the pathophysiology of RLS/WED has found that various genetic markers and existing dysfunctions in dopaminergic mechanisms and iron mechanisms play a central role. Until recently, the first line treatment of RLS/WED was with low dose dopamine agonists, with three drugs having been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. However, the occurrence of dopaminergic augmentation and an overall increase in severity of symptoms during long term treatment with dopamine agonists is leading to a shift towards non-dopaminergic alternatives as initial treatments, and particularly to α 2 δ ligands. Recent international guidelines recommend, whenever possible, to start treatment with these drugs (α 2 δ ligands) to avoid augmentation from the start. Other (eg, glutamatergic or adenosine) neurotransmitters might also play an important role in causing RLS/WED and might thus lead to new treatments.

### Treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^114adC69]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) restless legs syndrome (RLS) — Recommendation 4: In adults with RLS, the AASM recommends the use of IV ferric carboxymaltose over no IV ferric carboxymaltose in patients with appropriate iron status (see good practice statement for iron parameters) (strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). The TF identified 5 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with clinically significant improvements in disease severity, sleep quality, and quality of life (QOL) with a moderate effect size, and 4 RCTs reporting adverse events leading to withdrawal where the pooled estimate did not meet clinical significance; adverse effects included risk for hypophosphatemia and dizziness, and the undesirable effect size was deemed small. Overall certainty was moderate due to imprecision; cost was considered moderate; the treatment would probably reduce health equity; feasibility was probably achievable.

### Treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^115Lvq8c]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Periodic limb movement disorder in adults — evidence gaps and conditional recommendations. PLMD is a controversial diagnosis in adults; higher-quality treatment studies were limited to the 1990s to early 2000s, leading to conditional recommendations against triazolam and valproic acid. The literature is devoid of treatment studies for PLMD within the past 2 decades, the value of independent treatment of periodic limb movements during sleep (PLMS) in the context of restless legs syndrome is of unclear significance, and PLMS associations with age and diverse medical and neurological conditions leave the indication for treatment uncertain.

### Emerging concepts of the pathophysiology and adverse outcomes of restless legs syndrome [^116vzYSE]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease (WED), is a common neurological disorder affecting up to 5% to 10% of the population, but it remains an underdiagnosed condition. RLS/WED is characterized by uncomfortable sensations, mainly in the legs, which appear during inactivity and worsen in the evening or at night. The prevalence of RLS/WED and periodic leg movements (PLMs) is increased in patients with sleep-disordered breathing, particularly in those with OSA, the most common sleep disorder encountered in sleep centers. New advances in the pathophysiology of RLS/WED have shown important implications for various genetic markers, neurotransmitter dysfunction, and iron deficiency. A practical approach to RLS/WED management includes an accurate diagnosis, the identification of reversible contributing factors, and the use of nonpharmacological therapies, including iron substitution (oral or IV) therapy. Many pharmacological agents are effective for the treatment of RLS/WED. Until recently, the first-line treatment of RLS/WED consisted of low-dose dopamine agonists (DA). However, given the fact that DAs cause high rates of augmentation of symptoms, international guidelines recommend that whenever possible the initial treatment of choice should be an α2δ ligand, and avoidance of dopaminergic agents unless absolutely necessary. If necessary, the lowest effective dose should be used for only the shortest possible time. The symptoms of RLS/WED can disrupt the quality of sleep as well as the quality of life. IV iron therapy may be considered in patients with refractory RLS. A better understanding of RLS/WED pathophysiology will allow patients to receive tailored therapy, resulting in an improved quality of life.

Sleep disorders, including restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder, sleep apnea syndrome, and narcolepsy, are prevalent medical conditions, likely to be seen by practicing psychiatrists. Awareness of these conditions and their presentations, pathophysiology, and treatment allows psychiatrists to treat these conditions where appropriate, to minimize complications and health consequences associated with delayed diagnosis, and to reduce the burden of disease that these conditions may place on patients already experiencing primary psychiatric disorders.

### Treatment of restless legs syndrome [^115xkwuR]. Neurotherapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common disorder diagnosed by the clinical characteristics of restlessness in the legs associated often with abnormal sensations that start at rest and are improved by activity, occurring with a diurnal pattern of worsened symptoms at night and improvement in the morning. RLS is the cause of impaired quality of life in those more severely afflicted. Treatment of RLS has undergone considerable change over the last few years. Several classes of medications have demonstrated efficacy, including the dopaminergic agents and the alpha-2-delta ligands. Levodopa was the first dopaminergic agent found to be successful. However, chronic use of levodopa is frequently associated with augmentation that is defined as an earlier occurrence of symptoms frequently associated with worsening severity and sometimes spread to other body areas. The direct dopamine agonists, including ropinirole, pramipexole, and rotigotine patch, are also effective, although side effects, including daytime sleepiness, impulse control disorders, and augmentation, may limit usefulness. The alpha-2-delta ligands, including gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, and pregabalin, are effective for RLS without known occurrence of augmentation or impulse control disorders, although sedation and dizziness can occur. Other agents, including the opioids and clonazepam do not have sufficient evidence to recommend them as treatment for RLS, although in an individual patient, they may provide benefit.

Conclusion

In this article, an attempt is made to summarize the current research progress of the incidence, clinical manifestations, mechanisms, diagnosis and treatment on Parkinson's disease (PD) with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). However, given the complexity of factors and predictors that contribute to the progression of RLS in PD, each of these areas requires further investigation.

The existing research in this field is still in its infancy and ongoing. This review notes that RLS in PD may be associated with iron deficiency, dysfunction of the dopamine system, and reduced connectivity of related neural pathways. Despite this, more in — depth research is required to explore whether the progression of RLS in PD is also linked to immune inflammation, gut microbiota, and other factors. Additionally, there is significant variation in prevalence studies. To accurately assess the prevalence of RLS in PD, there is a need for standardized research methods in the future. Furthermore, current treatments can only alleviate symptoms and fall short in preventing or reversing the disease's progression. Therefore, future research should focus on the pathogenesis of RLS in PD to provide a theoretical foundation for the development of more effective treatments. Until now, research on RLS in PD spans multiple disciplines, including neurology, neuroimaging, and genetics. In the future, interdisciplinary cooperation should be strengthened. By integrating resources and technical advantages, we can promote the in — depth development of RLS research in PD.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) use of opioids — extended-release oxycodone and, with reasonable extension, other formulations of low-dose opioids, not formally assessed in high-quality studies, are given a conditional recommendation for moderate to severe cases of RLS. Low-dose opioids are often necessary to treat dopamine agonist-related augmentation of RLS symptoms, can facilitate taper and discontinuation of the dopamine agonist, and then usually remain the primary treatment for RLS symptoms; caution should be used with opioids as central sleep apnea and respiratory depression can emerge with the increased morphine equivalent dosing in most opioids with the exception of buprenorphine, which has a reduced risk of respiratory depression.
