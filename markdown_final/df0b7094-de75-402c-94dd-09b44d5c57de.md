## Question

What conditions should be included in the differential diagnosis of cellulitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what conditions should be included in the differential diagnosis of cellulitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing the clinical context and the magnitude of misdiagnosis. Then, I should categorize key mimics by pathophysiology and highlight high-risk entities that must not be missed. Next, I will layer in population-specific considerations. After that, I should review the diagnostic approach across history, examination, laboratories, imaging, and biopsy. Then, I will examine decision tools like ALT-70 and their limitations. Finally, I'll synthesize practical takeaways and safety checks anchored to guideline recommendations and imaging criteria to reduce diagnostic error [^111Gmbbk] [^115uKspM] [^111VZ6JV].

> Let me first confirm the core clinical problem and why precision matters. Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, most commonly due to β-hemolytic streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus, but diagnosis is clinical and nonspecific, which fuels frequent misclassification of pseudocellulitis as infection [^1119mx9Q]. Hold on, I should verify the misdiagnosis burden: systematic review data show misdiagnosis rates ranging from roughly 19% to 83% with a mean near 41%, and related analyses estimate substantial avoidable costs and unnecessary antibiotic exposure, underscoring the need for a structured differential and early specialty input when uncertain [^111Gmbbk] [^116pcKEq] [^1114XDHs].

> Next, I should organize the differential by pathophysiology to avoid anchoring bias. Let me think about four major buckets that consistently come up in emergency medicine and dermatology reviews: true infections needing antimicrobials, noninfectious inflammatory dermatoses, vascular and lymphatic disorders, and malignant or infiltrative diseases, with a fifth practical bucket for traumatic or mechanical triggers that can mimic infection or coexist with it [^114kM2k4] [^111ZKv3w] [^113JQWLj]. I need to ensure I keep rapid-life-threats like necrotizing fasciitis in sharp focus because missing these is catastrophic and often begins with a working diagnosis of "cellulitis" until careful reassessment reveals red flags [^113X5dYY].

> I will now examine key infectious entities so I do not overlook treatable causes. Erysipelas tends to be more superficial with a sharply demarcated, raised border compared with cellulitis, often streptococcal, while cutaneous abscess is characterized by fluctuance and can be reliably differentiated from cellulitis at the bedside with point-of-care ultrasound, which meaningfully alters management toward incision and drainage when indicated [^116mEAXB] [^114vUVFq]. Hold on, I should verify necrotizing soft tissue infection red flags: pain out of proportion, edema extending beyond erythema, rapid progression, and systemic toxicity warrant emergent surgical consultation and advanced imaging, with broad-spectrum empiric coverage including agents active against streptococci and MRSA while source control is pursued [^113X5dYY] [^1161PQHd]. Let me not forget site-specific infections like orbital cellulitis with ophthalmoplegia and pain on eye movement, and environmental exposures such as Vibrio vulnificus after coastal water contact, both of which require urgent recognition and targeted therapy; even rare causes like cutaneous anthrax can present as preseptal cellulitis and should be considered in the right epidemiology [^111x6z8K] [^115fsSTS] [^11642dXK].

> Now, I should review noninfectious inflammatory mimics that commonly drive overdiagnosis. Venous stasis dermatitis and lipodermatosclerosis often present bilaterally with pruritus and chronic edema or fibrotic changes, while contact or irritant dermatitis is pruritic with a relevant exposure history and less tenderness or systemic upset, and conditions like Wells syndrome, Sweet syndrome, erythema multiforme, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, urticaria, and drug eruptions can all produce erythematous plaques or plaques with atypical morphology or distribution that do not behave like cellulitis clinically [^111ZKv3w] [^113JQWLj] [^115uKspM]. Wait, let me verify the practical implication: when pruritus outweighs pain, or the process is migratory or transient, a noninfectious dermatosis becomes far more likely than a bacterial cellulitis [^111ZKv3w].

> I need to check the vascular and lymphatic conditions next because these frequently masquerade as "red, swollen legs". Deep vein thrombosis can mimic cellulitis with unilateral swelling and pain; duplex ultrasonography is first-line when DVT is suspected, and a negative scan, in the right context, can support a cellulitis diagnosis while also preventing anticoagulation errors, whereas chronic lymphedema produces woody, often bilateral nonpitting edema and predisposes to recurrent infection but is not itself an acute infection [^114kM2k4] [^111ZKv3w]. Let me confirm lipodermatosclerosis features: chronic lower leg induration with an "inverted champagne bottle" contour in venous disease is typical and should prompt vascular risk management rather than antibiotics unless superinfection is proven [^111ZKv3w].

> But wait, what if the erythema is an infiltrative malignant process. Carcinoma erysipelatoides in inflammatory breast cancer, cutaneous infiltration from leukemia or lymphoma, and Kaposi sarcoma can all present with erythematous plaques, sometimes on lymphedematous limbs; when morphology is atypical or the course is refractory, biopsy with appropriate immunohistochemistry such as HHV-8 for Kaposi sarcoma becomes essential to avoid prolonged, ineffective antibiotic courses [^113JQWLj] [^116x7tw2] [^115oHTUY]. Hold on, I should verify that early tissue diagnosis is particularly emphasized in immunocompromised hosts where malignant and infectious etiologies frequently overlap and evolve rapidly [^115oHTUY].

> Let me consider traumatic and mechanical mimics now so I don't miss foreign body reactions or critical care pseudocellulitis. Retained foreign material can incite a localized inflammatory response that looks like focal cellulitis until removed, and in the ICU, acute inflammatory edema presents as bilateral erythematous edematous plaques in fluid-overloaded patients with impaired lymphatic return, improving with volume optimization rather than antibiotics [^113JQWLj] [^115RaJs9]. Wait, I initially put "fight bite" here, but I should correct myself: closed-fist injuries over the MCP joints are fundamentally infectious from oral flora inoculation and belong under bacterial infections with a low threshold for surgical evaluation, not in the noninfectious trauma bucket [^114kM2k4].

> Next, I should review population-specific considerations to widen the differential thoughtfully. In immunocompromised patients, I need to expand beyond routine bacteria to include opportunistic fungi, viruses, atypical mycobacteria, drug reactions, graft-versus-host disease, and malignancy, and I should obtain early dermatology input with biopsy or aspiration for histology and culture because clinical gestalt is less reliable in this group [^115uKspM] [^1173adkz] [^115oHTUY]. In febrile neutropenia, I should stratify risk and broaden microbiologic evaluation, including blood cultures and lesion cultures before empiric therapy, recognizing that resistant bacteria and molds are plausible culprits, and that fungal biomarkers have limited sensitivity on current antifungals [^115LrDzG] [^112KZkpu]. For pediatric orbital or periorbital disease, cavernous sinus thrombosis must be considered when clinical deterioration or cranial symptoms evolve, and for wounds exposed to salt or brackish water, I must rapidly consider Vibrio vulnificus and start appropriate antibiotics without delay [^111x6z8K] [^115fsSTS].

> I should confirm bedside discriminators from the history and physical because they often pivot the diagnosis. Bilateral involvement strongly favors pseudocellulitis such as venous stasis or lymphedema over true infection, pruritus greater than pain points to dermatitis, whereas pain out of proportion should cue concern for necrotizing fasciitis, and interdigital maceration or tinea pedis are common portals for lower extremity cellulitis that require targeted local therapy to prevent recurrence [^111CRrQw] [^113X5dYY] [^111Mrdn1] [^115fTU2J]. Hold on, I should verify that recognizing and treating predisposing factors like edema, obesity, and chronic skin disease meaningfully reduces recurrence and is therefore part of the initial visit's workup and counseling, not an afterthought [^115fTU2J].

> Let me review labs carefully, and I should double-check when they actually help. Routine blood cultures and superficial swabs have low yield in uncomplicated cellulitis and are generally not recommended, but I should obtain them in immunocompromised patients, those with prosthetic intravascular devices, immersion injuries, or systemic toxicity where nonstandard pathogens are more likely, aligning with IDSA and ESCMID stewardship guidance [^112Y49h4] [^112GnzC7] [^115jGBew] [^112KVs2T] [^115zhFjv]. I need to ensure I use inflammatory markers judiciously: elevated CRP and ESR, such as CRP ≥ 2 mg/dL and ESR ≥ 30 mm/h, raise the likelihood of deeper infections like osteomyelitis or myositis rather than superficial cellulitis, while normal values lower that probability and can guide imaging decisions [^113mPavE].

> Next, I should review imaging and when not to delay it. Point-of-care ultrasound helps me distinguish abscess from cellulitis at the bedside and reduces diagnostic uncertainty in real time, duplex ultrasound is first-line for suspected DVT in unilateral swollen legs, and when necrotizing fasciitis or deep purulent collections are suspected clinically or by plain radiography, MRI or CT should be obtained urgently per ACR criteria and surgical consultation should not be delayed [^114vUVFq] [^114kM2k4] [^111VZ6JV] [^116sryHB]. Hold on, I should verify that after puncture wounds or when foreign bodies are possible, ultrasound, MRI, or contrast-enhanced CT are appropriate next studies to delineate retained material and deeper infection, consistent with ACR recommendations [^112cuL6t] [^116NPw4v].

> I will now examine the role of biopsy and early specialty input when the diagnosis remains unclear. When the presentation is atypical, refractory to guideline-concordant therapy, or raises concern for vasculitis, malignancy, or unusual infections, a skin biopsy or lesion aspiration for histology and microbiology with early dermatology consultation increases diagnostic accuracy and curbs unnecessary antibiotics, a practice emphasized especially in immunocompromised hosts [^113JQWLj] [^115oHTUY] [^1173adkz]. Let me first confirm that in such cases the threshold for tissue diagnosis should be low because the stakes of a missed alternative diagnosis are high and clinical criteria alone are insufficiently specific in the literature [^111Gmbbk].

> I should now review clinical decision tools while keeping their limitations in mind. The ALT-70 score assigns points for asymmetry, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and age ≥ 70 to discriminate cellulitis from pseudocellulitis in the lower extremity, with lower scores favoring pseudocellulitis and higher scores favoring true infection, but I need to remember this model emerged from retrospective data in admitted patients and functions best as an adjunct to clinical judgment rather than as a diagnostic arbiter [^114E3P1H] [^116qPMsz] [^1173956v]. However, prospective validation is needed before widespread use [^

> Hmm, wait a minute, I left that citation incomplete; I should correct myself. Prospective validation is indeed still needed before widespread use of ALT-70, so I will explicitly cite the derivation study and reviews highlighting the current evidence gaps to avoid overreliance on a single score in isolation [^114E3P1H] [^1173956v] [^116qPMsz].

> Let me synthesize practical, guideline-concordant management implications while I'm verifying the differential. For typical nonpurulent cellulitis without systemic instability, initial empiric therapy should target streptococci, most patients can be managed as outpatients, and a 5 to 6 day course is often sufficient when close follow-up is available, with limb elevation and treatment of predisposing factors to reduce recurrence risk [^116aZEV3] [^111ek3cL] [^111gsSaf] [^117WMmEy] [^117MYykE]. Hold on, I should confirm when to broaden: if MRSA coverage is desired based on epidemiology or severity, IDSA options include clindamycin monotherapy or combinations such as TMP/SMX or a tetracycline plus a β-lactam, or linezolid when warranted by severity and comorbidities [^115M76PW].

> Finally, I need to ensure safety checks for high-consequence conditions are front and center. If there is pain out of proportion, rapidly progressive edema or erythema, or systemic toxicity, I should escalate immediately with surgical consultation, broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics, and advanced imaging as indicated for necrotizing infection, and if there is saltwater exposure with a rapidly progressive wound, I should treat promptly for Vibrio vulnificus while arranging urgent debridement if needed [^113X5dYY] [^1161PQHd] [^115fsSTS]. Hold on, let me double-check that these escalation triggers are communicated clearly to the team to prevent delays, because most severe soft tissue infections initially masquerade as "cellulitis" until someone notices the out-of-proportion pain, disproportionate edema, or the failure to respond as expected to standard therapy [^113X5dYY].

Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis [^1119mx9Q], but many conditions mimic its erythema, warmth, and swelling [^114kM2k4], leading to frequent **misdiagnosis and unnecessary antibiotics** [^111Gmbbk] [^113Hxubb]. The most common mimics are **venous stasis dermatitis, lymphedema, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT)**, while **necrotizing fasciitis, abscess, and septic arthritis** are critical to exclude due to severity [^114kM2k4] [^113X5dYY]. Key distinguishing features include bilateral involvement (stasis/lymphedema), sharply demarcated erythema (erysipelas) [^111ZKv3w], and pain out of proportion (necrotizing fasciitis) [^113X5dYY]. Point-of-care ultrasound [^114vUVFq] helps differentiate abscess from cellulitis, and MRI/CT are reserved for suspected deep or necrotizing infection [^111VZ6JV]. Early dermatology input reduces **misdiagnosis and unnecessary antibiotics** [^112bQrDj] [^1114XDHs].

---

## Common infectious mimics

- **Erysipelas**: Superficial infection [^116mEAXB] with sharply demarcated erythema, often on face or lower limbs [^111ZKv3w].
- **Abscess**: Localized fluctuant collection; ultrasound [^114vUVFq] distinguishes from cellulitis.
- **Necrotizing fasciitis**: Rapid progression, severe pain, systemic toxicity, crepitus [^113X5dYY]; surgical emergency.
- **Septic arthritis**: Joint swelling, warmth, limited motion [^114kM2k4], systemic symptoms.
- **Septic bursitis**: Localized swelling over bursa, often olecranon or prepatellar [^114kM2k4].

---

## Common non-infectious mimics

- **Venous stasis dermatitis**: Bilateral lower limb erythema, edema [^111ZKv3w], hyperpigmentation, pruritus.
- **Lymphedema**: Chronic, non-pitting edema [^111ZKv3w], often unilateral, without warmth or tenderness.
- **Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)**: Unilateral swelling [^114kM2k4], erythema, tenderness, positive Homans sign.
- **Gout/pseudogout**: Acute joint inflammation, erythema, swelling, severe pain [^114kM2k4].
- **Contact dermatitis**: Pruritic, erythematous rash with clear exposure history [^111ZKv3w].
- **Drug reactions**: Morbilliform or urticarial rash, often bilateral, associated with new medications [^113JQWLj].

---

## Less common but clinically significant mimics

- **Necrotizing fasciitis**: Rapidly progressive [^113X5dYY], severe pain, systemic toxicity, crepitus.
- **Pyoderma gangrenosum**: Painful ulcers with violaceous borders [^113JQWLj], associated with systemic disease.
- **Sweet syndrome**: Painful erythematous plaques, fever [^113JQWLj], associated with malignancy or drugs.
- **Carcinoma erysipelatoides**: Breast cancer metastasis presenting as erythematous plaque [^113JQWLj].
- **Kaposi sarcoma**: Violaceous plaques or nodules, often in immunocompromised patients [^116vKRYC].

## Clinical features distinguishing cellulitis from its mimics

| **Feature** | **Cellulitis** | **Venous stasis dermatitis** | **Lymphedema** | **DVT** | **Necrotizing fasciitis** |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Laterality | Unilateral | Bilateral | Unilateral or bilateral | Unilateral | Unilateral |
| Onset | Acute | Chronic | Chronic | Acute | Rapid |
| Pain | Moderate | Mild pruritus | Minimal | Moderate | Severe |
| Systemic symptoms | Common [^114kM2k4] | Rare | Rare | Rare | Common |
| Demarcation | Poor | Sharp | Poor | Poor | Poor |
| Warmth | Present | Mild | Absent | Mild | Variable |
| Crepitus | Absent | Absent | Absent | Absent | Present [^113X5dYY] |

## Diagnostic approach

History and physical examination [^114kM2k4] should assess **onset, progression, systemic symptoms, and risk factors**. Laboratory tests include **CBC, CRP, and ESR** [^113mPavE], and blood cultures should be obtained if the patient is immunocompromised [^112KVs2T] or has severe infection [^112GnzC7]. Imaging primarily uses **ultrasound** [^114vUVFq] to evaluate for abscess or DVT, with **MRI or CT** reserved for suspected necrotizing infection or deep involvement [^111VZ6JV]. Early dermatology consultation reduces **misdiagnosis and unnecessary antibiotic use** [^112bQrDj] [^1114XDHs].

---

## Consequences of misdiagnosis

Misdiagnosis leads to **unnecessary antibiotic use** [^113Hxubb], contributing to antimicrobial resistance, adverse effects, and higher costs [^116pcKEq]. It also **delays appropriate treatment** [^113Hxubb], allowing progression of the underlying condition and increasing morbidity, and raises healthcare costs through avoidable admissions and interventions [^113Hxubb].

---

Cellulitis has many mimics [^111Gmbbk], and **accurate diagnosis** relies on careful clinical assessment, targeted testing, and early dermatology input [^112bQrDj] to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary antibiotics.

### Clinical mimics: An emergency medicine-focused review of cellulitis mimics [^114kM2k4]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Cellulitis is a common clinical condition with low rates of morbidity and mortality if treated appropriately. Mimics of cellulitis presenting with erythema, edema, warmth, and pain can be associated with grave morbidity and mortality if misdiagnosed.

- **Objective**: This review investigates the signs and symptoms of cellulitis, mimics of cellulitis, and an approach to the management of both cellulitis and its mimics.

- **Discussion**: The emergency medicine definition of cellulitis includes erythema, induration, warmth, and swelling. Given the common pathophysiologic pathways, cellulitis mimics often present in an analogous manner. These conditions include septic bursitis, septic joint, deep vein thrombosis, phlegmasia cerulea dolens, necrotizing fasciitis, flexor tenosynovitis, fight bite (closed fist injury), orbital cellulitis, toxic shock syndrome, erysipelas, abscess, felon, paronychia, and gouty arthritis. Many of these diseases have high morbidity and mortality if missed by the emergency physician. Differentiating these mimics from cellulitis can be difficult in the fast-paced emergency setting. A combination of history, physical examination, and focused diagnostic assessment may assist in correctly identifying the underlying etiology. For many of the high mortality cellulitis mimics, surgical intervention is necessary.

- **Conclusion**: Cellulitis and its mimics present similarly due to the same physiologic responses to skin and soft tissue infections. A combination of history, physical examination, and diagnostic assessment will help the emergency physician identify the underlying condition effectively.

### Lower limb cellulitis and its mimics: Part II. Conditions that simulate lower limb cellulitis [^111ZKv3w]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Several common conditions can mimic cellulitis, creating a potential for misdiagnosis and incorrect management. The most common disorders mistaken for lower limb cellulitis include venous eczema, lipodermatosclerosis, irritant dermatitis, and lymphedema. Dermatologists are often consulted when a patient has failed to respond to therapy, and a thorough knowledge of the differential diagnosis is essential. This article focuses on entities that can mimic cellulitis, with an emphasis on elements of the history and physical examination that can help to distinguish between lower limb cellulitis and its simulators.

### Costs and consequences associated with misdiagnosed lower extremity cellulitis [^113Hxubb]. JAMA Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Inflammatory dermatoses of the lower extremity are often misdiagnosed as cellulitis (also known as "pseudocellulitis") and consequently treated with antibiotics and/or hospitalization. There is limited data available on the costs and complications resulting from misdiagnosed cellulitis.

- **Objective**: To characterize the national health care burden of misdiagnosed cellulitis in patients admitted for treatment of lower extremity cellulitis.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This study is a cross-sectional analysis involving patients admitted from the emergency department (ED) of a large urban hospital with a diagnosis of lower extremity cellulitis between June 2010 and December 2012. Patients who were discharged with a diagnosis of cellulitis were identified as having cellulitis, while those who received an alternative diagnosis during the hospital course, at discharge, or within 30 days of discharge were classified as having pseudocellulitis. A literature review was conducted to calculate large-scale costs and complication rates. National cost figures were obtained from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) for 2010, to calculate hospitalization costs per year attributed to misdiagnosed lower extremity pseudocellulitis.

- **Exposures**: The exposed group consisted of patients who presented to and were admitted from the ED with a diagnosis of lower extremity cellulitis.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Patient characteristics, hospital course, and complications during and after hospitalization were reviewed for each patient. Estimates of annual costs and complications associated with misdiagnosed cellulitis were derived.

### What is the utility of point-of-care ultrasound for diagnosis of soft tissue abscess vs. cellulitis [^114vUVFq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), including cellulitis and abscess, are common conditions managed in the emergency department. Differentiating these based solely on history and physical examination can be challenging. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has been proposed as a tool to distinguish abscess from cellulitis.

- **Clinical question**: What is the utility of POCUS for diagnosing soft tissue abscess vs. cellulitis?

- **Evidence review**: Studies retrieved included four systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating the use of POCUS for diagnosing abscess. These studies provide estimates of the potential utility of POCUS in differentiating abscess and cellulitis.

- **Conclusion**: Based upon the available literature, POCUS can reliably differentiate abscess and cellulitis and assist with management of SSTIs.

### Misdiagnosis of uncomplicated cellulitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Gmbbk]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis with several mimics and no gold-standard diagnostic criteria. Misdiagnosis is common. This review aims to quantify the proportion of cellulitis misdiagnosis in primary or unscheduled care settings based on a second clinical assessment and describe the proportion and types of alternative diagnoses.

- **Methods**: Electronic searches of Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library (including CENTRAL) using MeSH and other subject terms identified 887 randomized and non-randomized clinical trials, and cohort studies. Included articles assessed the proportion of cellulitis misdiagnosis in primary or unscheduled care settings through a second clinical assessment up to 14 days post-initial diagnosis of uncomplicated cellulitis. Studies on infants and patients with (peri-)orbital, purulent, and severe or complex cellulitis were excluded. Screening and data extraction were conducted independently in pairs. Risk of bias was assessed using a modified risk of bias tool from Hoy et al. Meta-analyses were undertaken where three or more studies reported the same outcome.

- **Results**: Nine studies conducted in the United States, UK, and Canada, including a total of 1,600 participants, were eligible for inclusion. Six studies were conducted in the inpatient setting; three were in outpatient clinics. All nine included studies provided estimates of the proportion of cellulitis misdiagnosis, with a range from 19% to 83%. The mean proportion misdiagnosed was 41% (95% CI 28 to 56% for random effects model). Heterogeneity between studies was very high both statistically (I² = 96%, p-value for heterogeneity).

### Outcomes of early dermatology consultation for inpatients diagnosed with cellulitis [^112bQrDj]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Many inflammatory skin conditions mimic cellulitis, termed pseudocellulitis, and are often treated with antibiotics and/or hospitalization. This leads to unnecessary patient morbidity and substantial healthcare expenditure.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the impact of early dermatology consultation on clinical and economic outcomes associated with misdiagnosed cellulitis.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This prospective cohort study enrolled patients with a presumed diagnosis of cellulitis in the emergency department, in the emergency department observation unit, or within 24 hours of admission to an inpatient unit of a large urban teaching hospital between February and September 2017. Patients received telephone and clinic follow-up during the 30-day post-discharge period. We screened 165 patients with the primary concern of cellulitis. Of these, we excluded 44 patients who required antibiotics for cutaneous, soft-tissue, deeper-tissue, and/or bone infections irrespective of cellulitis status, and 5 patients who were scheduled to be discharged by the emergency department.

- **Interventions**: Early dermatology consultation for presumed cellulitis.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Primary outcomes were patient disposition and rates of antibiotic use.

- **Results**: Of 116 patients (63 [54.3%] women; 91 [78.4%] non-Hispanic white; mean [SD] age, 58.4 [19.1] years), 39 (33.6%) were diagnosed with pseudocellulitis by dermatologists. Of these, 34 (87.2%) had started using antibiotics for presumed cellulitis as prescribed by the primary team at the time of enrollment. The dermatology team recommended antibiotics accordingly.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115uKspM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). High credibility.

In the evaluation of cellulitis, particularly in immunocompromised patients, the 2014 guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend including a thorough differential diagnosis. This should encompass drug eruption, cutaneous infiltration with underlying malignancy, chemotherapy- or radiation-induced reactions, Sweet syndrome, erythema multiforme, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) among allogeneic transplant recipients, in addition to infection. Furthermore, it is advised to consider bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic agents in the differential diagnosis for infection of skin lesions.

Regarding specific circumstances for cellulitis, particularly in patients with febrile neutropenia, the IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining risk stratification based on susceptibility to infection:

- **High-risk**: Anticipated prolonged and profound neutropenia with an absolute neutrophil count < 100 cells/mcL or a MASCC score of < 21.
- **Low-risk**: Anticipated brief periods of neutropenia and few comorbidities, or a MASCC score of ≥ 21.

### Cellulitis: A review [^1119mx9Q]. JAMA (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cellulitis:

- **Definition**: Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue.

- **Pathophysiology**: Cellulitis is primarily caused by β-hemolytic Streptococci and S. aureus.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of non-purulent lower extremity cellulitis is 176.6 per 100,000 persons in the US.

- **Disease course**: After a breach in the skin allows pathogens to enter the dermis, the release of bacterial toxins and other inflammatory mediators results in dermal edema, lymphatic dilation, bulla formation, and regional lymphadenopathy. Untreated infection may progress to bacteremia and systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 17% of patients with acute cellulitis are unresponsive to initial treatment, and the risk of treatment failure is highest in obese patients. Recurrence of cellulitis occurs in approximately 14% and 45% of cases within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

### Cellulitis: Diagnosis and management [^113EYPpq]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute infection of the dermal and subcutaneous layers of the skin, often occurring following a local skin trauma. It is a common diagnosis in both inpatient and outpatient dermatology, as well as in the primary care setting. Cellulitis classically presents with erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness over the affected area. There are many other dermatologic diseases that can present with similar findings, highlighting the need to consider a broad differential diagnosis. Some of the most common mimics of cellulitis include venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, deep vein thrombosis, and panniculitis. History, local characteristics of the affected area, systemic signs, laboratory tests, and, in some cases, skin biopsy can be helpful in confirming the correct diagnosis. Most patients can be treated as an outpatient with oral antibiotics, with dicloxacillin or cephalexin being the oral therapy of choice when methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is not a concern.

### Unique presentation of cavernous sinus thrombosis in a paediatric patient [^111x6z8K]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Differential diagnosis included preseptal cellulitis, orbital cellulitis, subperiosteal abscess, and cavernous sinus thrombosis. The patient's worsening clinical findings and lack of improvement on oral antibiotics heightened the suspicion for a more severe process. The clinical presentation, in addition to imaging results, helped narrow the diagnosis to cavernous sinus thrombosis.

Based on the acute clinical presentation and progression, as well as diagnostic findings suggestive of sinusitis and meningitis, the most likely etiology was an infectious cause. This was further supported by the patient's improvement in clinical status. Other potential etiologies considered in the evaluation included malignancy, inflammatory disease, and hypercoagulability; however, these were deemed less likely due to the absence of supporting clinical symptoms and diagnostic findings.

### A predictive model for diagnosis of lower extremity cellulitis: A cross-sectional study [^114E3P1H]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Cellulitis has many clinical mimickers (pseudocellulitis), which leads to frequent misdiagnosis.

- **Objective**: To create a model for predicting the likelihood of lower extremity cellulitis.

- **Methods**: A cross-sectional review was performed of all patients admitted with a diagnosis of lower extremity cellulitis through the emergency department at a large hospital between 2010 and 2012. Patients discharged with a diagnosis of cellulitis were categorized as having cellulitis, while those given an alternative diagnosis were considered to have pseudocellulitis. Bivariate associations between predictor variables and final diagnosis were assessed to develop a 4-variable model.

- **Results**: In total, 79 (30.5%) of 259 patients were misdiagnosed with lower extremity cellulitis. Of the variables associated with true cellulitis, the four in the final model were asymmetry (unilateral involvement), leukocytosis (white blood cell count ≥ 10,000/uL), tachycardia (heart rate ≥ 90 bpm), and age ≥ 70 years. We converted these variables into a points system to create the ALT-70 cellulitis score as follows: Asymmetry (3 points), Leukocytosis (1 point), Tachycardia (1 point), and age ≥ 70 (2 points). With this score, 0–2 points indicate ≥ 83.3% likelihood of pseudocellulitis, and ≥ 5 points indicate ≥ 82.2% likelihood of true cellulitis.

- **Limitations**: Prospective validation of this model is needed before widespread clinical use.

- **Conclusion**: Asymmetry, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and age ≥ 70 are predictive of lower extremity cellulitis. This model might facilitate more accurate diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.

### Diagnosis and management of cellulitis and abscess in the emergency department setting: An evidence-based review [^11689GoD]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Cellulitis and abscess are common reasons for presentation to the emergency department, with several nuances in the care of these patients. The objective of this narrative review article was to provide a summary of the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of cellulitis and abscesses, with a focus on emergency clinicians.

- **Discussion**: The most common bacteria causing cellulitis are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and other β-hemolytic streptococci, while methicillin-resistant S. aureus is most common in abscesses. The history and physical examination are helpful in differentiating between cellulitis and abscess in many cases, and point-of-care ultrasound can be a useful tool in unclear cases. Treatment for cellulitis typically involves a penicillin or cephalosporin, and the treatment of abscesses is incision and drainage. Loop drainage is preferred over the traditional incision and drainage technique, and adjunctive antibiotics can be considered. Most patients can be managed as outpatients.

- **Conclusions**: It is essential for emergency physicians to be aware of the evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of patients with cellulitis and abscess.

### Cellulitis [^117Sz9yf]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused predominantly by gram-positive organisms. Risk factors include prior episodes of cellulitis, cutaneous lesions, tinea pedis, and chronic edema. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis and presents with localized skin erythema, edema, warmth, and tenderness. Uncomplicated cellulitis can be managed in the outpatient setting with oral antibiotics, and imaging often is not required but can be helpful.

Recurrent cellulitis is common, and predisposing conditions should be assessed and treated at the time of initial diagnosis. For patients with frequent recurrences despite management of underlying conditions, antimicrobial prophylaxis can be effective.

### Skin and soft tissue infections in the emergency department [^115joSCW]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

This article covers the diagnosis and treatment of skin and soft tissue infections commonly encountered in the emergency department: impetigo, cutaneous abscesses, purulent cellulitis, nonpurulent cellulitis, and necrotizing skin and soft tissue infections. Most purulent infections in the United States are caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

- **Incision and drainage**: For abscesses, we emphasize the importance of incision and drainage.
- **Nonpurulent infections**: These are usually caused by streptococcal species, and initial empiric antibiotics need not cover methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
- **Necrotizing skin and soft tissue infections**: Uncommon but potentially lethal, the challenge lies in rapid diagnosis in the emergency department and prompt surgical exploration and debridement.

### Distinguishing cellulitis from its noninfectious mimics: Approach to the red leg [^116pcKEq]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common clinical diagnosis in both outpatient and inpatient settings. Studies have demonstrated a surprisingly high misdiagnosis rate, with nearly one-third of cases being other conditions, such as pseudocellulitis. This high rate of misdiagnosis is believed to contribute to approximately $515 million in avoidable healthcare spending in the United States each year, leading to delayed or missed diagnoses of pseudocellulitis and consequently delays in appropriate treatment. There is a broad differential diagnosis for pseudocellulitis, which includes both inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions of the skin. Accurate diagnosis of the specific condition causing pseudocellulitis is crucial, as management varies greatly.

### Recurrent breast cellulitis from a nipple fissure [^112h8W1E]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Breast cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis classically characterized by swelling, erythema, warmth, and tenderness, often resulting from S. aureus infection. Mastitis is defined as inflammation of the breast tissue parenchyma and presents similarly to breast cellulitis with tenderness and swelling. However, mastitis can occur in the absence of skin changes, such as erythema, or infection, such as periductal mastitis. Indeed, breast cellulitis has been classified by some investigators as superficial mastitis occurring in the dermis.

Although superinfection of cutaneous fissures is a frequent complication of atopic dermatitis, fissures in most areas, such as the earlobes, tend to lead to impetigo rather than cellulitis. It is plausible that the rich lymphatic supply of the breast allowed the propagation of infection in this case, resulting in cellulitis.

Previously reported risk factors for isolated breast cellulitis include pregnancy, lactation, post-menopause, trauma (e.g. piercings, tattoos), lesions in breast skin (e.g. eczema), and prior breast-conserving surgeries. No reports exist of breast cellulitis from a nipple fissure in a non-pregnant, premenopausal patient with atopic dermatitis. It is important to recognize this condition because careful inspection is required to reveal a culprit source, and specific treatment is necessary to establish a durable response to antibiotics.

Although the management of cellulitis is well established, the management of nipple fissures is not well described. Both mupirocin and gentian violet are effective in temporarily reducing staphylococcal colonization.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with cellulitis requiring intensive care [^115mwmkR]. JAMA Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a commonly occurring skin and soft tissue infection and one of the most frequently seen dermatological diseases in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, the clinical characteristics of patients with cellulitis requiring intensive care treatment are poorly defined. Necrotizing fasciitis is often confused with cellulitis at initial presentation and is considered to be more severe; thus, it has previously been described in more detail.

- **Objective**: To describe the clinical presentation and outcomes of patients with ICU-necessitating cellulitis and to compare them with patients with necrotizing fasciitis.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This prospective cohort study includes all ICU admissions from two tertiary hospitals in the Netherlands. Of 2562 sepsis admissions, 101 had possible, probable, or definite cellulitis or soft tissue infections. Retrospective review identified severe cellulitis was the reason for ICU admission in 23 patients, necrotizing fasciitis in 31 patients, and other diagnoses in 47 patients.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Patient and disease characteristics, cultured pathogens, lengths of stay, and short-term and long-term mortality.

Overall, 54 patients with cellulitis (n = 23; mean [SD] age, 57.2 [17.7] years) or necrotizing fasciitis (n = 31; mean [SD] age, 54.3 [13.5]) were included in this study. Patients with cellulitis were found to be less severely ill than patients with necrotizing fasciitis. This is reflected in rates of shock (7 [30.4%] vs 19 [61.3%]; p = 0.03) and the need for mechanical ventilation (12 [52.2%] vs 19 [93.5%]; P).

### Cellulitis: A review of current practice guidelines and differentiation from pseudocellulitis [^112hv8YA]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Cellulitis, an infection involving the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, is the most common reason for skin-related hospitalization and is seen by clinicians across various disciplines in inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room settings, presenting as a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. It is clinically diagnosed based on the history of present illness and physical examination, lacking a gold standard. The clinical presentation typically includes the acute onset of redness, warmth, swelling, tenderness, and pain. However, diagnosing cellulitis is complicated by various infectious and non-infectious mimickers such as venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, eczema, lymphedema, and erythema migrans. Microbiological diagnosis is often unobtainable due to the poor sensitivity of culture specimens. The majority of non-purulent, uncomplicated cellulitis cases are caused by β-hemolytic streptococci or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Appropriate targeted coverage with oral antibiotics such as penicillin, amoxicillin, and cephalexin is sufficient. Even with rising rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coverage for non-purulent cellulitis is generally not recommended.

### Narrative review: Diseases that masquerade as infectious cellulitis [^113JQWLj]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

For cellulitis that does not respond to conventional antimicrobial treatment, clinicians should consider, among other explanations, several noninfectious disorders that might masquerade as infectious cellulitis. Diseases that commonly masquerade as this condition include thrombophlebitis, contact dermatitis, insect stings, drug reactions, eosinophilic cellulitis (the Wells syndrome), gouty arthritis, carcinoma erysipelatoides, familial Mediterranean fever, and foreign-body reactions. Diseases that uncommonly masquerade as infectious cellulitis include urticaria, lymphedema, lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, lymphoma, leukemia, Paget disease, and panniculitis.

Clinicians should perform an initial diagnostic work-up directed by the findings from a detailed history and complete physical examination. In many cases, a skin biopsy is the only tool that helps identify the correct diagnosis. Special tests may also be needed.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^1173956v]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses flowchart of literature search and study selection are summarized below. The characteristics of all eight included studies are summarized in Table 2. Raff et al. explored lower-limb cellulitis as the main pathology. Seven studies included patients with lower-limb cellulitis as a comparison group, in which cellulitis and other diagnoses were compared.

- **Characteristics of the eight included studies**: Six studies were case-control studies, and one study was a cohort study. There was also one cross-sectional study. The most common setting was the Emergency Department (ED), with three studies conducted in this environment. These studies were conducted in six different countries. Kato et al. did not include exclusion criteria.

- **Reference tests**: The reference test for cellulitis was a clinical diagnosis in seven studies, with a bone scan used by Fleischer et al. However, only Rabuka et al. clearly stated the specialty of the physician who made the cellulitis diagnosis. Two studies followed up patients for up to 30 days to determine the final diagnosis.

- **Index tests**: In studies where cellulitis was the main pathology, Raff et al. developed a predictive score, the ALT-70 score, to compare cellulitis with pseudocellulitis. This score assessed asymmetry (unilateral involvement, 3 points), leucocytosis (white blood cell count ≥ 10,000 μL−1, 1 point), tachycardia (heart rate ≥ 90 beats per minute, 1 point), and age.

### Acute inflammatory edema: A mimicker of cellulitis in critically ill patients [^115RaJs9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Inpatient dermatology consultations for treatment-refractory or atypical cellulitis are common. In critically ill patients, differentiating cellulitis from its mimickers can be challenging. We describe acute inflammatory edema, a likely underrecognized variant of pseudocellulitis.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the charts of 15 patients with this diagnosis, seen by the inpatient dermatology consultation service at the University of California at San Francisco between 2009 and 2017.

- **Results**: The cohort consisted of 9 women and 6 men with an age range of 52–73 years. Acute inflammatory edema presents as bilateral, erythematous, and edematous plaques, most commonly involving the thighs and lower abdomen, sparing areas of increased pressure on the skin. There is a predilection for patients with high body mass index and those with clinical or quantitative findings of fluid overload.

- **Conclusion**: We propose a three-part pathogenesis of acute inflammatory edema: 1) acute-onset volume overload, 2) in patients with impaired lymphatic return, and 3) leads to dermal edema, microtears in connective tissue, and an influx of inflammation.

### Cellulitis in chronic oedema [^1128Axfm]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

The novel findings from this publication indicate that one-third of patients with chronic oedema are likely to develop cellulitis at some point. The worse the oedema, the more likely cellulitis is to occur; conversely, the better the oedema, the less likely cellulitis is to occur. The strengths of this study include the large number of patients and the international collaboration involving nine countries, highlighting that chronic oedema predisposing to cellulitis is a global healthcare burden, at least in these countries.

However, targeting healthcare professionals with an interest in lymphoedema to identify patients may have resulted in elevated numbers and more severe cases included compared to the general population. Nonetheless, this does not undermine the value of the results. Unfortunately, data on recurrent cellulitis were not included, and it is likely to be a common occurrence. As shown previously, cellulitis can be self-perpetuating, with past episodes making future episodes more likely. While prophylactic penicillin has been shown to be valuable in preventing cellulitis, this study demonstrates the importance of controlling chronic oedema in preventing cellulitis, a finding recently confirmed by the use of compression garments.

In healthcare, patients are often treated for the acute episode of cellulitis and discharged without sufficient consideration for treating risk factors, such as chronic oedema, skin disease, and wounds. Dermatologists are well-positioned to manage such conditions and, therefore, should be more involved in these cases.

### Lower limb cellulitis: Low diagnostic accuracy and underdiagnosis of risk factors [^113CPR3W]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis and recognition of predisposing factors have been shown to be challenging in lower limb cellulitis (LLC). Assessment of 1,746 consecutive patients with cellulitis presenting to a UK university hospital showed increasing overdiagnosis, with only 31.9% of patients referred during the period 2015–2018 having the diagnosis of LLC confirmed. Recognition of at least one predisposing factor increased from 61% to 89% following the introduction of more specific screening questions, indicating a need for better primary care dermatology education and the benefit of a proforma with specific screening questions for reversible predisposing factors for LLC.

### Top 10 myths regarding the diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis [^111CRrQw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is commonly treated in the emergency department (ED). Patients who present with cellulitis incur significant healthcare costs and may be overtreated with antibiotics. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis play an important role in cost-effective, high-quality medical care, as well as appropriate antibiotic utilization.

- **Objective**: We aim to describe common fallacies regarding cellulitis. We present 10 myths that result in misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or inappropriate empiric management of cellulitis. Clinical presentation, including swelling and redness, is explored in depth, along with the incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, management of tick bites, and effective antibiotic therapy for cellulitis.

- **Discussion**: Patients are often treated for cellulitis unnecessarily or inappropriately. Awareness of these myths will help guide providers in clinical decision-making in order to effectively tailor treatment for these infections.

- **Conclusions**: Cellulitis is not as simple as it might seem and is commonly misdiagnosed in the ED. Noninfectious causes of local symptoms, including lymphedema, venous stasis, and deep vein thrombosis, need to be considered. Cellulitis should be treated with empiric antimicrobial therapy based on patient risk factors and regional susceptibility patterns. This review will assist providers in managing cellulitis and avoiding treatment errors that lead to high costs, unwanted side effects for patients, and overuse of antibiotics.

### Bilateral cellulitis [^116vKRYC]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

We present a case of bilateral lesions in a 50-year-old man, which were initially mistaken for and treated as bilateral cellulitis. We propose that, unlike unilateral cellulitis, bilateral cellulitis is rare, and other aetiologies should be considered when evaluating a patient with bilateral lesions. The differential diagnosis includes stasis dermatitis, lipodermatosclerosis, lymphoedema, and vascular lesions such as Kaposi sarcoma, which was identified in this case. Early consultation with dermatology and performing a biopsy in unclear cases can mitigate the unnecessary use of prolonged antibiotics, prevent antibiotic resistance, and reduce the incidence of Clostridium difficile infections. HIV testing is an essential screening test for all adults who present with non-specific viral symptoms and rash.

### Cellulitis and soft tissue infections [^114WtF2a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Cellulitis and soft tissue infections represent a diverse group of diseases, ranging from uncomplicated cellulitis to necrotizing fasciitis. Management of predisposing conditions is the primary means of prevention. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis and is therefore made based on history and physical examination. Imaging may be helpful for characterizing purulent soft tissue infections and associated osteomyelitis. Treatment varies according to the type of infection. The foundations of treatment are drainage of purulence and antibiotics, with the latter targeted at the infection's most likely cause.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^116qPMsz]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis can be a difficult diagnosis to make. Furthermore, 31% of patients admitted from the emergency department with suspected lower-limb cellulitis have been misdiagnosed, with incorrect treatment potentially resulting in avoidable hospital admission and the prescription of unnecessary antibiotics.

- **Objectives**: We sought to identify diagnostic criteria or tools that have been developed for lower-limb cellulitis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review using Ovid MEDLINE and Embase databases in May 2018, with the aim of describing diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis, and we assessed the quality of the studies identified using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. We included all types of study that described diagnostic criteria or tools.

- **Results**: Eight observational studies were included. Five studies examined biochemical markers, two studies assessed imaging, and one study developed a diagnostic decision model. All eight studies were considered to have a high risk for bias in at least one domain. The quantity and quality of available data were low, and results could not be pooled owing to the heterogeneity of the findings.

- **Conclusions**: There is a lack of high-quality publications describing criteria or tools for diagnosing lower-limb cellulitis. Future studies using prospective designs, validated in both primary and secondary care settings, are needed.

What's already known about this topic? Diagnosing lower-limb cellulitis on first presentation is challenging. Approximately one in three patients admit.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: Mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^1166SdXy]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute, painful, and potentially serious bacterial infection of the skin and underlying tissue that can significantly impact patients' lives. Pain, the feeling of being very unwell, and the need for elevation of the affected limb can lead to a reduced quality of life and significant periods of work absence among individuals with cellulitis. Cellulitis also places a considerable burden on the National Health Service (NHS). Between 2015 and 2016, 123,644 patients were admitted to hospitals in England for cellulitis.

Approximately one-third of people with cellulitis suffer recurrent episodes. Risk factors for the recurrence include previous episodes of cellulitis, lymphoedema, obesity, diabetes, and skin disorders that produce breaks in the skin, such as fungal foot disease, dry skin, or insect bites. The only treatment shown to reduce the risk of recurrence is long-term, low-dose antibiotics. However, this strategy has not been widely implemented due to growing pressures to reduce antibiotic prescribing amidst fears of antibiotic resistance and possible side effects.

The risk of further episodes may also be reduced by using emollients to prevent dry, cracked skin, checking for and treating tinea pedis, and managing lymphoedema with compression garments. There has been limited research into the role of skincare in preventing cellulitis, but a role for dry skin has been hypothesized. Regular application of emollient has been shown to reduce dry skin, potentially playing a role in prevention.

### Lower limb cellulitis and its mimics: Part I. Lower limb cellulitis [^115JcYR7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

An aging population and obesity have both contributed to a rising incidence of lower limb cellulitis. The most important predisposing factors include older age, obesity, venous insufficiency, saphenous venectomy, and edema. Streptococci are the most commonly implicated pathogen and often reside in the interdigital toe spaces. Any disruption of the skin surface can allow the organism to invade. Effective management requires an appropriate antibiotic and attention to the predisposing factors. This article summarizes the epidemiology and treatment of this common infection.

Regarding specific circumstances for cellulitis, particularly in patients with febrile neutropenia (persistent or recurrent episodes), the IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining blood cultures and cultures of skin lesions through culture aspiration, biopsy, or surgical excision in these patients. This is because their infections may be caused by resistant microbes, yeast, or molds. It is important to recognize that the sensitivity of a single-serum fungal antigen test (such as 1,3-β-D-glucan or galactomannan tests) is low in patients receiving antifungal agents. Furthermore, the benefits from laboratory tests for fungal antigen or DNA detection remain inconsistent.

### Recurrent unilateral cellulitis: Is it May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) [^117DPquV]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) is a differential diagnosis to be considered in a patient with recurrent unilateral cellulitis. A 73-year-old woman initially presented with recurrent unilateral cellulitis of her left lower limb. A CT scan demonstrated a stenosed left common iliac vein (CIV) narrowed at its origin by the proximal right common iliac artery, consistent with MTS. The chronicity of the condition at the time of diagnosis made attempts to recanalize the CIV unsuccessful. A diagnosis of MTS should be considered in a patient with chronic unilateral limb edema or cellulitis as it represents a potentially treatable condition if detected early.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^111kKWVP]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis can be a difficult diagnosis to make. Furthermore, 31% of patients admitted from the emergency department with suspected lower-limb cellulitis have been misdiagnosed, with incorrect treatment potentially resulting in avoidable hospital admission and the prescription of unnecessary antibiotics.

We sought to identify diagnostic criteria or tools that have been developed for lower-limb cellulitis. A systematic review was conducted using Ovidand Embase databases in May 2018, with the aim of describing diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis. The quality of the studies identified was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool, and all types of studies describing diagnostic criteria or tools were included.

Eight observational studies were included in the review.

- **Biochemical markers**: Five studies examined biochemical markers.

- **Imaging**: Two studies assessed imaging.

- **Diagnostic decision model**: One study developed a diagnostic decision model. All eight studies were considered to have a high risk for bias in at least one domain. The quantity and quality of available data were low, and results could not be pooled due to the heterogeneity of the findings.

There is a lack of high-quality publications describing criteria or tools for diagnosing lower-limb cellulitis. Future studies using prospective designs, validated in both primary and secondary care settings, are needed.

What's already known about this topic? Diagnosing lower-limb cellulitis on first presentation is challenging.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^114AUZTk]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methodological quality**:

	- **Risk of bias**: The risk of bias for patient selection was high for all eight studies. Six of them used a case–control method, and the exclusion criteria in two studies were inappropriate as they excluded patients more difficult to diagnose. The study by Shin et al. had a low risk of bias for the index test since it included a prespecified threshold, whereas the other seven studies did not. The reference standard in the study by Rabuka et al. was considered high risk because some patients received the reference test after the index test, thereby increasing the risk of observer bias. The risk was unclear in the remaining seven studies due to indeterminate accuracy in cellulitis diagnosis. The flow of timing was unclear in these seven studies as it was not stated whether all patients received the same reference standard test. The study by Fleischer et al. presented a high risk because not all patients were analyzed.

	- **Risk of bias assessment**: Assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies‐2 diagnostic accuracy critical appraisal tool. This tool showed the risk of bias for each domain in individual studies.

	- **Graphical representation**: Figure 2 displays the percentage of studies with low, high, or unclear risk of bias for each of the four domains.

### Utility of inflammatory markers in hospitalized children with skin erythema [^113mPavE]. Hospital Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

There is overlap in the clinical presentations of superficial skin infections (e.g. cellulitis) and deeper infections (e.g. osteomyelitis). Inflammatory markers are frequently obtained in hospitalized patients with cellulitis; however, it is unknown whether inflammatory markers discriminate between superficial and deeper infections.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective review of children hospitalized with erythema on the skin and diagnoses of cellulitis, bursitis, myositis, osteomyelitis, and/or tenosynovitis. Patients were grouped into superficial infection (cellulitis and bursitis) and deeper infection (myositis, tenosynovitis, osteomyelitis). We compared C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) values between the two groups and constructed receiver operating characteristic curves to determine optimal cutoff values.

- **Results**: Among 168 children hospitalized with skin erythema, 122 patients had superficial infections and 46 patients had deeper infections. Mean CRP and ESR were significantly higher in patients with deeper infections (CRP: 8.3 [± 9.6] mg/dL versus 2.8 [± 3.5] mg/dL; P < .001; ESR: 48.3 [± 28.6] mm/h versus 21.8 [± 16.0] mm/h; P < .001). Neither WBC count nor fever was significantly different between the groups. CRP ≥ 2 mg/dL and ESR ≥ 30 mm/h were associated with deeper infections (CRP: odds ratio: 4.77; 95% confidence interval: 2.24–10.15; ESR: odds ratio: 7.93; 95% confidence interval: 3.46–17.67). When CRP and ESR were below these cutoffs, the negative predictive value was 89%.

- **Conclusions**: Among patients presenting with skin erythema, CRP ≥ 2 mg/dL and ESR ≥ 30 mm/h were associated with deeper infections, highlighting the utility of these inflammatory markers in differentiating between superficial and deeper infections.

### A case of progressive lower leg edema [^116x7tw2]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Based on the clinical presentation and histology, what is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Lipodermatosclerosis – Incorrect. Although lipodermatosclerosis is a diagnostic consideration in our patient's clinical presentation, CD31 and human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) positivity indicate KS. Interestingly, there are increasing reports of KS mimicking other clinical and histologic entities, including lymphangioma-like KS, pyogenic granuloma–like KS, lipodermatosclerosis–like KS, and ecchymotic KS.

B. Lymphedema – Incorrect. Our patient has woody, nonpitting edema, which is characteristic of lymphedema, but the findings of CD31 and HHV-8 positivity in the neoplastic capillaries are diagnostic of KS. Therefore, our patient's lymphedema is a complication of his KS.

C. Stasis dermatitis – Incorrect. Stasis dermatitis is an intensely pruritic, eczematous disorder related to chronic venous insufficiency. Our patient does not complain of significant pruritus, and CD31 and HHV-8 should not be positive in stasis dermatitis. Interestingly, there are several reports of KS arising in the setting of arterial, venous, or lymphatic insufficiency with associated stasis dermatitis–like changes.

D. Kaposi sarcoma – Correct. The development of a new patch on the thigh at the 6-month follow-up and the histologic findings of a patchy capillary proliferation in a tiered distribution are suggestive of KS. CD31 and HHV-8 immunohistochemical stains are positive in the neoplastic cells, supporting the diagnosis of KS.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^116mEAXB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The term "non-necrotizing cellulitis" is used to incorporate two entities: erysipelas and cellulitis, which are diffusely spreading skin infections not associated with suppurative foci. A fine distinction exists between erysipelas and cellulitis: erysipelas has a clear line of demarcation between involved and uninvolved tissue, with lesions raised above the surrounding normal skin. In contrast, cellulitis involves deeper layers of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue and has less distinctive features than erysipelas.

These infections are commonly caused by streptococcal species, usually beta-hemolytic streptococci, primarily group A. Staphylococcus aureus rarely causes erysipelas and cellulitis; however, such infections are typically more suppurative and less diffuse. Superficial, non-necrotizing infections caused by certain strains of Group A Streptococcal (GAS) may be associated with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, characterized by rapid progression of septic shock and organ failure. The recent dramatic increase in community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) complicates the empiric treatment of staphylococcal infections.

Diagnostic studies have a low yield in patients with superficial soft tissue infections and typically do not aid in diagnosis. However, it is of considerable importance to establish whether cellulitis represents signs of a deeper and/or more severe infectious process, as most necrotizing soft tissue infections are initially diagnosed as cellulitis. Lack of clinical response might be due to unusual organisms, resistant strains of staphylococcus or streptococcus, or deeper processes.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^114AhEfn]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and associated subcutaneous tissue, with 60% of cases affecting the lower limb. Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis that presents with more marked superficial inflammation.

The diagnosis of cellulitis can be challenging, with 31% of patients who present with suspected lower-limb cellulitis in the emergency department (ED) subsequently being given a diagnosis other than cellulitis. Routine biochemical and hematological blood tests and blood cultures are not specific for cellulitis, which results in avoidable hospital admissions and unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics. Definitive diagnostic criteria could potentially improve clinical care and also enhance the validity of clinical research on cellulitis by ensuring appropriate case definition. However, there are currently no agreed diagnostic criteria for cellulitis.

Patients with cellulitis commonly present to primary care services or the ED. A recent U.K. cellulitis research priority setting partnership ranked questions on 'diagnostic criteria' as important for future cellulitis research.

The aim of this systematic review was to identify and conduct a critical appraisal of the quality of studies that have developed or validated diagnostic criteria or tools for lower-limb cellulitis. We define diagnostic criteria or tools as the inclusion of a minimum of one variable that has been tested against at least one clinical feature. In this paper, 'cellulitis' refers to lower-limb cellulitis only. Lower-limb erysipelas is included as it is clinically indistinguishable.

### Inpatient dermatology consultation aids diagnosis of cellulitis among hospitalized patients: A multi-institutional analysis [^115gTpen]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Given its nonspecific physical examination findings, accurately distinguishing cellulitis from a cellulitis mimicker (pseudocellulitis) is challenging.

- **Objective**: We sought to investigate the national incidence of cellulitis misdiagnosis among inpatients.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of inpatient dermatology consultations at Massachusetts General Hospital, University of Alabama at Birmingham Medical Center, University of California Los Angeles Medical Center, and University of California San Francisco Medical Center in 2008. All consults requested for the evaluation of cellulitis were included. The primary outcomes were determining the incidence of cellulitis misdiagnosis, evaluating the prevalence of associated risk factors, and identifying common pseudocellulitides.

- **Results**: Of the 1430 inpatient dermatology consultations conducted in 2008, 74 (5.17%) were requested for the evaluation of cellulitis. In all, 55 (74.32%) patients evaluated for cellulitis were given a diagnosis of pseudocellulitis. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of misdiagnosis across institutions (P = .12). Patient demographics and associated risk factor prevalence did not statistically vary in patients given a diagnosis of cellulitis versus those with pseudocellulitis (P > .05).

- **Limitations**: This study was unable to evaluate all patients admitted with cellulitis and was conducted at tertiary care centers, which may affect the generalizability of the results.

- **Conclusions**: Cellulitis is commonly misdiagnosed in the inpatient setting.

### Effect of dermatology consultation on outcomes for patients with presumed cellulitis: A randomized clinical trial [^1114XDHs]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). High credibility.

Each year, cellulitis leads to 650,000 hospital admissions and is estimated to cost $3.7 billion in the United States. Previous literature has demonstrated a high misdiagnosis rate for cellulitis, which results in unnecessary antibiotic use and increased health care costs.

To determine whether dermatologic consultation decreases the duration of hospital stay or intravenous antibiotic treatment duration in patients with cellulitis, this randomized clinical trial was conducted in a large urban tertiary care hospital between October 2012 and January 2017, with a 1-month follow-up duration. Patients were randomized to the control group, which received the standard of care (i.e. treatment by the primary medicine team), or the intervention group, which received dermatology consultation. Medical chart review of demographic information and hospital courses was performed. Adult patients hospitalized with a presumed diagnosis of cellulitis were eligible. A total of 1300 patients were screened, 1125 were excluded, and 175 were included. Statistical analysis was employed to identify significant outcome differences between the two groups.

- **Interventions**: Dermatology consultation within 24 hours of hospitalization.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Length of hospital stay and duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment.

Results indicated that of the 175 participants, 70 (40%) were women and 105 (60%) were men. The mean age was 58.8 years. Length of hospital stay was not statistically different between the two groups. The duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment was less than four days.

### Cellulitis and erysipelas [^117YVujD]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common problem caused by spreading bacterial inflammation of the skin, with redness, pain, and lymphangitis. Up to 40% of affected people experience systemic illness. Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis characterized by marked superficial inflammation, typically affecting the lower limbs and the face. The most common pathogens in adults are streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Both cellulitis and erysipelas can result in local necrosis and abscess formation. About a quarter of affected people experience more than one episode of cellulitis within three years.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for cellulitis and erysipelas? What are the effects of treatments to prevent the recurrence of cellulitis and erysipelas? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2007. Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review. We included harms alerts from relevant organizations like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 14 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, and comparative effects of different antibiotics.

### Is it necrotizing fasciitis or necrotizing cellulitis after varicella zoster infection? Two case reports [^111ZkVUT]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis and necrotizing cellulitis are serious cutaneous complications in varicella patients. Differentiation of necrotizing cellulitis from necrotizing fasciitis can initially be challenging due to the indistinct clinical course at the onset of infection and the lack of definitive diagnostic criteria. This paper reports on two children with necrotizing cellulitis that developed following a varicella infection to draw the attention of health care providers to necrotizing cellulitis, which showed a slower clinical course than necrotizing fasciitis and recovered with conservative treatment approaches without aggressive surgical intervention.
