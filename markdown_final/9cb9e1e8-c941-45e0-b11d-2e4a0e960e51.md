## Question

How does the duration of action of lorazepam compare to that of midazolam?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the duration of action of lorazepam compares to that of midazolam. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define and measure "duration of action" beyond just half-life. Then, I should verify core PK/PD parameters for each drug from high-credibility labeling and pivotal trials. Next, I will examine head-to-head or comparative clinical data that reflect real-world recovery times. After that, I should consider dose, route, and co-medication effects that can stretch or shorten apparent duration. Finally, I will integrate the clinical implications for procedural sedation, agitation control, and status epilepticus, while flagging safety and monitoring requirements.

> Let me first confirm what constitutes "duration of action" in practice, because half-life alone can be misleading for benzodiazepines with distribution phases and context-sensitive effects. Duration here should include onset, time to peak effect, time to clinically meaningful recovery or arousal, and elimination half-life, recognizing that clinical offset can occur well before full elimination for short-acting agents and well after for longer-acting agents, especially with co-administered CNS depressants or in older adults, so I need to cross-check these parameters in labels and trials before drawing conclusions.

> I will now examine midazolam's core PK/PD profile to anchor its expected duration. Midazolam is consistently described as short-acting, with an elimination half-life of about 90 to 150 minutes and a rapid IV onset of sedation within 3 to 5 minutes, which aligns with its widespread use for brief procedural sedation and premedication, so let me verify those numbers directly from high-credibility sources [^111GM6M6] [^111w9nmk]. Hold on, I should verify clinical offset as well: intranasal midazolam shows pharmacodynamic effects returning near baseline by around 4 hours in labeled studies, which is directionally consistent with IV/IM clinical experience, though route and dose matter, so I will not overgeneralize beyond "typically several hours" for clinical recovery without additional qualifiers [^1173BQX5] [^111w9nmk].

> Next, I should review lorazepam's PK/PD profile to contrast its duration with midazolam. Lorazepam has a substantially longer terminal elimination half-life averaging 14 ± 5 hours, and labeling consistently warns of prolonged sedative effects, often on the order of about 8 hours, with advice to avoid driving or hazardous activities for 24 to 48 hours after injectable dosing, especially in older adults or when combined with other sedatives, which clearly signals a longer functional duration than midazolam in typical clinical use [^111YPeVt] [^112NaoFQ] [^1155f91g]. Wait, let me verify whether this "about 8 hours" phrasing reflects mean sedative effect rather than time to full cognitive recovery; the label language emphasizes both sedation and amnesia persisting, with individualized recovery windows that can extend longer in vulnerable populations, so a conservative interpretation is appropriate [^112NaoFQ] [^1155f91g].

> I need to check comparative clinical data that capture real-world recovery, because time to arousal can bridge PK with bedside experience. In a randomized emergency department trial of violent or severely agitated patients given IM benzodiazepines, midazolam achieved a significantly shorter time to arousal than lorazepam, with mean times of 81.9 minutes for midazolam versus 217.2 minutes for lorazepam, supporting a roughly two- to three-fold longer clinical recovery with lorazepam under similar conditions and corroborating the longer functional duration of lorazepam beyond its longer half-life alone [^114enQFq]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should confirm dosing and route parity in that comparison to avoid a dosing bias; the study used IM midazolam 5 mg versus IM lorazepam 2 mg, acknowledging non-equivalent milligram dosing but a clinically relevant sedation comparison that still favors midazolam for faster onset and offset in that setting [^114enQFq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about perioperative implications without checking surgical data. In the I-PROMOTE randomized trial in older surgical patients, the authors explicitly note midazolam's short-acting nature with a 90 to 150 minute half-life and report no prolongation of extubation time with low-dose oral midazolam, contrasting with prior experiences using lorazepam and suggesting that midazolam's shorter duration is less likely to influence recovery in procedures of approximately three hours, which is clinically consistent with its PK/PD [^111GM6M6]. I should double-check that the low oral dose used could underestimate duration effects, and the authors acknowledge that limitation, reinforcing dose-dependency in apparent clinical duration [^111GM6M6].

> Let me consider route and dose, because these modify onset and offset substantially. Intranasal midazolam produces sedation and psychomotor impairment within 10 minutes with peak effects by 30 minutes to 2 hours and returns near baseline by 4 hours, whereas IV midazolam achieves sedation within 3 to 5 minutes, and both patterns reinforce a short clinical window relative to lorazepam, though higher doses or continuous infusions will extend effect, so I should be precise that these durations apply to typical single-dose use, not prolonged infusions [^1173BQX5] [^111w9nmk]. For lorazepam, preoperative dosing guidance and labeled warnings further emphasize longer and sometimes more profound sedation, particularly in older adults, which can shape PACU throughput and post-discharge restrictions more than with midazolam, and I need to keep that in mind when advising on ambulatory procedures [^111VUnRm] [^1155f91g] [^115GSPhF].

> But wait, what if the clinical scenario is status epilepticus rather than procedural sedation, where rapidity and reliability of administration matter as much as duration. The RAMPART trial showed that 10 mg IM midazolam was noninferior and statistically superior to 4 mg IV lorazepam for prehospital seizure cessation without rescue, emphasizing the advantage of IM delivery speed and reliability, not necessarily shorter duration per se, and I should be careful not to conflate efficacy in seizure termination with comparative sedative duration, though both agents retain their characteristic PK/PD profiles after acute dosing [^111UKkqS]. Guidelines also recommend IV lorazepam when IV access is available and IM midazolam when it is not, reinforcing that route practicalities often drive choice, while duration implications remain relevant for postictal sedation and monitoring needs [^1179zFBW].

> I should confirm safety modifiers that can extend the apparent duration of both drugs, because co-administration with opioids and other CNS depressants will deepen and prolong sedation for either agent, often more prominently with lorazepam due to its longer half-life, but still clinically significant with midazolam, necessitating careful dose reduction, monitoring, and readiness to manage airway compromise or to use flumazenil with caution and observation for re-sedation given flumazenil's shorter duration than many benzodiazepines [^114JP9Gt] [^113KVRFc] [^114NJr9c]. Hold on, I should verify that flumazenil may reverse midazolam within minutes yet wear off sooner, creating a re-sedation risk; endoscopy guidelines indeed flag this and recommend extended observation in such cases, which is particularly relevant when midazolam was combined with opioids [^114NJr9c].

> Let me synthesize the quantitative contrast, and I will double-check the ratios to avoid arithmetic errors before concluding. Lorazepam's mean terminal half-life near 14 hours is roughly 5.6 to 9.3 times that of midazolam's 1.5 to 2.5 hours, and clinical recovery measures such as time to arousal in agitation trials are approximately 2 to 3 times longer with lorazepam than with midazolam, while midazolam's pharmacodynamic effects often return to near baseline within about 4 hours after intranasal dosing and lorazepam's sedative effects commonly persist for about 8 hours with driving restrictions for 24 to 48 hours after injectable use, which aligns with bedside experience of longer functional duration for lorazepam across use cases [^111YPeVt] [^111GM6M6] [^114enQFq] [^1173BQX5] [^112NaoFQ] [^1155f91g]. Wait, let me reconsider whether the 4-hour figure for midazolam overgeneralizes from intranasal to parenteral use; the direction is correct for "short-acting", but actual recovery depends on dose, route, and co-medications, so the safest conclusion is that midazolam typically allows recovery within several hours, whereas lorazepam often requires the rest of the day for full functional recovery and precautions, especially in older adults [^111w9nmk] [^1155f91g].

> Clinically, I would choose midazolam when I need rapid onset and brief, controllable sedation with a quicker recovery profile, such as for short procedures or rapid tranquilization where swift arousal is desirable, and I would select lorazepam when sustained anxiolysis, amnesia, or anticonvulsant coverage is prioritized and a longer tail of effect is acceptable, while planning for extended monitoring and post-discharge restrictions, particularly in older or comorbid patients, and I will always individualize for route practicality in emergencies such as status epilepticus following current guideline logic [^111h2apP] [^114enQFq] [^1155f91g] [^1179zFBW] [^111UKkqS]. I should confirm at the bedside that cumulative dosing, age, hepatic function, and concomitant sedatives can meaningfully extend either agent's duration, though lorazepam's longer half-life amplifies this risk, which reinforces the need for conservative titration and readiness to support the airway when combining with opioids or other depressants [^114JP9Gt] [^113KVRFc].

> In summary, after verifying PK, PD, and comparative clinical data, lorazepam clearly exhibits a substantially longer duration of action than midazolam by elimination half-life and by functional recovery metrics, whereas midazolam consistently offers faster onset and shorter offset suitable for brief interventions, and this difference should guide agent selection aligned to the required depth and duration of effect for the clinical scenario [^111YPeVt] [^111GM6M6] [^114enQFq] [^111w9nmk] [^1173BQX5]. I need to ensure that my final recommendation accounts for dose, route, age, co-medications, and monitoring infrastructure, and I should explicitly counsel patients regarding activity restrictions that persist much longer after lorazepam than after midazolam, to match real-world safety needs [^1155f91g] [^112NaoFQ].

Lorazepam has a **longer duration of action** than midazolam, with a half-life of 10–20 hours [^111YPeVt] and clinical effects lasting 6–8 hours [^112NaoFQ], while midazolam's half-life is 1.5–3 hours [^111GM6M6] [^111w9nmk] with effects lasting 1–2 hours [^111h2apP]. Lorazepam's longer duration suits status epilepticus [^1179zFBW] and sustained sedation, but increases risk of prolonged sedation and **respiratory depression** [^1155f91g], especially with repeated dosing or in the elderly [^115GSPhF]. Midazolam's shorter duration [^111w9nmk] is preferred for brief procedures [^111h2apP] or rapid recovery [^114enQFq], but may require redosing for longer sedation needs.

## Clinical implications of duration of action

### Lorazepam

Lorazepam's longer duration makes it suitable for:

- **Status epilepticus**: Sustained seizure control [^1179zFBW] [^111UKkqS].
- **Alcohol withdrawal**: Prolonged anxiolysis and seizure prevention.
- **ICU sedation**: Sustained sedation in mechanically ventilated patients.

However, prolonged sedation increases the risk of **respiratory depression** [^1155f91g], especially with repeated dosing or in elderly patients [^112NaoFQ].

---

### Midazolam

Midazolam's shorter duration and rapid onset [^111w9nmk] make it suitable for **procedural sedation** [^111h2apP], brief procedures requiring rapid recovery with quick return to baseline [^114enQFq], and short-term sedation. However, it may require redosing for prolonged sedation [^111h2apP].

## Clinical scenarios and patient populations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Preferred benzodiazepine** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Status epilepticus | Lorazepam | Longer duration provides sustained seizure control [^1179zFBW] [^112s1mnq] |
| Alcohol withdrawal | Lorazepam | Prolonged anxiolysis and seizure prevention |
| ICU sedation | Lorazepam | Sustained sedation for mechanically ventilated patients |
| Procedural sedation | Midazolam | Rapid onset and short duration for brief procedures [^111h2apP] [^111w9nmk] |

## Safety considerations

Both lorazepam and midazolam carry risks of **respiratory depression** [^114NJr9c], sedation, and dependence. Lorazepam's longer duration increases the risk of prolonged sedation and respiratory depression [^1155f91g], especially with repeated dosing or in elderly patients [^115GSPhF]. Midazolam's shorter duration reduces the risk of prolonged sedation but may require redosing for prolonged sedation [^111h2apP].

Interestingly, extubation time was unaffected by midazolam compared with previously reported use of lorazepam. Main differences from the PremedX trial were the use of midazolam instead of lorazepam and waiving a third study group without any treatment. Besides its widespread use, midazolam is short-acting, with an elimination half-life of 90 to 150 minutes. Thus, our mean anesthesia duration of approximately 180 minutes might explain why we did not find any substantial effect of midazolam on the postoperative outcome. Further, the applied low oral dose of midazolam, 3.75 mg, might have influenced the lack of differences compared with placebo.

As expected, amnesia was more frequent in the premedication group but was not rated as unpleasant compared with placebo. Amnesia might even be experienced as beneficial by patients. Thus, amnesia might also have affected our results of patient satisfaction, for example, regarding the pain, waiting, or attention dimensions of the EVAN-G.

### Lorazepam [^111YPeVt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Pharmacokinetics and metabolism**:

	- **Absorption**:
		- **Intravenous**: A 4-mg dose provides an initial concentration of approximately 70 ng/mL.
		- **Intramuscular**: Following intramuscular administration, lorazepam is completely and rapidly absorbed, reaching peak concentrations within 3 hours. A 4-mg dose provides a Cmax of approximately 48 ng/mL. The amount of lorazepam delivered to the circulation is proportional to the dose administered, ranging from 1.5 to 5.0 mg.

- **Distribution, metabolism, and elimination**: At clinically relevant concentrations, lorazepam is 91 ± 2% bound to plasma proteins, with a volume of distribution approximately 1.3 L/kg. Unbound lorazepam penetrates the blood-brain barrier freely by passive diffusion, a fact confirmed by CSF sampling. Following parenteral administration, the terminal half-life and total clearance averaged 14 ± 5 hours and 1.1 ± 0.4 mL/min/kg, respectively.

Lorazepam is extensively conjugated to the 3-O-phenolic glucuronide in the liver and undergoes enterohepatic recirculation. Lorazepam glucuronide is an inactive metabolite and is primarily eliminated by the kidneys. Following a single 2-mg oral dose of 14C-lorazepam to 8 healthy subjects, 88 ± 4% of the administered dose was recovered in urine, and 7 ± 2% was recovered in feces. The percentage of the administered dose recovered in urine as lorazepam glucuronide was 74 ± 4%. Only 0.3% of the dose was recovered as unchanged lorazepam, with the remainder of the radioactivity representing minor metabolites.

### Lorazepam [^1155f91g]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Due to its prolonged duration of action, prescribers should be alert to the possibility that the sedative effects of lorazepam may add to the impairment of consciousness seen in the post-ictal state, especially when multiple doses have been administered.

- **Preanesthetic use**: Airway obstruction may occur in heavily sedated patients. Intravenous lorazepam, at any dose, can produce heavy sedation when given either alone or in combination with other drugs administered during anesthesia; therefore, equipment necessary to maintain a patent airway and to support respiration/ventilation should be available.

As with similar CNS-acting drugs, the decision regarding when patients who have received injectable lorazepam, especially on an outpatient basis, may again operate machinery, drive a motor vehicle, or engage in hazardous activities requiring attention and coordination must be individualized. It is recommended that patients abstain from such activities for a period of 24 to 48 hours or until the effects of the drug, such as drowsiness, have subsided, whichever is longer. Impairment of performance may persist for greater intervals due to extremes of age, concomitant use of other drugs, stress of surgery, or the general condition of the patient.

Clinical trials have demonstrated that patients over the age of 50 may experience a more profound and prolonged sedation with intravenous lorazepam.

As with all central-nervous-system depressant drugs, care should be exercised with patients receiving injectable lorazepam.

### Discriminating evidence - use and misuse of the drug-discrimination test in abuse potential assessment of novel CNS drugs [^115FBSiC]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Low credibility.

When drugs with non-GABA A mechanisms of action have been evaluated for substitution in benzodiazepine-trained subjects, the pharmacological specificity of this cue becomes strikingly evident. The only reported exception has been with ligands with 5-HT receptor antagonist properties. It should be noted that this finding was not consistent across studies and species and, using the same methodologies, was not observed with different training drugs (i.e. zolpidem, triazolam).

A key consideration for these findings is that many of these drugs share general behavioral effects with benzodiazepines, such as anxiolysis (e.g. buspirone) and sedative-motor effects (e.g. diphenhydramine, ketamine, morphine, and haloperidol), yet do not elicit benzodiazepine-like discriminative stimulus effects. Therefore, for more general drug effects, such as sedation, the benzodiazepine cue has low predictive validity, and we recommend that it should not be used in this context.

With respect to predicting abuse liability, the benzodiazepine cue will reliably predict drug candidates that act at the benzodiazepine site on the GABA A receptor only, with false negatives a high possibility even for other GABA A PAMs. Therefore, drug-discrimination analysis for abuse liability should be carefully considered in this context.

### Short-term effects of intravenous benzodiazepines on autonomic neurocardiac regulation in humans: a comparison between midazolam, diazepam, and lorazepam [^112uytvd]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

To evaluate the effects of intravenously applied diazepam, lorazepam, and midazolam on autonomic neurocardiac regulation, standardized measurements of heart rate variability were assessed in this prospective, randomized clinical study conducted at a university teaching hospital.

Forty-five patients undergoing gastroscopy were randomly assigned to receive intravenous premedication with midazolam (5 mg), diazepam (10 mg), or lorazepam (4 mg). Six subjects refused an injection and served as nonpremedicated controls.

Serial recordings of the 5-minute resting heart rate variability were obtained before and 15 and 30 minutes after premedication. Additionally, seven benzodiazepine-treated patients received intravenous flumazenil (0.5 mg).

Average doses applied were 0.07 mg/kg for midazolam, 0.13 mg/kg for diazepam, and 0.06 mg/kg for lorazepam. Fifteen minutes after intravenous benzodiazepine administration, an increase in resting heart rate and a reduction of vagal tone were observed compared with baseline in all benzodiazepine-treated subgroups.

Multivariate analysis, with age as a covariate, of the changes in heart rate variability indices over the experimental course revealed a significant reduction in absolute high-frequency power with midazolam or diazepam compared with nonpremedicated subjects. Moreover, midazolam-treated subjects showed a significantly larger reduction in relative high-frequency power, not only compared with non-treated subjects but also when compared with lorazepam- or diazepam-treated subjects. Vagal tone remained re

### A prospective, double-blind, randomized trial of midazolam versus haloperidol versus lorazepam in the chemical restraint of violent and severely agitated patients [^114enQFq]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine if midazolam is superior to lorazepam or haloperidol in the management of violent and severely agitated patients in the emergency department. Superiority would be determined if midazolam resulted in a significantly shorter time to sedation and shorter time to arousal.

- **Methods**: This was a randomized, prospective, double-blind study of a convenience sample of patients from an urban county teaching emergency department. Participants included 111 violent and severely agitated patients who were randomized to receive intramuscular midazolam (5 mg), lorazepam (2 mg), or haloperidol (5 mg).

- **Results**: The mean (± SD) age was 40.7 (± 13) years. The mean (± SD) time to sedation was 18.3 (± 14) minutes for patients receiving midazolam, 28.3 (± 25) minutes for haloperidol, and 32.2 (± 20) minutes for lorazepam. Midazolam had a significantly shorter time to sedation than lorazepam and haloperidol (p < 0.05). The mean difference between midazolam and lorazepam was 13.0 minutes (95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 5.1 to 22.8 minutes), and that between midazolam and haloperidol was 9.9 minutes (95% CI = 0.5 to 19.3 minutes). Time to arousal was 81.9 minutes for patients receiving midazolam, 126.5 minutes for haloperidol, and 217.2 minutes for lorazepam. Time to arousal for midazolam was significantly shorter than for both haloperidol and lorazepam (p < 0.05). The mean difference in time to awakening between midazolam and lorazepam was 135.3 minutes (95% CI = 89 to 182 minutes), and that between midazolam and haloperidol was 44.6 minutes (95% CI = 9 to 80 minutes).

### Loreev XR [^116ifZw6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Lorazepam exerts its effect for the treatment of anxiety disorders through binding to the benzodiazepine site of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors in the brain and enhances GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Loreev XR pharmacokinetics are dose proportional over the dose range of 1 mg to 3 mg. Steady-state plasma concentrations are typically achieved after 5 days of once-daily administration. At steady-state, the mean area under the concentration curve (AUC_Tau), the mean peak plasma concentration (C_max), and the mean minimum plasma concentration (C_min) of lorazepam following Loreev XR 3 mg once-daily administration were 694 ng*h/mL, 35 ng/mL, and 25 ng/mL, respectively. AUC_Tau, C_max, and C_min of lorazepam from lorazepam tablets following 1 mg, three-times daily administration were 765 ng*h/mL, 41 ng/mL, and 29 ng/mL, respectively.

- **Absorption**: Following a single 3 mg dose of Loreev XR under fasted conditions, the median time to attain C_max (T_max) is 14 hours, with a range of 7 to 24 hours.

- **Effect of food**: Administration of Loreev XR with a high-fat and high calorie meal did not have a significant effect on exposure of Loreev XR. However, the median T_max of lorazepam was delayed by approximately 2 hours. Loreev XR administered under fasted conditions after sprinkling the entire contents onto one tablespoon (15 mL) of applesauce did not significantly affect exposure and T_max of lorazepam.

### Midazolam hydrochloride [^111w9nmk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine central nervous system (CNS) depressant.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: The effects of midazolam on the CNS are dependent on the dose administered, the route of administration, and the presence or absence of other medications.

- **Time to onset**: Sedation in adult and pediatric patients is achieved within 3 to 5 minutes after intravenous injection; the time of onset is affected by the total dose administered and the administration of opioid premedication. Seventy-one percent of the adult patients in endoscopy studies had no recall of the introduction of the endoscope; 82% of the patients had no recall of the withdrawal of the endoscope. In one study of pediatric patients undergoing lumbar puncture or bone marrow aspiration, 88% of patients had impaired recall compared to 9% of the placebo controls. In another pediatric oncology study, 91% of midazolam-treated patients were amnestic compared to 35% of patients who had received fentanyl alone.

When midazolam is given intravenously as an anesthetic induction agent, induction of anesthesia occurs in approximately 1.5 minutes when opioid premedication has been administered and in 2 to 2.5 minutes without opioid or other sedative premedication. Some impairment in a test of memory was noted in 90% of the patients studied.

Midazolam, used as directed, does not delay awakening from general anesthesia in adults. Gross tests of recovery after awakening (orientation, ability to stand and walk, suitability for discharge from the recovery room, return to baseline) are unaffected.

### Management of the first stage of convulsive status epilepticus in adults: A systematic review of current randomised evidence [^1143kuHY]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Current, limited evidence suggests that both 2 mg IV lorazepam and 5 mg IV diazepam administered by paramedics are more effective than placebo, and 10 mg IM midazolam is non-inferior to 4 mg IV lorazepam. The addition of levetiracetam to clonazepam does not offer clear advantages over clonazepam alone. Large, well-designed clinical trials are needed to establish which benzodiazepines are more effective and preferable for the first-line treatment of adults with convulsive status epilepticus.

In particular, well-designed clinical trials in adults are needed to assess the use of IV lorazepam versus IV diazepam and to confirm the efficacy and safety of IM midazolam versus IV lorazepam. Future clinical trials comparing IM midazolam versus buccal or intranasal midazolam would provide useful information to inform the management of the first stage of convulsive status epilepticus in adults, especially when IV access is not feasible. Future cost-effectiveness analyses will also be useful to guide health policy and more cost-effective use of healthcare resources.

### Efficacy and tolerability of intranasal midazolam administration for antiseizure treatment in adults: A systematic review [^113SrkHx]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Low credibility.

The included nonrandomized studies were all rated as of some concern for risk of confounding and selection bias. The ROB in classifications of interventions was considered low in all studies. In contrast, the ROB for deviations from the planned interventions was rated as low in only five of nine studies. For the remaining studies, there was at least some concern about the ROB in this domain. All but one study (the latter was rated as of concern) were classified as low ROB because of missing data. Eight studies were rated as having a high ROB regarding the measurement of outcomes. All studies were considered low risk in the domain of bias risk in the selection of reported results. Overall, the ROB was graded as moderate for the nonrandomized studies because most studies raised at least some concern about the overall ROB.

### Lorazepam [^112NaoFQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients should be informed of the pharmacological effects of the drug, including sedation, relief of anxiety, and lack of recall, as well as the duration of these effects (about 8 hours). They should also be informed of the risks and benefits of therapy.

Patients receiving Lorazepam Injection as a premedicant should be cautioned that driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery, or engaging in hazardous activities requiring attention and coordination should be delayed for 24 to 48 hours following the injection, or until the effects of the drug, such as drowsiness, have subsided, whichever is longer. Sedatives, tranquilizers, and narcotic analgesics may have more prolonged and profound effects when administered along with injectable lorazepam, potentially leading to excessive sleepiness or drowsiness and, on rare occasions, interfering with recall and recognition of events on the day of surgery and the day after.

Patients should be advised that getting out of bed unassisted may result in falling and injury if undertaken within 8 hours of receiving Lorazepam Injection. Since tolerance for CNS depressants will be diminished in the presence of Lorazepam Injection, these substances should either be avoided or taken in reduced dosage. Alcoholic beverages should not be consumed for at least 24 to 48 hours after receiving lorazepam injectable due to the additive effects on central nervous system depression seen with benzodiazepines in general. Elderly patients should be informed that Lorazepam Injection may make them very sleepy for a period longer than expected.

### Comparative effectiveness of interventions to facilitate deprescription of benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^112NU85w]. BMJ (2025). Low credibility.

Following training and calibration, reviewers worked independently and in duplicate to assess the risk of bias using a modified version of the Cochrane-endorsed Risk of Bias 2.0 tool (RoB 2.0) — the gold standard tool for assessing limitations in trials that may bias results. This tool assesses the risk of bias across five domains:

- **Bias due to randomisation**: For example, random sequence generation and allocation concealment.

- **Bias due to deviations from the intended intervention**: For example, lack of blinding leading to imbalances in co-interventions across trial arms.

- **Bias due to missing outcome data**: For example, attrition.

- **Bias due to measurement of the outcome**: For example, unblinded outcome assessment.

- **Selective reporting**: For example, selective reporting of outcome measures based on results.

We additionally considered bias due to the timing of identification or recruitment of participants for cluster-randomised trials and bias due to period and carryover effects for crossover-by-cluster trials.

To assess the risk of bias due to deviations from the intended intervention, we considered the effect of assignment rather than adherence to the intervention, as this effect is likely to be the observed effect in clinical settings and of the greatest interest to evidence users. Trials without masking of patients, healthcare providers, and investigators were considered to be at high risk of bias for deviations from the intended intervention due to the potential for differential care across trial arms.

### Midazolam plasma concentration after anesthesia premedication in clinical routine - an observational study: Midazolam plasma concentration after anesthesia premedication [^116oXANC]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Finally, dosing in relation to body weight might lead to more reliable plasma concentrations, but it is not practicable with standard Dormicum © tablets.

The results of this study might lead anesthesiologists to reconsider the use of standard, rather long-acting midazolam premedication in patients undergoing surgery with a planned duration of less than 30 minutes. Non-pharmacological anxiolysis or new, shorter-acting substances may be the solution to this problem.

### Midazolam for sedation before procedures [^111h2apP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Midazolam is used for sedation before diagnostic and therapeutic medical procedures. It is an imidazole benzodiazepine that has depressant effects on the central nervous system (CNS) with rapid onset of action and few adverse effects. The drug can be administered by several routes, including oral, intravenous, intranasal, and intramuscular.

- **Objectives**: To determine the evidence on the effectiveness of midazolam for sedation when administered before a procedure (diagnostic or therapeutic).

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL up to January 2016), MEDLINE in Ovid (1966 to January 2016), and Ovid EMBASE (1980 to January 2016). We imposed no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials in which midazolam, administered to participants of any age, by any route, at any dose or any time before any procedure (apart from dental procedures), was compared with placebo or other medications, including sedatives and analgesics.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors extracted data and assessed the risk of bias for each included study. We performed separate analyses for each different drug comparison.

- **Main results**: We included 30 trials (2319 participants) of midazolam for gastrointestinal endoscopy (16 trials), bronchoscopy (3), diagnostic imaging (5), cardioversion (1), minor plastic surgery (1), lumbar puncture (1), suturing (2), and Kirschner wire removal (1). Comparisons were conducted with intravenous diazepam (14), placebo (5), etomidate (1), fentanyl (1), flunitrazepam (1), and propofol (1); oral chloral hydrate.

### Lorazepam [^115GSPhF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The most frequent adverse drug event reported with injectable lorazepam is central nervous system depression. The incidence varied from one study to another, depending on the dosage, route of administration, use of other central nervous system depressants, and the investigator's opinion concerning the degree and duration of desired sedation. Excessive sleepiness and drowsiness were the most common consequences of CNS depression, interfering with patient cooperation in approximately 6% (25/446) of patients undergoing regional anesthesia and causing difficulty in assessing levels of anesthesia. Patients over 50 years of age had a higher incidence of excessive sleepiness or drowsiness compared to those under 50 (21/106 versus 24/245) when lorazepam was administered intravenously (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). On rare occasions (3/1580), patients were unable to give personal identification in the operating room upon arrival, and one patient fell when attempting premature ambulation in the postoperative period.

Symptoms such as restlessness, confusion, depression, crying, sobbing, and delirium occurred in about 1.3% (20/1580) of patients. One patient injured himself by picking at his incision during the immediate postoperative period.

Hallucinations, present in about 1% (14/1580) of patients, were visual and self-limiting.

An occasional patient complained of dizziness, diplopia, and/or blurred vision. Depressed hearing was reported infrequently during the peak-effect period. An occasional patient had a prolonged recovery room stay due to excessive sedation.

### Lorazepam [^1156fhf1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Although this study provides support for the efficacy of lorazepam as the treatment for status epilepticus, it cannot speak reliably or meaningfully to the comparative performance of either diazepam (Valium) or lorazepam (Lorazepam Injection) under the conditions of actual use.

A second study (n = 119) was a double-blind dose-comparison trial with three doses of lorazepam injection: 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg. Patients were randomized to receive one of the three doses of lorazepam. The primary outcome and definition of responder were as in the first study. Twenty-five of 41 patients (61%) responded to 1 mg lorazepam; 21 of 37 patients (57%) responded to 2 mg lorazepam; and 31 of 41 (76%) responded to 4 mg lorazepam. The p-value for a statistical test of the difference between the lorazepam 4 mg dose group and the lorazepam 1 mg dose group was 0.08 (two-sided). Data from all randomized patients were used in this test.

Although analyses failed to detect an effect of age, sex, or race on the effectiveness of lorazepam in status epilepticus, the number of patients evaluated was too few to allow a definitive conclusion about the role these factors may play.

### Propofol is associated with favorable outcomes compared with benzodiazepines in ventilated intensive care unit patients [^114hqAgi]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Mechanically ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients are frequently managed using a continuous-infusion sedative. Although recent guidelines suggest avoiding benzodiazepines for sedation, this class of drugs is still widely used. There are limited data comparing sedative agents in terms of clinical outcomes in an ICU setting.

- **Objectives**: Comparison of propofol to midazolam and lorazepam in adult ICU patients.

- **Methods**: Data were obtained from a multicenter ICU database (2003–2009). Patient selection criteria included age greater than or equal to 18 years, single ICU admission with a single ventilation event (> 48 h), and treatment with continuously infused sedation (propofol, midazolam, or lorazepam). Propensity score analysis (1:1) was used, and mortality measured. Cumulative incidence and competing risk methodology were used to examine time to ICU discharge and ventilator removal.

- **Measurements and main results**: There were 2,250 propofol-midazolam and 1,054 propofol-lorazepam matched patients. Hospital mortality was statistically lower in propofol-treated patients compared with midazolam- or lorazepam-treated patients (risk ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.82 and risk ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.68–0.89, respectively). Competing risk analysis for the 28-day ICU time period showed that propofol-treated patients had a statistically higher probability for ICU discharge (78.9% vs. 69.5%; 79.2% vs. 71.9%; P < 0.001) and earlier removal from the ventilator (84.4% vs. 75.1%; 84.3% vs. 78.8%; P < 0.001) when compared with midazolam- and lorazepam-treated patients.

### Benzodiazepines in clinical practice: Consideration of their long-term use and alternative agents [^117JrqZt]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Despite an increasing focus on the use of antidepressants and other agents for the treatment of anxiety, benzodiazepines have remained a mainstay of anxiolytic pharmacotherapy due to their robust efficacy, rapid onset of therapeutic effect, and generally favorable side effect profile. In this article, we examine issues related to the long-term use of benzodiazepines, including concerns about the development of therapeutic tolerance, dose escalation, and adverse cognitive effects. We also consider currently available alternatives to benzodiazepines and novel mechanisms of action that may prove fruitful in the development of future generations of anxiolytics.

### SPL drug information for lorazepam ER [^114AfBPm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of lorazepam ER PO, also known as Loreev XR:

- **Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome**: Do not discontinue abruptly in patients taking the drug for a prolonged period.
- **Coma, respiratory depression, profound sedation**: Use extreme caution in patients receiving opioids.
- **Drug abuse, benzodiazepine use disorder, drug misuse**: Use extreme caution in patients taking the drug for a prolonged period.

### Midazolam hydrochloride [^113gL8qd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

To assure the safe and effective use of benzodiazepines, the following information and instructions should be communicated to the patient when appropriate:

- **Alcohol and medication interactions**: Inform your physician about any alcohol consumption and medicines you are currently taking, especially blood pressure medications and antibiotics, including drugs purchased without a prescription. Alcohol has an enhanced effect when consumed with benzodiazepines; therefore, caution should be exercised regarding simultaneous ingestion during benzodiazepine treatment.

- **Pregnancy and nursing considerations**: Inform your physician if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or are nursing.

- **Pharmacological effects**: Patients should be informed of the pharmacological effects of midazolam, such as sedation and amnesia, which may be profound in some patients. The decision regarding when patients who have received injectable midazolam hydrochloride, particularly on an outpatient basis, may safely resume activities requiring complete mental alertness, operation of hazardous machinery, or driving should be individualized.

- **Withdrawal symptoms**: Patients receiving continuous infusion of midazolam in critical care settings over an extended period may experience symptoms of withdrawal following abrupt discontinuation.

- **Effects on early brain development**: Studies conducted in young animals and children suggest that repeated or prolonged use of general anesthetic or sedation drugs in children younger than 3 years may have negative effects on their developing brains. This should be discussed with parents and caregivers.

### Seizalam [^117RBXXd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The safety and effectiveness of Seizalam for the treatment of status epilepticus were established in a multi-center, randomized, double-blind (double-dummy), active-control trial. This study compared midazolam administered intramuscularly (IM) via an auto-injector to lorazepam administered intravenously (IV). Patients who met the diagnosis of status epilepticus, experiencing continuing convulsive seizure activity after the arrival of paramedics, were eligible for enrollment.

The intent-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of 893 patients, who were randomized to receive either IM midazolam (n = 448) or IV lorazepam (n = 445). Following randomization, each patient received study treatments administered by a healthcare professional, such as a paramedic, prior to arrival at a hospital. According to the double-dummy design, adult patients received 10 mg IM midazolam followed by an IV placebo or an IM placebo followed by 4 mg IV lorazepam.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the termination of convulsive seizure activity without the need for rescue medication prior to arrival at the emergency department (ED), as determined by the ED attending physician. A statistically significantly higher percentage of midazolam-treated patients met the primary efficacy endpoint.

### A comparison of lorazepam, diazepam, and placebo for the treatment of out-of-hospital status epilepticus [^112s1mnq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). High credibility.

It is uncertain whether the administration of benzodiazepines by paramedics is an effective and safe treatment for out-of-hospital status epilepticus.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial to evaluate intravenous benzodiazepines administered by paramedics for the treatment of out-of-hospital status epilepticus. Adults with prolonged (lasting five minutes or more) or repetitive generalized convulsive seizures received intravenous diazepam (5 mg), lorazepam (2 mg), or placebo. An identical second injection was given if needed.

- **Results**: Of the 205 patients enrolled, 66 received lorazepam, 68 received diazepam, and 71 received placebo. Status epilepticus had been terminated on arrival at the emergency department in more patients treated with lorazepam (59.1 percent) or diazepam (42.6 percent) than patients given placebo (21.1 percent) (P = 0.001). After adjustment for covariates, the odds ratio for termination of status epilepticus by the time of arrival in the lorazepam group as compared with the placebo group was 4.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.9 to 13.0). The odds ratio was 1.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.8 to 4.4) in the lorazepam group as compared with the diazepam group and 2.3 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 5.9) in the diazepam group as compared with the placebo group. The rates of respiratory or circulatory complications (indicated by bag valve-mask ventilation or an attempt at intubation, hypotension, or cardiac dysrhythmia) after the study treatment was administered were 10.6 percent for the lorazepam group, 10.3 percent for the diazepam group, and followed appropriately in other groups.

### The effect of lorazepam on pain and anxiety in abortion [^112y68xu]. Contraception (2003). Low credibility.

In this double-blind study, 104 women were randomized to receive 1 mg lorazepam or a placebo prior to a first-trimester abortion. Additionally, 262 women were allowed to choose whether or not to take lorazepam.

The outcome measures:

- **11-point verbal pain scales**: These assessed pain during the abortion.
- **Anxiety assessment**: Measured before premedication and during the abortion.

The mean anxiety and pain scores did not differ significantly between the lorazepam and placebo groups in the randomized trial. In the observational group, women who took lorazepam experienced a drop in their mean anxiety score from 5.5 to 4.7, whereas those who did not take it saw their score rise from 3.8 to 4.9. This study indicates that administering oral benzodiazepines preoperatively neither benefits nor harms patients; however, the placebo effect can help increase patient comfort.

### Pharmacological interventions for benzodiazepine discontinuation in chronic benzodiazepine users [^114njksx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines is common practice despite clinical recommendations for short-term use. Benzodiazepines are used by approximately 4% of the general population, with increased prevalence in psychiatric populations and the elderly. After long-term use, it is often difficult to discontinue benzodiazepines due to psychological and physiological dependence. This review investigated whether pharmacological interventions can facilitate benzodiazepine tapering.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions to facilitate discontinuation of chronic benzodiazepine use.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following electronic databases up to October 2017: Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group's Specialised Register of Trials, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and ISI Web of Science. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO ICTRP, and ISRCTN registry, and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials comparing pharmacological treatment versus placebo or no intervention, or versus another pharmacological intervention in adults who had been treated with benzodiazepines for at least two months and/or fulfilled criteria for benzodiazepine dependence (any criteria).

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: We included 38 trials (involving 2543 participants), but we could only extract data from 35 trials with 2295 participants. Many different…

### Comparative effectiveness of interventions to facilitate deprescription of benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111SYifo]. BMJ (2025). Low credibility.

We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. For each comparison and outcome, the certainty of evidence was rated as either high, moderate, low, or very low based on several considerations:

- **Risk of bias**: Study limitations
- **Inconsistency**: Heterogeneity in results across trials
- **Indirectness**: Differences between the questions investigated in studies and the question of interest
- **Imprecision**: Random error
- **Publication bias**: Tendency for studies with statistically significant or positive results to be published, published faster, or published in journals with higher visibility

High certainty evidence suggests that the estimated effect (results from a rigorous systematic review and meta-analysis) is likely to be close to the true effect. Conversely, low or very low certainty evidence indicates that the estimated effect may substantially differ from the true effect.

To assess indirectness, the context in which the trial was conducted was considered. Specifically for non-drug interventions, trials conducted before 2000 were anticipated to be indirect due to potential differences in patients' reactions to behavioral interventions. For instance, mailed educational materials might be less effective in the digital age where physical mail is more quickly discarded.

### Pain management of first-trimester surgical abortion: Effects of selection of local anesthesia with and without lorazepam or intravenous sedation [^113iZyZK]. Contraception (2006). Low credibility.

This prospective observational study compared the effectiveness and acceptability of three commonly used regimens to reduce pain during first-trimester surgical abortion with local anesthesia.

Women undergoing suction curettage at less than 14 weeks gestation received preoperative ibuprofen and an intraoperative paracervical block. Participants then selected (1) no additional medication (local arm), (2) sublingual lorazepam (0.5 to 1 mg, approximately 20 minutes preoperatively), or (3) intravenous sedation with fentanyl and midazolam (doses from 50 to 125 micrograms of fentanyl and 1–2 mg of midazolam). The primary outcome was intraoperative pain as measured on an 11-point verbal rating scale (0 = no pain and 10 = worst pain ever).

Three hundred thirty women were enrolled; 105 chose the local arm, 106 opted for lorazepam, and 119 picked intravenous sedation. Mean pain scores were 6.2 for the local arm, 6.8 for lorazepam, and 5.7 for intravenous sedation. Increased preoperative anxiety, depression, expected pain, and a lower volume of local anesthesia used (10 mL vs. 20 mL) were positive predictors of intraoperative pain. Using multivariable analyses to control for these confounders, plus gestational age, alcohol use, and body mass index, intravenous sedation was associated with a 0.86 point lower pain score (p < 0.005), whereas the local and lorazepam groups were not significantly different. Compared with the referent group (local), participants who received lorazepam were significantly less satisfied with pain control (23.8% vs. 6% unsatisfied; OR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.13 to 3.26).

### Lorazepam [^115gv3Ma]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Lorazepam injection, active comparators, and lorazepam injection in combination with a comparator were administered to 488 individuals during controlled and open-label clinical trials. Due to reenrollments, these 488 patients participated in a total of 521 patient-episodes. Lorazepam injection alone was given in 69% of these patient-episodes (n = 360). The safety information presented below is based on data available from 326 of these patient-episodes in which lorazepam injection was administered alone.

- **Adverse events classification**: All adverse events that were observed once are included, except those that have already been listed in previous tables. The study's events were categorized by body system in descending frequency, following these definitions:
	- **Frequent adverse events**: Occurred in at least 1 out of 100 individuals.
	- **Infrequent study events**: Occurred between 1 out of 100 and 1 out of 1000 individuals.

### Efficacy and tolerability of intranasal midazolam administration for antiseizure treatment in adults: A systematic review [^112uu7Ek]. Neurocritical Care (2024). High credibility.

Rapid and easy administration of benzodiazepines can be challenging in the acute care setting in patients with prolonged epileptic seizures, seizure clusters, or status epilepticus. From an application perspective, intranasal midazolam (in-MDZ) administration appears to be particularly promising. This route seems less invasive compared to intravenous, intramuscular, or intraosseous routes, and less stigmatizing compared to rectal administration. Therefore, it is of potential clinical relevance, particularly regarding administration by a layperson.

At the time of writing, to the best of our knowledge, no systematic review has examined the existing global evidence on the efficacy and tolerability of in-MDZ administration for antiseizure treatment in adults. Within the framework of this systematic review, we have compiled the available evidence from the international literature, including 12 identified studies published within the last 38 years, with most published over the previous 5 years. Most of the included studies provided data regarding the proportion of successful seizure termination and the recurrence of seizures after the first in-MDZ administration.

The intranasal administration led to a mean seizure termination in nearly three out of four patients. Compared with the reported successful seizure termination rates with other benzodiazepines or midazolam administered via alternative routes (except for rectal midazolam), in-MDZ administration did not appear to be inferior to other benzodiazepine alternatives, such as intravenously administered midazolam or diazepam given via the intranasal route.

### Chronotherapeutic considerations of benzodiazepine administration for agitation management in the emergency department [^116icEMv]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). Low credibility.

Nobay et al. conducted a randomized trial with 111 violent or severely agitated patients who presented to the emergency department (ED). Patients were assigned to receive intramuscular (IM) midazolam 5 mg (n = 42), lorazepam 2 mg (n = 27), or haloperidol 5 mg (n = 42). Adult patients, with 48.6% having a prior psychiatric history, were enrolled from 0800 to 2300 over a 2-year period. Efficacy was assessed using the Modified Thomas Combativeness Scale. The midazolam group exhibited a significantly shorter time to onset of sedation (p < 0.05) and a more rapid time to arousal than the other two agents (p < 0.05). Twenty percent of patients in the two benzodiazepine (BZD) arms required rescue medications compared with 19% in the haloperidol group (p = 0.66). No data were presented regarding when patients specifically arrived within the enrollment time window.

- **The TREC Collaborative Group**: Conducted a randomized trial in three psychiatric EDs involving 301 aggressive or agitated patients, 72.8% of whom had a prior psychiatric history. Patients were randomized to receive either IM midazolam 7.5–15 mg (n = 151) or haloperidol 5–10 mg plus IM promethazine 25–50 mg (n = 150). Participants were enrolled between June and December, with 95% presenting between 0800 and 0000. Midazolam resulted in significantly faster sedation than the combination group at both 20 and 40 minutes. At 20 minutes, 89% of patients in the midazolam group were tranquil or asleep, compared with 93% at 40 minutes. No significant differences were noted between the groups regarding adverse effects. Again, no data were presented regarding when patients specifically arrived within the enrollment time window.

### Chronotherapeutic considerations of benzodiazepine administration for agitation management in the emergency department [^112YBmW9]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Molecular clocks regulate physiological processes that might affect intravenous benzodiazepine efficacy and safety.

- **Midazolam intrinsic clearance**: Midazolam intrinsic clearance (Cl) and volume of distribution during the elimination phase (Vdβ) have been adapted from Klotz and Ziegler.

- **Plasma diazepam data**: Plasma diazepam data is adapted from Naranjo et al. γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA A) level (%) is adapted from Li et al.

At the time of writing, very few studies have been performed to investigate the circadian changes in drug distribution to tissues from systemic blood circulation. The variation in protein binding, particularly the proportion of unbound proteins, due to circadian oscillation, is considered a contributing factor to the time-dependent dosing dynamics of drug distribution. Diazepam and its metabolite, N-desmethyldiazepam, are highly bound to plasma albumin. Only 1.33 ± 0.21% (mean ± s.d.) of diazepam is in the unbound form in the plasma over the range of concentrations normally encountered in therapy, and the drug elimination is reported to be dependent on the free fraction.

Changes in the diazepam free fraction may, therefore, cause important variations in disposition and effects. The fraction of unbound diazepam is lower at 0.5 hour after intravenous dosing in the morning, and a negative correlation is observed between the fraction of unbound and total plasma level (figure 1B). Therefore, diurnal alteration in protein binding contributes to time-dependent changes in the rate of diazepam distribution and has both pharmacokinetic and clinical importance. According to these observations, defining the best dosing time for BZD administration may result in optimal efficacy and safety.

### A double-blind, randomized comparison of i.v. lorazepam versus midazolam for sedation of ICU patients via a pharmacologic model [^113YL1e6]. Anesthesiology (2001). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and midazolam, are frequently administered to surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients for postoperative sedation. At the time of writing, the pharmacology of lorazepam in critically ill patients had not been described. The aim of the study was to characterize and compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of lorazepam and midazolam administered as continuous intravenous infusions for postoperative sedation of surgical ICU patients.

- **Methods**: With Institutional Review Board approval, 24 consenting adult surgical patients were given either lorazepam or midazolam in a double-blind fashion (together with either intravenous fentanyl or epidural morphine for analgesia) through target-controlled intravenous infusions, titrated to maintain a moderate level of sedation for 12–72 hours postoperatively. Moderate sedation was defined as a Ramsay Sedation Scale score of 3 or 4. Sedation scores were measured along with benzodiazepine plasma concentrations. Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were estimated using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling.

- **Results**: A two-compartment model best described the pharmacokinetics of both lorazepam and midazolam. The pharmacodynamic model predicted the depth of sedation for both midazolam and lorazepam with 76% accuracy. The estimated sedative potency of lorazepam was twice that of midazolam. The predicted C50, ss (plasma benzodiazepine concentrations where P(Sedation ≥ ss) = 50%) values for midazolam (sedation score [SS] ≥ n, where n = a Ramsay Sedation Score of 2, 3,… 6) were not fully provided in the original text.

### Lorazepam [^113bCmdQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Lorazepam injection may produce physical dependence if used more frequently than recommended. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction. Although lorazepam injection is indicated only for intermittent use, if used more frequently than recommended, abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction, or administration of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, including seizures, which can be life-threatening.

Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages (i.e. higher and/or more frequent doses) and those who have had longer durations of use. For patients using lorazepam injection more frequently than recommended, to reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue lorazepam injection.

- **Acute withdrawal signs and symptoms**: Acute withdrawal signs and symptoms associated with benzodiazepines have included abnormal involuntary movements, anxiety, blurred vision, depersonalization, depression, derealization, dizziness, fatigue, and gastrointestinal adverse effects.

### Lorazepam vs diazepam for pediatric status epilepticus: a randomized clinical trial [^114Gd1nE]. JAMA (2014). High credibility.

Benzodiazepines are considered first-line therapy for pediatric status epilepticus. Some studies suggest that lorazepam may be more effective or safer than diazepam, but lorazepam is not FDA approved for this indication.

To test the hypothesis that lorazepam has better efficacy and safety than diazepam for treating pediatric status epilepticus, a randomized clinical trial was conducted.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This double-blind trial took place from March 1, 2008, to March 14, 2012. It included patients aged 3 months to younger than 18 years with convulsive status epilepticus who presented to one of 11 US academic pediatric emergency departments. A total of 273 patients participated, with 140 randomized to receive diazepam and 133 to lorazepam.

- **Interventions**: Patients received either 0.2 mg/kg of diazepam or 0.1 mg/kg of lorazepam intravenously, with half this dose repeated at 5 minutes if necessary. If status epilepticus continued at 12 minutes, fosphenytoin was administered.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary efficacy outcome was the cessation of status epilepticus by 10 minutes without recurrence within 30 minutes. The primary safety outcome was the performance of assisted ventilation. Secondary outcomes included rates of seizure recurrence and sedation, and times to cessation of status epilepticus and return to baseline mental status. Outcomes were measured 4 hours after study medication administration.

Cessation of status epilepticus for 10 minutes without recurrence within 30 minutes occurred in 101 out of 140 (72.1%) in the diazepam group and 97…

### Comparative effectiveness of interventions to facilitate deprescription of benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1176haQw]. BMJ (2025). High credibility.

We summarized heterogeneity by using the I² statistic. We interpreted an I² value of 0% to 40% as not important, 30% to 60% as moderate heterogeneity, 50% to 90% as substantial heterogeneity, and 75% to 100% as considerable heterogeneity. The I² value is prone to misinterpretation, as even small degrees of clinically unimportant inconsistency may translate to high I² values if estimates from studies are precise. Hence, we also considered the absolute magnitude of differences in estimates across studies. For analyses with 10 or more studies, we had planned to test for publication bias by visually inspecting funnel plots and using Egger's tests, but all analyses included fewer than 10 studies.

- **Network meta-analysis**: Like conventional meta-analysis, which pools results from studies assessing the same or similar research questions, network meta-analysis also pools study results but allows comparisons among three or more interventions simultaneously. We opted against network meta-analyses owing to the sparsity of evidence across outcomes and outcome measures and due to concerns with transitivity or joint randomizability — a critical assumption of network meta-analysis. In particular, the types of interventions studied in trials varied across settings. For example, studies conducted in the community often focused on less intensive interventions such as patient education and tapering, whereas trials conducted in specialized settings studied more intensive interventions, such as introducing new healthcare professionals or training healthcare professionals to perform additional tasks outside of their main scope.

### Nayzilam [^1173BQX5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: The exact mechanism of action for midazolam is not fully understood. It is believed to involve potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission resulting from binding at the benzodiazepine site of the GABA A receptor.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: The pharmacodynamic properties of midazolam and its metabolites are similar to those of other benzodiazepines, including sedative, anxiolytic, amnestic, and hypnotic activities. The effects of midazolam on the central nervous system are dependent on the dose administered, the route of administration, and the presence or absence of other medications. Treatment with Nayzilam was associated with effects on measures of sedation and psychomotor performance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Sedation and psychomotor impairment effects generally began to occur within 10 minutes post-dose, with peak effects observed within 30 minutes to 2 hours post-dose. The pharmacodynamic effects generally returned to near baseline levels by 4 hours post-dose.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, plasma exposures (Cmax and AUC) of midazolam in epilepsy patients increase approximately proportional to dose from 5.0 mg to 15 mg, representing 0.5 and 1.5 times the recommended maximum total dose (5 mg initial dose + 5 mg second dose), respectively.

- **Absorption**: Following nasal administration of a single 5 mg midazolam dose to healthy adults, midazolam was absorbed with a median Tmax (range) of 17.3 (7.8 to 28.2) minutes. The midazolam mean (± SD) Cmax and AUC0-∞ were 54.7 (± 30.4) ng/mL and 126.2 (± 59) ng∙hr/mL, respectively.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines on sedation in gastrointestinal endoscopy [^114NJr9c]. Gut (2024). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine-related toxicity and the use of flumazenil is a critical area of concern. Symptoms of benzodiazepine-related overdose include reduced consciousness, hypotension, respiratory depression, and apnea. Management is largely supportive, although flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, which acts by competitively binding at a benzodiazepine-binding site on the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor, can be used to reverse the effects of benzodiazepine toxicity. It has more efficacy at reversing central nervous system depression than respiratory depression; thus, in patients administered both benzodiazepine and opiate as part of their sedation regimen, it would make sense to give naloxone first before flumazenil.

Flumazenil is given intravenously and has a rapid onset of action of 1–2 minutes, with the maximal effect reached within 10 minutes after administration. The BNF recommends a dosage of 200 μg, administered over 15 seconds, followed by 100 μg every minute, if required, up to a maximum of 2 mg.

Potential side effects related to flumazenil include nausea, vomiting, headaches, and dizziness. There are also reported cases of benzodiazepine reversal-related seizures, particularly in patients receiving long-term benzodiazepines or high-dose tricyclic antidepressants. The reversal of the effects of midazolam with flumazenil may occur within 2 minutes. Since midazolam has a longer duration of action than flumazenil, re-sedation may occur following the administration of flumazenil. It is prudent to observe patients receiving flumazenil for an extended period in recovery (e.g. 2 hours longer than usual).

### Lorazepam [^115DNFW7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Lorazepam interacts with the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine receptor complex, which is widespread in the brain of humans as well as other species. This interaction is presumed to be responsible for lorazepam's mechanism of action. Lorazepam exhibits a relatively high and specific affinity for its recognition site but does not displace GABA. Attachment to the specific binding site enhances the affinity of GABA for its receptor site on the same receptor complex. The pharmacodynamic consequences of benzodiazepine agonist actions include antianxiety effects, sedation, and reduction of seizure activity. The intensity of action is directly related to the degree of benzodiazepine receptor occupancy.

- **Effects in pre-operative patients**: Intravenous or intramuscular administration of the recommended dose of 2 mg to 4 mg of lorazepam injection to adult patients is followed by dose-related effects of sedation (sleepiness or drowsiness), relief of preoperative anxiety, and lack of recall of events related to the day of surgery in the majority of patients. The clinical sedation (sleepiness or drowsiness) thus noted is such that the majority of patients are able to respond to simple instructions whether they give the appearance of being awake or asleep. The lack of recall is relative rather than absolute, as determined under conditions of careful patient questioning and testing using props designed to enhance recall. The majority of patients under these reinforced conditions had difficulty recalling perioperative events or recognizing props from before surgery.

### A comparison of midazolam, lorazepam, and diazepam for the treatment of status epilepticus in children: A network meta-analysis [^112QsEPD]. Journal of Child Neurology (2016). High credibility.

Midazolam, lorazepam, and diazepam are recommended as emergent initial therapy for status epilepticus. However, there are no studies confirming the best agent for pediatric status epilepticus. We compared the efficacy of midazolam, lorazepam, and diazepam in treating pediatric status epilepticus using a network meta-analysis method.

In total, 16 randomized controlled trials containing 1,821 patients were included. Nonintravenous midazolam, intravenous lorazepam, and intravenous diazepam were more successful in achieving seizure cessation when compared with nonintravenous diazepam (odds ratio = 2.23, 95% credibility interval: 1.62, 3.10; odds ratio = 2.71, 95% credibility interval: 1.25, 5.89; odds ratio = 2.65, 95% credibility interval: 1.12, 6.29; respectively).

Among lorazepam, midazolam, and diazepam, midazolam had the highest probability (surface under the cumulative ranking area [SUCRA] = 0.792) of achieving seizure cessation. Lorazepam had the largest probability (SUCRA = 0.4346) of being the best treatment in reducing respiratory depression.

In conclusion, nonintravenous midazolam and intravenous lorazepam were superior to intravenous or nonintravenous diazepam, and intravenous lorazepam was at least as effective as nonintravenous midazolam in treating pediatric status epilepticus.

### Posttraumatic midazolam administration does not influence brain damage after experimental traumatic brain injury [^111yB7eL]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Low credibility.

Midazolam is an inexpensive benzodiazepine that is most suitable for sedation in patients with TBI. Unlike other benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam or diazepam, it has a short, context-sensitive half-time with rapid onset and offset of action.

Our previous study shows that TBI induces the expression of p75NTR 24 hours after experimental TBI, which is associated with proapoptotic signaling. A superinduction of p75NTR further exacerbated p75NTR-mediated cell death through the inhibition of neurotrophin procession by propofol.

We hypothesized that the GABA-ergic stimulation by midazolam enhances brain damage in a similar fashion as propofol. In the present study, we therefore investigated the effect of a delayed single-bolus midazolam application at 24 hours after trauma, at the peak of p75NTR expression, on histological brain damage, neuroinflammation, and neurological function 3 days after insult to explore whether posttraumatic midazolam application is neurotoxic in a posttreatment paradigm as previously demonstrated for propofol.

### Guidelines for the evaluation and management of status epilepticus [^1179zFBW]. Neurocritical Care (2012). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of status epilepticus, and more specifically in relation to antiepileptic drugs, the NCS 2012 guidelines recommend administering benzodiazepines as emergent initial therapy. Administer lorazepam as the drug of choice for IV administration and midazolam for IM administration. Consider administering rectal diazepam if IV access is not available and if IM administration of midazolam is contraindicated.

### Intramuscular versus intravenous therapy for prehospital status epilepticus [^111UKkqS]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). High credibility.

Early termination of prolonged seizures with intravenous administration of benzodiazepines improves outcomes. For faster and more reliable administration, paramedics increasingly use an intramuscular route.

- **Methods**: This double-blind, randomized, noninferiority trial compared the efficacy of intramuscular midazolam with that of intravenous lorazepam for children and adults in status epilepticus treated by paramedics. Subjects whose convulsions had persisted for more than 5 minutes and who were still convulsing after paramedics arrived were given the study medication by either intramuscular autoinjector or intravenous infusion. The primary outcome was the absence of seizures at the time of arrival in the emergency department without the need for rescue therapy. Secondary outcomes included endotracheal intubation, recurrence of seizures, and timing of treatment relative to the cessation of convulsive seizures. This trial tested the hypothesis that intramuscular midazolam was noninferior to intravenous lorazepam by a margin of 10 percentage points.

- **Results**: At the time of arrival in the emergency department, seizures were absent without rescue therapy in 329 of 448 subjects (73.4%) in the intramuscular-midazolam group and in 282 of 445 (63.4%) in the intravenous-lorazepam group (absolute difference, 10 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 4.0 to 16.1; P < 0.001 for both noninferiority and superiority). The two treatment groups were similar concerning the need for endotracheal intubation (14.1% of subjects with intramuscular midazolam and 14.4% with intravenous lorazepam).

### CNS 7056: A novel ultra-short-acting benzodiazepine [^111F2W43]. Anesthesiology (2007). Low credibility.

A new benzodiazepine derivative, CNS 7056, has been developed to permit a superior sedative profile to agents, i.e. more predictable fast onset, short duration of sedative action, and rapid recovery profile. This goal has been achieved by rendering the compound susceptible to metabolism via esterases. The authors now report on the profile of CNS 7056 in vitro and in vivo.

- **Methods**: The affinity of CNS 7056 and its carboxylic acid metabolite, CNS 7054, for benzodiazepine receptors and their selectivity profiles were evaluated using radioligand binding. The activity of CNS 7056 and midazolam at subtypes (alpha1beta2gamma2, alpha2beta2gamma2, alpha3beta2gamma2, alpha5beta2gamma2) of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor was evaluated using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. The activity of CNS 7056 at brain benzodiazepine receptors in vivo was measured in rats using extracellular electrophysiology in the substantia nigra pars reticulata. The sedative profile was measured in rodents using the loss of righting reflex test.

- **Results**: CNS 7056 bound to brain benzodiazepine sites with high affinity. The carboxylic acid metabolite, CNS 7054, showed around 300 times lower affinity. CNS 7056 and CNS 7054 (10 μm) showed no affinity for a range of other receptors. CNS 7056 enhanced GABA currents in cells stably transfected with subtypes of the GABAA receptor. CNS 7056, like midazolam and other classic benzodiazepines, did not show clear selectivity between subtypes of the GABAA receptor. CNS 7056 (intravenous) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of brain activity in vivo.

### SPL drug information for lorazepam [^115TWpcn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of lorazepam IV (also known as Ativan) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use. There is evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monitor for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. Monitor neonates for floppy infant syndrome and hyperbilirubinemia. Patients should be warned of the potential risks to the fetus and instructed to discontinue the drug prior to becoming pregnant. The drug lorazepam IV is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, due to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

Regarding medical management for catatonia, more specifically with respect to benzodiazepines, BAP 2023 guidelines recommend considering the use of high doses of lorazepam above the licensed maximum to achieve maximal effect. An adequate trial should be considered complete when catatonia is adequately treated, titration has been stopped due to side effects, or the dose has reached at least 16 mg/day.

### Oral clonazepam versus lorazepam in the treatment of methamphetamine-poisoned children: a pilot clinical trial [^1113eACd]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

As depicted in Table 1, the median [IQR] treatment response and duration of symptoms was 4 hours for all patients with a hospitalization period closer to 24–48 hours. The long hospitalization period, compared to the short duration of toxicity, was due to the observation period to monitor for possible adverse effects (e.g. over-sedation) and persisting agitation. During the monitoring period, patients were mostly calm, but their vital signs (e.g. temperature and heart rate) changed over time [see Table 2]. Our findings thus support our hypothesis that treatment with oral clonazepam or lorazepam following an IV diazepam loading dose is efficacious. It may also reduce the burden for healthcare workers, for whom establishing and maintaining the IV line in pediatric patients is a major concern.

Compared to other studies, we managed to enroll a substantial sample of 30 patients. Replication of our findings would lend further support to the concept of the combination treatment of IV and oral BZO as a practical, novel, and cost-efficient intervention. However, further studies to evaluate different BZOs in the setting of acute methamphetamine poisoning in children are also warranted. These may include a comparison of the non-IV administration of different BZOs, such as via the intranasal (diazepam, midazolam), buccal, and intramuscular (both midazolam) routes, which have already been tested in the management of epileptic seizures in children and shown similar efficacy as IV diazepam for this indication.

The generalizability of our findings is limited by the fact that all pati…

### Seizalam [^114JP9Gt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**:
	- **Benzodiazepines and opioids**:
		The risk of respiratory depression is increased when benzodiazepines and opioids are used together because they act at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABAA sites, whereas opioids act primarily at mu receptors. This combination significantly heightens the potential for benzodiazepines to exacerbate opioid-related respiratory depression. It is important to limit the dosage and duration of concomitant use and monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation.

	- **Other CNS depressants and alcohol**:
		The sedative effect of Seizalam is enhanced by other medications that depress the central nervous system, especially opioids such as morphine, meperidine, and fentanyl, as well as secobarbital, droperidol, and alcohol.

	- **Cytochrome P450–3A4 inhibitors**:
		Caution is recommended when Seizalam is administered with drugs known to inhibit the P450–3A4 enzyme system, such as cimetidine, erythromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, ketoconazole, and itraconazole. These interactions may lead to prolonged sedation due to decreased plasma clearance of midazolam.

### Midazolam hydrochloride [^113KVRFc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

**General precautions**: The efficacy and safety of midazolam in clinical use depend on the administered dose, the clinical status of the individual patient, and the use of concomitant medications capable of depressing the CNS. Anticipated effects may range from mild sedation to deep levels of sedation, with a potential loss of protective reflexes, particularly when coadministered with anesthetic agents or other CNS depressants. Care must be taken to individualize the dose of midazolam HCl syrup based on the patient's age, underlying medical or surgical conditions, and concomitant medications. It is crucial to have personnel, age- and size-appropriate equipment, and facilities available for monitoring and intervention. Practitioners administering midazolam must possess the skills necessary to manage reasonably foreseeable adverse effects, particularly skills in airway management.

### A placebo- and midazolam-controlled phase I single ascending-dose study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of remimazolam (CNS 7056): Part II. Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling and simulation [^114eCZBn]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2012). Low credibility.

A new benzodiazepine, remimazolam, which is rapidly metabolized by tissue esterases to an inactive metabolite, has been developed to permit a fast onset, a short, predictable duration of sedative action, and a more rapid recovery profile than currently available drugs. We report on modeling of the data and simulations of dosage regimens for future study.

- **Methods**: A phase I, single-center, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, randomized, single-dose escalation study was conducted. Fifty-four healthy subjects in 9 groups received a single 1-minute IV infusion of remimazolam (0.01–0.3 mg/kg). There were 18 control subjects taking midazolam and 9 placebos. Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling of the data was undertaken, and the parameters obtained were used for Monte-Carlo simulations of alternative dosing regimens.

- **Results**: A 4-compartment mammillary pharmacokinetic model of midazolam and a physiologically based recirculation model of remimazolam were fitted to the observed plasma levels. The recirculation model of remimazolam explained the observed high venous, compared with arterial, concentrations at later time points. The two models were used to simulate the arterial concentrations required for the pharmacodynamic models of sedation (Bispectral Index and Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation [MOAA/S]) and gave population mean pharmacodynamic parameters as follows: Bispectral Index-IC(50): 0.26, 0.07 μg/mL; γ: 1.6, 8.6; k(e0): 0.14, 0.053 min(-1); I(MAX): 39, 19, and MOAA/S-IC(50): 0.4, 0.08 μg/mL; γ: 1.4, 3.4; k(e0): 0.2.

### The effects of lorazepam on extrastriatal dopamine D(2/3)-receptors-a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled PET study [^111QeM9Q]. Psychiatry Research (2009). Low credibility.

Lorazepam is a widely used anxiolytic drug of the benzodiazepine class. The clinical actions of benzodiazepines are thought to be mediated via specific allosteric benzodiazepine binding sites and enhancement of GABAergic neurotransmission in the brain. However, the indirect effects of benzodiazepines on other neurotransmitter systems have not been extensively studied. Previous experimental evidence suggests that benzodiazepines inhibit striatal dopamine release by enhancing the GABAergic inhibitory effect on dopamine neurons, whereas very little is known about cortical or thalamic gamma-amino-butyric (GABA)-dopamine interactions during benzodiazepine administration.

We explored the effects of lorazepam (a single 2.5 mg dose) on cortical and thalamic D(2/3) receptor binding using positron-emission tomography (PET) and the high-affinity D(2/3)-receptor ligand [(11)C]FLB 457 in 12 healthy male volunteers. We used a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study design. Dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptor binding potential was measured with the reference tissue method in several extrastriatal D(2)-receptor areas, including frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices, as well as the thalamus.

- **Sedative effects**: The main subjective effect of lorazepam was sedation. Lorazepam induced a statistically significant decrease of D(2)/D(3) receptor BP(ND) in the medial temporal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which was also confirmed by voxel-level analysis. The sedative effect of lorazepam was associated with a decrease in D(2)/D(3) receptor BP(ND) in the DLPFC.

In conclusion, lorazepam decreased [(11)C]FLB 457 binding significantly in extrastriatal brain regions, notably affecting the DLPFC.

### Comparative effectiveness of interventions to facilitate deprescription of benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^117CjTrX]. BMJ (2025). High credibility.

We restricted comparisons of multicomponent and single component interventions to our most important outcome, representing the effectiveness of interventions (the proportion of patients who discontinue BSH), and another outcome representing the acceptability and safety of the intervention (the proportion of patients who discontinued the intervention).

When possible, for each unique comparison of interventions and outcomes, we performed frequentist random effects meta-analysis using the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimator — a conservative approach to meta-analysis — using data from the last point of follow-up from each trial where randomized groups were still preserved. For comparisons where meta-analysis was not feasible, we described the range and distribution of results narratively, following the synthesis without meta-analysis (SWiM) guidelines. We did not encounter comparisons for which we could not do quantitative synthesis.

We found that trials measured and reported results for physical function, mental health, and quality of life using several different instruments. We pooled the results of each unique measure separately. We avoided using standardized mean differences due to their potential to be influenced by differences in variability across trial populations. Additionally, we avoided converting units of one measure to another due to potential differences in the range of the construct covered by each measure.

For cluster trials that appropriately accounted for correlations within clusters, we used the reported results in the analysis. Otherwise, we…

### Lorazepam [^114occc7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The effectiveness of Lorazepam Injection in status epilepticus was established in two multi-center controlled trials involving 177 patients. With rare exceptions, patients were between 18 and 65 years of age. More than half the patients in each study had tonic-clonic status epilepticus; patients with simple partial and complex partial status epilepticus comprised the rest of the population studied, along with a smaller number of patients who had absence status.

- **Study design and methodology**: One study (n = 58) was a double-blind active-control trial comparing Lorazepam Injection and diazepam. Patients were randomized to receive lorazepam 2 mg IV (with an additional 2 mg IV if needed) or diazepam 5 mg IV (with an additional 5 mg IV if needed). The primary outcome measure was a comparison of the proportion of responders in each treatment group, where a responder was defined as a patient whose seizures stopped within 10 minutes after treatment and who continued seizure-free for at least an additional 30 minutes.

- **Study results**: Twenty-four of the 30 (80%) patients were deemed responders to lorazepam and 16/28 (57%) patients were deemed responders to diazepam (p = 0.04). Of the 24 lorazepam responders, 23 received both 2 mg infusions. Non-responders to lorazepam 4 mg were given an additional 2 to 4 mg lorazepam; non-responders to diazepam 10 mg were given an additional 5 to 10 mg diazepam. After this additional dose administration, 28/30 (93%) of patients randomized to lorazepam and 24/28 (86%) of patients randomized to diazepam were deemed responders, a difference that was not statistically significant.

### Benzodiazepine versus nonbenzodiazepine-based sedation for mechanically ventilated, critically ill adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^111CAw99]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Use of dexmedetomidine or propofol instead of a benzodiazepine sedation strategy may improve ICU outcomes. We conducted a review of randomized trials comparing benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine regimens in mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients to determine if differences exist in ICU length of stay, time on the ventilator, delirium prevalence, and short-term mortality.

- **Methods**: We searched CINAHL, MEDLINE, the Cochrane databases, and the American College of Critical Care Medicine's Pain, Agitation, and Delirium Management Guidelines' literature database from 1996 to 2013. Citations were screened for randomized trials that enrolled critically ill, mechanically ventilated adults comparing an IV benzodiazepine-based to a nonbenzodiazepine-based sedative regimen and reported duration of ICU length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, delirium prevalence, and/or short-term mortality. Trial characteristics and results were abstracted in duplicate and independently, and the Cochrane risk of bias tool was used for quality assessment. We performed random effects model meta-analyses where possible.

- **Results**: We included six trials enrolling 1,235 patients: midazolam versus dexmedetomidine (n = 3), lorazepam versus dexmedetomidine (n = 1), midazolam versus propofol (n = 1), and lorazepam versus propofol (n = 1). Compared to a benzodiazepine sedative strategy, a nonbenzodiazepine sedative strategy was associated with a shorter ICU length of stay (n = 6 studies; difference = 1.62 days; 95% CI, 0.68–2.55; I² = 0%; p = 0.0007).

### Lorazepam [^111VUnRm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Lorazepam can be administered by intramuscular or intravenous injection for preanesthetic purposes.

- **Intramuscular injection**: For the designated indications as a premedicant, the usual recommended dose of lorazepam for intramuscular injection is 0.05 mg/kg up to a maximum of 4 mg. As with all premedicant drugs, the dose should be individualized (see clinical pharmacology, warnings, precautions, and adverse reactions). Doses of other central nervous system depressant drugs should typically be reduced (see precautions). For optimum effect, which is measured as the lack of recall, intramuscular lorazepam should be administered at least 2 hours before the anticipated operative procedure. Narcotic analgesics should be administered at their usual preoperative time. There are insufficient data to support efficacy or make dosage recommendations for intramuscular lorazepam in patients under 18 years of age; therefore, such use is not recommended.

- **Intravenous injection**: For the primary purpose of sedation and relief of anxiety, the usual recommended initial dose of lorazepam for intravenous injection is 2 mg total, or 0.02 mg/lb (0.044 mg/kg), whichever is smaller. This dose will suffice for sedating most adult patients and ordinarily should not be exceeded in patients over 50 years of age. In those patients in whom a greater likelihood of lack of recall for perioperative events would be beneficial, larger doses as high as 0.05 mg/kg up to a total of 4 mg may be administered (see clinical pharmacology, warnings, precautions, and adverse reactions). Doses of other injectable central nervous system depressant drugs should typically be reduced (see precautions).
