## Question

Verapamil for Raynauds

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether verapamil is effective for Raynaud's phenomenon and how it fits into treatment recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic distinction between dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines and systematic reviews say about first-line therapy and whether verapamil is even mentioned. Next, I will examine any direct evidence for verapamil in Raynaud's, including dosing and outcomes. After that, I should consider indirect or off-label contexts where verapamil might be used and whether that translates to efficacy for Raynaud's. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and safety considerations, including alternatives and when to escalate therapy.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic framework, because I need to ensure I'm not conflating classes. Verapamil is a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker with prominent effects on cardiac conduction and contractility, whereas dihydropyridines like nifedipine, amlodipine, and felodipine are more peripheral vasodilators and are the traditional agents for Raynaud's phenomenon. This distinction matters because non-dihydropyridines are less potent peripheral vasodilators and are not the standard for Raynaud's management [^113ipp9x] [^117Q8uTG].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines to see what they actually recommend. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify whether verapamil appears at all. The ESVM guideline recommends calcium channel blockers as first-line if lifestyle fails, but emphasizes slow-release nifedipine and dose titration to mitigate vasodilatory side effects, with no role for verapamil in Raynaud's treatment algorithms [^116YiVM2] [^1127mzMo]. Similarly, EULAR recommendations for systemic sclerosis–associated Raynaud's consistently endorse dihydropyridine CCBs, usually nifedipine, as first-line, again without mentioning verapamil for this indication [^115fh6pi] [^111zhqJZ]. The 2024 British Society for Rheumatology guideline likewise positions CCBs and other vasodilators for SSc-RP, but does not include verapamil among recommended agents for Raynaud's symptom control [^117DT4e4] [^111rQdjG].

> I will now examine the evidence base for calcium channel blockers in Raynaud's to ensure I'm not missing a niche role for verapamil. The Cochrane reviews and meta-analyses show that dihydropyridine CCBs reduce attack frequency and severity in primary and secondary Raynaud's, albeit with modest effect sizes and common adverse effects like headache, flushing, and edema. Importantly, these analyses focus on nifedipine and other dihydropyridines, not verapamil [^113ipp9x] [^1158q3ek] [^1164NsZu]. Wait, let me verify whether any included trials tested verapamil — none of the major systematic reviews or RCT syntheses evaluate verapamil for Raynaud's, which aligns with its absence from guidelines [^113ipp9x] [^1158q3ek].

> But wait, what if verapamil is used indirectly for Raynaud's in another context? I should double-check that. Non-dihydropyridine CCBs like verapamil and diltiazem are sometimes used for rate control in thyrotoxicosis when beta-blockers are contraindicated, and in that narrow scenario, guidelines note that verapamil or diltiazem can be used orally for rate control, but this is not a treatment for Raynaud's phenomenon itself and does not imply efficacy for vasospastic attacks [^117Veyv3]. Hold on, I should verify that this is not conflated with Raynaud's therapy — yes, these are distinct indications and should not be extrapolated to Raynaud's management.

> Let me consider the mechanistic rationale, because I need to ensure the pharmacology supports the clinical stance. Raynaud's benefit from CCBs derives from peripheral vasodilation of digital arteries and arterioles; dihydropyridines are more effective peripheral vasodilators than non-dihydropyridines, which preferentially affect cardiac conduction and have less pronounced peripheral vasodilatory effects, making verapamil a weaker candidate for reversing cold-induced vasospasm in Raynaud's [^117Q8uTG] [^113ipp9x]. This mechanistic mismatch reinforces why guidelines prioritize dihydropyridines over verapamil for Raynaud's symptom control [^116YiVM2] [^115fh6pi].

> I should confirm practical dosing and safety context for the agents that are actually recommended, so I don't leave the user without actionable guidance. For nifedipine, typical practice is to start with a low dose of a slow-release formulation and titrate gradually to improve tolerability; common adverse effects include headache, flushing, dizziness, and peripheral edema, which often attenuate with continued use or dose adjustment [^1127mzMo] [^113ipp9x]. If dihydropyridine CCBs are ineffective or poorly tolerated, second-line options include phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and, for severe cases, intravenous prostanoids such as iloprost, with supportive measures like smoking cessation, cold avoidance, and occupational therapy as indicated [^115fh6pi] [^113NP9CY] [^114VvGud] [^116sMFkR].

> Putting this together, I should conclude clearly and verify alignment with the evidence. Verapamil is not recommended for Raynaud's phenomenon because there is no supportive clinical evidence and no guideline endorsement for this indication, whereas dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers — particularly nifedipine — remain first-line pharmacotherapy when lifestyle measures are insufficient. Verapamil's role, if any, is limited to alternative rate control in thyrotoxicosis and should not be used for Raynaud's symptom control [^116YiVM2] [^115fh6pi] [^1147HWXL]. If Raynaud's symptoms persist despite optimized dihydropyridine therapy, consider PDE5 inhibitors or IV prostanoids per guideline pathways rather than switching to verapamil [^115fh6pi] [^113NP9CY].

---

Verapamil is **not recommended** for Raynaud's phenomenon because it lacks supportive evidence and is not included in current guidelines [^116YiVM2] [^115fh6pi]. While verapamil is a calcium channel blocker, its **vasodilatory effect is weaker** than dihydropyridines (e.g. nifedipine, amlodipine), which are first-line for Raynaud's [^113ipp9x]. Verapamil may be considered only if dihydropyridines are contraindicated or not tolerated, but expectations for benefit should be modest and monitoring for adverse effects is advised [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological rationale for verapamil in Raynaud's phenomenon

Verapamil is a **non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker** that inhibits calcium influx in vascular smooth muscle, producing vasodilation. In theory, this could reduce vasospasm and improve digital perfusion in Raynaud's. However, its vasodilatory effect is less pronounced than dihydropyridines, which are preferred for peripheral vasodilation in Raynaud's [^113ipp9x].

---

## Clinical evidence for verapamil in Raynaud's phenomenon

There is **limited clinical evidence** supporting verapamil for Raynaud's:

- **Primary Raynaud's**: No randomized controlled trials (RCTs) specifically evaluate verapamil in primary Raynaud's.
- **Secondary Raynaud's**: Limited data suggest minimal benefit, with no significant reduction in attack frequency or severity compared to placebo or active comparators.
- **Guideline recommendations**: Major guidelines (ESVM, EULAR, BSR) do not recommend verapamil for Raynaud's; they endorse dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g. nifedipine, amlodipine) as first-line therapy [^116YiVM2] [^115fh6pi] [^117DT4e4].

---

## Comparison with other calcium channel blockers

Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g. nifedipine, amlodipine) have **moderate-quality evidence** supporting their use in Raynaud's, demonstrating modest reductions in attack frequency and severity [^113ipp9x] [^1158q3ek]. In contrast, verapamil's weaker peripheral vasodilation and lack of supportive trials make it a less attractive option [^113ipp9x].

---

## Safety profile and tolerability

Verapamil is generally well tolerated, but **adverse effects** include:

- Bradycardia
- Hypotension
- Constipation
- Dizziness
- Headache

These effects may limit tolerability, particularly in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities or those prone to hypotension.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize lifestyle modifications and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers as **first-line therapy** for Raynaud's. Verapamil is not mentioned as a recommended option, reflecting the lack of evidence and consensus support [^116YiVM2] [^115fh6pi] [^117DT4e4].

---

## Clinical scenarios where verapamil might be considered

Verapamil may be considered only in **specific scenarios**, such as:

- **Contraindications to dihydropyridines**: Patients who cannot tolerate or have contraindications to dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.
- **Adjunctive therapy**: As part of a combination regimen for refractory cases, although evidence is limited.
- **Comorbidities**: Patients with concurrent cardiovascular conditions where verapamil's cardiac effects may be beneficial (e.g. arrhythmias, hypertension).

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Verapamil is **not recommended** for Raynaud's phenomenon due to limited evidence and weaker vasodilatory effects compared to dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. It may be considered only when first-line agents are contraindicated or not tolerated, with careful monitoring for adverse effects. Clinicians should prioritize guideline-supported therapies and lifestyle modifications for optimal management [^116YiVM2] [^115fh6pi] [^117DT4e4].

### Raynaud's phenomenon (primary) [^1124He7o]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2013). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Raynaud's phenomenon is an episodic, reversible vasospasm of the peripheral arteries (usually digital). It causes pallor, followed by cyanosis and/or redness, often with pain and, at times, paraesthesia. On rare occasions, it can lead to ulceration of the fingers and toes (and, in some cases, of the ears or nose). This review focuses on primary (idiopathic) Raynaud's phenomenon, occurring in the absence of an underlying disease. The prevalence of primary Raynaud's phenomenon varies by sex, country, and exposure to workplace vibration.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of drug treatments for primary Raynaud's phenomenon? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to August 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 9 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: amlodipine, diltiazem, nicardipine, and nifedipine.

### Vasodilators for primary Raynaud's phenomenon [^114hVUwX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Numerous agents have been suggested for the symptomatic treatment of primary Raynaud's phenomenon. Apart from calcium channel blockers, which are considered to be the drugs of choice, evidence of the effects of alternative pharmacological treatments is limited. This is an update of a review first published in 2008.

Objectives

To assess the effects of drugs with vasodilator effects on primary Raynaud's phenomenon as determined by frequency, severity, and duration of vasospastic attacks; quality of life; adverse events; and Raynauds Condition Score.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the ClinicalTrials.gov trial register to November 16, 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials evaluating effects of oral, intravenous, and topical formulations of any drug with vasodilator effects on subjective symptoms, severity scores, and radiological outcomes in primary Raynaud's phenomenon. Treatment with calcium channel blockers was not assessed in this review, nor were these agents compared.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed studies using the Cochrane "Risk of bias" tool, and extracted study data. Outcomes of interest included frequency, severity, and duration of attacks; quality of life (QoL); adverse events (AEs); and the Raynaud Condition Score (RCS). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We identified seven new studies for this update. In total, we included 15 studies involving 635 participants. These studies compared different vasodilators to placebo. Individual studies used different methods and measures to report different outcomes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors Combining data from three studies revealed a possible small increase in the frequency of attacks per week after treatment (captopril or enalapril) compared to placebo (mean difference [MD] 0.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.43 to 1.17; low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between groups in severity of attacks (MD -0.17, 95% CI -4.66 to 4.31; 34 participants, 2 studies; low-certainty evidence); duration of attacks (MD 0.54, 95% CI -2.42 to 1.34; 14 participants, 1 study; low-certainty evidence); or AEs (risk ratio [RR] 1.35, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.73; 46 participants, 3 studies; low-certainty evidence). QoL and RCS were not reported. Alpha blockers Two studies used alpha blockers (buflomedil or moxisylyte). We were unable to combine data due to the way results were presented. Buflomedil probably reduced the frequency of attacks compared to placebo (MD -8.82, 95% CI -11.04 to -6.60; 31 participants, 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence) and may improve severity scores (MD -0.41, 95% CI -0.62 to -0.30; moderate-certainty evidence). With moxisylyte, investigators reported fewer attacks (P < 0.02), less severe symptoms (P < 0.01), and shorter duration of attacks, but the clinical relevance of these results is unclear. No evidence of a difference in AEs between buflomedil and placebo groups was noted (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.27 to 7.28; 31 participants, 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). More AEs were observed in participants in the moxisylyte group than in the placebo group. Prostaglandin/prostacyclin analogues One study compared beraprost versus placebo. There was no evidence of benefit for frequency (MD 2.00, 95% CI -0.35 to 4.35; 118 participants, low-certainty evidence) or severity (MD -0.06, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.22; 118 participants, low-certainty evidence) of attacks. Overall, more AEs were noted in the beraprost group (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.42; 125 participants; low-certainty evidence). This study did not report on duration of attacks, QoL, or RCS. Thromboxane synthase inhibitors One study compared a thromboxane synthase inhibitor (dazoxiben) versus placebo. There was no evidence of benefit for frequency of attacks (MD 0.8, 95% CI -1.81 to 3.41; 6 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events were not reported in subgroup analyses of participants with primary Raynaud's phenomenon, and the study did not report on duration of attacks, severity of symptoms, QoL, or RCS. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors One study compared ketanserin with placebo. There may be a slight reduction in the number of attacks per week with ketanserin compared to placebo (MD -14.0, 95% CI -27.72 to -0.28; 41 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and reduced severity score (MD -133.00, 95% CI -162.40 to -103.60; 41 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence that ketanserin reduced the duration of attacks (MD -4.00, 95% CI -14.82 to 6.82; 41 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or that AEs were increased in either group (RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.65; 41 participants; very low-certainty evidence). This study did not report on QoL or RCS. Nitrate/nitrate derivatives Four studies compared topical treatments of nitroglycerin or glyceryl trinitrate versus placebo, each reporting on limited outcomes. Meta-analysis demonstrated no evidence of effect on frequency of attacks per week (MD -1.57, 95% CI -4.31 to 1.17; 86 participants, 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence). We were unable to pool any data for the remaining outcomes. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors Three studies compared phosphodiesterase inhibitors (vardenafil, cilostazol or PF-00489791) to an equivalent placebo. Results showed no evidence of a difference in frequency of attacks (standardized MD [SMD] -0.05, 95% CI -6.71 to 6.61; 111 participants, 2 studies; low-certainty evidence), severity of attacks (MD -0.03, 95% CI -1.04 to 0.97; 111 participants, 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence), duration of attacks (MD -1.60, 95% CI -7.51 to 4.31; 73 participants, 1 study; low-certainty evidence), or RCS (SMD -0.8, 95% CI -1.74 to 0.13; 79 participants, 2 studies; low-certainty evidence). Study authors reported that 35% of participants on cilostazol complained of headaches, which were not reported in the placebo group. PF-00489791 caused 34 of 54 participants to experience AEs versus 43 of 102 participants receiving placebo (RR 1.49). Headache was most common, affecting 14 participants (PF-00489791) versus nine participants (placebo).

Authors' Conclusions

The included studies investigated several different vasodilators (topical and oral) for treatment of primary Raynaud's phenomenon. Small sample sizes, limited data, and variability in outcome reporting yielded evidence of very low to moderate certainty. Evidence is insufficient to support the use of vasodilators and suggests that vasodilator use may even worsen disease.

### Calcium channel blockers for primary Raynaud's phenomenon [^1158q3ek]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Calcium channel blockers are the most commonly prescribed drugs for people with primary Raynaud's phenomenon. Primary Raynaud's phenomenon is a common condition characterised by an exaggerated vasospastic response to cold or emotion: classically the digits (fingers and toes) turn white, then blue, then red.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different calcium channel blockers for primary Raynaud's phenomenon as determined by attack rates, severity scores, participant-preference scores and physiological measurements.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator (TSC) searched the Specialised Register (last searched February 2013) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 1). In addition the TSC searched clinical trials databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating the effects of oral calcium channel blockers for the treatment of primary Raynaud's phenomenon.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and their quality, and extracted the data. Data extraction included adverse events. We contacted trial authors for missing data.

Main Results

We included seven randomised trials with 296 participants. Although overall all the trials were classed as being at low or unclear risk of bias, the sample size of the included trials was small and there was unclear reporting of outcomes. Four trials examined nifedipine and the remainder nicardipine. Comparisons were with placebo in six trials and with both dazoxiben and placebo in one trial (only the nifedipine versus placebo data were used within this review). Treatment with oral calcium channel blockers was minimally effective in primary Raynaud's phenomenon at decreasing the frequency of attacks (standardised mean difference of 0.23; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.38, P = 0.003). This translates to 1.72 (95% CI 0.60 to 2.84) fewer attacks per week on calcium channel blockers compared to placebo. One trial provided details on duration of attacks reporting no statistically significant difference between the nicardipine and placebo groups (no P value reported). Only two trials provided any detail of statistical comparisons of (unvalidated) severity scores between treatment groups: one of these trials (60 participants) reported a mean severity score of 1.55 on placebo and 1.36 on nicardipine, difference 0.2 (95% CI of difference 0 to 0.4, no P value reported) and the other trial (three participants only with primary Raynaud's phenomenon) reported a median severity score of 2 on both nicardipine and placebo treatment (P > 0.999). Participant-preference scores were included in four trials, but in only two were results specific to participants with primary Raynaud's phenomenon, and scoring systems differed between trials: scores differed between treatments in only one trial, in which 33% of participants on placebo and 73% on nifedipine reported improvement in symptoms (P < 0.001). Physiological measurements were included as outcome measures in five trials (different methodologies were used in each): in none of these trials were any statistically significant between-treatment group differences found. Treatment with calcium channel blockers appeared to be associated with a number of adverse reactions, including headaches, flushing and oedema (swelling).

Authors' Conclusions

The randomised controlled trials included in this review provide moderate-quality evidence that oral calcium channel blockers are minimally effective in the treatment of primary Raynaud's phenomenon as measured by the frequency of attacks. However, the results of this review were limited by small sample sizes in the included studies and by variable data quality, particularly with regard to outcome measures.

Regarding medical management for systemic sclerosis, more specifically with respect to management of Raynaud's phenomenon, initial therapy, EULAR 2025 guidelines recommend to offer dihydropyridine CCBs, usually oral nifedipine, as first-line therapy for the treatment of SSc-associated Raynaud's phenomenon.

### Calcium channel blockers for primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon [^113ipp9x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Raynaud's phenomenon is a vasospastic disease characterized by digital pallor, cyanosis, and extremity pain. Primary Raynaud's phenomenon is not associated with underlying disease, but secondary Raynaud's phenomenon is associated with connective tissue disorders such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and mixed connective tissue disease. Calcium channel blockers promote vasodilation and are commonly used when drug treatment for Raynaud's phenomenon is required.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) versus placebo for treatment of individuals with Raynaud's phenomenon with respect to Raynaud's type (primary vs secondary) and type and dose of CCBs.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (May 19, 2017), MEDLINE (1946 to May 19, 2017), Embase (1947 to May 19, 2017), clinicaltrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Portal. We applied no language restrictions. We also searched bibliographies of retrieved articles and contacted key experts for additional and unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing calcium channel blockers versus placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and risk of bias and extracted trial data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.

Main Results

This review contains 38 RCTs (33 cross-over RCTs) with an average duration of 7.4 weeks and 982 participants; however, not all trials reported all outcomes of interest. Nine of the identified trials studied patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon (N = 365), five studied patients with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon (N = 63), and the rest examined a mixture of patients with primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon (N = 554). The most frequently encountered risk of bias types were incomplete outcome data and poor reporting of randomization and allocation methods. When researchers considered both primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon, evidence of moderate quality (downgraded for inconsistency) from 23 trials with 528 participants indicates that calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were superior to placebo in reducing the frequency of attacks. CCBs reduced the average number of attacks per week by six (weighted mean difference (WMD) -6.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.60 to - 5.67; I² = 98%) compared with 13.7 attacks per week with placebo. When review authors excluded Kahan 1985C, a trial showing a very large reduction in the frequency of attacks, data showed that CCBs reduced attack frequency by 2.93 per week (95% CI -3.44 to -2.43; I² = 77%). Low-quality evidence (downgraded for imprecision and inconsistency) from six trials with 69 participants suggests that the average duration of attacks did not differ in a statistically significant or clinically meaningful way between CCBs and placebo (WMD -1.67 minutes, 95% CI -3.29 to 0); this is equivalent to a -9% difference (95% CI -18% to 0%). Moderate-quality evidence (downgraded for inconsistency) based on 16 trials and 415 participants showed that CCBs reduced attack severity by 0.62 cm (95% CI -0.72 to - 0.51) on a 10-cm visual analogue scale (lower scores indicate less severity); this was equivalent to absolute and relative percent reductions of 6% (95% CI -11% to -8%) and 9% (95% CI -11% to -8%), respectively, which may not be clinically meaningful. Improvement in Raynaud's pain (low-quality evidence; downgraded for imprecision and inconsistency) and in disability as measured by a patient global assessment (moderate-quality evidence; downgraded for imprecision) favored CCBs (pain: WMD -1.47 cm, 95% CI -2.21 to -0.74; patient global: WMD -0.37 cm, 95% CI -0.73 to 0, when assessed on a 0 to 10 cm visual analogue scale, with lower scores indicating less pain and less disability). However, these effect estimates were likely underpowered, as they were based on limited numbers of participants, respectively, 62 and 92. For pain assessment, absolute and relative percent improvements were 15% (95% -22% to -7%) and 47% (95% CI -71% to -24%), respectively. For patient global assessment, absolute and relative percent improvements were 4% (95% CI -7% to 0%) and 9% (95% CI -19% to 0%), respectively. Subgroup analyses by Raynaud's type, CCB class, and CCB dose suggest that dihydropyridine CCBs in higher doses may be more effective for primary Raynaud's than for secondary Raynaud's, and CCBs likely have a greater effect in primary than in secondary Raynaud's. However, differences were small and were not found for all outcomes. Dihydropyridine CCBs were studied as they are the subgroup of CCBs that are not cardioselective and are traditionally used in RP treatment whereas other CCBs such as verapamil are not routinely used and diltiazem is not used as first line subtype of CCBs. Most trial data pertained to nifedipine. Withdrawals from studies due to adverse effects were inconclusive owing to a wide CI (risk ratio [RR] 1.30, 95% CI 0.51 to 3.33) from two parallel studies with 63 participants (low-quality evidence downgraded owing to imprecision and a high attrition rate); absolute and relative percent differences in withdrawals were 6% (95% CI -14% to 26%) and 30% (95% CI -49% to 233%), respectively. In cross-over trials, although a meta-analysis was not performed, withdrawals were more common with CCBs than with placebo. The most common side effects were headache, dizziness, nausea, palpitations, and ankle edema. However, in all trials, no serious adverse events (death or hospitalization) were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Randomized controlled trials with evidence of low to moderate quality showed that CCBs (especially the dihydropyridine class) may be useful in reducing the frequency, duration, severity of attacks, pain and disability associated with Raynaud's phenomenon. Higher doses may be more effective than lower doses and these CCBs may be more effective in primary RP. Although there were more withdrawals due to adverse events in the treatment groups, no serious adverse events were reported.

### Practical management of Raynaud's phenomenon-a primer for practicing physicians [^116oQ8Gw]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is a common vasospastic condition that results in digital hypoperfusion in response to cold and/or emotional stress and is associated with significant pain and disability. The aim of our review is to provide a practical approach for clinicians to inform assessment and management of patients with RP.

Recent Findings

Autoantibodies and nailfold capillaroscopy are key investigations to stratify the risk of progression to systemic sclerosis (SSc) in patients RP, which was recently confirmed in the multicenter, very early diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (VEDOSS) project. Research has explored the complex lived-patient experience of RP including digital vasculopathy in SSc and has highlighted the need for outcome measure development to facilitate research in the field. Pharmacological treatment strategies vary significantly internationally and there is continued interest in developing surgical approaches.

Summary

We provide a practical and up-to-date approach to inform the assessment and management of patients with RP including guidance on drug initiation and escalation. Calcium channel blockers are first-line treatment and can be initiated by primary care physicians. We also highlight second-line drug therapies used for refractory RP and the potential role for surgical intervention.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of treatments for secondary Raynaud's phenomenon: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised trials [^1114HovB]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

Background

Several pharmacological treatments are available for secondary Raynaud's phenomenon, but there is uncertainty regarding the best options. We aimed to assess and compare the benefits and harms of treatments available for secondary Raynaud's phenomenon.

Method

We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological treatments. We searched for systematic reviews published in MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews up to Jan 31, 2017, and for RCTs published from inception to Sept 24, 2019 in MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We included double-blind RCTs (parallel or crossover) that compared two or more pharmacological treatments or placebo in patients with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. Individual patient data were obtained for one unpublished RCT. Three researchers independently screened the texts and extracted the data. Efficacy outcomes included severity (on a ten-point scale), daily frequency, and mean duration of Raynaud's phenomenon attacks. We also examined tolerability and acceptability. Pairwise meta-analyses and Bayesian random-effects network meta-analyses were used to synthesise data. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017057518).

Findings

We included 58 RCTs in the analysis, comprising 3867 patients (3540 [91.5%] with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon) and 15 classes of drugs. Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors were more effective than placebo for frequency (mean difference -0.36 [95% credibility interval -0.69 to -0.04]), severity (-0.34 [-0.66 to -0.03]), and duration (-3.42 [-6.62 to -0.29]) of attacks (low to moderate level of evidence). Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were superior to placebo for frequency (-0.35 [-0.67 to -0.02]) and severity (-0.84 [-1.25 to -0.45]) of attacks (low level of evidence). For severity of attacks, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (-1.54 [-2.68 to -0.41]; very low level of evidence) and oral prostacyclin receptor agonists (-0.48 [-0.80 to -0.16]; low level of evidence) were superior to placebo. No other drug classes were significantly superior to placebo with regard to efficacy outcomes. Compared with placebo, tolerability was lower for PDE5 inhibitors (incidence rate ratio for serious adverse events or early study exit due to adverse events 3.30 [95% CrI 1.49 to 7.55]) and CCBs (3.13 [1.33 to 7.04]). For all outcomes, global heterogeneity and between-study variance ranged from low (I 2 = 0% and τ 2 = 0.0 for attack severity and duration) to moderate (I 2 = 41% and τ 2 = 0.2 for tolerability). The overall risk of bias was judged to be low in 22 (38%), high in ten (17%), and unclear in 26 (45%) RCTs.

Interpretation

PDE5 inhibitors and CCBs are the most effective pharmacological options, albeit with moderate efficacy and a low level of evidence. Current evidence does not support the use of any other drug in secondary Raynaud's phenomenon.

### Current medical and surgical management of Raynaud's syndrome [^116obzdJ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Raynaud's syndrome (RS) is characterized by episodic digital ischemia induced by cold or emotional stress. Pathophysiologic mechanisms include temporary vasospasm and fixed digital artery obstruction. A number of pharmacologic and invasive therapies have been studied to treat RS symptoms; however, there are no specific treatments that are currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration specifically for RS. Of the available pharmacologic agents, calcium-channel blockers remain the preferred initial treatment for vasospastic RS, although many vasodilators have been studied and found to be efficacious. Vasodilators are less effective in treating digital artery obstruction, and no treatments have been found to be universally beneficial, although the phosphodiesterase V inhibitors have been gaining in popularity. Invasive therapies may have a role in selective cases. In this review, the current evidence of treatment for RS is summarized.

### Oral vasodilators for primary Raynaud's phenomenon [^116NawkU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Many different drugs have been suggested for the symptomatic treatment of primary Raynaud's phenomenon. Apart from calcium channel blockers, which are considered the drugs of choice, the evidence of the effects of alternative pharmacological treatments is limited. This is an update of a review first published in 2008.

Objectives

To assess the effects of various drugs with vasodilator actions on primary Raynaud's phenomenon.

Search Methods

For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched 14 May 2012), CENTRAL (Issue 4, 2012) and clinical trials databases. We contacted one pharmaceutical company and one trial author for additional information. In addition, the reference lists of relevant studies were searched for additional citations. There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating the effects of oral formulations of any drug with vasodilator effects on subjective symptoms in primary Raynaud's phenomenon. Treatment with, or comparison with, calcium channel blockers was not assessed in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two members of the review team independently assessed the trials for inclusion and their quality and extracted the data. Data extraction included adverse events. We contacted trial authors for missing data.

Main Results

Eight studies involving 290 participants were included. Two trials examined the effects of captopril, the rest were single trials on single drugs. All comparisons were with placebo. The methodological quality of most trials was poor. Enalapril was associated with a small increase in the frequency of attacks per week (difference in means 0.8; 95% CI 0.43 to 1.17). The difference between the intervention groups on a subjective improvement score was non-significant. There was a significant effect of buflomedil on the frequency of attacks per week (weighted mean difference (WMD) -8.8; 95% CI -17.55 to -0.09), but there was no evidence of effect on the severity score. The proportion with fewer attacks was significantly higher on moxisylyte than on placebo (relative risk (RR) 4.33; 95% CI 1.36 to 13.81). For captopril, beraprost, dazoxiben and ketanserin there was no evidence of an effect on the frequency, severity or duration of attacks. Beraprost and moxisylyte gave significantly more adverse effects than placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

Poor methodological quality, small sample sizes and the limited data available resulted in low precision of the statistical results and limited value of the overall results. The overall results show that there is no evidence for an effect of vasodilator drugs on primary Raynaud's phenomenon.

### Calcium channel blocker toxicity [^111PNbXu]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Calcium channel blockers continue to be used for the management of a wide variety of adult and pediatric conditions including hypertension, angina pectoris, atrial arrhythmias, Raynaud phenomenon, and migraine headaches. With increased use comes increased potential for misuse and abuse. This article serves as a review of calcium channel blocker physiology with emphasis on presentation and management of the pediatric patient with calcium channel blocker toxicity.

### Treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon [^113KipiN]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon is an episodic vasospasm of the peripheral arteries, causing pallor followed by cyanosis and redness with pain and sometimes paraesthesia, and, rarely, ulceration of the fingers and toes. Primary or idiopathic Raynaud's phenomenon (Raynaud's disease) occurs without an underlying disease. Secondary Raynaud's phenomenon (Raynaud's syndrome) occurs in association with an underlying disease. Initially conservative, non-pharmacologic approach is important for these patients, although pharmacologic therapy may ultimately be necessary. Advances in vascular physiology have showed the role of the endothelium as well as endothelium-independent mechanisms in the altered vasoregulation of Raynaud's phenomenon. This has opened promising therapeutic avenues, and it is likely that therapies targeted towards specific pathophysiologic steps become available in the near future.

### Calcium channel blockers for primary Raynaud's phenomenon: a meta-analysis [^1164NsZu]. Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

To determine the efficacy of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) for primary Raynaud's phenomenon (RP). Primary outcomes were frequency and severity of RP attacks.

Methods

A meta-analysis was conducted using primary data sources: Medline, Current Contents and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of > 2 days' duration with < 35% dropouts. Eighteen of 31 trials were eligible for inclusion [13 nifedipine vs placebo; five other CCBs vs placebo (n = 361)]. The main reasons for trial exclusion were: subset data (primary RP) not provided (n = 10); data published more than once (n = 1); lack of control group (n = 1); and lack of randomization (n = 1). Data were abstracted independently and a weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated for the outcomes.

Results

The WMD (95% confidence interval) of all CCBs vs placebo for reduction in the frequency of attacks (n = 17) over 1 week was -5.00 (-9.02, -0.99) (P = 0.01) or -2.80 (-3.90, -1.70) when heterogeneity was considered, and -6.05 (-11.19,-0.19) (P = 0.04) for nifedipine alone (n = 10). The WMD of all CCBs vs placebo (n = 8) for reduction in severity of attacks (assessed with a 10-cm visual analogue scale) was -1.39 (-2.20, -0.58) (P = 0.0007) and -1.81 (-3.08, -0.54) (P = 0.005) for nifedipine alone (n = 5).

Conclusions

Several small RCTs of CCBs for primary RP have been conducted and have yielded clinical improvement in the frequency and severity of ischaemic attacks. Most trials were crossover trials in which order effect was not studied; this may have introduced bias. The effect size may have been small because of low dosing in studies. The efficacy of CCBs for reducing severity and frequency of ischaemic attacks in primary RP is small (average of 2.8 to 5.0 fewer attacks per week and a 33% reduction in severity).

### Part II: the treatment of primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon [^116k9Ntn]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Raynaud phenomenon (RP) presents with either primary or secondary disease, and both have the potential to negatively impact patient quality of life. First-line management of RP should include lifestyle modifications in all patients. Some patients with primary RP and most with secondary RP require pharmacologic therapies, which may include calcium channel blockers, topical nitrates, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, or endothelin antagonists. Additional approaches to treatment for those with signs of critical ischemia or those who fail pharmacologic therapy include botulinum toxin injection and digital sympathectomy. Herein, we describe in detail the treatment options for patients with RP as well as provide treatment algorithms for each RP subtype.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^1147HWXL]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Symptomatic management of thyrotoxicosis — beta-adrenergic blockade is recommended in all patients with symptomatic thyrotoxicosis, especially elderly patients and thyrotoxic patients with resting heart rates in excess of 90 beats per minute or coexistent cardiovascular disease, with a strong recommendation and moderate-quality evidence. In a randomized controlled trial of MMI alone versus MMI plus a β-adrenergic blocking agent, after 4 weeks patients taking β-adrenergic blockers had lower heart rates, less shortness of breath and fatigue, and improved "physical functioning" on the SF-36 health questionnaire. Technical remarks state that β-blockers should be used with caution in patients with bronchospastic asthma; in quiescent bronchospastic asthma or mild obstructive airway disease or symptomatic Raynaud's phenomenon a relative β1-selective agent can be used cautiously with careful monitoring of pulmonary status, very high doses may occasionally be required to reduce heart rate to near the upper limit of normal but low to moderate doses often give sufficient symptom relief, and oral verapamil or diltiazem have been shown to affect rate control when patients do not tolerate or are not candidates for β-adrenergic blocking agents.

### Effectiveness of interventions for secondary Raynaud's phenomenon: a systematic review [^116UXsu3]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To present an evidence-based overview of the effectiveness of (non)surgical symptomatic interventions to treat secondary Raynaud's phenomenon (RP).

Data Sources

The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, PEDro, and CINAHL were searched for relevant systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Study Selection

Two reviewers independently applied the inclusion criteria to select potential studies.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the methodologic quality.

Data Synthesis

If pooling of data was not possible, a best-evidence synthesis was used to summarize the results. Of the 5 reviews and 19 RCTs included, 1 RCT studied acupuncture and another RCT reported on percutaneous radiofrequency thoracic sympathectomy. All others concentrated on the effectiveness of drugs (oral or intravenous [IV]). It appeared that calcium channel blockers significantly reduce the frequency and severity of Raynaud attacks, and are therefore effective in the treatment of secondary RP. Iloprost (oral and IV) was also found to be effective. Limited evidence was found for atorvastatin. For other traditional and more recently discovered interventions, no clear favorable effects were found.

Conclusions

This review shows that there is clear evidence in favor of calcium channel blockers and iloprost (oral and IV) to treat secondary RP. For all other interventions, only limited, conflicting, or no evidence was found. More high-quality, well-designed RCTs are needed in this field, especially for new interventions based on recent knowledge about the pathophysiology of secondary RP.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^117Veyv3]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Symptomatic management of thyrotoxicosis includes graded recommendations: beta-adrenergic blockade should be given to elderly patients with symptomatic thyrotoxicosis and to other thyrotoxic patients with resting heart rates in excess of 90 bpm or coexistent cardiovascular disease (1/++0), and beta-adrenergic blockade should be considered in all patients with symptomatic thyrotoxicosis (1/+00). In patients in whom thyrotoxicosis is strongly suspected or confirmed, propranolol, atenolol, metoprolol, or other beta-blockers decrease heart rate, systolic blood pressure, muscle weakness, and tremor and improve irritability, emotional lability, and exercise intolerance; however, because available beta-blockers lack sufficient beta-1 selectivity at recommended doses, they are generally contraindicated in bronchospastic asthma. In quiescent bronchospastic asthma where heart rate control is essential, or in mild obstructive airway disease or symptomatic Raynaud's phenomenon, a nonselective beta-blocker such as nadolol can be used cautiously with careful pulmonary monitoring, very high doses may sometimes be required, and calcium channel blockers (verapamil or diltiazem) administered orally and not intravenously have been shown to effect rate control in patients who do not tolerate or are not candidates for beta-adrenergic blocking agents.

### Raynaud's phenomenon (secondary) [^111YXTaX]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Raynaud's phenomenon is episodic vasospasm of the peripheral vessels, causing pallor followed by cyanosis and redness with pain and sometimes paraesthesia, and, rarely, ulceration of the fingers and toes. It presents as episodic colour changes of the digits, usually in response to cold exposure or stress. The classic triphasic colour change is white (ischaemia), then blue (deoxygenation), then red (reperfusion). Raynaud's phenomenon can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to several different conditions and causes. This review deals with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of self-help measures for secondary Raynaud's phenomenon? What are the effects of drug treatments for secondary Raynaud's phenomenon? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2007 (BMJ Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 25 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: alpha-blockers; angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; angiotensin II receptor antagonists; antithrombotics/inhibitors of platelet aggregation; biofeedback; calcium channel blockers; endothelin-1 receptor anatagonists; glyceryl trinitrate (transdermal); hand exercises; inositol nicotinate; moxisylyte; nafitidrofuryl oxylate; phosphodiesterase inhibitors; prostaglandins (oral, intravenous); relaxation therapy; serotonin reuptake inhibitors SRIs; smoking cessation; and warming hands and feet.

### Lower limb ulcer and Raynaud's phenomenon [^115Dbdt5]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Beta blockers may be used in the treatment of RP – Incorrect. Beta block ers (especially nonselective beta blockers) should be avoided, as they may promote RP attacks.
B. Calcium channel blockers constitute the first-line drug treatment of RP – Correct. Calcium channel blockers are recommended if lifestyle modification alone is insufficient. These drugs influence the number and severity of RP attacks. Long-acting calcium channel blockers may be preferred in order to reduce vasodilatory adverse effects.
C. Fluoxetine could be an alternative to calcium channel blockers in cases of intolerance – Correct. Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor commonly used in the treatment of depression. Furthermore, it also showed benefit on frequency and severity of RP attacks in comparison to nifedipine in an open-label cross-over study.
D. Botulinum toxin A could be used in the management of RP – Correct. Botulinum toxin A is a protein produced by Clostridium botulinum that inhibits acetylcholine release in the motor plate and parasympathetic system. Locally injected into the digit or the palmar skin, it may reduce severity of RP attacks.
E. Iloprost could be proposed as a second-line treatment after failure of calcium channel blockers – Correct. Iloprost is an analog of prostacyclin and may be used as a second-line treatment of RP, as it reduces the frequency and severity of the RP attacks. Iloprost is originally used in the treatment of digital ulcers in SSc.

### The 2024 British Society for Rheumatology guideline for management of systemic sclerosis [^117SEYbv]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is the most common disease-specific manifestation of SSc. Virtually all people with SSc will experience cold sensitivity and exhibit other features of digital vascular compromise.

Self-management in the form of cold avoidance and effective measures to promote re-warming forms the mainstay of management. Most people with SSc can predict the occurrence of RP symptoms based on relevant environmental and/or contextual factors. Many people with SSc become adept at managing their symptoms, although this can be at the expense of social participation or rely on the support of others. Smoking is associated with worse digital vascular outcomes and support should be made available to achieve smoking cessation, including nicotine replacement therapy.

Pharmacological intervention should be considered for RP symptoms inadequately controlled through self-management. Registry analyses have identified wide variation in prescribing practices for SSc and indicate clinicians are not fully exploiting the range of therapeutic options available to them. Many pharmacological interventions have been assessed in RP and a recent network meta-analysis suggests the efficacy of treatments for SSc-RP are modest at best. Potential side effects common to all treatments designed to promote vasodilation include headaches (which often regress with repeated dosing) and hypotensive symptoms. Low resting blood pressure may influence the choice of treatment. It is prudent to commence a low dose of any vasoactive treatment for RP and increase gradually depending on tolerability and efficacy. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are generally considered the first line. Selective phosphodiesterase (PDE5i) inhibitors are increasingly being positioned as a second-line treatment for SSc-RP, and their use has been supported by the falling cost of generic non-proprietary brands. Such treatments may exert benefits on other aspects of SSc. Registry evidence has suggested treatments for RP such as CCBs may reduce the likelihood of developing PAH and left ventricular dysfunction in SSc.

### Raynaud's phenomenon [^1128eUMB]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon is characterised by episodic vasospasm of the fingers and toes typically precipitated by exposure to cold. Mild Raynaud's is common and is not usually a harbinger of clinically important disability; its onset, however, can be startling and uncomfortable for patients, and the well recognised association in some cases with systemic rheumatic conditions often precipitates aggressive assessments for underlying diseases. Advances in vascular physiology have shed light on the role of the endothelium as well as endothelium-independent mechanisms in the altered vasoregulation of Raynaud's. We review clinical aspects of the disorder and new insights with respect to pathophysiology, and we discuss potential new therapeutics based on the disease mechanism, such as prostacyclin analogues, serotonin antagonists, and calcitonin gene-related peptides.

### Calcium antagonists [^117Q8uTG]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Calcium antagonists were introduced for the treatment of hypertension in the 1980s. Their use was subsequently expanded to additional disorders, such as angina pectoris, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Raynaud phenomenon, pulmonary hypertension, diffuse esophageal spasms, and migraine. Calcium antagonists as a group are heterogeneous and include 3 main classes — phenylalkylamines, benzothiazepines, and dihydropyridines — that differ in their molecular structure, sites and modes of action, and effects on various other cardiovascular functions. Calcium antagonists lower blood pressure mainly through vasodilation and reduction of peripheral resistance. They maintain blood flow to vital organs, and are safe in patients with renal impairment. Unlike diuretics and beta-blockers, calcium antagonists do not impair glucose metabolism or lipid profile and may even attenuate the development of arteriosclerotic lesions. In long-term follow-up, patients treated with calcium antagonists had development of less overt diabetes mellitus than those who were treated with diuretics and beta-blockers. Moreover, calcium antagonists are able to reduce left ventricular mass and are effective in improving anginal pain. Recent prospective randomized studies attested to the beneficial effects of calcium antagonists in hypertensive patients. In comparison with placebo, calcium antagonist-based therapy reduced major cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death significantly in elderly hypertensive patients and in diabetic patients. In several comparative studies in hypertensive patients, treatment with calcium antagonists was equally effective as treatment with diuretics, beta-blockers, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. From these studies, it seems that a calcium antagonist-based regimen is superior to other regimens in preventing stroke, equivalent in preventing ischemic heart disease, and inferior in preventing congestive heart failure. Calcium antagonists are also safe and effective as first-line or add-on therapy in diabetic hypertensive patients. Heart rate-lowering calcium antagonists (verapamil, diltiazem) may have an edge over the dihydropyridines in post-myocardial infarction patients and in diabetic nephropathy. Thus, calcium antagonists may be safely used in the management of hypertension and angina pectoris.

### Management of Raynaud's phenomenon and digital ischemic lesions in scleroderma [^112AqK4d]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon is a challenging problem in patients who have scleroderma. It causes a great deal of morbidity with recurrent painful attacks and frequent digital ischemic lesions. The strategy to treat the vascular disease must consider treatment for the vasospasm and the intrinsic vascular disease with intimal proliferation and vessel occlusion. Vasodilator therapy remains the main method to treat Raynaud's phenomenon, but new understanding of the pathobiology of scleroderma vascular disease is providing novel treatment options. We need more investigations into these vasoactive drugs before routine use can be recommended. Critical ischemia can cause deep tissue injury and digital loss. An aggressive approach to reversing an ischemic crisis is essential for preventing these severe events.

### Therapy: a local approach to Raynaud phenomenon [^113PXXgg]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2009). Medium credibility.

The current treatment options for Raynaud phenomenon are often ineffective and can have undesirable adverse effects. Topical, or transdermal, treatments that increase digital blood flow without systemic adverse effects are, therefore, an attractive option. A novel topical nitroglycerin formulation has shown promise in treating Raynaud attacks.

Figure 3
Forest plot of summary statistics of weekly attacks of Raynaud's phenomenon from posterior distribution of negative binomial Bayesian model (subgroup analyses; per‐protocol set). n p = number of patients receiving placebo; n a = number of patients receiving active treatment; P † = probability that the difference between the treatment means (selexipag minus placebo) for weekly average number ofattacks in the maintenance period is < 0; 90% = 90% confidence interval; = digital ulcer; s = calcium‐channel blockers.

Other end points. The weekly average number of RP attacks during the maintenance period improved in 81.3% of placebo‐treated patients and in 63.0% of selexipag‐treated patients; it remained stable in 12.5% and 22.2% of patients, respectively, and worsened in 6.3% and 14.8% of patients, respectively. During the baseline week, the average RP attack duration was 21.5 minutes in the placebo group and 24.2 minutes in the selexipag group; the mean ± SD change in weekly average RP attack duration at week 8 was 4.6 ± 26.5 minutes in the placebo group and 2.7 ± 17.0 minutes in the selexipag group (n = 19 for both groups). The mean RCS at baseline was 3.3 in placebo‐treated patients (n = 30) and 4.0 in selexipag‐treated patients (n = 25). No difference was observed between placebo and selexipag in changes from baseline in RCS at any time during the study (data not shown).

5 CHAPTER 5: EXPLANATION

5.1 Explanation 1: Effects of calcium antagonists, antiplatelet drugs, and prostaglandin preparations on SSc‐associated skin ulcers

5.1.1 No study has evaluated the usefulness of calcium antagonists for treating SSc‐associated skin ulcers. However, calcium antagonists are useful for treating Raynaud phenomenon, and may be effective for circulatory disorder–associated ulcers

As reports on the usefulness of nifedipine, Finch et al.performed a randomized crossover study of 16 SSc patients, and reported that nifedipine significantly reduced the frequency, duration, and severity of Raynaud phenomenon in comparison with a placebo. Meyrick Thomas et al.performed a randomized crossover study of 18 SSc patients, and found a significant decrease in the duration of Raynaud phenomenon. Thompson et al.performed a meta‐analysis regarding the effects of calcium antagonists on Raynaud phenomenon in SSc patients, and reported that nifedipine had been administered to a total of 44 SSc patients for 2 to 12 weeks in five studies, and that nifedipine significantly reduced the frequency, duration, and severity of Raynaud phenomenon in comparison with a placebo. A review of nicardipine did not show any significant difference in comparison with a placebo. This may have been due to the small number of patients (n = 15).

5.1.2 No study has evaluated the usefulness of beraprost sodium for treating SSc‐associated skin ulcers, but it is useful for treating Raynaud phenomenon. This drug may be effective for circulatory disorder–associated ulcers

Hida et al.administered beraprost sodium to 15 patients with SSc, three with mixed connective tissue disease, and one with Raynaud disease, and reported that this drug significantly decreased the frequency and duration of Raynaud phenomenon. Asano et al.investigated 12 SSc patients, and found that a sustained‐release beraprost sodium preparation significantly reduced the Raynaud condition score and symptoms. On the other hand, Vayssairat et al.performed an RCT of 107 SSc patients, and reported that beraprost sodium did not exhibit any significant inhibitory effects on Raynaud phenomenon or digital ulcers in comparison with a placebo, whereas it slightly delayed the appearance of digital ulcers in the winter, significantly improving overall well‐being.

Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is experienced by > 90% of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc), often as the first symptom of the disease 1, 2, 3. RP is part of the spectrum of vasculopathy associated with SSc, which also includes digital ulceration and critical digital ischemia 2. It is an important clinical manifestation of the disease, as it is thought that vasculopathy may play a key role in the early pathogenesis of SSc 4. RP occurs due to episodic, reversible vasospasm of the small arteries and arterioles, usually in the fingers and toes, and is mainly triggered by cold or emotional stress 5, 6. In addition, RP secondary to SSc is linked with structural changes of the vasculature, resulting in blood vessel narrowing and impairment of blood flow 5. Because RP is burdensome, improvements in RP have been linked to better quality of life 7, 8.

Management of RP is challenging and requires a multifaceted approach, including risk factor avoidance and targeted drug therapy 2, such as calcium‐channel blockers 9 and, more recently, at least in patients with severe SSc‐related RP, phosphodiesterase V inhibitors 10, 11, 12. Angiotensin receptor blockers are sometimes recommended, but there is little evidence to support their efficacy 13. Intravenous prostanoids, particularly iloprost infusions, are recommended for patients with severe RP when treatment with other agents has failed 2, 9. Although intravenous iloprost has demonstrated efficacy in decreasing severity, frequency, and duration of RP attacks in patients with SSc 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, intravenous administration is burdensome. Currently, there is limited evidence for the benefit of oral prostacyclin analogs in patients with RP 8. Therefore, there is a need to identify oral therapies that act on the prostacyclin receptor for the management of RP secondary to SSc.

Selexipag is an oral, selective IP prostacyclin receptor agonist that has recently been approved for the long‐term treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adults with World Health Organization functional class II/III symptoms 19, 20. The present study aimed to determine the effect of selexipag on the frequency of RP attacks in patients with RP secondary to SSc.

### Contemporary management of Raynaud's phenomenon and digital ischaemic complications [^111d8Lr5]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The present review gives an update of the current management of Raynaud's phenomenon and its ischaemic complications (digital ulceration and critical ischaemia) and discusses possible further developments in the next 5–10 years. New approaches to therapy are being driven by increased understanding of pathophysiology and by increased international networking of clinicians and scientists, facilitating clinical trials.

Recent Findings

Key points include phosphodiesterase inhibitors most likely confer benefit, although clinical trials have given somewhat conflicting results, and have been short-term; a new topical, easy-to-use glyceryl trinitrate preparation has been shown to improve Raynaud's Condition Score; the endothelin-1 receptor antagonist bosentan has now been shown to reduce the number of new systemic sclerosis (SSc)-related digital ulcers in two multinational clinical trials; and although statin therapy is likely to confer benefit in SSc-related Raynaud's phenomenon, further research is required to confirm this.

Summary

New therapeutic approaches in patients who do not respond to more traditionally used vasodilators include phosphodiesterase inhibitors and (for those with recurrent SSc-related digital ulcers) endothelin-1 receptor antagonism. Several other potential new therapies are being researched. Optimal management of digital ulceration is multidisciplinary including tissue viability and (sometimes) surgical input.

### Re-thinking strategies for a pharmaceutical approach to pain-related to connective tissue related Raynaud's phenomenon in the United States [^1136nK99]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved therapies for Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) treatment in the United States (U.S.). Clinical trials have been challenged by study design. Important advances in RP patient reported outcome measures and mechanistic quantification allows RP-related pain characterization. The rationale for this narrative review is current RP treatment guidelines that focus on vasodilation.

Methods

The question of why there are limitations to RP treatment in the US is addressed through a comprehensive search strategy of published RP-treatment guidelines up until September 1, 2025. Search databases included Medline (PubMed), Embase, and Scopus for index terms, "Raynaud's phenomenon treatment guidelines". If a society guideline was updated, only the most recent was included. Eligibility, data extraction, risk of bias and quality assessment were subject to review by two independent reviewers with a third reviewer resolving discrepancies. US specific considerations of published guidelines are reviewed.

Results

There were 118 published articles that were identified by the search terms 'Raynaud's phenomenon treatment guidelines', and 27 abstracts were reviewed. There were 4 articles that were published as RP treatment recommendations or guidelines, which were reviewed for full content. Pain management for RP is not included in guideline-based care.

Conclusion

There are advances in outcome measures for quantifying pain now available for RP clinical trials. Large U.S. based registries for systemic sclerosis (SSc) utilizing patient reported outcomes can allow serial data collection on RP and RP-related digital lesions to provide real-world data on medication efficacy for pain relief.

### Botulinum toxin in the long-term treatment of refractory Raynaud's phenomenon [^112KqZa9]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon is an exaggerated physiological response of blood vessels in the distal extremities to emotional stress and cold. It can be idiopathic or secondary to a connective tissue disorder, such as scleroderma or systemic lupus erythematosus. Treatment for Raynaud's phenomenon consists primarily of lifestyle modifications; if unsuccessful, pharmacotherapy with dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can be added. Botulinum toxin (BTX-A) is a neurotoxic protein produced by Clostridium botulinum spores. While most widely known for its cosmetic use, BTX-A has many therapeutic utilities due to its ability to inhibit multiple neurotransmitters. In this report, we present a patient with Raynaud's phenomenon refractory to standard therapies whose symptoms resolved after treatment with BTX-A. Follow-up with the patient after one and five years showed no relapse or recurrence of symptoms.

### Understanding, assessing and treating Raynaud's phenomenon [^114gsNDG]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

New insights in the pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms implicated in cutaneous vasomotor response to cooling are emerging from recent literature. These advances are introducing significant changes in the management of Raynaud's phenomenon. In this review, we outline how these new findings are leading to novel methods of assessment and new opportunities for specific targeted therapy.

Recent Findings

New potential targets for treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon derive from experimental observations. Increased protein tyrosine kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation have been described in vascular smooth muscle cells in response to cooling and are linked to excessive alpha2-adrenergic response. Activation of Rho/Rho kinase pathway is triggered by increase of reactive oxygen species and up-regulates alpha2c-adrenergic receptors on the surface of vascular smooth muscle cells, thus determining an excessive vasoconstrictive response to cooling. This observation generated pilot trials testing rho-kinase inhibitors and alpha2c-adrenergic receptors antagonists in vasospastic conditions with encouraging results. Therapies already in use for pulmonary hypertension are also showing an effect in Raynaud's phenomenon. Studies evaluating anti-endothelin-1 (bosentan), phosphodiesterases inhibitors (sildenafil), and prostanoids (given for critical digital ischemia) in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon all determined improvement of symptoms and/or digital ischemic lesions. Novel techniques for better visualization and quantification of cutaneous microvascular defects are under development. The hope is that these new tools will allow earlier discrimination between primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon as well as a better way to predict outcome and response to therapy.

Summary

Remarkable progress towards a rational approach to the management and treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon is emerging.

3 CHAPTER 3: GUIDELINES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE/VASCULITIS‐ASSOCIATED SKIN ULCERS, S, AND RECOMMENDATIONS

CQ1: Are there any drugs effective in preventing or treating SSc‐associated skin ulcers?

3.1 Background/purpose

SSc induces fibrosis of the skin and various organs such as the lung/esophagus/intestinal tract/kidney. Concerning its pathogenesis, 3 factors are recognized: immune dysfunction, vascular damage, and fibrosis are primarily known, but vascular damage may play a key role in the onset of skin ulcers. Skin ulcers occur through persistent dermal ischemia related to microcirculatory disorder at the distal portions of the extremities such as the fingertips. Therefore, drugs that reduce vascular damage are selected as treatment options. Furthermore, in addition to skin ulcers, Raynaud phenomenon is observed as a representative symptom of vascular damage. This phenomenon refers to transient ischemia of the fingers related to reversible arterial spasm. Vasoconstrictors, such as endothelin, and cold stimulation–related sympatheticotonia, are complexly involved in the pathogenesis of this phenomenon. From the viewpoint of a similar pathogenesis, drugs that relieve Raynaud phenomenon are also regarded as candidates for treatment. Concretely, these include vasodilators, antiplatelet drugs, drugs for pulmonary hypertension, calcium antagonists, angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and statins. In the present guidelines, these treatment options were examined using the evidence‐based method (EBM) method. In addition, SSc‐associated skin ulcers are often refractory and can induce severe pain. Recurrent ulcers and shortening of the distal portions of the extremities may significantly affect the patient's QOL. From these viewpoints, the prevention of new skin ulcers is an important clinical issue, and drugs that prevent their onset were also investigated.

### Current drug therapy for scleroderma and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon: evidence-based review [^112fqd5Q]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

(1) Scleroderma and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon are frequently associated with increased morbidity for which no specific standardised treatment guidelines exist. (2) Current therapies for scleroderma target the immune system, with the goal of reducing inflammation and secondary tissue injury and fibrosis. Therapy targeting underlying vascular disease is designed to improve the symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon and to reduce ischemic injury to involved organs. (3) Few controlled trials of therapy used for scleroderma are completed, and current treatments are largely based on organ-specific therapy and uncontrolled case series suggesting disease modification. (4) Recent randomised, controlled trials in scleroderma demonstrate promising results in the treatment of interstitial lung disease with cyclophosphamide, and vascular disease of the lungs and digits with endothelin receptor antagonists, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor sildenafil and prostacyclins, while trials with methotrexate show only modest benefit in controlling scleroderma-associated skin disease. (5) Prostacyclins are a therapeutic option in patients with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. Modest benefits have also been shown with alpha1-antagonists and calcium channel blockers, while the effect of ACE inhibitors has been variable. Some data suggest some benefits to the use of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor sildenafil, the serotonin uptake inhibitor fluoxetine and the angiotensin receptor inhibitor losartan.

### Evidence and consensus-based recommendations for non-pharmacological treatment of fatigue, hand function loss, Raynaud's phenomenon and digital ulcers in patients with systemic sclerosis [^112P5vCD]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The strengths of this project are the broad participation of patient representatives and professionals and its systematic approach that is based on the standardized operating procedures to combine practice and evidence-based knowledge of EULAR. Therefore, the resulting recommendations can be used for all stakeholders: support HPRs in the treatment of SSc patients, guidance for rheumatologists, and other medical or non-medical care providers on timely referrals, and thus better access to information regarding HPR treatment for SSc patients and their patient organizations. Another strength is the division of recommendations into a stepped care approach including patient education, single or multiple HPR treatments and a multidisciplinary approach. Both the consensus meeting and literature suggested that different disease manifestations require different treatment approaches. All patients diagnosed with SSc need patient education regarding clinical manifestations and possible disease consequences to manage SSc. Moreover, patients with single, non-lethal disease consequences can often receive help through specific, individualized treatments. However, when patients report limitations that cause restrictions in multiple areas of activities of daily living, multidisciplinary treatment with appropriate specialists should be considered.

A possible limitation in this study is that we used a pragmatic literature research approach to answer research questions, and that we refrained from statistical pooling of data of findings of individual RCTs due to the heterogeneity of interventions and outcome measures. As, a consequence, we did not provide information about the magnitude of effects (and thus the clinical relevance of findings). Draft recommendations formulated by the task force in the face-to-face meeting were the main factors deciding whether recommendations were approved. However, in disease settings in which evidence is limited by a small patient sample and the rapid development of the disease, this approach can help to inform the content of HPR interventions and can also be used in the development and/or optimization of research studies and national postgraduate educational offerings. By performing a thorough literature search on systematic reviews and recently published RCTs we got insight into the (lack of) evidence basis of each individual recommendation. To ensure the high quality of statements, all articles found were assessed for their quality, risk of bias and subsequently the level of evidence. Another potential study limitation might be that, while the literature used originates from the international field of expertise, the expertise of experts involved is probably mainly based on the Dutch health care system. As those roles may vary per country, local adaptations may be needed if the recommendations stated in this study are used in other countries.

### Efficacy and safety of selexipag in adults with Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to systemic sclerosis: a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study [^111xtDQ6]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were similar between all randomized patients (Table 1) and the per‐protocol set (see Supplementary Table 2). The treatment arms were generally similar, although more patients in the placebo group had a history of digital ulcers (71.1%) compared with the selexipag group (44.4%). Baseline use of calcium‐channel blockers in the per‐protocol set was greater in placebo‐treated patients (71.9%) compared with selexipag‐treated patients (33.3%) (see Supplementary Table 2).

Table 1
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of all of the randomized patients a

Dosing and exposure. Of all randomized patients, 71.1% (27 of 38) in the placebo group had an individualized maintenance dose corresponding to 1,600 μg twice daily, while 83.3% (30 of 36) of patients receiving selexipag had an individualized maintenance dose of ≤ 800 μg twice daily (median 600 [interquartile range 200–800]) (see Supplementary Table 3). The median duration of exposure to study drug for all randomized patients in the double‐blind period was 55.5 days (interquartile range 54.0–57.0 days) in the placebo group and 55.5 days (interquartile range 50.5–56.0 days) in the selexipag group.

Patient selection. Eligible patients were age ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of SSc according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2013 classification criteria (total score of ≥ 9, including a score of 3 for the RP item) 21. Patients were required to have had ≥ 7 RP attacks on ≥ 5 different days during the baseline week and ≥ 80% eDiary compliance during the run‐in period. We excluded patients with a history of other conditions that can affect RP evaluation (for example, surgery [cervicothoracic sympathectomy, recent amputation, debridement] or recent treatment with botulinum toxin). Patients who received prostacyclin or prostacyclin analogs within 3 months of the screening visit were not eligible. Patients were permitted to take calcium‐channel blockers, nitrates or nitric oxide donors, endothelin receptor antagonists, alpha‐blockers, antithrombotic agents, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, beta‐blockers, clonidine, systemic corticosteroids, and fluoxetine during the study, provided that the dose had been stable in the month prior to screening and remained stable during the treatment period. Complete inclusion/exclusion criteria are provided in Supplementary Table 1, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at.

Study outcome measures. The primary efficacy end point was the weekly average number of RP attacks during the maintenance period. Other prespecified efficacy end points included number and proportion of patients with weekly average number of RP attacks in categories of improved (change from baseline week of at least –15%), stable (change from baseline week of between –15% and 15%), and worsened (change from baseline week of > 15%) during the maintenance period; change from baseline week to week 8 in the weekly average RP attack duration following randomization; change from baseline week to each postbaseline week in the weekly average Raynaud's Condition Score (RCS) 22 following randomization; number of new digital ulcers and number of baseline digital ulcers completely healed at week 8, and changes from baseline to week 8 in quality of life, as measured by the overall Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire 23, the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (HAQ DI) 24, and the hand components of the HAQ DI. Safety end points included treatment‐emergent adverse events (AEs) and laboratory assessments.

### Head-to-head comparison of udenafil vs amlodipine in the treatment of secondary Raynaud's phenomenon: a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study [^115JdqiR]. Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

RP is a reversible vasoconstriction of digital arteries that causes pain and skin discoloration. This study compared the efficacy of the new phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor udenafil with that of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine in the treatment of secondary RP.

Methods

A total of 29 patients with secondary RP associated with connective tissue diseases were enrolled in this double-blind, randomized, cross-over study. The patients were randomized to receive udenafil 100 mg/day or amlodipine 10 mg/day for 4 weeks. After a washout period they were crossed over to the other drug for another 4 weeks. The primary outcome was RP frequency before and after treatment. The secondary outcomes were RP condition scores, RP duration, number of digital ulcers, HAQ, physician global assessment and digital artery flow before and after treatment.

Results

Amlodipine and udenafil both decreased the rate of RP attack significantly. The drugs did not differ in terms of RP frequency or any of the secondary outcomes except for digital blood flow; udenafil improved it significantly better than amlodipine (P = 0.021). Udenafil was well tolerated without serious adverse effects.

Conclusion

Udenafil and amlodipine have comparable efficacy in improving RP attacks. In addition, udenafil improves the blood flow in digital arteries compared with amlodipine.

### Raynaud's phenomenon in mixed connective tissue disease [^113y1xAg]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon affects most patients who have mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) and frequently represents the initial manifestation of the disease. It is the cutaneous symptom of a systemic vasculopathy that is characterized by intimal fibrosis and blood vessel obliteration that frequently leads to visceral involvement, particularly pulmonary hypertension. An association between Raynaud's phenomenon and the characteristic autoantibody in MCTD, anti-U1-RNP (ribonucleoprotein), is found across the spectrum of rheumatic diseases, including undifferentiated connective tissue disease, scleroderma, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Capillary nailfold examination represents a valuable tool to identify patients who are at risk for MCTD. The goal in the therapy of Raynaud's phenomenon in MCTD is to decrease the frequency of attacks, to prevent digital ulceration, and to limit progressive vascular damage. Therapeutic regimens include the traditional use of calcium channel blockers and novel vascular therapies.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) — calcium channel blocker (CCB) therapy in acute vasoreactivity responders: High doses of CCBs are recommended in patients with idiopathic PAH (IPAH), heritable PAH (HPAH) and drug-induced PAH (DPAH) who are responders to acute vasoreactivity testing, with close follow-up and complete reassessment after 3–4 months of therapy (including right heart catheterization [RHC]). Continuation of high doses of CCBs is recommended in patients in World Health Organization functional class (WHO-FC) I or II with marked haemodynamic improvement (near normalization), whereas initiation of specific PAH therapy is recommended in patients in WHO-FC III or IV or those without marked haemodynamic improvement (near normalization) after high doses of CCBs. High doses of CCBs are not indicated in patients without a vasoreactivity study or in non-responders unless standard doses are prescribed for other indications (e.g. Raynaud's phenomenon).

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of Raynaud phenomenon [^1137SoAP]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2012). Medium credibility.

The past 10 years have seen the publication of results from several multicentre clinical trials in primary and systemic sclerosis (SSc)-related Raynaud phenomenon. The publication of these studies has occurred as a result of new insights into the pathogenesis of Raynaud phenomenon, which are directing new treatment approaches, and increased international collaboration between clinicians and scientists. Although the pathogenesis of Raynaud phenomenon is complex, abnormalities of the blood vessel wall, of neural control mechanisms and of intravascular (circulating) factors are known to interact and contribute. Key players relevant in drug development include nitric oxide, endothelin-1, alpha adrenergic receptor activation, abnormal signal transduction in vascular smooth muscle, oxidative stress and platelet activation. The main advances in diagnosis have been a clearer understanding of autoantibodies and of abnormal nailfold capillary patterns as independent predictors of SSc, and widespread use and increased availability of capillaroscopy. The ultimate aim is to translate the advances made in the pathophysiology and early diagnosis into development of treatments to prevent and reverse digital vascular dysfunction and injury. This Review provides an update of the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of Raynaud phenomenon. Current and future treatment approaches are discussed, and some key unanswered questions are highlighted.

Digital ulcer disease in SSc

What is the best management for digital ulceration in SSc?

Guideline recommendation for digital ulcers in SSc:

Severe digital vasculopathy with new tissue necrosis or critical ischaemia is an emergency requiring urgent clinical assessment (preferably within 48 hours) (1C, 95%).
Sildenafil (or tadalafil) is recommended as first-line agent in DU healing and secondary prevention and bosentan as second-line treatment in line with NHS England policy 210302P [1911] (1C, 99%).
Intravenous prostanoids may be considered to promote DU healing (1C, 98%).
Consider anti-platelet therapy in DU disease (particularly if local necrosis) (2C, 94%).
Digital (palmar) sympathectomy (with or without botulinum toxin injection) may be considered in those intolerant to systemic vasodilator meds and recurrent DU at a single site (2C, 95%).
Debridement of DU may promote healing (2C, 93%).
There should be access to SSc/CTD specialist wound care services to prevent and treat skin ulcers (1C, 98%).

What is the best management for Raynaud's phenomenon?

Guideline recommendation for RP in SSc:

Although therapeutic benefits appear modest, calcium channel blockers and other vasodilators should be considered in management of SSc-RP (1B, 100%).
Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5i such as sildenafil, tadalafil) and intravenous prostanoids are effective as second-line agents for refractory SSc-RP (1B, 99%).
Consider anti-platelet therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel) and statins in refractory SSc-RP given strong therapeutic rationale despite limited evidence (2C, 93%).
For rescue therapy in severe SSc-RP IV, prostanoids may be considered (1C, 99%).
Digital (palmar) sympathectomy (with or without botulinum toxin injection) which may be considered in severe and/or refractory cases of SSc-RP, particularly if systemic vasodilator therapies are poorly tolerated, e.g. low basal BP (2C, 93%).

Guideline Statement 12 — intralesional verapamil may be offered with caution given weak and conflicting evidence. Clinicians may offer intralesional verapamil for the treatment of patients with Peyronie's disease (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade C). The Panel notes that the evidence for the use of intralesional verapamil is weak; clinicians should carefully consider whether the use of this treatment is appropriate given the substantial uncertainty regarding its efficacy and the availability of other treatments that are clearly more effective. Intralesional verapamil was evaluated in nine randomized designs, including two RCTs, and eight observational studies, and this literature is challenging to interpret because of varied inclusion criteria, varied treatment protocols, and conflicting findings.

### Renin-angiotensin system mediators and Raynaud's phenomenon [^113hFELs]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon (RP).

Data Sources

Biomedical literature was accessed through July 2006 via PubMed, the Iowa Drug Information System (IDIS), and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) Plus. PubMed database terms included Raynaud's disease, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers [pharmacological action]; IDIS terms included hypotensive agents-ace inhib 24080200, raynaud's syndrome 443.0, and hypotensive agents-angioten II 24080400; and CINAHL Plus terms included Raynaud's disease, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, losartan, and irbesartan.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All clinical trials published in English that reported both subjective and objective outcomes of efficacy were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Several small, short-term studies have evaluated captopril, enalapril, and losartan in the treatment of RP. The studies of ACE inhibitors have found conflicting results in their ability to improve digit blood flow and reduce both frequency and severity of RP attacks. Two studies have focused on the use of losartan for RP treatment, with both finding a statistically significant reduction in attacks and one showing improvement in symptoms of RP in comparison with the commonly utilized calcium-channel blocker, nifedipine. Most of the studies were short term (≤ 12 wk) and included a limited number of patients (< 60).

Conclusions

ACE inhibitors and ARBs may provide some minor benefits in the relief of RP, although no definite evidence exists to suggest that they are superior to traditionally used treatments such as calcium-channel blockers. Larger, randomized controlled trials of longer duration are needed to compare the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors and ARBs with conventional treatment.

### Autoimmune disorders: nail signs and therapeutic approaches [^1125ogUu]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma, SSc) is an autoimmune disease that targets small and medium-sized arteries and arterioles in the involved tissues, resulting in a fibrotic vasculopathy and tissue fibrosis. Several prominent nail and periungual changes are apparent in scleroderma. Examination of the nail fold capillaries can reveal the nature and extent of microvascular pathology in patients with collagen vascular disease and Raynaud's phenomenon. Among the complications stemming from Raynaud's phenomenon can be painful ischemic digital ulcers. This can be managed, and potentially prevented, through pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic means. Whereas oral calcium channel blockers remain the most convenient therapy, oral endothelin receptor antagonists and intravenous prostaglandins may be important therapeutic advances for ischemic digital vascular lesions.

### Hypertension: sex-related differences in drug treatment, prevalence and blood pressure control in primary care [^1135AB4L]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Calcium-channel blockers

Dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (CCB) are also a first-line treatment in hypertension. The CCB are the only first-line drug class that can be initiated without knowledge and timely follow-up of electrolyte status and kidney function, making them a convenient choice when follow-up scheduling is challenging. The vasodilating effects of CCB can cause adverse effects encompassing dizziness, flushing, headache and tibial edema, which women are more likely to experience. Calcium-channel blockers, especially nifedipine, are safe to use during pregnancy. They are also a suitable choice for treating Raynaud phenomenon, which is more prevalent in women.

Thiazides

Thiazide-type and thiazide-like diuretics are also a first-line treatment in hypertension. Thiazide treatment is associated with a reduced risk of osteoporotic fractures, which predominantly afflict women. However, observational studies have suggested that this effect may, perhaps surprisingly, be clinically more discernible in men. One explanation to this finding could be that fracture risk in general is noticeably higher in women, and the fracture-protecting effect of thiazides might be ruled out by other more potent negative factors in women. Thiazides are also a first-line, pharmacological treatment option in patients with recurrent calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis who exhibit hyper-calciuria. Calcium-oxalate stones are the most frequent cause of nephrolithiasis and men are afflicted twice as often as women.

Hypokalemia and hyponatremia are frequent adverse effects of thiazides, which seem to afflict women to a greater degree than men, while men are more likely to develop hyperuricemia and gout. Men are also more likely to experience sexual dysfunction during thiazide treatment, primarily in the form of erectile dysfunction. Thiazides are rarely used in pregnancy due to risk of decreased placental perfusion and the decreased plasma volume associated with preeclampsia.

### Efficacy of radiofrequency thermocoagulation of the thoracic sympathetic nerve versus chemical excision in pain caused by Raynaud's disease [^116UsMFy]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Raynaud's disease is a dysfunctional vascular disorder characterized by pallor and bruising of the extremities in response to cold stimuli or emotional stress. Its clinical types are classified as primary and secondary. The former is idiopathic and usually does not leave serious complications. In contrast, secondary Raynaud's disease is mostly complicated by connective tissue diseases, such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjögren's syndrome. Patients with secondary Raynaud's disease may develop serious complications, such as ulceration of the fingers or toes and ischemic necrosis of the tissues. Currently, vasoactive drugs, mainly calcium channel blockers, remain an important clinical treatment for Raynaud's disease; however, previous studies have shown that relying on drugs alone does not seem to have the desired efficacy and commonly leads to some drug side effects. Calcium channel blockers seem to be associated with many adverse effects, such as headache, flushing, and ankle swelling. Recurrent episodes of experiencing cold and pain in extremities make patients suffer, thus seriously affecting their quality of life. Therefore, it is necessary to explore more effective treatment modalities to improve the prognosis of patients with Raynaud's disease.

### 2022 ESC / ERS guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension [^113tUD25]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

ESC/ERS pulmonary arterial hypertension — management of vasoreactive IPAH/HPAH/DPAH: High doses of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are recommended in responders to acute vasoreactivity testing (class I, level C). Close follow-up with complete reassessment after 3–4 months of therapy, including right heart catheterization (RHC), is recommended for patients treated with high-dose CCBs (class I, level C). Continuing high doses of CCBs is recommended in WHO functional class (WHO-FC) I or II with marked haemodynamic improvement, defined as mPAP < 30 mmHg and PVR < 4 WU (class I, level C). In patients with a positive vasoreactivity test but insufficient long-term response to CCBs who require additional pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) therapy, continuation of CCB therapy should be considered (class IIa, level C). CCBs are not recommended in patients without a vasoreactivity study or in non-responders, unless prescribed for other indications (e.g. Raynaud's phenomenon) (class III, level C).

Calcium channel blockers

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) including amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, lacidipine, lercanidipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, nimodipine and verapamil are mainly used for the treatment and prophylaxis of angina, and the treatment of hypertension where an ACEi/ARB is unsuitable. In patients with rheumatic disease, nifedipine or amlodipine are also used to treat Raynaud's phenomenon.

UKTIS has not identified an increased risk of congenital malformations or other adverse pregnancy outcomes with CCBs, although data remains too limited to draw firm conclusions on many outcomes. Data on rates of preterm delivery, foetal growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes are too limited and/or confounded to permit an accurate risk assessment, but where a CCB is required to treat maternal hypertension or as a tocolytic, foetal benefits of use are likely to outweigh any unspecified risk and treatment should not be withheld on this basis. Data is more limited for amlodipine so it is not included in alternatives to treat hypertension in pregnancy that include labetalol, nifedipine or methyldopa in order of preference.

LactMed describes low levels of nifedipine and amlodipine in breastmilk, without any adverse effects being reported among exposed infants. NICE guidance of other antihypertensive drugs that may be offered in breastfeeding mothers include nifedipine, amlodipine, atenolol or labetolol. Recommendations were based on evidence as shown in Supplementary Table S8, available at Rheumatology online.

Recommendations for CCBs in pregnancy and breastfeeding

Nifedipine is compatible with pregnancy with no direct evidence of harm at doses up to 90 mg/day (GRADE 1A, SOA 99.0).
Nifedipine is compatible with breastfeeding (GRADE 1B, SOA 100).
Amlodipine can be considered in pregnancy and breastfeeding as there is no evidence of harm (GRADE 1C, SOA 97.9).

Pulmonary vasodilators

Moderate-to-severe pulmonary hypertension (PHT) is a rare complication of certain ARDs and remains a contraindication to planned pregnancy with high mortality. Unintentional pregnancy and/or patient choice, however, means that treatment of this condition with specific pulmonary vasodilators may be required in pregnancy. Limited information on use of these drugs in human pregnancy was identified in the previous BSR guideline. No studies were identified examining pregnancy outcomes after paternal exposure to any of these pulmonary vasodilators.

### ADRA2A and IRX1 are putative risk genes for Raynaud's phenomenon [^115MbXUi]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Fig. 5
Scheme of the key finding.

In people without Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) stimulation of α 2A - and α 2C -adrenoreceptors contributes to vasoconstriction and lower blood flow. In patients with RP, blood flow is further reduced due to overexpression of α 2A -adrenoreceptors creating a state of hypersensitivity to catecholamine-release. Created with BioRender.com.

Currently, RP is treated depending on its severity. For mild cases, avoidance of triggers like cold or emotional stress might be sufficient, but severe vasospastic attacks require pharmacological interventions with calcium channel blockers as first-line response. However, the overall effectiveness of calcium channel blockersor alternative vasodilatory medications such as angiotensin receptor blockers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors is limited. Negative findings that overall align well with the absence of genetic evidence for those targets in our study. A staggering characteristic of the ADRA2A locus was the specificity in phenome-wide screens and comprehensive database lookups, which indicated an RP-specific effect. Such a characteristic may make the inhibition of the gene product, α 2A -adrenoreceptors, an interesting pharmacological target. This does not rule out that systemically administered antagonists might exert adverse effects, but inhibiting α 2A -adrenoreceptor activity in disease-relevant tissue, for example using topical solutions, might provide a safe and effective treatment option. There are already approved medications that target α 2 -adrenoreceptor antagonistically like the widely prescribed antidepressant mirtazapine, but they lack specificity for α 2A -adrenoreceptorand case reports described the occurrence or worsening of RP in two male patients under yohimbine treatment, another α 2 -adrenoreceptor antagonist, for erectile dysfunction. Clinical trials are needed to test whether treatment with mirtazapine, or topical solutions thereof, can indeed mitigate vasospastic attacks in patients with primary RP, also because an early study described relieved symptoms under methyldopa, an α 2 -adrenergic agonist.

### Anorexia nervosa and Raynaud's phenomenon: a case report [^116WqJV9]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe and discuss potential relationships between anorexia nervosa (AN) and Raynaud's phenomenon, the course and concurrent treatment of these two disorders as they appeared simultaneously, and a potential treatment modification entailed in such concurrent therapies.

Background

Although Raynaud's phenomenon has been described during the course of AN, the associations and interactions between these two conditions are not clear.

Method

We report the medical workup, treatment, and outcomes in a 19-year old female patient who developed Raynaud's phenomenon following the onset of AN.

Results

After treatment with nutritional rehabilitation, counseling, and individual and group therapy, the patient's weight, eating disorder-related behaviors, and attitudes improved significantly. Raynaud's related symptoms improved, following treatment with a calcium channel blocker and antiaggregant therapy. In conjunction with nutritional efforts to treat the patient's long-standing amenorrhea and osteopenia, the treatment team elected to also administer estrogen hormone in addition to oral calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Since oral contraceptives are to be avoided in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon who show clinical findings suggesting connective tissue disorder, the treatment team elected to treat this patient with transdermal hormone replacement therapy.

Conclusion

The co-occurrence of AN and Raynaud's phenomenon merits close and persistent follow-up by a multidisciplinary team and may lead to alterations of usual therapeutic approaches.

### Raynaud's phenomenon and digital ulcers: advances in evaluation and management [^112Qz3v6]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this review is to give an update on advances in evaluation and management of systemic sclerosis (SSc)-related Raynaud's phenomenon and digital ulceration, focusing on reports from the last 18 months. The increasing recognition of the huge impact of Raynaud's phenomenon and of digital ulceration on the everyday lives of patients with SSc has sparked enthusiasm internationally to develop better outcome measures and better treatments, and so a review is timely.

Recent Findings

There have been recent advances in the development of patient reported outcome instruments [e.g. the Hand Disability in Systemic Sclerosis-Digital Ulcers (HDISS-DU) instrument] and also in noninvasive imaging techniques, including thermography and laser Doppler methods. Improved outcome measures will facilitate future clinical trials, both early phase proof-of-concept and later phase trials. New insights have been gained into mechanisms of action and methods of administration of 'conventional' therapies, for example phosphodiesterase inhibitors and intravenous prostanoids. New treatment approaches are being investigated, including topical and procedural therapies.

Summary

Clinicians can look forward to seeing these advances translating into clinical benefit over the next 5 years. To help ensure this, they should strive whenever possible to recruit patients with SSc-related digital vasculopathy into observational studies and clinical trials.

### The outcome of angiography in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon: an unexpected role for atherosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia [^116fixjQ]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Upper extremity angiography can make an important contribution to the diagnosis in vasculopathy. The present study was designed to assess the diagnostic role of upper extremity angiography in patients with disturbed circulation of the hand, according to a standardised protocol.

Methods

The study was carried out in an outpatient setting in 103 patients suffering from bilateral Raynaud's phenomenon without any obvious underlying disease and who were unresponsive to nifedipine and aspirin. All patients had angiographies taken according to a standardized technique using vasodilating medication, and reviewed according to a standardised protocol that covered all the known characteristics of angiopathy such as diminished flow, stops, tortuosity, irregularity of the wall, tapering, collaterals and blushing.

Results

Standardised angiograms showed vasculopathy compatible with primary vasospasm in 42 patients [all women; mean age 35.1 years], atherosclerotic vascular disease in 44 patients [M/F 9/35; mean age 46.7 years], peripheral embolism in 8 patients [M/F 4/4; mean age 38.4 years], vasculitis in 3 patients [3 women; mean age 38 years] and Buerger's disease in 3 patients [3 men; mean age 47 years]. Inter-observer differences were present in 4 cases, but consensus could be reached through open discussion. An unexpected 47% of patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease had dyslipidemia, frequently of familial origin.

Conclusions

The standardised angiography protocol proved to be helpful in the assessment of upper extremity angiography. Surprisingly, a high prevalence of angiographic abnormalities compatible with atherosclerotic vascular disease could already be diagnosed in relatively young patients with Raynaud's phenomenon, of whom 47% showed hypercholesterolemia.

### Systemic sclerosis in adults. part II: management and therapeutics [^111D1mV2]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The management of systemic sclerosis (SSc) is complex, evolving, and requires a multidisciplinary approach. At diagnosis and throughout the disease course, clinical assessment and monitoring of skin involvement is vital using the modified Rodnan Skin Score, patient-reported outcomes, and new global composite scores (such as the Combined Response Index for Systemic Sclerosis, which also considers lung function). Immunomodulation is the mainstay of skin fibrosis treatment, with mycophenolate mofetil considered first line. Meanwhile vasculopathy-related manifestations (Raynaud's phenomenon, digital ulcers) and calcinosis, require general measures combined with specific pharmacologic (calcium-channel blockers, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, and prostanoids), nonpharmacologic (digital sympathectomy and botulinum toxin injections), and often multifaceted, management approaches. Patients should be screened at the time of diagnosis specifically for systemic manifestations and then regularly thereafter, with appropriate treatment. Numerous targeted therapeutic options for SSc, including skin fibrosis, are emerging and include B-cell depletion, anti-interleukin 6, Janus kinase, and transforming growth factor β inhibition. This second article in the continuing medical education series discusses these key aspects of SSc assessment and treatment, with particular focus on skin involvement. It is vital that dermatologists play a key role in the multidisciplinary approach to SSc management.

### The British society of gastroenterology / UK-PBC primary biliary cholangitis treatment and management guidelines [^112RkcSE]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Miscellaneous

Up to one-quarter of patients with PBC have Raynaud's phenomenon which occurs due to spasmodic arterial contraction in the extremities (usually fingers and toes, but sometimes ears and nose). Patients should be asked specifically about the classical symptoms of their extremities turning white, then blue and finally red, often associated with pain/burning/tingling when the blood flow returns. Practical measures, such as wearing gloves, using hand warmers and avoiding cold environments, are often all that are needed for mild symptoms. For more marked symptoms, vasodilators such as calcium channel blockers can be used. Specialist rheumatological advice should be sought for severe symptoms and those at risk of digital ulceration. Approximately 8% of patients with PBC have limited scleroderma (CREST syndrome: Calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, oEsophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly, Telangiectasia). These symptoms and signs should be sought and, if present, patients should be referred for rheumatology advice. Social isolation, fatigue, anxiety and depression are important predictors of poor perceived QoL in PBC. Primary care providers should consider assessing patients for features of depression and, where appropriate, a trial of antidepressants may be helpful.

### Evaluation of the safety of calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists for migraine treatment among adults with Raynaud phenomenon [^1131XXe8]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

A new class of medications known as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibitors has been recently approved for the treatment of episodic and chronic migraine. There are 2 types of available CGRP inhibitors: (1) monoclonal antibodies that bind the CGRP receptor or ligand and (2) small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonists. These medications suppress activity of CGRP, a neuropeptide located in the peripheral and central nervous system that is involved in pain modulation, particularly in the trigeminovascular system.

In addition to its role in the nervous system, CGRP confers potent vasodilatory effects, which may clinically manifest as flushing. Deficiency of CGRP may play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of scleroderma and Raynaud phenomenon (RP). In scleroderma, there are fewer CGRP-supplying nerves, and in RP, there may be CGRP deficiency in the distal or acral skin. Cutaneous blood flow increases in these patients after CGRP infusion. A previous studyexamined the effects of systemic therapy with calcitonin in patients with scleroderma, finding a reduction of digital ulceration and improvement in pulmonary function after infusion. In another study, the use of CGRP antagonists was associated with digital ulceration in 2 patients with underlying RP.

Microvascular complications of migraine therapies predate the advent of CGRP modulators, as evidenced by worsening RP documented in the use of vasoactive medications, such as ergot alkaloids, triptans, and β-blockers. With the emergence of CGRP antagonists as a mainstay in prophylactic and rescue migraine therapy, it is crucial to identify patients at risk for complications to develop appropriate and safe prescribing guidelines. In this study, we identified patients with primary or secondary RP while taking CGRP antagonists for migraine therapy and assessed for cutaneous microvascular complications.

### Efficacy and safety of selexipag in adults with Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to systemic sclerosis: a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study [^112RyjcU]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of selexipag on the frequency of RP attacks in patients with RP secondary to SSc. The rationale for this evaluation included the observation that other drugs targeting the prostacyclin pathway (e.g. intravenous iloprost) have shown some efficacy in RP secondary to SSc 18. However, selexipag did not reduce the number of RP attacks compared with placebo, and therefore the study did not meet its primary objective. The safety profile of selexipag was consistent with that observed previously in studies of patients with PAH 19, 25, with no new safety events identified.

Recent systematic reviews have noted that there have been few randomized controlled trials in RP, including in SSc‐related RP 26, 27, 28, 29. This dearth of studies is related to the complexities of study design in RP, which includes the need to run trials during the winter months to minimize the effects of seasonality 30. Despite its negative findings, our study is important because it draws attention to a number of learning points that will help to optimize clinical trial design. One particular point of note for future trial design is the issue of a placebo response in studies of RP. The placebo effect is often a confounder in the evaluation of RP in a clinical trial setting 12, 31. In our study, the placebo effect was notable, with many placebo‐treated patients reporting good outcomes. Patient‐reported outcomes may be particularly sensitive to the placebo effect 30; it may be that placebo‐treated patients experience fewer AEs and subsequently report better outcomes compared with patients receiving active treatment who are subject to side effects. Another potential contributing factor may be the difference between groups in the number of tablets taken; a greater proportion of placebo‐treated patients reached a higher placebo‐equivalent dose and therefore received more tablets. Taking more tablets may be associated with an increased placebo effect 32. Also, by specifically recruiting patients who report a high number of RP attacks, we may have selected a population in which the placebo effect is particularly apparent.

### Wound, pressure ulcer, and burn guidelines (2023)-4: guidelines for the management of connective tissue disease / vasculitis-associated skin ulcers, third edition [^116jZ29K]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding the following drugs, we concluded that RCTs did not confirm their preventive or curative effects on the onset of new skin ulcers or that the level of evidence from RCTs was low: beraprost sodium, lipo‐PGE1 preparations, nifedipine, atorvastatin, iloprost, udenafil, quinapril, cyclophosphamide, selexipag, treprostinil, botulinum toxin, and riociguat.

However, in clinical practice, prostaglandin preparations, calcium antagonists, and antiplatelet drugs have been empirically used for the treatment of SSc‐associated skin ulcers. In particular, many studies reported their usefulness for treating Raynaud phenomenon as a vascular lesion. Combination therapy with these drugs is also considered for the prevention and treatment of SSc‐associated skin ulcers in clinical practice (refer to Explanation 1, Chapter 5).

Furthermore, caution is needed for the use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists. With respect to the effects of the former on vascular lesions, an RCT with quinapril showed that there was no improvement in the frequency or severity of Raynaud phenomenon, and that new skin ulcer onset was not inhibited. Concerning angiotensin II receptor antagonists, a comparative study of losartan potassium with nifedipine for Raynaud phenomenon was performed. There were slight improvements in the frequency and severity of Raynaud phenomenon in patients with SSc, but they were not significant. The two drugs did not significantly ameliorate Raynaud phenomenon as a vascular lesion. In addition, ACE inhibitors are effective for scleroderma renal crisis, but their usefulness in prophylactic administration remains to be clarified. Furthermore, a recent large‐scale, prospective cohort study in Europe showed that the administration of ACE inhibitors rather increased the risk of scleroderma renal crisis. Based on these findings, if other drugs are available, the introduction of ACE inhibitors only for the prevention and treatment of skin ulcers should be carefully examined.

3.4 Precautions for clinical use

Among the recommended drugs, bosentan administration for preventing the onset of new skin ulcers is covered by health insurance. As an adverse reaction, the incidence of liver dysfunction is high, and there are serious cases; therefore, caution is required. On the other hand, bosentan administration for treating skin ulcers is not covered by health insurance. PDE5 inhibitors are covered by health insurance only for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Therefore, whether the recommended drugs are indicated must be carefully considered.

### Raynaud phenomenon of the nipple in breastfeeding mothers: an underdiagnosed cause of nipple pain [^117NXks3]. JAMA Dermatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Objective

To elucidate the diagnostic criteria of Raynaud phenomenon of the nipple that will aid in recognizing and treating Raynaud phenomenon in breast feeding mothers with chronic deep nipple pain during lactation.

Design

Retrospective review of a patient database composed of 22 cases of breastfeeding mothers who fit the diagnostic criteria for Raynaud phenomenon of the nipple.

Setting

Menlo Dermatology Medical Group in Menlo Park, California, an academic-affiliated, private dermatologic referral center.

Patients

All patients diagnosed as having Raynaud phenomenon of the nipple evaluated from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2010.

Main Outcome Measures

The rate of failed treatment for Candida mastitis, the rate of improvement of symptoms with nifedipine use, and the overall rate of improvement of symptoms with appropriate therapy involving treatment of Raynaud phenomenon.

Results

Among the 22 patients with Raynaud phenomenon of the nipple, previous treatment for Candida mastitis with oral or topical antifungals was ineffective in 20(91%). Of the 12 patients who tolerated a trial of nifedipine,10 (83%) reported decreased or resolved nipple pain. All patients experienced marked improvement of symptoms with appropriate therapy involving treatment of Raynaud phenomenon.

Conclusions

Most patients were treated with antifungals before presentation without resolution of nipple pain. Nifedipine appears to be an effective medication for the treatment of Raynaud phenomenon of the nipple. With appropriate management of Raynaud phenomenon, breastfeeding mothers demonstrated improvement of nipple pain. Raynaud phenomenon of the nipple should be considered in the differential diagnosis of nipple pain during lactation.

### Effects of long-term cyclic iloprost therapy in systemic sclerosis with Raynaud's phenomenon. A randomized, controlled study [^114z5WvE]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Iloprost is a stable prostacyclin analogue which has been shown to be effective in the short-term symptomatic treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) secondary to systemic sclerosis (SSc). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of long-term cyclic therapy with iloprost in comparison with nifedipine on the skin score, pulmonary function and Raynaud's severity score in patients with SSc and RP.

Methods

We conducted a 12-month prospective, randomised, parallel-group, blind-observer trial to compare the effects of intravenously infused iloprost (2 ng/kg/min on 5 consecutive days over a period of 8 hours/day and subsequently for 8 hours on one day every 6 weeks) with those of conventional vasodilating therapy with nifedipine (40 mg/day for os) in 46 patients with SSc and RP.

Results

At 12 months, iloprost but not nifedipine reduced the skin score (iloprost: from 13.26 ± 2.05 to 9.26 ± 1.32, p = 0.002; nifedipine: from 10.83 ± 2.09 to 12.17 ± 3.02, p = n.s.; iloprost vs nifedipine: p = 0.016) and the RP severity score (iloprost: from 2.17 ± 0.2 to 1.22 ± 0.13, p = 0.02 vs baseline; nifedipine: from 2.08 ± 0.34 to 1.33 ± 0.22, p = n.s.). Carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO), expressed as % of the predicted normal value, worsened significantly in the nifedipine group (from 69.6 ± 7.4% to 61.5 ± 6.5%, p = 0.044) and remained stable in patients treated with iloprost (from 53.2 ± 4.8 to 56.0 ± 4.6%, iloprost vs nifedipine: p = 0.026).

Conclusion

In SSc patients, cyclic intravenous iloprost infusion is able to control vasospastic disease. Our results suggest that it might also act as a disease-modifying agent, as it seems to improve the course of the disease. Further studies principally focused on organ involvement and the natural history of the disease are needed to confirm our results.

### Effectiveness of calcium channel blockers for Raynaud phenomenon… [^1122JXZV]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Are calcium channel blockers effective therapy for Raynaud phenomenon. Evidence-Based Answer CCBs are modestly effective at reducing the frequency of attacks of primary Raynaud phenomenon. There is no evidence that attack severity or physiologic measurements are reduced by CCBs. Treatment is associated with adverse effects such as headache, flushing, and edema. 1 Avoidance of precipitating factors has long been the primary treatment approach, with pharmacotherapy reserved for patients who have persistent or severe symptoms. There are no clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of primary Raynaud phenomenon. CCBs are the most widely used medications for Raynaud phenomenon.

Other agents, such as endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, vasodilators, and onabotulinumtoxinA, have been proposed as treatment for Raynaud phenomenon with minimal success. 2 A previous meta-analysis from 2005 concluded that CCBs moderately reduce the frequency of attacks by a mean of 5. 00 per week and reduce the severity of attacks by 33%. 3 The criteria for inclusion of studies in the current meta-analysis were stricter than in the 2005 publication. This meta-analysis included only persons with primary Raynaud phenomenon. Seven randomized trials of CCBs vs. placebo were included with a total of 296 participants. Three of the studies had six or fewer participants. The heterogeneity of these trials made quantitative pooling of data impossible for most outcomes, including severity of Raynaud phenomenon attacks.

All seven trials were published before the introduction of the Raynaud's Condition Score, a validated outcome tool for Raynaud phenomenon. Avoidance of inciting factors continues to be the mainstay of therapy for Raynaud phenomenon. Based on this review, CCBs can provide limited benefit for most patients but are likely to cause adverse effects. However, there are few other medical options available for these patients. Because there are no treatment guidelines for physicians, a frank discussion of the benefits and risks should take place before prescribing CCBs to patients with Raynaud phenomenon.

Digital vasculopathy

Digital vasculopathy leads to Raynaud's and digital ischaemia with development of complications of severe vasculopathy including gangrene, ulceration, and infection of superficial and deep tissues. In children, similar approaches used to adults but consider availability of jSSc dosing and pharmacokinetic data.

What is the best management for digital ulceration in SSc?

Recommendation for digital ulcers (DU) in SSc:

Severe digital vasculopathy with new tissue necrosis or critical ischaemia is an emergency requiring urgent clinical assessment (preferably within 48 h) (1C, 95%).
Sildenafil (or tadalafil) is recommended as first line agent in DU healing and secondary prevention and bosentan as second-line treatment in line with NHS England policy 210302P [1911] (1C, 99%).
I.v. prostanoids may be considered to promote DU healing (1C, 98%).
Consider anti-platelet therapy in DU disease (particularly if local necrosis) (2C, 94%).
Digital (palmar) sympathectomy (with or without botulinum toxin injection) may be considered in those intolerant to systemic vasodilator meds and recurrent DU at a single site (2C, 95%).
Debridement of DU may promote healing (2C, 93%).
There should be access to SSc/CTD specialist wound care services to prevent and treat skin ulcers (1C, 98%).

What is the best management for RP?

Guideline recommendation for RP in SSc:

Although therapeutic benefits appear modest, calcium channel blockers and other vasodilators should be considered in management of SSc-RP (1B, 100%).
PDE5i (e.g. sildenafil, tadalafil) and i.v. prostanoids are effective as second-line agent for refractory SSc-RP (1B, 99%).
Consider anti-platelet therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel) and statins in refractory SSc-RP given strong therapeutic rationale despite limited evidence (2C, 93%).
For rescue therapy in severe SSc-RP, i.v. prostanoids may be considered (1C, 99%).
Digital (palmar) sympathectomy (with or without botulinum toxin injection) which may be considered in severe and/or refractory cases of SSc-RP — particularly if systemic vasodilator therapies poorly tolerated, e.g. low basal blood pressure (2C, 93%).

### A phase 2 trial investigating the effects of the angiotensin II type 2 receptor agonist C21 in systemic sclerosis-related Raynaud's [^115bHgxj]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

The study was conducted from 3 January to 14 December 2020, and a total of 21 patients were screened (patient flow through study shown in Supplementary Fig. S1, available at Rheumatology online). Due to lock-down of the research facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic, the sponsor decided to stop recruitment when 12 patients had completed the study: it would have been very difficult to recruit further patients over the winter months. All were female and all had the limited cutaneous subtype of SSc, with a median age of 58.5 (range 35–69) years, a median duration of RP of 19.0 (range 0.4–41.0) years, and a median time since SSc diagnosis (since first non-Raynaud's manifestation) of 12.4 (range 0.4–39.0) years (Supplementary Table S1, available at Rheumatology online). Nine were anticentromere antibody positive and one was anti-topoisomerase positive (the other two patients were negative for SSc-specific autoantibodies). Five patients were on vasodilator therapy (three on nifedipine, one on amlodipine and one on sildenafil) and none was on immunosuppressant or systemic corticosteroid therapy. At screening, median RCS was 4.0 (range 1–10) and median mRSS was 1.0 (range 0–4). On nailfold capillaroscopy, median capillary density was 3.37/mm (range 0.45–6.41) and median capillary width 19.58 (range 11.45–42.00).

Response to cold challenge

Rewarming profiles after C21 and placebo are shown in Fig. 1, and results are summarized in Table 1. C21 showed a numeric advantage over placebo on the primary outcome (AUC) but the difference was not statistically significant (Table 1). MAX was significantly higher after treatment with C21 than after placebo (Table 1) and GRAD (over the first 2 min) was lower (i.e. temperature recovery was slower), although not significantly. At the end of the rewarming period the patients had recovered 62.7% and 47.5% of the drop during the cold challenge on the C21 and placebo days, respectively (P = 0.084). Mean temperature difference between the treatment periods gradually increased over time (Fig. 1).

### Electrocardiographic markers for the prediction of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with systemic sclerosis [^114PCDjZ]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Due to a lack of studies with appropriate evidence levels, the antiarrhythmic therapy of scleroderma patients remains empiric. Since amiodarone may enhance pulmonary fibrosis, its use is limited in this particular indication. The sodium channel blockers (Class I antiarrhythmic drugs, e.g. propafenone, quinidine, flecainide, etc.) should also be avoided, as they may cause ischaemia–reperfusion effect and proarrhythmia. In autoimmune diseases the beta adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol and its combination with a dihydropyridine type calcium channel blocker (CCB) (e.g. felodipine) is applicable without the worsening of RP. The beta adrenoceptor antagonists carvedilol and nebivolol have been shown to be applied the most effectively as a treatment for cardiac rhythm disturbances due to their vasodilator properties, without having a harmful effect on Raynaud's symptoms and peripheral arterial circulation. In the case of scleroderma heart disease, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and CCBs are thought to be useful therapeutic tools. According to a retrospective study based on the data of 7000 SSc patients, CCBs have been shown to decrease the prevalence of LV dysfunction. The application of dihydropyridine-type CCBs (e.g. nifedipine, felodipine, amlodipine, etc.) in SSc can be favourable; their vasodilator effect improves the peripheral circulation, which increases the perfusion of the myocardium. Furthermore, the beneficial property of nifedipine on myocardial perfusion in SSc patients may appear even after 2 weeks of treatment. Valentini et al. found that 448 out of 601 SSc patients took CCBs combined with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (mainly valsartan and candensartan). During the follow-up period, the vasodilator therapy had to be terminated or modified in only 15 cases due to peripheral vascular adverse effects. Importantly, the administration of vasodilator treatment was associated with a reduced occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias (P = 0.03). Regarding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, the use of ramipril (2.5–5 mg/day) may be favourable; in addition to its positive cardiovascular effects, it can also reduce the progression of scleroderma kidney disease. Among non-dihydropyridine CCBs, verapamil is preferred for the treatment of supraventricular arrhythmias in SSc. Digoxin, spironolactone, furosemide, procainamide or mexiletine can also be administered in the case of recurrent ventricular arrhythmias. Wada et al. have shown that in SSc patients with cardiac amyloidosis, combined diuretic, angiotensin-receptor blocker and beta-blocker treatment alongside anti-TNF therapy could also improve cardiac function. A novel agent, C188-9, may reduce the fibrotic activity in scleroderma, as it inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation. Consequently, it significantly decreases the activity of TGF-β1 and IL-6 pathways. During phase 1 investigations with C188-9 in an SSc mouse model, a definitive reduction of cardiac fibrosis has been detected.

### A patient with a purple, edematous great toe [^115QJNeJ]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following is considered the first-line treatment for acute sarcoid dactylitis?
A. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors
B. Methotrexate
C. Systemic corticosteroids
D. Calcium channel blockers
E. Sulfasalazine

Answers:
A. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors – Incorrect. TNF- α inhibitors may be used for long-term management but are not considered first-line therapy. Although no clinical trials have established an optimal therapy, both infliximab and adalimumab have been reported in the treatment of sarcoidosis, including cases with musculoskeletal involvement.
B. Methotrexate – Incorrect. This agent may be used in refractory or chronic cases but is not the initial treatment choice.
C. Systemic corticosteroids – Correct. Systemic corticosteroids are considered the first-line treatment for acute sarcoid dactylitis. Treatment often involves oral corticosteroids in the range of 15 to 20 mg per day, with dosing adjusted based on clinical response. Higher doses have been used in cases of more active or severe disease.
D. Calcium channel blockers – Incorrect. These are used for conditions like pernio and Raynaud's phenomenon but have no established role in sarcoid dactylitis treatment.
E. Sulfasalazine – Incorrect. While sulfasalazine is used in the management of inflammatory arthritis, it has no recognized role in the treatment of sarcoid dactylitis.

### Management of Raynaud phenomenon and digital ulcers in scleroderma [^114RFWsc]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Raynaud phenomenon (RP) and associated digital ischemia can be among the most vexing clinical problems for patients with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). Understanding the treatment approach to RP and associated ischemia and how to prevent digital ulcers is important for clinicians caring for these patients. This article reviews the management of RP and digital ischemic ulcers. The magnitude of the problem and pathophysiology of RP are first discussed, with an emphasis on recent advances in understanding of the disease process. Options for the practical pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for RP and digital ischemic ulcers are detailed.

Early diagnosis of SSc

The cardinal aspects of early diagnosis must incorporate history, examination and investigation. There are substantial implications for making a diagnosis of SSc and important considerations when the diagnosis is confidently excluded. There will be people where a risk of future development of SSc is identified. Making an early diagnosis includes the following:

History: Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) provides a window of opportunity for early diagnosis although in early dcSSc where sometimes Raynaud's onset is contemporaneous with, or even after, onset of non-Raynaud's manifestations of SSc.
Examination: Puffy fingers.
Investigation: Includes ANA, nailfold capillaroscopy, SSc-specific autoantibodies.

Over the past few years, the concept of very early diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (VEDOSS) has emerged. This is important because emerging data suggest that significant complications of the disease may already be developing at this stage. It is notable that cases with all the 'red flag' VEDOSS features of RP, puffy fingers, ANA, SSc-specific antibody, abnormal nailfold capillaroscopy would already fulfil 2013 EULAR/ACR Classification criteria for SSc but those with incomplete features have a high probability of progression to SSc.

Nailfold capillaroscopy is central to diagnosis, although a recent survey suggested 41% of UK rheumatologists do not access capillaroscopy on site and 27% do not use capillaroscopy at all.

Early onset features of SSc in children are much less defined and might be influenced by distinct features of jSSc such as greater frequency of overlap manifestations and different ANA profiles form adult-onset SSc. Expertise in paediatric nailfold capillaroscopy is limited with a UK survey showing 14% of paediatric rheumatologists did not undertake capillaroscopy. Additionally, normative values for children are not yet established. Assessment of nailfold capillaries is central to early diagnosis and differentiating primary from secondary RP and may be undertaken using a dermatoscope, or low-cost USB microscope if more sophisticated capillaroscopy is not available.

In considering early diagnosis, cases of SSc that present with organ-based complications without pre-existing diagnosis of SSc are important. These are seen in PH, ILD and gastroenterology clinics as well as in acute medicine and nephrology for cases of scleroderma renal crisis (SRC), where up to 20% may not have a pre-existing diagnosis. Classification criteria for SRC are being developed that will also assist with earlier diagnosis of SSc in these cases.

### Efficacy of tadalafil in secondary Raynaud's phenomenon resistant to vasodilator therapy: a double-blind randomized cross-over trial [^111vaHLw]. Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of tadalafil as add-on therapy in secondary RP resistant to vasodilators.

Methods

Patients with scleroderma and MCTD having four or more RP attacks per week despite being on vasodilators were randomized to receive either placebo or tadalafil (20mg) on alternate days as add-on therapy to their current vasodilators for 6 weeks. After a 7-day washout, patients were crossed over to the other arm. Primary endpoints were improvement in the daily frequency and duration of RP episodes and RP condition score (RCS). Secondary outcome measures were healing of existing and appearance of new digital ulcers (DUs) and improvement in scleroderma-specific HAQ (SHAQ), quality of life (QoL), flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), patient and physician global assessment.

Results

Twenty-four of 25 recruited patients completed the study. All the patients were receiving calcium channel blockers and in addition 18 were receiving other vasodilators. During tadalafil therapy significant improvement in mean daily frequency, mean daily duration of RP and mean daily RCS were observed as compared with baseline and placebo. All the 24 digital lesions healed during tadalafil therapy as compared with 3/13 during the placebo treatment (P < 0.0001). One new DU was reported during tadalafil therapy vs 13 during placebo therapy (P = 0.0005). QoL, SHAQ, FMD, patient and physician global assessment significantly improved while on tadalafil. No serious adverse event was observed.

Conclusion

Tadalafil as add-on therapy improves symptoms of RP, heals and prevents new DUs and improves QoL in patients with resistant secondary RP.

### Efficacy and safety of selexipag in adults with Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to systemic sclerosis: a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study [^1111ZpZT]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Structural vasculopathy and vasospasm are features of SSc 33, and it is possible that treatment acting to restore vasoreactivity could lead to greater awareness of RP attacks, thereby masking a potential treatment effect. This potential confounding factor is likely to be more acute over a short observation period, and a longer observation period may be warranted to discern any potential treatment effect.

The number of new digital ulcers reported during the double‐blind period was low in both treatment groups and lower than that in previous studies with double‐blind or open‐label treatment that specifically focused on digital ulcers 34, 35, 36, 37, 38. However, this study was not designed or powered to assess the impact of selexipag on digital ulcers.

Although not fully understood, the pathogenesis of RP secondary to SSc is linked to structural and functional changes in the vasculature leading to impaired blood flow and an imbalance in the levels of neurotransmitters controlling vasodilation and vasoconstriction, and SSc‐related RP has been associated with smoking, hormonal changes, and genetic factors 39. As there is evidence that selexipag is efficacious in other forms of vasculopathy and some evidence that other therapies targeting the prostacyclin pathway can have a positive effect on RP, differences in efficacy due to the route of administration also need to be considered. Intravenous iloprost has shown efficacy in reducing the number, severity, and duration of RP attacks 14, 15, 16, 17, 40, 41; however, consistent benefits have not been seen in trials evaluating oral iloprost 42, 43, 44. This raises the question of whether the route of administration of selexipag may have an impact on the potential for a treatment response. One might consider targeting SSc vasculopathy with IP prostacyclin receptor agonists, such as selexipag, but via a different mode of administration. Furthermore, future studies may include the use of objective measurements to assess clinically relevant end points in SSc vasculopathy.

### Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) for the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon [^114L3nAH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Raynaud's phenomenon is a vasodilatory phenomenon characterised by digital pallor, cyanosis, and pain of the extremities. Primary Raynaud's phenomenon has no underlying disease associated with it, while secondary Raynaud's phenomenon is associated with connective tissue disorders such as systemic sclerosis. Systemic sclerosis causes fibrosis and commonly affects the skin and internal organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, kidney, and heart. Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) are a class of drugs that increases blood flow to the extremities and may be beneficial in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of PDE5i compared to placebo for the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, and clinical trial registries up to June 2022. We did not apply any language restrictions. We searched the bibliographies of retrieved articles and contacted key experts in the field for additional and unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PDE5i to placebo in people with primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

This review included nine RCTs which ranged in duration from four to eight weeks and included a total of 411 participants. The majority had Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to systemic sclerosis. Tadalafil was assessed in four studies, sildenafil in three studies, vardenafil in one study, and a new PDE5 inhibitor known as "PF-00489791" in one study. Three studies were parallel design and six studies were cross-over. The frequency of attacks per week was 24 with placebo and PDE5i reduced the frequency of attacks by an average of three attacks per week (mean difference (MD) -3.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.15 to -1.00; 8 studies; low-certainty evidence). The duration of attacks per day was 55 minutes with placebo and PDE5i reduced the duration of attacks by an average of five minutes (MD -5.31, 95% CI -8.90 to -1.71; 8 studies; low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence from one study with eight participants showed severity of Raynaud's attacks (assessed on a 10 cm visual analogue scale with lower scores indicating less severity) was 20% lower with a PDE5i (3.7 with placebo compared to 1.6 with treatment; MD -2.1, 95% CI -2.7 to 1.4; very low-certainty evidence). Pain and patient global assessment were assessed on a 10 cm visual analogue scale with lower scores indicating improvement. Low-certainty evidence showed that the use of PDE5i may result in little to no difference compared to placebo in reducing the average pain of Raynaud's attacks (3 to 2.9; MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.78 to 0.57; 4 studies). Global scores were 36% lower with the use of a PDE5i compared to placebo (9.2 to 5.6; MD -3.59, 95% CI -4.45 to -2.73; 1 study, 24 participants; low-certainty evidence). The rate of withdrawals during treatment with PDE5i ranged from 2% to 20% compared with 2% to 4% in the placebo group in five studies. Four studies reported no withdrawals due to adverse events. Seven studies reported no serious adverse events. The rate of serious adverse events reported in two studies ranFged from 2% during treatment to 4% with placebo. The majority of the studies were judged as low or unclear risk of bias for selection, performance, and detection bias. Almost half were judged at high risk of attrition bias and unclear risk for selective reporting bias. We downgraded frequency of attacks, duration of attacks, pain intensity, and patient global assessment for small sample sizes and concerns about inconsistency and graded each as low certainty of evidence. We downgraded severity of attacks to very low certainty due to serious concerns about imprecision and publication bias. We downgraded withdrawals due to adverse events and serious adverse events to moderate certainty of evidence due to a low number of reported events.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on low-certainty evidence, PDE5i may reduce the frequency of attacks of Raynaud's phenomenon by a small amount per week, result in a small reduction in the duration of attack, improve patients' global assessment of their disease, and result in little to no difference in pain. PDE5i probably result in little or no difference in serious adverse events but slightly increase the likelihood of withdrawing from treatment due to an adverse event.

### Cutaneous dyspigmentation with perifollicular sparing [^112GBCJq]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Which of the following is the most appropriate first-line treatment for depigmentation in SSc?
A. Mycophenolate mofetil
B. Nifedipine
C. Tofacitinib
D. Methotrexate
E. UV phototherapy

Answers:
A. Mycophenolate mofetil – Correct. Mycophenolate mofetil is often used as first-line treatment for cutaneous manifestations in SSc. A case series demonstrated its efficacy with > 75% improvement of salt and pepper depigmentation after 12 months of treatment with doses ranging 1.5 to 3 g/d.
B. Nifedipine – Incorrect. This calcium channel blocker is used as a first-line treatment for Raynaud phenomenon in SSc. There are no studies in the current literature to support the use of nifedipine in the treatment of depigmentation associated with SSc.
C. Tofacitinib – Incorrect. The Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription pathway has been implicated as the pathogenesis of depigmentation in SSc, similar to vitiligo. The use of a Janus kinase inhibitor has shown to be successful in disease control and repigmentation in 1 case report of a patient with diffuse SSc. Given the lack of evidence, it would not be the most appropriate first-line treatment.
D. Methotrexate – Incorrect. There are no studies in the current literature to support the use of methotrexate in the treatment of salt and pepper depigmentation in SSc.
E. UV phototherapy – Incorrect. One case report hypothesized that their patient experienced "autorepigmentation" after exposure to natural sunlight. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have addressed the use of phototherapy in treating depigmentation in SSc.
