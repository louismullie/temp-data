## Question

What are the typical diagnostic tests for lymphoma in children?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the typical diagnostic tests for lymphoma in children. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial clinical assessment and when to suspect lymphoma. Then, I should verify the core laboratory workup. Next, I will examine tissue diagnosis and pathology requirements, including what to avoid. After that, I need to review staging imaging, including PET/CT, PET/MRI, and alternatives. I will then consider special populations and ancillary tests. Finally, I should confirm response assessment criteria and surveillance principles, and close with a concise synthesis of the typical test sequence with citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical foundation: a careful history and physical examination to document B symptoms and map nodal and extranodal sites is essential, and I should not jump to conclusions before establishing pretest probability and documenting baseline status, because this frames all subsequent testing and interpretation [^6935c8bb] [^f2786a25].

> Wait, let me verify the core laboratory panel. The typical baseline workup includes CBC with differential, ESR and/or CRP, and a comprehensive metabolic panel including liver enzymes, bilirubin, creatinine, and electrolytes; lactate dehydrogenase is prognostically important and should be added, and I should remember to order HIV and hepatitis B/C testing when risk factors or atypical presentations are present, with pregnancy testing before therapy in those of childbearing potential [^6935c8bb] [^f2786a25] [^58967a88].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about tissue diagnosis. I need to ensure adequate tissue is obtained: excisional or incisional biopsy of the most accessible node is preferred; core needle biopsy may suffice if diagnostic, but fine-needle aspiration alone is not appropriate for initial diagnosis because architecture and immunophenotyping are required; fresh tissue in saline (not formalin) preserves viability for flow cytometry and cytogenetics, and touch preparations can reveal cytologic detail that small cores might miss [^9d27e0f0] [^c5d3a617] [^f20bbf4b].

> I should double-check the pathology workup elements. Immunophenotyping by immunohistochemistry and/or flow cytometry is mandatory for lineage assignment and subtype classification; in aggressive mature B-cell lymphomas, surface immunoglobulin and B-cell antigens confirm mature phenotype, and TdT is typically negative; cytogenetics or FISH may be needed for specific translocations such as MYC in Burkitt lymphoma, and molecular testing can refine classification in select scenarios, though routine mutational panels are not universally required in pediatrics [^7832f9d2] [^e974d954] [^9d35a7f8] [^d8a02e6a].

> Next, I should review staging imaging. FDG-PET/CT or FDG-PET/MRI is essential for initial staging and for end-of-therapy response assessment; diagnostic-quality contrast-enhanced CT of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis is still needed for anatomic detail, and when PET/CT is used, combining PET with diagnostic CT in a single session reduces radiation; if PET/MRI is chosen, a diagnostic chest CT is still required to evaluate lung parenchyma; limited whole-body PET fields (skull base to mid-thigh) are usually sufficient because lesions outside this field rarely change stage or management in pediatrics [^bba638f9] [^2bf3db02] [^c59dfbee] [^5270a60c].

> But wait, what if PET is not available or radiation avoidance is prioritized? Whole-body MRI is a reasonable radiation-free alternative for staging, with pooled sensitivity around 95% though specificity is lower for overall staging; it performs particularly well for extranodal disease, and emerging data support its feasibility, though PET/CT remains the reference standard in most pediatric protocols; in resource-limited settings, chest radiograph and abdominal ultrasound may substitute initially, acknowledging limitations [^346f34a3] [^05500fdd] [^693b3c63].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and ancillary tests. In children under 5 years or those with recurrent infections, atypical presentations, or family history, an immunodeficiency workup should be considered; in suspected post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, evaluate transplant history, graft function, and consider EBV testing; for hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, pay close attention to liver and spleen imaging patterns and consider marrow assessment; for CNS disease risk, lumbar puncture with CSF cytology and flow cytometry is indicated in lymphoblastic lymphoma and other high-risk subtypes [^6935c8bb] [^59bf1ed2] [^58b8a2ea].

> Let me consider response assessment carefully. Interim and end-of-therapy PET is interpreted using the Deauville 5-point scale, where scores 1–3 are generally considered negative and 4–5 positive; a score of 4 can be equivocal and requires clinical judgment; if there is less than complete response at end of therapy, biopsy of residual masses is recommended to confirm active disease before escalating therapy; routine surveillance PET is discouraged due to false positives, and any post-radiation PET should be delayed 8–12 weeks to minimize false positives [^4ed12162] [^66819c05] [^5270a60c] [^81e78f89].

> Hold on, I should verify surveillance principles. Most relapses are detected by history and physical examination rather than routine imaging; thus, surveillance imaging should be symptom-driven or protocol-mandated, and when used, limited-interval CT or MRI of original sites at 3–6 month intervals for up to 2 years is reasonable; importantly, the method of relapse detection does not appear to impact survival, arguing against aggressive asymptomatic imaging [^99ee5ecb] [^5270a60c] [^488785e7].

> Let me synthesize the typical diagnostic sequence succinctly. Typical testing proceeds from clinical assessment with B symptoms and nodal/extranodal exam, to baseline labs including CBC, ESR/CRP, CMP with LDH, and targeted infectious testing, to tissue diagnosis with excisional/incisional biopsy and full immunophenotyping plus selective cytogenetics/FISH, to staging with whole-body FDG-PET/CT or PET/MRI plus diagnostic contrast-enhanced CT or MRI as indicated, with consideration of bone marrow and CSF evaluation in high-risk subtypes, and finally to response assessment with interim/end-of-therapy PET using Deauville scoring and judicious biopsy of residual masses when PET is positive or equivocal [^6935c8bb] [^9d27e0f0] [^bba638f9] [^66819c05].

The typical diagnostic tests for lymphoma in children include a **CBC with differential** [^6935c8bb], **ESR/CRP**, and a **comprehensive metabolic panel** [^f2786a25] to assess systemic involvement and organ function. Excisional or incisional lymph node biopsy with **immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry** [^c5d3a617] is essential for definitive diagnosis and subtype classification [^7832f9d2]. Imaging with **FDG-PET/CT or PET/MRI** [^2bf3db02] [^0f16a008] is standard for staging and response assessment, while contrast-enhanced CT or MRI defines disease extent and guides therapy [^2eb52a90]. Bone marrow aspiration/biopsy is indicated for advanced disease or cytopenias [^b0740498], and lumbar puncture is performed for CNS risk or lymphoblastic subtypes [^58967a88]. HIV, hepatitis B/C, and pregnancy tests are obtained when relevant [^6935c8bb], and immunodeficiency workup is considered in young children or atypical cases [^8757f08e].

---

## Clinical evaluation and laboratory tests

- **History and physical examination**: Document B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss) [^6935c8bb], lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and extranodal involvement [^f2786a25].

- **Complete blood count (CBC) with differential**: Evaluate for anemia, leukocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal lymphocytes [^6935c8bb].

- **Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and/or C-reactive protein (CRP)**: Assess systemic inflammation and disease activity [^6935c8bb].

- **Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)**: Evaluate renal, hepatic function, electrolytes, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as a marker of tumor burden [^6935c8bb].

- **HIV and hepatitis B/C testing**: Recommended for patients with risk factors or unusual presentations [^6935c8bb].

- **Pregnancy test**: Required before treatment in individuals of childbearing potential [^6935c8bb].

- **Immunodeficiency workup**: Consider in children < 5 years, recurrent infections, atypical presentation, or family history [^8757f08e].

---

## Tissue diagnosis

- **Excisional or incisional lymph node biopsy**: Gold standard for definitive diagnosis, providing adequate tissue for morphology, immunohistochemistry, and molecular testing [^9d27e0f0] [^c5d3a617].

- **Core needle biopsy**: Alternative when excisional biopsy is not feasible, but may be insufficient for definitive diagnosis [^c5d3a617].

- **Fine-needle aspiration (FNA)**: Not recommended for initial diagnosis due to limited tissue yield and inability to assess architecture [^c5d3a617].

- **Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry**: Essential for immunophenotyping, subclassification, and differentiation from reactive processes [^7832f9d2] [^e974d954].

- **Cytogenetic and molecular testing**: Identify characteristic translocations (e.g. MYC in Burkitt lymphoma) [^9d35a7f8] and establish clonality [^7832f9d2].

---

## Imaging studies

- **FDG-PET/CT or PET/MRI**: Standard for initial staging, interim response assessment, and end-of-therapy evaluation [^2bf3db02]; provides metabolic and anatomical information [^0f16a008].

- **Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI**: Define disease extent, evaluate organ involvement, and guide therapy planning [^2eb52a90].

- **Chest X-ray**: Useful for initial assessment of mediastinal disease and bulk disease, especially when cross-sectional imaging is unavailable [^bba638f9].

- **Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy**: Indicated for advanced disease, cytopenias, or when bone marrow involvement is suspected [^b0740498].

- **Lumbar puncture**: Performed in lymphoblastic lymphoma or when CNS involvement is suspected [^9257b2e4].

### Laboratory workup of lymphoma in adults [^5aa019a8]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The diagnostic workup of lymphoma continues to evolve rapidly as experience and discovery lead to the addition of new clinicopathologic entities and techniques to differentiate them. The optimal clinically effective, efficient, and cost-effective approach to diagnosis that is safe for patients can be elusive, in both community-based and academic practice. Studies suggest that there is variation in practice in both settings.

The Aim Of This Review Is To

develop an evidence-based guideline for the preanalytic phase of testing, focusing on specimen requirements for the diagnostic evaluation of lymphoma.

Methods

The American Society for Clinical Pathology, the College of American Pathologists, and the American Society of Hematology convened a panel of experts in the laboratory workup of lymphoma to develop evidence-based recommendations. The panel conducted a systematic review of the literature to address key questions. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, recommendations were derived based on the available evidence, the strength of that evidence, and key judgments as defined in the GRADE Evidence to Decision framework.

Results

Thirteen guideline statements were established to optimize specimen selection, ancillary diagnostic testing, and appropriate follow-up for safe and accurate diagnosis of indolent and aggressive lymphoma.

Conclusions

Primary diagnosis and classification of lymphoma can be achieved with a variety of specimens. Application of the recommendations can guide decisions about specimen suitability, diagnostic capabilities, and correct utilization of ancillary testing. Disease prevalence in patient populations, availability of ancillary testing, and diagnostic goals should be incorporated into algorithms tailored to each practice environment.

### Surveillance imaging in pediatric lymphoma [^b1f5b826]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Current therapies used in treating children with Hodgkin lymphoma and many histological subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma have resulted in overall survival rates exceeding 90% in many instances. With increasing concerns related to the cost of radiologic imaging, exposure to ionizing radiation, and potential false-positive results, the role of routine off-therapy surveillance imaging has been called into question. Although radiologic imaging plays an important role in diagnosing and assessing treatment response, in these children - the majority of whom have an excellent outcome following completion of therapy - there is an opportunity to dramatically reduce the number of off-therapy imaging evaluations. This review summarizes several recent studies in both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma providing evidence to support these efforts. In addition, we propose a surveillance imaging strategy that uses a novel risk-adapted and response-based approach to determine which children would most benefit from off-therapy imaging surveillance.

### Functional and anatomical imaging in pediatric oncology: which is best for which tumors [^44ce1e93]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Functional imaging techniques are playing an increasingly important role in the management of pediatric cancer. Technological advances have pushed the development of hybrid imaging techniques, including positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, PET/MR and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT. Together with an increasing need to identify surrogate biomarkers for response to novel therapies, the use of functional imaging techniques, which had been reserved primarily for lymphoma patients, is now being recognized as standard of care for the management of many other pediatric solid tumors. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent data describing the use of functional and metabolic imaging strategies for the staging and response assessment of common pediatric solid tumors, and to offer some guidance as to which techniques are most appropriate for which tumor types.

### International pediatric non-Hodgkin lymphoma response criteria [^55389b46]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Response criteria are well established for adult patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). A revised set of response criteria in adults with NHL was recently published. However, NHL in children and adolescents involves different histologies, primary sites of disease, patterns of metastatic spread, approaches to therapy, and responses to treatment compared with adult NHL. However, there are no standardized response criteria specific to pediatric NHL. Therefore, we developed international standardized methods for assessing response to therapy in children and adolescents with NHL.

Methods

An international multidisciplinary group of pediatric oncologists, pathologists, biologists, and radiologists convened during and after the Third and Fourth International Childhood, Adolescent and Young Adult NHL Symposia to review existing response and outcome data, develop methods for response evaluation that reflect incorporation of more sensitive technologies currently in use, and incorporate primary and metastatic sites of disease for the evaluation of therapeutic response in children and adolescents with NHL.

Results

Using the current adult NHL response criteria as a starting point, international pediatric NHL response criteria were developed incorporating both contemporary diagnostic imaging and pathology techniques, including novel molecular and flow cytometric technologies used for the determination of minimal residual disease.

Conclusion

Use of the international pediatric NHL response criteria in children and adolescents receiving therapy for NHL incorporates data obtained from new and more sensitive technologies that are now being widely used for disease evaluation, providing a standardized means for reporting treatment response.

### ACR appropriateness criteria pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma [^6bdc3e5a]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma is a highly curable malignancy and potential long-term effects of therapy need to be considered in optimizing clinical care. An expert panel was convened to reach consensus on the most appropriate approach to evaluation and treatment of pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances where evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment. Four clinical variants were developed to assess common clinical scenarios and render recommendations for evaluation and treatment approaches to pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma. We provide a summary of the literature as well as numerical ratings with commentary. By combining available data in published literature and expert medical opinion, we present a consensus to the approach for management of pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma.

Pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma — diagnosis and workup prioritize adequate tissue, and for evaluation and initial workup of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), the Panel recommends that an excisional or incisional lymph node biopsy generally be performed. A core needle biopsy may be adequate if diagnostic for CHL, but is not adequate for the diagnosis of NLPHL, and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is not an appropriate diagnostic test. Diagnosis should be established according to guidelines in the 2022 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification Haematolymphoid Tumours, 5th edition or 2022 International Consensus Classification (ICC) of Mature Lymphoid Neoplasms.

### Pediatric lymphomas: key concepts and clinical approaches for pediatricians [^aa308374]. Pediatrics in Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Lymphomas are the third most prevalent pediatric cancer following leukemia and brain tumors, representing 10% to15% of all childhood cancers. We can divide lymphomas into Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, with marked differences between these 2 groups. Clinical manifestations can be insidious, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion when treating patients with lymphadenopathies, weight loss, or prolonged fever. Although refinements in chemotherapy regimens have improved survival for pediatric lymphomas, more recent successful incorporation of targeted therapies offers hope for even better outcomes with fewer late effects. Given the excellent prognosis for many of these patients, it is increasingly important for primary care physicians to recognize and manage potential late effects of therapy, both physical and psychological.

### Non-Hodgkin lymphoma imaging spectrum in children, adolescents, and young adults [^693b3c63]. Radiographics (2022). Medium credibility.

In children, adolescents, and young adults (CAYA), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is characterized by various age-related dissimilarities in tumor aggressiveness, prevailing pathologic subtypes, and imaging features, as well as potentially different treatment outcomes. Understanding the imaging spectrum of NHL in CAYA with particular attention to children and adolescents is critical for radiologists to support the clinical decision making by the treating physicians and other health care practitioners. The authors discuss the currently performed imaging modalities including radiography, US, CT, MRI, and PET in the diagnosis, staging, and assessment of the treatment response. Familiarity with diagnostic imaging challenges during image acquisition, processing, and interpretation is required when managing patients with NHL. The authors describe potentially problematic and life-threatening scenarios that require prompt management. Moreover, the authors address the unprecedented urge to understand the imaging patterns of possible treatment-related complications of the therapeutic agents used in NHL clinical trials and in practice.

### Relapse after treatment of pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma: outcome and role of surveillance after end of therapy [^99ee5ecb]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The outcome of treatment for pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is excellent using chemotherapy and radiation. However, a minority of patients will relapse after treatment, but additional therapy achieves durable second remission in many cases. The optimal surveillance strategy after modern therapy for HL has not been well defined.

Procedures

We reviewed the outcomes of pediatric patients with HL treated between 1990 and 2006 to determine the primary event that led to the detection of relapse. We determined the probability of relapse detection by routine follow-up procedures, including history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging, and determined the impact of each of these screening methods on the likelihood of survival after relapse.

Results

Relapse occurred in 64 of 402 evaluable patients (15.9%) at a median of 1.7 years from the time of diagnosis. The majority of relapses (60%) were diagnosed at a routine visit, and patient complaint was the most common initial finding that led to a diagnosis of relapse (47% of relapses). An abnormal finding on physical examination was the primary event in another 17% of relapses, and imaging abnormalities led to the diagnosis in the remaining 36%. Laboratory abnormalities were never the primary finding. The method of detection of relapse and timing (whether detected at a routine visit or an extra visit) did not impact survival.

Conclusions

In pediatric HL, most relapses are identified through history and physical examination. Frequent imaging of asymptomatic patients does not appear to impact survival and is probably not warranted.

### FDG PET / CT in children and adolescents with lymphoma [^343a9143]. Pediatric Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of this review is to give an overview of FDG PET/CT applications in children and adolescents with lymphoma. Today, FDG PET is used for tailoring treatment intensity in children with Hodgkin lymphoma within the framework of international treatment optimisation protocols. In contrast, the role of this method in children with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is not well defined. This paper overviews clinical appearance and metabolic behaviour of the most frequent lymphoma subtypes in childhood. The main focus of the review is to summarise knowledge about the role of FDG PET/CT for initial staging and early response assessment.

Tests that examine the body and lymph system are used to diagnose and stage childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma. If your child has symptoms that suggest non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the doctor will need to find out if these are due to cancer or another problem. The doctor will ask when the symptoms started and how often your child has been having them. They will also ask about your child's personal and family health history and do a physical exam. Depending on these results, they may recommend other tests. If your child is diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the results of the tests will help plan treatment. The tests used to diagnose and stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma may include: Blood chemistry studiesuse a blood sample to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body, including electrolytes, lactate dehydrogenase, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and liver function values.

An unusual amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. Liver function testsmeasure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver. A higher-than-normal amount of a substance can be a sign of cancer. CT scan uses a computer linked to an x-ray machine to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the lining around the spinal cord to remove a sample of CSF. The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for cancer. Chest x-rayis a type of radiation that can go through the body and make pictures of the organs and bones inside the chest. One of the following types of biopsies may be done: The procedure used to remove the sample of tissue depends on where the tumor is in the body:

If cancer is found, the following tests may be done to study the cancer cells: Immunohistochemistryuses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of a patient's cells or tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an enzyme or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. Immunotherapy Immunotherapy helps a person's immune system fight cancer. Types of immunotherapy include:

### Machine learning to predict interim response in pediatric classical Hodgkin lymphoma using affordable blood tests [^2cbffb2c]. JCO Global Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

More recently, an important goal has been to predict the subset of patients who will relapse to intensify treatment for these patients.iPET-CT alone is insufficient for this purpose, but the combination of blood tests and iPET-CT results may in time yield further useful information. The potential correlation between iPET-CT and patient survival is as yet inconclusive in our patient cohort, as demonstrated by the similar 2-year OS in patients with RER and SER. We may postulate that by escalating treatment guided by iPET-CT, the survival disparity has effectively been reduced. The quest to predict relapse or progression continues, especially in settings where salvage options are limited.

Although the results of this study are useful in predicting iPET-CT response, the challenge remains to tailor treatment safely and appropriately, to effect cure with minimal side effects, and to identify those patients who require treatment intensification with accuracy. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring changes in blood tests as they offer valuable insights into the prediction of RER to chemotherapy. By leveraging these predictive markers, health care professionals in resource-limited settings may be able to optimize treatment plans, personalize care, and enhance patient outcomes. However, caution should be exercised in settings with potentially diverse patient populations: different patient groups may exhibit variations in baseline hematologic parameters or levels of nonspecific markers. These variations may be influenced by a range of factors, including underlying medical conditions, demographic characteristics, and environmental factors.

Pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma — staging and imaging guidance states that 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET scans are essential for initial staging and for evaluating residual masses at the end of treatment. For staging and risk assessment, diagnostic imaging should be done before initiating chemotherapy, including FDG-PET/CT or FDG-PET/MRI (whole-body), diagnostic contrast-enhanced (IV ± oral) CT of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, or CT of chest and MRI of neck, abdomen, and pelvis. When available, FDG-PET/CT and diagnostic CT should be performed as a combined examination to limit radiation exposure, and FDG-PET scans should be assessed by a nuclear diagnostic radiologist experienced in reading Deauville scores. If cross-sectional imaging is not available or is needed for a clinical trial, posterior-anterior and lateral chest x-rays are recommended to determine bulk of disease, and consultation with a radiation oncologist is strongly recommended when considering treatment options and for assessing adequacy of imaging for potential future RT.

### Pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma, version 3.2021 [^f6e22e02]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma — principles of imaging state that clinical management involves initial chemotherapy and assessment of treatment response with fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). The Deauville criteria use a 5-point scale (5-PS) to assess FDG uptake relative to the mediastinum and liver; in this 5-PS, scores of 1 to 4 refer to initially involved sites and a score of 5 refers to an initially involved site and/or new lesions, and interim or end-of-treatment FDG-PET scans with a score of 1, 2, or 3 are generally considered "negative" while scores of 4 and 5 are considered "positive", noting that a score of 4 can be difficult to assess and may require clinical judgment. FDG-PET imaging is important as a baseline measurement and for early response assessment, often after the initial 2 cycles of chemotherapy; the Panel recommends diagnostic contract-enhanced CT or MRI for sites of involvement and FDG-PET/CT or FDG-PET/MRI for interim and end-of-therapy assessments, and states that special attention should be given to end-of-therapy scans when utilizing CPIs given their potential for delayed response or pseudo-progression. In addition, the Panel recommends waiting for at least 8 to 12 weeks after the end of RT to perform FDG-PET and recommends consideration of measures such as warming or pharmacologic suppression to reduce brown fat activation; routine surveillance scans in the first year may have utility but are recommended to be limited thereafter, and during follow-up scans should only be obtained if there is significant concern for relapse or for up to 2 years.

### Current role of FDG-PET in pediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma [^4121e9c3]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Hodgkin's lymphoma is one of the most curable pediatric cancers with long-term survival rates exceeding 90% following intensive treatment. Collaborative group studies worldwide aim on reduction or elimination of radiotherapy to avoid potentially life-limiting late effects especially second cancers and cardiovascular diseases. Large prospective trials have integrated early response FDG-PET scans to identify adequate responders to chemotherapy in whom radiotherapy may safely be omitted. The criteria for interpretation of early response PET have changed during the past years and will be further refined based on trial results. FDG-PET is also systematically used to assess initial disease involvement of pediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma and could replace bone marrow biopsy. This article summarizes the role of FDG-PET in staging and response assessment focusing on large pediatric trials, the criteria for PET interpretation and pitfalls.

### Is true whole-bodyF-FDG PET / CT required in pediatric lymphoma? An IAEA multicenter prospective study [^c59dfbee]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Guidelines recommend true whole-body 18 F-FDG PET/CT scans from vertex to toes in pediatric lymphoma patients, although this suggestion has not been validated in large clinical trials. The objective of the study was to evaluate the incidence and clinical impact of lesions outside the "eyes to thighs" regular field of view (R-FOV) in 18 F-FDG PET/CT staging (sPET) and interim (iPET) scans in pediatric lymphoma patients. Methods: True whole-body sPET and iPET scans were prospectively obtained in pediatric lymphoma patients (11 worldwide centers). Expert panel central review of sPET and iPET scans were evaluated for lymphoma lesions outside the R-FOV and clinical relevance of these findings. Results: A total of 610 scans were obtained in 305 patients. The sPET scans did not show lesions outside the R-FOV in 91.8% of the patients, whereas in 8.2% patients the sPET scans demonstrated lesions also outside the R-FOV (soft tissue, bone, bone marrow, and skin); however, the presence of these lesions did not change the clinical stage of any patient and did not affect treatment decision. Among the 305 iPET scans, there were no new positive 18 F-FDG-avid lesions outside the R-FOV, when compared with their paired sPET scans. A single lesion outside the R-FOV on iPET occurred in 1 patient (0.3%), with the primary lesion diagnosed in the femur on sPET that persisted on iPET. Conclusion: The identification of additional lesions outside the R-FOV (eyes to thighs) using 18 F-FDG PET/CT has no impact in the definition of the clinical stage of disease and minimal impact in the treatment definition of patients with pediatric lymphoma. As so, R-FOV for both sPET and iPET scans could be performed.

### Role of limited whole-body PET / CT in pediatric lymphoma [^796a92ac]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Performing true whole-body FDG PET/CT is standard practice in pediatric lymphoma staging and follow-up. In adults, imaging is typically limited whole-body PET/CT, which has advantages over true whole-body PET/CT, primarily decreased scanning time and decreased radiation. We hypothesize that in pediatric lymphoma, limited whole-body PET/CT is sufficient for routine follow-up when disease on the true whole-body staging study is confined to the limited whole-body field of view (FOV).

Materials and Methods

True whole-body PET/CT studies performed for staging and follow-up of pediatric lymphoma patients between November 2004 and July 2009 at two tertiary pediatric referral hospitals were retrospectively reviewed. Abnormalities on the limited whole-body and additional true whole-body FOV were documented.

Results

One hundred seventy patients met the inclusion criteria (752 examinations). At staging, disease involved the limited whole-body FOV without involving the additional true whole-body FOV in 150. Of the 150, 145 had routine follow-up (508 examinations). In these patients, no new (18)F-FDG-avid disease was identified outside of the limited whole-body FOV on routine follow-up (positive predictive value, 0%, 95% CI, 0–0.02).

Conclusion

The limited whole-body PET/CT for routine follow-up when disease is confined to the limited whole-body FOV at staging is appropriate. Given its definite advantages over true whole-body PET/CT, it is preferred.

Pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma imaging after treatment and FDG-PET use: Due to the risk of false positives, routine or surveillance FDG-PET scans are discouraged, and if relapse is suspected (based on imaging, clinical, and pathologic correlations) imaging studies are recommended. It is acceptable to obtain a posterior-anterior and lateral chest x-ray, CT scan with contrast, or MRI of original sites of disease, followed at 3- to 6-month intervals for up to 2 years following completion of therapy, and although an MRI scan may substitute CT scan for neck, abdomen, and pelvic regions, a diagnostic CT of the chest is required to evaluate lung parenchyma. If the previous FDG-PET was positive (Deauville 3 to 5), an FDG-PET/CT or FDG-PET/MRI scan is recommended to confirm CR at the end of all prescribed therapy, including RT, and once negative a repeat FDG-PET should not be done unless evaluating suspicious findings on the history and physical, CT, or MRI; in addition, to minimize false-positive results, it is important to wait at least 8 to 12 weeks after the end of RT to perform FDG-PET assessments.

### [F] FDG PET / MRI in children suffering from lymphoma: does MRI contrast media make a difference? [^26fb9e15]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As the third most common tumor disease, lymphomas represent a significant proportion of pediatric malignancies, accounting for approximately 15%. Generally, lymphoma types are broadly distinguished: Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is diagnosed more frequently than Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). Highly accurate staging of lymphoma patients plays an important role for therapy, as it is well known that therapeutic strategies and prognosis depend heavily on the tumor stage at initial staging. Although contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) diagnostic is used frequently due to its immediate availability for initial staging, [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography ([18 F]FDG PET)/CT is considered the current reference imaging method. The additional metabolic information outperforms single CT diagnostics especially for staging of small nodal lymphoma manifestations and for response assessment. Nonetheless, both modalities come with repetitive radiation exposure and an increasing risk of future secondary malignancies. Especially for children, a radiation-saving diagnostic alternative should be the goal. Combining high spatial soft tissue resolution with a functional imaging dataset, [18 F]FDG PET/magnet resonance imaging (MRI) is becoming increasingly important as a radiation-saving alternative for initial staging and follow-up imaging of all lymphoma patients, especially in children. It enables a reduction of radiation exposure up to 65%, while obtaining high quality at morphologic lymphoma imaging. Consequently, improvements of the diagnostic work-up therapeutic abilities build the basis of increasingly favorable prognosis for children with lymphoma, measurable with a 5-year survival of 97% for HL and 85% for NHL, respectively. However, [18 F]FDG PET/MRI can easily reach 1 h of examination time for an adequate staging, making it stressful and challenging for pediatric and adult patients. Bearing in mind that lymphoma patients commonly undergo multiple examinations for staging and therapy monitoring, special attention should be paid to the ongoing discussion about the relevance of gadolinium deposition to the brain. Thus, application of an MRI contrast agent should be reduced to a clinically reasonable minimum. Thus, skipping contrast administration and the associated contrast-enhanced sequence could reduce the risk of adverse effects like the discussed gadolinium deposition in the brain and allergic reactions and save time as well as costs.

### [F] FDG PET / MRI in children suffering from lymphoma: does MRI contrast media make a difference? [^3b7f4489]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

A pilot study published by Kirchner et al. in 2017 already compared different reading protocols in a small cohort, entailing non-enhanced/contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted [18 F]FDG PET/MR imaging and whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI for lesion detection and determination of the tumor stage in pediatric lymphoma patients. This study revealed that the application of contrast agents does not lead to a noticeable improvement of the diagnostic accuracy of a PET/MRI staging. Nonetheless, data about the value of MRI contrast agent application in [18 F]FDG PET/MRI in the diagnostic work-up of pediatric lymphoma patient is still limited to few small cohort studies.

Therefore, the present follow-up study aims to further validate a potentially time- and contrast agent–saving [18 F]FDG PET/MRI protocol in the diagnostic work-up of pediatric lymphoma patients.

Pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma — principles of imaging and FDG-PET — clinical management of pediatric CHL involves initial treatment with chemotherapy and assessment of treatment response with FDG-PET to determine the need for additional treatment. The Deauville criteria use a 5-point scale (5-PS); in the 5-PS, interim or end-of-treatment FDG-PET scans with a score of 1, 2, or 3 are generally considered "negative", scans with a score of 4 and 5 are considered "positive", and a score of 4 can be difficult to assess and may require clinical judgment. FDG-PET imaging is important as a baseline measurement and to perform an early response assessment (ERA) often after the initial 2 cycles of chemotherapy. The Panel recommends diagnostic contrast-enhanced CT or MRI to evaluate sites of involvement and FDG-PET/CT or FDG-PET/MRI for interim and end-of-therapy assessments; special attention should be given to end-of-therapy scans when utilizing CPIs. The Panel recommends waiting for at least 8 to 12 weeks after the end of RT to perform FDG-PET to minimize false-positive results and also recommends consideration of measures such as warming or pharmacologic suppression to reduce brown fat activation to minimize false positive FDG-PET findings. In some cases, routine surveillance scans in the first year following completion of therapy may have utility but are recommended to be limited thereafter; during follow-up, scans should only be obtained if there is significant concern for relapse or for up to 2 years.

### Dedicated diagnostic approaches for mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas occurring in children, adolescents, and young adults [^8757f08e]. Histopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

For clinicians, it might be challenging to diagnose an underlying IEI in a patient with lymphoma. Young age at the time of diagnosis (younger than 5 years of age), increased toxicity from conventional chemotherapy (DNA repair defects), recurrent history of sinopulmonary infections (humoral B‐deficiency), opportunistic infections, skin rashes (T‐cell defects), autoimmunity (immune regulatory disorders), or an IEI family history may be helpful clues. Patients with an IEI can present with more than one type of LPD, or have disease at unusual sites. A high level of suspicion is important, in addition to close collaboration with haemopathologists and immunologists. An initial workup for suspected cases should include immune evaluation, such as lymphocyte subsets with T, B, NK enumeration, quantitative serum immunoglobulins, and vaccine titres. Confirmatory tests can be done using an NGS IEI panel, whole‐exome sequencing (WES) and/or WGS studies. Identifying an underlying IEI in a patient with lymphoma or LPD has treatment and prognostic implications.

### Continuing challenges in childhood non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [^5e2497a4]. British Journal of Haematology (2005). Low credibility.

Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in children includes a number of different pathological subtypes and, with improved diagnostic techniques and better understanding of the natural history of each type, treatment strategies have become more tumour-specific. Original staging systems are now less useful in determining treatment stratification and there is a need for careful analysis of large cohorts of patients, treated in the same manner, to determine the clinical and biological features that, with current therapies, are of prognostic value. Novel imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography, and molecular techniques to detect low-level marrow involvement are likely to be incorporated into new risk grouping. These will be used to determine the extent of initial disease and evaluate more accurately the speed and quality of response to chemotherapy. With high cure rates, it becomes particularly important to minimize late effects of therapy and the introduction of monoclonal antibodies in combination with chemotherapy may provide a method for improving outcome in poor risk groups and reducing sequelae by allowing reduction in chemotherapy in good risk patients.

### [F] FDG PET / MRI in children suffering from lymphoma: does MRI contrast media make a difference? [^86db5e50]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Evaluate the influence of an MRI contrast agent application on primary and follow-up staging in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed lymphoma using [18 F]FDG PET/MRI to avoid adverse effects and save time and costs during examination.

Methods

A total of 105 [18 F]FDG PET/MRI datasets were included for data evaluation. Two different reading protocols were analyzed by two experienced readers in consensus, including for PET/MRI-1 reading protocol unenhanced T2w and/or T1w imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and [18 F]FDG PET imaging and for PET/MRI-2 reading protocol an additional T1w post contrast imaging. Patient-based and region-based evaluation according to the revised International Pediatric Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) Staging System (IPNHLSS) was performed, and a modified standard of reference was applied comprising histopathology and previous and follow-up cross-sectional imaging. Differences in staging accuracy were assessed using the Wilcoxon and McNemar tests.

Results

In patient-based analysis, PET/MRI-1 and PET/MRI-2 both determined a correct IPNHLSS tumor stage in 90/105 (86%) exams. Region-based analysis correctly identified 119/127 (94%) lymphoma-affected regions. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy for PET/MRI-1 and PET/MRI-2 were 94%, 97%, 90%, 99%, 97%, respectively. There were no significant differences between PET/MRI-1 and PET/MRI-2.

Conclusions

The use of MRI contrast agents in [18 F]FDG PET/MRI examinations has no beneficial effect in primary and follow-up staging of pediatric lymphoma patients. Therefore, switching to a contrast agent–free [18 F]FDG PET/MRI protocol should be considered in all pediatric lymphoma patients.

Clinical relevance statement

This study gives a scientific baseline switching to a contrast agent–free [18 F]FDG PET/MRI staging in pediatric lymphoma patients. This could avoid side effects of contrast agents and saves time and costs by a faster staging protocol for pediatric patients.

Key Points

- No additional diagnostic benefit of MRI contrast agents at [18 F]FDG PET/MRI examinations of pediatric lymphoma primary and follow-up staging

- Highly accurate primary and follow-up staging of pediatric lymphoma patients at MRI contrast–free [18 F]FDG PET/MRI

Evaluate the influence of an MRI contrast agent application on primary and follow-up staging in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed lymphoma using [18 F]FDG PET/MRI to avoid adverse effects and save time and costs during examination.

Methods

A total of 105 [18 F]FDG PET/MRI datasets were included for data evaluation. Two different reading protocols were analyzed by two experienced readers in consensus, including for PET/MRI-1 reading protocol unenhanced T2w and/or T1w imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and [18 F]FDG PET imaging and for PET/MRI-2 reading protocol an additional T1w post contrast imaging. Patient-based and region-based evaluation according to the revised International Pediatric Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) Staging System (IPNHLSS) was performed, and a modified standard of reference was applied comprising histopathology and previous and follow-up cross-sectional imaging. Differences in staging accuracy were assessed using the Wilcoxon and McNemar tests.

Results

In patient-based analysis, PET/MRI-1 and PET/MRI-2 both determined a correct IPNHLSS tumor stage in 90/105 (86%) exams. Region-based analysis correctly identified 119/127 (94%) lymphoma-affected regions. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy for PET/MRI-1 and PET/MRI-2 were 94%, 97%, 90%, 99%, 97%, respectively. There were no significant differences between PET/MRI-1 and PET/MRI-2.

Conclusions

The use of MRI contrast agents in [18 F]FDG PET/MRI examinations has no beneficial effect in primary and follow-up staging of pediatric lymphoma patients. Therefore, switching to a contrast agent-free [18 F]FDG PET/MRI protocol should be considered in all pediatric lymphoma patients.

Clinical Relevance Statement

This study gives a scientific baseline switching to a contrast agent-free [18 F]FDG PET/MRI staging in pediatric lymphoma patients. This could avoid side effects of contrast agents and saves time and costs by a faster staging protocol for pediatric patients.

Key Points

- No additional diagnostic benefit of MRI contrast agents at [18 F]FDG PET/MRI examinations of pediatric lymphoma primary and follow-up staging
- Highly accurate primary and follow-up staging of pediatric lymphoma patients at MRI contrast-free [18 F]FDG PET/MRI.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) — genetic alterations and pediatric testing — may show rearrangements of MYC, BCL2, and/or BCL6 as well as aneuploidy, and isolated MYC rearrangement is seen in up to 8% to 14% of DLBCL cases with similar frequency in children and adults. Although FISH studies for MYC, IGH/BCL2, and BCL6 are generally recommended in all adult DLBCL, in pediatrics individual cases or institutional practice may determine whether to pursue FISH testing given the rarity of "double" and "triple" hit lymphoma. Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) does not occur in children; therefore, CCND1 interrogation for pleomorphic MCL is not needed in pediatric DLBCL. Despite well-described molecular genetics, there is currently no role for molecular genetic (mutational) analysis in the routine diagnosis of BL or DLBCL.

### Assessment of lymphadenopathy in children [^51a675e2]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The assessment of lymphadenopathy in children is a common diagnostic problem in pediatrics. An understanding of the wide variety of diseases and conditions that may present as lymphadenopathy is essential to determining the most appropriate work up for an individual patient. Although the majority of these children will prove to have a benign disorder, it is important that the pediatrician also have an appreciation for the malignant diseases that may present with lymphadenopathy, so that in such cases the diagnosis of a serious or life-threatening disease can be made in a timely manner.

### Diagnostic accuracy of whole-body magnetic resonance imaging versus positron emission tomography-computed tomography for the staging of pediatric lymphoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^346f34a3]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been investigated by multiple authors as a radiation-free alternative to positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET-CT) in children with lymphoma.

Objective

To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio of whole-body MRI compared to PET-CT for the staging of pediatric lymphoma.

Methods

The databases PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were searched for studies that reported the accuracy of whole-body MRI compared to PET-CT for lymphoma staging in children. Data was collected from included studies to formulate 2×2 contingency tables, including the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves were drawn and the area under the curve (AUC) calculated. In addition, the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS 2) tool was used to assess the risk of bias and applicability concerns.

Results

A total of seven studies were included in the final analysis. Of these, six studies used unenhanced whole-body MRI. The pooled sensitivity of whole-body MRI-based staging was 95.8%, while the pooled specificity was 21.8%. The DOR for whole-body MRI was 1.19. For extranodal staging, the pooled sensitivity was 88.9%, specificity was 97.4%, and DOR was 25.29. The partial AUC for overall staging was 0.63, whereas that for extranodal staging stood at 0.88. Based on the QUADAS 2 tool, all seven studies were at risk of bias (six at high risk, one at unclear risk).

Conclusion

Whole-body MRI has high sensitivity for staging of pediatric lymphoma and may be a useful alternative to PET-CT.

### PET imaging in pediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma [^55321f8f]. Pediatric Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Advances in diagnostic imaging technology, especially functional imaging modalities like positron emission tomography (PET), have significantly influenced the staging and treatment approaches used for pediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma. Today, the majority of children and adolescents diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma will be cured following treatment with non-cross-resistant combination chemotherapy alone or in combination with low-dose, involved-field radiation. This success produced a greater appreciation of long-term complications related to radiation, chemotherapy, and surgical staging that prompted significant changes in staging and treatment protocols for children and adolescents with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Contemporary treatment for pediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma uses a risk-adapted approach that reduces the number of combination chemotherapy cycles and radiation treatment fields and doses for patients with localized favorable disease presentation. Advances in diagnostic imaging technology have played a critical role in the development of these risk-adapted treatment regimens. The introduction of computed tomography (CT) provided an accurate and non-invasive modality to define nodal involvement below the diaphragm that motivated the change from surgical to clinical staging. The introduction of functional imaging modalities, like positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, provided the means to correlate tumor activity with anatomic features generated by CT and modify treatment based on tumor response. For centers with access to this modality, PET imaging plays an important role in staging, evaluating tumor response, planning radiation treatment fields, and monitoring after completion of therapy for pediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma. This trend will likely increase in the future as a result of PET's superior sensitivity in correlating sites of tumor activity compared to other available functional imaging modalities. Ongoing prospective studies of PET in pediatric patients will increase understanding about the optimal use of this modality in children with cancer and define the characteristics of FDG-avid nonmalignant conditions that may be problematic in the interpretation of tumor activity.

### Pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma, version 3.2021 [^1e593c6e]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

NCCN Pediatric Hodgkin Lymphoma — principles of staging define imaging-based criteria for site involvement with category 2A recommendations. For lymph nodes, long axis ≥ 2 cm is considered involved on diagnostic CT/MRI, and long axis 1–2 cm counts if FDG-PET positive. For spleen, on ultrasound any lesion large enough to characterize is considered involvement irrespective of the FDG-PET result, while with FDG-PET/CT or FDG-PET/MRI, focal FDG-PET–positive lesions must be confirmed by CT with IV contrast or MRI or ultrasound, and splenomegaly or diffuse uptake greater than liver alone are not considered involvement. For lung on FDG-PET/CT, extralymphatic structures (lung lesions) contiguous with nodal masses are considered E-lesions, and involvement may include at least 1–2 small foci (between 5–10 mm), at least 1 intrapulmonary focus > 1 cm on CT, or FDG-PET–positive lesions < 1 cm when no other etiology is suspected; if all lesions are exclusively in 1 lung then only that lung is involved, but the presence of one additional smaller focus in the other lung means both lungs are considered involved. For liver, any focal mass lesion large enough to characterize is considered lymphomatous on diagnostic imaging unless an alternative etiology is indicated, and liver involvement is defined as any hepatic lesion on CT or MRI that correlates with 18 F-FDG uptake greater than background liver. For bone marrow, involvement is defined as ≥ 3 FDG-PET–positive lesions in bone marrow without cortical bone destruction. For bone, involvement includes an FDG-PET–positive lesion with cortical bone destruction on CT or MRI; if no cortical bone destruction, a bone scan may be helpful, and extralymphatic structures (bone lesions) contiguous with nodal masses are considered E-lesions. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### White paper on the current state of imaging biomarkers in paediatric oncology [^05500fdd]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Lymphoma

The lymphomas are the third most frequent paediatric cancer, with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) predominantly affecting teenagers and non-Hodgkin variants (NHL) affecting more individuals younger than 15 years. The Lugano classification alongside Deauville scores (as defined by the European Network-Paediatric Hodgkin Lymphoma Study Group (EuroNet-PHL)) and the International Pediatric Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Staging System (IPNHLSS) are adopted for staging them, respectively.

In Hodgkin lymphoma, [18 F]FDG PET (combined with computed tomography (CT) or MRI) is the modality of choice for staging and treatment response assessment, providing both structural and functional metabolic information. Preferably, only low-dose CT for attenuation correction (instead of diagnostic contrast-enhanced CT) should be acquired to limit the radiation exposure; also, radioactivity dosages can be lessened thanks to the new and more sensitive (total body) PET scanners. This is very important because children are more sensitive to ionising radiation than adults with a potential but very low risk of adverse effects, in particular the induction of cancer later during life. There is an increasing interest in and validation of the use of whole-body (WB)-MRI as a radiation-free alternative, at least for staging purposes. In non-Hodgkin lymphoma, imaging recommendations are still more heterogeneous depending on the subtype and often still include chest X-ray, ultrasound of the abdomen, and cranial/spinal MRI if indicated. Only in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, [18 F]FDG PET/CT and/or WB-MRI are increasingly used.

Diagnosis — pediatric aggressive mature B-cell lymphomas: Excisional or incisional biopsy of most accessible site is preferred. Touch preparations of fresh lesional tissue should be encouraged whenever possible since, if done properly, they may reveal essential cytologic details that may be difficult to detect in small biopsies (eg, small needle core biopsy). A core needle biopsy is less optimal but can be used in circumstances when a lymph node or tumor mass is not easily accessible for excisional or incisional biopsy. Cores must be of sufficient size and number to allow for adequate evaluation of morphology, and all necessary ancillary studies (immunohistochemistry [IHC], flow cytometry, karyotype, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for major translocations, as applicable). A fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy alone is not suitable for the initial diagnosis of pediatric lymphoma. Place fresh specimen in saline, not formalin, ensuring viable diagnostic tissue for the pathologist. Hematopathology review of all slides as clinically indicated. Touch preparation for cytologic examination is recommended. Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Childhood Hodgkin lymphoma treatment (PDQ ®)-patient version… [^b0740498]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Tests that examine the lymph system and other parts of the body are used to diagnose and stage childhood Hodgkin lymphoma. If your child has symptoms that suggest Hodgkin lymphoma, the doctor will need to find out if these are due to cancer or to another problem. They will ask about your child's personal and family health history and do a physical exam. The doctor may recommend diagnostic tests to find out if your child has Hodgkin lymphoma. The results of these tests will also help you and your child's doctor plan treatment. The tests used to diagnose Hodgkin lymphoma may include: Complete blood count: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for:

- The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
- The amount of hemoglobin in the red blood cells.
- The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells. A pathologist views the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to look for abnormal cells.

Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is done for patients with advanced disease and/or B symptoms. Lymph node biopsy: The removal of all or part of one or more lymph nodes. The lymph node may be removed during an image-guided CT scan or a thoracoscopy, mediastinoscopy, or laparoscopy. One of the following types of biopsies may be done: Excisional biopsy: The removal of an entire lymph node. Incisional biopsy: The removal of part of a lymph node. Core biopsy: The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a wide needle. A pathologist views the lymph node tissue under a microscope to check for cancer cells called Reed-Sternberg cells. Reed-Sternberg cells are common in classic Hodgkin lymphoma. The following test may be done on tissue that was removed: Immunophenotyping: A laboratory test that uses antibodies to identify cancer cells based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cells. This test is used to help diagnose specific types of lymphoma.
- the type of Hodgkin lymphoma
- having more than the usual number of white blood cells or anemia at the time of diagnosis
- whether there is fluid around the heart or lungs at diagnosis
- the sedimentation rate or the albumin level in the blood
- the child's sex
- whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has recurred.

Tissue adequacy for diagnosis — biopsy method guidance: An excisional or incisional biopsy where possible is recommended; for classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL), ample tissue may be necessary to exclude other entities in the differential diagnosis and for specific morphologic subtyping, and a core biopsy may be appropriate in some settings; Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is discouraged in establishing a diagnosis not an appropriate diagnostic test.

### Pediatric aggressive mature B-cell lymphomas, version 3.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^9257b2e4]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric aggressive mature B-cell lymphomas — response criteria and PET guidance use the International Pediatric NHL Response Criteria, in which disease is classified as progressive disease (PD), no response (NR), minimal response (MR), partial response (PR), and complete response (CR); for patients with less than CR at the end of treatment (EOT), the residual mass should be biopsied to confirm residual disease, and most residual masses at EOT are necrotic tumor. Response assessment with PET/CT follows the Deauville 5-point scale, where a Deauville score of 1 to 3 is widely considered PET negative and 4 to 5 PET positive; a score of 4 on interim or EOT restaging may be consistent with PR if FDG avidity has declined from initial staging, while a score of 5 denotes PD. Sites of original disease should be reassessed with indicated imaging, bone marrow and CSF studies should also be performed if initially involved, and FDG-PET/CT or FDG-PET/MRI may be considered if not obtained diagnostically; however, FDG-PET should not replace contrast-enhanced diagnostic-quality CT or MRI, and treatment should not be escalated based on FDG-PET alone. Repeat biopsy of residual mass should be considered prior to additional therapy, but if the residual lesion is FDG-PET negative (Deauville 1–3), biopsy is not required; in the absence of clinical concern, FDG-PET does not need to be repeated once it is negative, and the positive predictive value of FDG-PET is fairly low.

Pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma imaging after completion of therapy — FDG-PET and cross‑sectional imaging guidance: Due to the risk of false positives, routine or surveillance FDG-PET scans are discouraged. If relapse is suspected (based on imaging, clinical, and pathologic correlations) imaging studies are recommended, and it is acceptable to obtain a posterior-anterior and lateral chest x-ray, CT scan with contrast, or MRI of original sites of disease, followed at 3- to 6-month intervals for up to 2 years following completion of therapy. Although an MRI scan may substitute CT scan for neck, abdomen, and pelvic regions, a diagnostic CT of the chest is required to evaluate lung parenchyma. If the previous FDG-PET was positive (Deauville 3 to 5), an FDG-PET/CT or FDG-PET/MRI scan is recommended to confirm CR at the end of all prescribed therapy, including RT. The Panel notes that once negative, a repeat FDG-PET should not be done unless evaluating suspicious findings on the history and physical, CT, or MRI, and to minimize false-positive results it is important to wait at least 8 to 12 weeks after the end of RT to perform FDG-PET assessments.

### Dedicated diagnostic approaches for mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas occurring in children, adolescents, and young adults [^c53ac4f9]. Histopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

The approach of combining NGS for immunoglobulin and/or T‐cell receptor rearrangement testing (IG/TCR NGS), RNA sequencing, and WES techniques alongside flow cytometry immunophenotyping into the diagnostic work‐up has been tested and proven to be feasible for paediatric lymphomas. For instance, Scheijde‐Vermeulen et al.recently reported their experience with integrating flow cytometry, IG/TCR NGS, RNA sequencing, and WES in a large cohort of paediatric lymphomas. Flow cytometry allowed quick identification of tumour cell lineage, RNA sequencing detected all but one translocation found by FISH, and WES identified additional genetic abnormalities not detected by standard approaches. For daily practice purposes in settings where high‐throughput molecular techniques are not available, routine flow cytometry and/or IHC and rational use of FISH probes following a diagnostic algorithm (Figure 4) allows accurate diagnosis of the main lymphoma entities in the CAYA population. Nevertheless, a better molecular characterization of lymphomas in CAYA may allow quick identification of subgroups of patients for whom de‐escalation of therapy would be possible (e.g. HGBCL‐11q, LBCL‐ IRF4 +), and could help to structure the development of new, innovative treatment clinical trials.

### PET / MRI improves management of children with cancer [^486d01bf]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Integrated PET/MRI has shown significant clinical value for staging and restaging of children with cancer by providing functional and anatomic tumor evaluation with a 1-stop imaging test and with up to 80% reduced radiation exposure compared with 18 F-FDG PET/CT. This article reviews clinical applications of 18 F-FDG PET/MRI that are relevant for pediatric oncology, with particular attention to the value of PET/MRI for patient management. Early adopters from 4 different institutions share their insights about specific advantages of PET/MRI technology for the assessment of young children with cancer. We discuss how whole-body PET/MRI can be of value in the evaluation of certain anatomic regions, such as soft tissues and bone marrow, as well as specific PET/MRI interpretation hallmarks in pediatric patients. We highlight how whole-body PET/MRI can improve the clinical management of children with lymphoma, sarcoma, and neurofibromatosis, by reducing the number of radiologic examinations needed (and consequently the radiation exposure), without losing diagnostic accuracy. We examine how PET/MRI can help in differentiating malignant tumors versus infectious or inflammatory diseases. Future research directions toward the use of PET/MRI for treatment evaluation of patients undergoing immunotherapy and assessment of different theranostic agents are also briefly explored. Lessons learned from applications in children might also be extended to evaluations of adult patients.

### Imaging for diagnosis, staging and response assessment of Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma [^0f16a008]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma are common malignancies in children and are now highly treatable. Imaging plays a major role in diagnosis, staging and response using conventional CT and MRI and metabolic imaging with positron emission tomography (PET)/CT and PET/MRI. Cross-sectional imaging has replaced staging laparotomy and splenectomy by demonstrating abdominal nodal groups and organ involvement. [F-18]2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) PET provides information on bone marrow involvement, and MRI elucidates details of cortical bone and confirmation of bone marrow involvement. The staging system for Hodgkin lymphoma is the Ann Arbor system with Cotswald modifications and is based on imaging, whereas the non-Hodgkin staging system is the St. Jude Classification by Murphy or the more recent revised International Pediatric Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Staging System (IPNHLSS). Because all pediatric lymphomas are metabolically FDG-avid and identify all nodal, solid organ, cortical bone and bone marrow disease, staging evaluations require FDG PET as PET/CT or PET/MRI in both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Both diseases have in common issues of airway compromise at presentation demonstrated by imaging. Differences exist in that Hodgkin lymphoma has several independent poor prognostic factors seen by imaging such as large mediastinal adenopathy, Stage IV disease, systemic symptoms, pleural effusion and pericardial effusion. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma includes more organ involvement such as renal, ovary, central nervous system and skin. Early or interim PET-negative scans are a reliable indicator of improved clinical outcome and optimize risk-adapted therapy and patient management; imaging may not, however, predict who will relapse. A recent multicenter trial has concluded that it is usually sufficient for pediatric lymphoma at staging and interim assessment to evaluate children with PET imaging from skull base to mid-thigh. Various systems of assessment of presence of disease or response are used, including the Deauville visual scale, where avidity is compared to liver; Lugano, which includes size change as part of response; or quantitative PET, which uses standardized uptake values to define more accurate response. Newer methods of immunotherapy can produce challenges in FDG PET evaluation because of inflammatory changes that may not represent disease.

### Role of PET / CT in malignant pediatric lymphoma [^4aa4ca8b]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Malignant pediatric lymphoma accounts for 10–15% of all pediatric cancers, (representing 2–3% of all malignancies), with a peak incidence between 5–9 years. Chemotherapy is usually the first and most common mode of treatment. The choice of treatment and prediction of prognosis depend on the histological type of tumor, initial staging, evaluating treatment response, and detection of early recurrence. Conventional imaging modalities have many limitations. PET/CT is more accurate, however so far the literature lacks the results of a large group of patients.

Aim Of Study

To report the role of PET/CT in the above-mentioned objectives at the newly established Children's Cancer Hospital in Cairo, Egypt, which is one of the busiest dedicated pediatric oncology centers of such purposes in the world. All findings were proven by histopathology, clinically, and by clinical follow-up.

Patient Population

A total of 152 patients (35 girls and 117 boys) with histologically proven malignant lymphoma (117 HD, 35 NHL) were included in this study. They were divided into four groups. Group I: 41 patients for initial staging. Group II: 51 patients for evaluating early treatment response after two to three cycles of chemotherapy. Group III: 42 patients for evaluating treatment response 4–8 weeks after the end of their treatment. Group IV: 18 patients evaluated for long-term follow-up. Results of PET/CT were compared with the other conventional imaging modalities (CIM).

Results

The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values of PET/CT and CIM were as follows: In Group I: PET/CT modified staging and treatment in 11 out of 41 cases (26.8%), upstaged 5(12.2%) patients and down-staged six (14.6%) patients. Group II: 100%, 97.7%, 98%, 85.7%, 100%, respectively, for PET/CT and 83%, 66.6%, 68.6%, 25%, 96.7% for CIM respectively Group III: At the end of chemotherapy 100%, 90.9%, 92.8%, 75%, 100%, respectively, for PET/CT and 55.5%, 57.5%, 57.1%, 26.3%, 82.6% for CIM, respectively. Group IV: For long-term follow-up, all the parameters scored 100% for PET/CT, 100%, 38.4%, 72.2%, 50%, 100% for CIM, respectively.

Conclusion

PET/CT in pediatric lymphoma is more accurate than CIM. We recommend that it should be the first modality for all purposes in initial staging, evaluating treatment response and follow-up.

### Significant dose reduction employing dual-low-dose PET / CT in pediatric lymphoma: maintaining diagnostic, staging, and response-assessing efficacy [^09e61656]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the clinical efficacy of a dual-low-dose total-body PET/CT protocol in pediatric lymphoma patients, incorporating low-dose PET imaging in combination with two distinct low-dose CT acquisition strategies.

Materials and Methods

Pediatric lymphoma patients (≤ 18years) receiving half-dose [18 F]FDG (1.85 ± 0.2 MBq/kg) were prospectively enrolled and divided into low-dose CT group (LDCT) and ultra-low-dose CT group (ULDCT) using uEXPLORER scanner. Image quality was evaluated based on subjective and objective metrics. The reference standard of lesions was confirmed with pathological and follow-up evidence. The effective dose (ED), the diagnostic efficacy for detecting lesions, and the accuracy for staging, treatment responses were compared. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained.

Results

A total of 246 pediatric patients were enrolled (9.2 ± 3.8 years, 180 male). The LDCT (n = 127) and ULDCT (n = 119) had similar clinical characteristics (p > 0.05) except for male percentage (78.7% vs. 67.2%, p = 0.042). The total ED of ULDCT was significantly lower than that of LDCT (5.6 ± 1.9mSv vs. 9.7 ± 3.2mSv, p < 0.001). Both groups showed acceptable subject image quality and were comparable in main objective parameters. ULDCT showed a sensitivity lower than LDCT (99.0% vs. 99.9%, p = 0.010) in diagnosing lymph node lesions, while their specificity (96.0% vs. 94.3%) and area under curve (AUC, 0.978 vs. 0.982) were similar (both p > 0.05). LDCT and ULDCT were also comparable in diagnosing extranodal involvements (AUCs > 0.800), staging accuracy (94.6% and 93.6%), and response assessment accuracy (97.6% and 96.3%).

Conclusions

Dual-low-dose total-body PET/CT allowed a significant reduction in total ED without compromising imaging quality and diagnosis performance in pediatric lymphoma patients.

Key Points

Question [18 F]FDG PET/CT scans are crucial for pediatric lymphoma patients; however, an optimized low-dose strategy has not been achieved. Findings Dual-low-dose PET/CT demonstrated sufficient image quality and clinical efficacy in pediatric lymphoma patients, with significantly reduced radiation exposure. The total radiation dosage of the ultra-low-dose CT protocol was 5.6 ± 1.9mSv. Clinical relevance A dual-low-dose PET/CT protocol is an optimized imaging strategy for pediatric lymphoma patients that significantly reduces radiation exposure while providing sufficient clinical efficacy for diagnosing, staging and treatment response evaluation.

### Laboratory workup of lymphoma in adults [^a076a7d9]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). High credibility.

Laboratory workup of lymphoma in adults — ancillary testing for diagnosis and classification: Clinical care providers should use immunophenotyping by flow cytometry and/or immunohistochemistry in addition to morphology for the evaluation of specimens for the diagnosis and subclassification of lymphoma. Clinical care providers should perform fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to assess for recurrent aneuploidies and translocations in the evaluation of a suspected diagnosis of specific lymphoma subtypes, noting that determination of the appropriate rearrangements is required for a diagnosis of high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements. Clinical care providers should not routinely use up-front polymerase chain reaction-based clonality studies in lymphoma evaluation (eg, T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin) in the initial investigation of lymphoma, although there may be an obligatory role in certain settings. Clinical care providers may use molecular tests to aid in classification of lymphomas; for example, pathologists may use a MYD88 L265P to aid in the classification of indolent B-cell lymphoma, and this recommendation refers to non-FISH molecular tests.

### Pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma, version 3.2021 [^d5453a5a]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma — staging imaging and FDG‑PET usage: 18F‑fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)‑PET scans are essential for initial staging and for evaluating residual masses at the end of treatment. For staging and risk assessment, imaging should be done before initiating chemotherapy and can include FDG‑PET/CT or FDG‑PET/MRI (whole‑body), diagnostic contrast‑enhanced (IV ± oral) CT of neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, or CT of chest and MRI of neck, abdomen, and pelvis. When available, FDG‑PET/CT and diagnostic CT should be performed as a combined examination to limit radiation exposure, and FDG‑PET scans should be assessed by a nuclear diagnostic radiologist experienced in reading Deauville scores for FDG–PET–adapted therapy. If cross‑sectional imaging is not available or is needed for a clinical trial, posterior‑anterior and lateral chest x‑rays are recommended to determine bulk of disease, and consultation with a radiation oncologist is strongly recommended to determine adequacy of imaging for potential future RT.

Lymphoma is the third most common cancer in children and adolescents. Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas comprise a heterogeneous group of tumors with distinct pathologic and clinical characteristics. Over the past three decades, significant advancements have been made in the molecular characterization of these disorders. With the use of intensive multiagent chemotherapy, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are now among the most successfully treated cancers in the pediatric population. Future goals of therapy include reduction of treatment duration for early-stage patients and identification of novel targets and therapeutics for advanced-stage patients.

Pediatric aggressive mature B-cell lymphomas — diagnosis prioritizes tissue biopsy, with excisional or incisional biopsy of the most accessible site preferred and fresh tissue sent in saline; fine-needle aspiration biopsy alone is not suitable for initial diagnosis. A core needle biopsy is not optimal but can be used when excisional or incisional biopsy is not easily accessible, and touch preparation of fresh tissue is recommended whenever possible to obtain essential cytologic details, with morphologic review performed as clinically indicated.

### [F] FDG PET / MRI in children suffering from lymphoma: does MRI contrast media make a difference? [^d6b1dbeb]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

[18 F]FDG PET/MRI is increasingly accepted for staging of lymphoma patients, and the present study further confirms the feasibility and high diagnostic accuracy of it in pediatric lymphoma patients. Especially in larger lymphoma treatment centers, [18 F]FDG PET/MRI becomes more and more the diagnostic of choice in the work-up of lymphoma patients compared to the current [18 F]FDG PET/CT reference imaging method. This is also caused by the fact that radiation exposure when using [18 F]FDG PET/MRI is significantly less than the radiation exposure of even a low-dose [18 F]FDG PET/CT. Bearing in mind the repetitive scans for therapy planning and follow-up imaging a lymphoma patient needs to undergo the reduction in radiation exposure using [18 F]FDG PET/MRI is even more substantial. Consequently, the risk of secondary malignancies due to radiation exposure becomes significantly lower. This is of particular high importance in pediatric patients.

The need for MRI contrast agent application in PET/MRI is clinically not debatable in individual tumor entities for further classification, such as liver or pelvic tumors. Contrary, first publications have already shown that especially in pediatric lymphoma patients, a MRI contrast agent application might be waived for staging. MRI contrast–free [18 F]FDG PET/MRI imaging protocols are able to outperform a radiation-saving [18 F]FDG PET/CT low-dose protocol with a more accurate soft tissue contrast and its well-known advantages when imaging parenchymal organs. Furthermore, they profit from simultaneously acquired metabolic PET imaging data that has been shown to be beneficial for staging, therapy monitoring, and differentiation between active and non-active lymphoma diseases.

The omission of contrast administration and the associated contrast-enhanced sequence would avoid side effects of contrast agents like gadolinium deposition to the body, allergic reactions, and incompatibilities and furthermore saves time and costs by a faster [18 F]FDG PET/MRI protocol. Thus, the present follow-up study aims to further validate the need of MRI contrast agent application in the diagnostic [18 F]FDG PET/MRI work-up of pediatric lymphoma patients by evaluating two different reading protocols.

Workup and staging

Initial workup for HSTCL includes a comprehensive history and physical examination, with particular attention to liver and spleen size. Routine laboratory studies should include a complete blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel (with particular attention paid to liver function tests), serum uric acid, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Patients usually present with signs and symptoms of systemic inflammation; therefore, trending erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ferritin, and C-reactive protein are reasonable. As stated earlier, screening for immunosuppression, immune dysregulation, and IEIs is recommended.

In terms of imaging, contrast-enhanced CT and PET/CT scans are commonly used to evaluate whole-body metabolic and morphologic presence of disease, similar to children and adolescents with other NHL (Figure 2). Use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET/MRI have also been described; however, similar to other lymphomas, they are recommended as alternative or adjunctive imaging modalities due to the superior sensitivity and specificity of CT and CT/PET in detecting both nodal and extranodal disease. CT and PET/CT each have pros and cons.CT scans can miss extranodal disease, particularly relevant for HSTCL. PET/CT scans have not been studied as extensively in pediatric NHL compared with adults and other malignancies and may be inadequate for response assessment alone. CTs usually show an enlarged liver and spleen without discrete lesions, whereas PET/CT may show avidity in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow.

### Pediatric aggressive mature B-cell lymphomas, version 3.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^66819c05]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

NCCN pediatric aggressive mature B-cell lymphomas — response assessment uses the International Pediatric NHL Response Criteria, in which disease is classified as progressive disease (PD), no response (NR), minimal response (MR), partial response (PR), and complete response (CR); for patients with less than CR at the end of treatment (EOT), the residual mass should be biopsied to confirm the presence or absence of residual disease, and the majority of residual masses at EOT are necrotic tumor. Response with PET/CT follows the Deauville 5-point scale based on visual assessment of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake relative to the mediastinum and liver; a Deauville score of 1 to 3 is now widely considered to be PET negative, and a Deauville score of 4 to 5 is universally considered to be PET positive, and a score of 4 on an interim or EOT restaging scan may be consistent with a PR if the FDG avidity has declined from initial staging, while a score of 5 denotes PD. Sites of original disease should be reassessed with indicated imaging (abdominal ultrasound, chest/abdomen/pelvis CT with contrast, and/or MRI), and bone marrow and CSF studies should also be performed if initially involved; FDG-PET/CT or FDG-PET/MRI may be considered if not obtained as part of diagnostic evaluation, but FDG-PET should not replace contrast-enhanced diagnostic-quality CT or MRI and treatment should not be escalated based on the results of FDG-PET alone; repeat biopsy of residual mass should be considered prior to additional therapy, and if the residual lesion is FDG-PET negative, biopsy is not required because of the high negative predictive value of FDG-PET; in the absence of clinical concern, FDG-PET does not need to be repeated once it is negative, and the positive predictive value of FDG-PET is fairly low.

### Dedicated diagnostic approaches for mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas occurring in children, adolescents, and young adults [^5c6456f3]. Histopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Non‐Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) occurring in children, adolescents, and young adults (CAYA, age less than 39) are categorized using the same diagnostic criteria as lymphomas occurring in older patients. Nevertheless, NHL affecting patients at different age ranges may have unique clinicopathology, epidemiology, biology, and prognosis that combined deserve further consideration. Broadly speaking, cancers arising in children and adolescents have genomic alterations that differ from those occurring in adult patients. Recent studies investigating the molecular landscape of paediatric lymphomas support the notion that the molecular characteristics observed in pan‐cancer paediatric cohorts also apply to at least a subset of B‐cell lymphomas arising in CAYA patients. However, except for isolated and relatively infrequent paediatric lymphomas or lymphoid proliferations already recognized as discrete paediatric entities, there are no established criteria to denominate NHL occurring in CAYA versus NHL occurring in older age groups. Study series of lymphomas typically include all ages, with median ages often dominated by those NHLs occurring in older adults, hindering conclusions on the specific biology of CAYA lymphomas. Furthermore, it is a common practice that patients above 18 years of age are cared for in nonpaediatric settings, establishing an arbitrary age cutoff that bundles older adolescents and young adults with older adults, and most likely does not reflect the biological behaviour of lymphomas.

There is a need to identify and indicate in a standardized manner those histopathologically and immunophenotypically identical lymphomas presenting across all age groups into clinically and molecularly distinct entities that present specifically in CAYA versus older patients. In this review, our focus will be on mature B‐cell lymphoma (MBCL). Within this group, rare CAYA‐specific entities (paediatric nodal marginal zone lymphoma [NMZL], paediatric‐type follicular lymphoma [PTFL]) have already been described. We will also discuss clinicopathologic data and, where available, molecular data across age groups for entities occurring in CAYA that to date lack an age‐related diagnostic designation (large B‐cell lymphoma, BCL with IRF4 ‐rearrangment, high‐grade BCL with 11q aberration, Burkitt lymphoma [BL], diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma [DBCL], primary mediastinal BCL, mediastinal grey zone lymphoma [MGZL], and lymphomas or lymphoproliferative disorders [LPDs] occurring in the setting of immunodeficiency/dysregulation).

### Laboratory workup of lymphoma in adults [^7a7631e0]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). High credibility.

Laboratory workup of lymphoma in adults — initial biopsy approach and follow-up: Clinical care providers should use surgical biopsy when feasible in a clinical setting where Hodgkin lymphoma is highly suspected, should obtain excisional or core needle biopsy (CNB) specimens in patients with high suspicion of lymphoma, and should not use fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytomorphology alone without ancillary testing to achieve a definitive diagnosis of lymphoma; a defined subset of lymphoma requires architectural assessment and cannot be reliably diagnosed and subclassified by FNA. Clinical care providers should follow up with patients with "negative" results for persistent signs and symptoms of lymphoma and pursue larger volume biopsy when clinical suspicion for lymphoma persists, and clinical care providers may obtain more than one tumor biopsies for the primary diagnosis in select patients with suspected lymphomas, noting that for certain lymphoma types (eg, splenic low-grade lymphomas, lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas) bone marrow biopsy may be preferred over more invasive surgical methods.

Pediatric aggressive mature B-cell lymphomas — diagnosis favors excisional or incisional biopsy of the most accessible site, with fresh biopsy tissue sent to pathology in saline to ensure viable diagnostic tissue, whereas fine-needle aspiration biopsy alone is not suitable for the initial diagnosis of pediatric lymphoma. A core needle biopsy is not optimal but can be used when a lymph node or tumor mass is not easily accessible for excisional or incisional biopsy, and touch preparation of fresh tissue samples is recommended whenever possible to obtain essential cytologic details that may be difficult to detect in small core needle biopsy samples; morphologic review should be performed as clinically indicated.

Pediatric aggressive mature B-cell lymphomas — Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cytogenetics and testing — are characterized by a MYC rearrangement on the long arm of chromosome 8 (8q24) with the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) on chromosome 14 as the most common partner, followed by light chain genes on chromosomes 2 and 22; because of partner heterogeneity, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a MYC break-apart probe is the recommended test, and conventional karyotype analysis may also be of use. In the absence of a MYC rearrangement, diagnosis of large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) with 11q aberration/high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL) with 11q aberrations may be pursued, and although optimum management is undefined it is most often treated like typical BL. The karyotype of BL is simpler than that of LBCL with 11q aberration/HGBL with 11q aberrations, though few and specific chromosomal gains and losses — 1q, 7, and 12 gain and 6q, 13q32–34, and 17p loss — do not exclude BL but may indicate disease progression. When morphology or immunophenotype raises concern for HGBL with MYC and BCL2 or BCL6 rearrangements, IGH/BCL2 and BCL6 status may be interrogated by FISH; HGBL is thought to be uncommon in children, and pediatric HGBL is treated with the same regimens as pediatric BL. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Lymphomas in sub-saharan Africa – what can we learn and how can we help in improving diagnosis, managing patients and fostering translational research? [^dbb39daf]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Approximately 30 000 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) occur in the equatorial belt of Africa each year. Apart from the fact that Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is very common among children and adolescents in Africa and that an epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is currently ongoing in this part of the world, very little is known about lymphomas in Africa. This review provides information regarding the current infrastructure for diagnostics in sub-Saharan Africa. The results on the diagnostic accuracy and on the distribution of different lymphoma subsets in sub-Saharan Africa were based on a review undertaken by a team of lymphoma experts on 159 fine needle aspirate samples and 467 histological samples during their visit to selected sub-Saharan African centres is presented. Among children (< 18 years of age), BL accounted for 82% of all NHL, and among adults, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma accounted for 55% of all NHLs. Among adults, various lymphomas other than BL, including T-cell lymphomas, were encountered. The review also discusses the current strategies of the International Network of Cancer Treatment and Research on improving the diagnostic standards and management of lymphoma patients and in acquiring reliable clinical and pathology data in sub-Saharan Africa for fostering high-quality translational research.

### General biomarker recommendations for lymphoma [^ff57f50f]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2016). Low credibility.

Lymphoid malignancies are a heterogeneous group of tumors that have distinctive clinical and biological behaviors. The increasing prevalence of disease reflects both treatment advances and the fact that some of these tumors are indolent. The ability to determine treatment needs at diagnosis remains problematic for some of the tumors, such as in follicular lymphomas. Major clinical advances will likely depend on precision oncology that will enable identification of specific disease entities, prognostic determination at diagnosis, and identification of precise therapeutic targets and essential pathways. However, refinement in diagnostic evaluation is an evolving science. The ability to determine prognosis at diagnosis is variable, and for many of the lymphoid malignancies prognosis can only be made after initial treatment. Clinical trials that aim to evaluate specific features of these diseases are required in order to advance clinical practice that meaningfully addresses this important public health challenge. Herein, we describe the process and general recommendation from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) clinical trials planning meeting in November 2014 to address clinical trial design and biomarker proposals in the context of NCI-supported lymphoma clinical trials in the National Clinical Trials Network.

Pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma — FDG-PET acquisition and interpretation notes specify that FDG-PET should be interpreted by an experienced nuclear diagnostic radiologist experienced in reading Deauville scores for FDG–PET–adapted therapy and FDG-PET/CT should be obtained in accordance with American College of Radiology (ACR) practice guidelines; in cases of FDG-PET positivity where sites of disease are inconsistent with usual presentation of HL or if there is an unusual disease presentation (ie, HIV), additional clinical evaluation may be required for staging, and if FDG-PET negative at anatomic lesion of concern, biopsy should be considered; in most instances, if the FDG-PET/CT displays a homogeneous pattern of marrow uptake bone marrow involvement is not assumed, whereas if there are multifocal (≥ 3) skeletal FDG-PET lesions without cortical destruction on CT, marrow involvement may be assumed; measures to reduce brown fat activation, such as pharmacologic suppression, may be considered to minimize false-positive findings; if FDG-PET/MRI obtained, diagnostic CT of chest is needed to evaluate lung parenchyma; special attention should be given to end-of-therapy scans when utilizing CPIs given their potential for delayed response or pseudo-progression.
