## Question

Do steroids help with urticaria from drug allergies?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether steroids help with urticaria from drug allergies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether we are dealing with acute drug-induced urticaria versus chronic spontaneous urticaria. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about systemic corticosteroids in urticaria. Next, I will review randomized trials and meta-analyses for efficacy and safety signals. After that, I need to check for any drug-specific nuances that change management. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and monitoring plan, making sure I double-check for any contradictions in the evidence before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Drug-induced urticaria is typically an acute IgE-mediated process that occurs within minutes to hours of exposure, driven by mast cell degranulation; in contrast, chronic spontaneous urticaria persists beyond 6 weeks and is often idiopathic or autoimmune, so conflating these entities would misguide therapy and expectations of steroid benefit [^117Btbxz] [^112RehWg].

> Next, I should review guideline positions before jumping to trials. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — guidelines consistently position second-generation H1 antihistamines as first-line for urticaria, with steroids reserved as short, infrequent rescue for severe exacerbations or antihistamine-refractory flares; long-term systemic steroids are discouraged due to adverse effects and lack of sustained benefit [^117HD3E3] [^112u66X8] [^113WjKGv].

> I will now examine the highest-quality evidence. A 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 randomized trials found that add-on systemic corticosteroids likely improve urticaria activity by about 14–15% in patients with a lower likelihood of antihistamine response, but the absolute benefit is small in highly antihistamine-responsive patients, and adverse events increase by roughly 15%, yielding a number needed to harm around 9; this supports a cautious, selective role rather than routine use [^114oHZyN].

> Wait, let me verify whether specific randomized trials contradict this. A double-blind ED trial adding prednisone to levocetirizine for acute urticaria showed no superiority of the steroid arm and numerically worse itch control at 2 days, with similar relapse rates; an ED RCT of IV dexamethasone added to antihistamine likewise found no improvement in pruritus at 60 minutes and suggested possible rebound activity with a 5-day oral steroid taper, reinforcing that routine steroid addition is not helpful in uncomplicated acute urticaria [^1168ZE8j] [^111rrU4R].

> But wait, what if the urticaria is part of a systemic allergic reaction or anaphylaxis? I should confirm that in anaphylaxis, epinephrine is first-line and steroids are adjuncts to prevent biphasic reactions; steroids do not acutely reverse IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation, so relying on them for immediate control of drug-induced urticaria without epinephrine in anaphylaxis would be inappropriate [^1171hJDv] [^117XwvfE] [^1176vwsW].

> Let me consider topical steroids briefly. A 2024 Bayesian meta-analysis suggests topical corticosteroids may modestly reduce wheal size and could reduce itch, but the itch signal is very uncertain and overall utility for diffuse urticaria is limited; guidelines also note limited benefit outside specific phenotypes like delayed pressure urticaria, so I should not overgeneralize topical steroid use here [^116rSFzH] [^1147G46J].

> I should double-check safety and rebound risk. Short courses under about 2 weeks carry lower risks of adrenal suppression, but even brief bursts can cause mood changes, dysglycemia, hypertension, and sleep disturbance; importantly, withdrawal or taper can unmask or worsen urticaria in some patients, and observational data link steroid exposure in urticaria patients to higher rates of depression, so I need to ensure the indication is strong before prescribing [^113KJSyn] [^113yCpwb] [^112dK5uo].

> Next, I should review drug-specific considerations. For drug-induced urticaria, the priority is culprit drug avoidance and supportive care with antihistamines; steroids are not disease-modifying for drug allergy and should be viewed as short-term rescue only if symptoms are severe or refractory, while definitive management may involve drug allergy evaluation, testing, and, when the drug is essential, desensitization under specialist supervision [^111pZskz] [^112RehWg].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For acute drug-induced urticaria, start with second-generation H1 antihistamines and escalate to higher than standard doses if needed; consider a short, low-dose oral steroid burst (for example, prednisone about 0.5 mg/kg for 3–5 days without a taper if ≤ 1 week) only for severe, disabling flares or when antihistamines are insufficient, and avoid routine steroid use given lack of consistent added benefit and nontrivial adverse effects; in chronic spontaneous urticaria, avoid long-term systemic steroids altogether and escalate to omalizumab or cyclosporine per guideline pathways if antihistamines fail [^113gs1cF] [^1169cTmD] [^112u66X8].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring and follow-up. If a short steroid course is used, reassess within a few days for efficacy and adverse effects, and de-escalate promptly; if urticaria recurs, do not repeatedly re-dose steroids without re-evaluating the diagnosis, triggers, and need for specialist referral, and document the drug allergy clearly to guide future avoidance and safe alternatives [^1171hJDv] [^111pZskz].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the message is precise: steroids can provide a modest, short-term symptomatic benefit in select urticaria scenarios, particularly when antihistamine responsiveness is limited, but they do not treat the underlying drug allergy mechanism and should not be used routinely; given adverse effects and conflicting trial signals, reserve systemic steroids for short rescue in severe or refractory cases while prioritizing antihistamines, trigger avoidance, and guideline-directed escalation strategies [^114oHZyN] [^1168ZE8j] [^117HD3E3].

Steroids can provide **short-term relief** for drug-induced urticaria, especially when symptoms are severe or refractory to antihistamines [^112RehWg], but they are **not first-line** and should be used cautiously due to adverse effects [^114oHZyN]. The mainstay of treatment is **second-generation H1 antihistamines** [^111G7gZs]; steroids are reserved for brief courses (≤ 5–7 days) in severe or refractory cases [^1169cTmD] [^112u66X8]. Long-term steroid use is discouraged because of risks such as adrenal suppression, infections, and metabolic effects [^1136vkXA] [^113yCpwb]. If urticaria persists, escalate to omalizumab or other guideline-supported therapies [^1129Bm69] [^112u66X8].

---

## Mechanism of action of steroids in urticaria

Steroids reduce urticaria by **suppressing inflammation** and immune responses:

- **Anti-inflammatory effects**: Inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α) and reduce vascular permeability and edema.

- **Immunosuppressive effects**: Suppress T-cell activation and proliferation, reducing immune-mediated inflammation.

- **Mast cell stabilization**: Reduce mast cell degranulation and histamine release, decreasing wheal and flare.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting steroid use in drug-induced urticaria

Evidence for steroids in drug-induced urticaria is **limited**; most data come from general urticaria studies and guidelines:

- **Acute urticaria**: Short courses of oral steroids may be considered for severe or refractory cases [^112sahLf] [^113WjKGv].

- **Chronic urticaria**: Steroids are not recommended for long-term use; short courses may be used for acute exacerbations [^1169cTmD] [^1136vkXA].

- **Systematic review**: Adjunctive systemic steroids may improve urticaria activity but increase adverse events, limiting their routine use [^114oHZyN].

---

## Recommended steroid regimens for drug-induced urticaria

Steroids should be used **short term** at the lowest effective dose:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended steroid regimen** |
|-|-|
| Severe acute urticaria | Prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day for 3–5 days, then taper over 2–3 days |
| Chronic urticaria exacerbation | Prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg/day for ≤ 7 days, then taper |
| Refractory cases | Short bursts (≤ 5–7 days) repeated infrequently as needed |

---

Long-term or repeated steroid use is **not recommended** because of adverse effects [^1136vkXA] [^113yCpwb].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of steroid therapy

Steroids have **significant adverse effects**, especially with prolonged use:

- **Short-term effects**: Hyperglycemia, hypertension, mood changes, insomnia, dyspepsia, increased infection risk.

- **Long-term effects**: Adrenal suppression, osteoporosis, cataracts, glaucoma, muscle weakness, metabolic syndrome.

- **Rebound phenomena**: Worsening urticaria upon withdrawal, especially after prolonged use [^113yCpwb].

---

## Comparison with other treatments

Steroids are **less effective and less safe** than antihistamines and biologics for urticaria:

| **Treatment** | **Efficacy** | **Safety** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Second-generation H1 antihistamines | High | Excellent | First-line |
| Omalizumab | High | Excellent | Second-line |
| Systemic steroids | Moderate | Moderate | Short-term rescue only |
| Leukotriene receptor antagonists | Moderate | Excellent | Adjunctive |
| Cyclosporine | High | Moderate | Third-line |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines consistently **recommend steroids only for short-term rescue** in severe or refractory cases:

- **First-line therapy**: Second-generation H1 antihistamines [^111G7gZs] [^1142P3Hj].

- **Second-line therapy**: Omalizumab for antihistamine-refractory cases [^1129Bm69] [^116Q7Efy].

- **Steroids**: Short courses (≤ 5–7 days) for severe exacerbations or refractory cases; avoid long-term use [^1169cTmD] [^1136vkXA].

---

## Clinical scenarios where steroids may be beneficial

Steroids may be appropriate when:

- **Severe acute urticaria**: Not controlled by antihistamines alone [^112sahLf].

- **Refractory chronic urticaria**: Short bursts for exacerbations [^1169cTmD].

- **Angioedema**: Severe or life-threatening cases as adjuncts to epinephrine and antihistamines [^117FCcej].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Patients on steroids require **close monitoring** for adverse effects, response, and rebound; reassess within 1–2 weeks and taper promptly to minimize risks [^113KJSyn].

---

Steroids can provide **short-term relief** for drug-induced urticaria but are not first-line; use brief courses for severe or refractory cases, monitor closely, and escalate to guideline-supported therapies if symptoms persist [^117DXoV3].

### Efficacy and safety of systemic corticosteroids for urticaria: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^114oHZyN]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Short courses of adjunctive systemic corticosteroids are commonly used to treat acute urticaria and chronic urticaria flares (both with and without mast cell-mediated angioedema), but their benefits and harms are unclear.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of treating acute urticaria or chronic urticaria flares with versus without systemic corticosteroids.

Methods

We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, and CBM databases from inception to July 8, 2023, for randomized controlled trials of treating urticaria with versus without systemic corticosteroids. Paired reviewers independently screened records, extracted data, and appraised risk of bias with the Cochrane 2.0 tool. We performed random-effects meta-analyses of urticaria activity, itch severity, and adverse events. We assessed certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach.

Results

We identified 12 randomized trials enrolling 944 patients. For patients with low or moderate probability (17.5%-64%) to improve with antihistamines alone, add-on systemic corticosteroids likely improve urticaria activity by a 14% to 15% absolute difference (odds ratio [OR], 2.17, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.43–3.31; number needed to treat [NNT], 7; moderate certainty). Among patients with a high chance (95.8%) for urticaria to improve with antihistamines alone, add-on systemic corticosteroids likely improved urticaria activity by a 2.2% absolute difference (NNT, 45; moderate certainty). Corticosteroids may improve itch severity (OR, 2.44; 95% CI: 0.87–6.83; risk difference, 9%; NNT, 11; low certainty). Systemic corticosteroids also likely increase adverse events (OR, 2.76; 95% CI: 1.00–7.62; risk difference, 15%; number needed to harm, 9; moderate certainty).

Conclusions

Systemic corticosteroids for acute urticaria or chronic urticaria exacerbations likely improve urticaria, depending on antihistamine responsiveness, but also likely increase adverse effects in approximately 15% more.

### Topical corticosteroids for hives and itch (urticaria): systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis of randomized trials [^116rSFzH]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Topical corticosteroids are widely used as a treatment for itch and wheals (urticaria), but their benefits and harms are unclear.

Objective

To systematically synthesize the benefits and harms of topical corticosteroids for the treatment of urticaria.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL from database inception to March 23, 2024, for randomized trials comparing topical corticosteroids with placebo for patients with urticaria (either chronic spontaneous or inducible urticaria or acute urticaria elicited from skin/intradermal allergy testing). Paired reviewers independently screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Random-effects meta-analyses addressed urticaria severity, itch severity (numeric rating scale; range 0–10; higher is worse), and adverse events. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach informed certainty of evidence ratings. PROSPERO registration: CRD42023455182.

Results

A total of 19 randomized controlled trials enrolled 379 participants with a median of mean age of 30.1 (range 21.1–44.0) years. Compared with placebo, topical corticosteroids may reduce wheal size (ratio of means 0.47, 95% CI 0.38–0.59; low certainty) and itch severity (mean difference -1.30, 95% CI -5.07 to 2.46; very low certainty). Topical corticosteroids result in little to no difference in overall adverse events (94 fewer patients per 1000, 95% credible intervals 172 fewer to 12 more; high certainty).

Conclusion

Compared with placebo, topical corticosteroids may result in a reduction of wheal size and little to no difference in overall adverse events. Topical corticosteroids may reduce itch severity, but the evidence is very uncertain. Future large, randomized trials addressing the use of topical corticosteroids would further support optimal urticaria management.

Nonantihistamine medications

Should corticosteroids be used in the treatment of CSU? Controlled clinical trials have not provided any evidence supporting long-term treatment with systemic steroids in CSU, and the prolonged use of steroids is not recommended due to their side-effects. Short courses of systemic steroids could be used in patients with severe exacerbation episodes, particularly when accompanied by angioedema or in patients with a minimal or partial response to antihistamine treatment. The dosages and weaning regimens of steroids for urticaria are variable, ranging from progressive reduction over 10 days to complex therapeutic regimens with alternate-day dose reduction.

Key point: Corticosteroids are not recommended as long-term CSU therapy. However, a short course of steroids might be useful to control exacerbation.

In which patients with CSU may oral calcineurin inhibitors be used as an therapeutic option in CSU? Four randomized controlled trials have reported favourable effects from the use of cyclosporine in patients with chronic urticaria/angioedema who are unresponsive to high doses of second-generation antihistamines. Treatment for 2–4 months has been used, with better results. One study noted improvement after discontinuation of cyclosporine, one-third of patients had complete remission, one-third had their disease controlled with antihistamines, and one-third returned to the severity level previous to cyclosporine therapy. However, cyclosporine has serious side-effects that may outweigh its benefits – especially the high risk of developing renal injury. Minimal data are available on the use of tacrolimus in chronic urticaria. However, the place of cyclosporine has varied as the approval of omalizumab as an indication for CSU.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^117DXoV3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — oral corticosteroids — In severe cases oral corticosteroids might be necessary, and in patients with poor response to antihistamines, a brief course might be required while eliminating suspected triggers and developing a treatment plan; a short course can be considered if symptoms are severe or not resolving with antihistamines. A randomized controlled study in adults showed that adding oral corticosteroids to antihistamines decreased time to resolution of acute urticaria symptoms in an emergency department setting, and a small study in adults and children showed more rapid resolution with oral corticosteroids than with antihistamines; however, these findings are not sufficient to warrant routine use of oral corticosteroids rather than antihistamines. Use of oral corticosteroids for acute urticaria/angioedema is common in an adult emergency department setting.

### Urticaria and angioedema: an overview [^112YDWBG]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Persistent or frequent episodes of urticaria are difficult to evaluate and treat. The best test to identify most patients with a specific underlying cause (eg, physical trigger, allergen, systemic disease) likely is the taking of a careful and detailed history and performance of a physical examination by a specialist who is knowledgeable in urticarial disease. Further study of the pathogenesis and treatment of urticaria is crucial. Given the limited efficacy of presently approved antihistamine treatments and the significant side effects of steroids and cyclosporine, there is a pressing need to evaluate other anecdotally supported urticaria treatments in randomized, controlled trials.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^1147G46J]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria topical corticosteroids — Potent topical corticosteroids can improve symptoms from delayed pressure urticaria but have limited utility in the treatment of diffuse chronic urticaria (C); an open trial with topical corticosteroids showed only short-term improvement in symptoms, and overall these studies suggest benefit in localized delayed pressure urticaria but limited utility and long-term efficacy for diffuse urticaria.

### EAACI / GA2LEN / EDF guideline: management of urticaria [^1133Gurw]. Allergy (2006). Low credibility.

This guideline is the result of a consensus reached during a panel discussion at the second International Consensus Meeting on Urticara, Urticaria 2004, a joint initiative of the EAACI Dermatology Section and GA2LEN. Urticaria has a profound impact on the quality of life, and effective treatment is therefore required. The recommended first line treatment are nonsedating H1 antihistamines. They have proven to be effective in double-blind controlled studies, but dosages increased up to fourfold over the recommended doses may be necessary. However, for different urticaria subtypes and in view of individual variation in the course of the disease and response to treatment, additional or alternative therapies may be required. Immunosuppressive drugs like cyclosporin A and corticosteroids are not recommended for long-term treatment due to unavoidable severe adverse effects. This guideline was, in addition, accepted by the European Dermatology Forum (EDF) and formally approved by the European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS).

### Drug-induced urticaria. recognition and treatment [^112RehWg]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Urticaria is the second most common cutaneous manifestation of drug allergy. Drug-induced urticaria is seen in 0.16% of medical inpatients and accounts for 9% of chronic urticaria or angioedema seen in dermatology outpatient departments. Occurring within 24 hours of drug ingestion, it is most commonly caused by penicillins, sulfonamides and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Drug-induced urticaria is seen in association with anaphylaxis, angioedema, and serum sickness. Diagnosis requires a detailed history, knowledge of the most likely agents sometimes supplemented with in vitro and skin testing. For mild reactions, avoidance of the causative drug and treatment with antihistamines will suffice. For anaphylactic shock, treatment with epinephrine (adrenaline), corticosteroids and antihistamines is required. Patients should be educated to inform medical staff about previous drug reactions, and to avoid these and cross-reacting drugs if possible. Medical staff need to routinely enquire about allergy and avoid unnecessary prescriptions.

### Treatment of chronic urticaria [^111Gd1Pt]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Second-generation antihistamines are unquestionably the first-line treatment for chronic urticaria and can be used at higher than licensed doses if normal doses fail to control the disease. A short course of oral corticosteroids should be considered for patients not responding to antihistamines before trying other immunosuppressive drugs. Ciclosporin is effective in most antihistamine-resistant patients who require long-term corticosteroid treatments to control their disease. Omalizumab is effective in most subsets of chronic urticaria sufferers who do not respond to other treatments but its high cost represents a limitation to its widespread use.

### Urticaria: evaluation and treatment [^114KLjLg]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Urticaria involves intensely pruritic, raised wheals, with or without edema of the deeper cutis. It is usually a self-limited, benign reaction, but can be chronic. Rarely, it may represent serious systemic disease or a life-threatening allergic reaction. Urticaria has a lifetime prevalence of approximately 20 percent in the general population. It is caused by immunoglobulin E- and nonimmunoglobulin E-mediated mast cell and basophil release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Diagnosis is made clinically. Chronic urticaria is usually idiopathic and requires only a simple laboratory workup unless elements of the history or physical examination suggest specific underlying conditions. Treatment includes avoidance of triggers, although these can be identified in only 10 to 20 percent of patients with chronic urticaria. First-line pharmacotherapy for acute and chronic urticaria is nonsedating second-generation antihistamines (histamine H1 blockers), which can be titrated to larger than standard doses. First-generation antihistamines, histamine H2 blockers, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and brief corticosteroid bursts may be used as adjunctive treatment. More than one-half of patients with chronic urticaria will have resolution or improvement of symptoms within one year.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^1171hJDv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria — diagnosis and management algorithm begins when a "Patient presents with possible acute urticaria and/or angioedema", prompting "DETAILED HISTORY INCLUDING REVIEW OF SYSTEMS" (including "Drug or biologic agent exposure(s)?" and "Physical triggers – evaluate with visual analog scale and itch severity scale") and "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION" (e.g., "Extent and characteristics of the urticaria/angioedema lesions" and "Presence of dermatographism"). When "Is the general evaluation listed in Box 2 suggestive of an underlying cause?" the next step is "SPECIFIC EVALUATION focused on the evaluation results of Box 2", followed by "Is specific evaluation suggestive of an underlying etiology?" and, if "Management of specific condition improves urticaria?", then "Follow up in 2–6 weeks, as symptoms and treatment response dictate: Modify (step down or discontinue) based on clinical response". If the general evaluation is not suggestive, the pathway states "MAY CONSIDER LIMITED NON-SPECIFIC EVALUATION" with labs that "May include CBC with diff, ESR, TSH, renal and liver profiles" and notes "Additional testing may be necessary depending on physician evaluation and patient circumstances", then proceed to "Initial Treatment" to "Remove/Avoid factors that may induce urticaria/angioedema", give "Antihistamines", consider "For moderate to severe cases oral glucocorticosteroids", and use "Epinephrine if potential for anaphylaxis".

### A randomized controlled trial of adding intravenous corticosteroids to H1 antihistamines in patients with acute urticaria [^111rrU4R]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute urticaria is a common dermatological condition in emergency departments (EDs). The main therapy involves controlling pruritus with antihistamines. Although guidelines have promoted the use of corticosteroids in addition to H1 antihistamines, well-designed clinical trials evaluating this approach are scarce.

Methods

Adult ED patients with acute urticaria and a pruritus score > 5 on a visual analog scale (VAS) were randomized into three groups: (i) IV chlorpheniramine (CPM) treatment, (ii) IV CPM and IV dexamethasone (CPM/Dex) and (iii) IV CPM and IV dexamethasone with oral prednisolone as discharge medication for 5 days (CPM/Dex/Pred). The primary outcomes were self-reported pruritus VAS scores at 60 min after treatment. We also evaluated 1-week and 1-month urticaria activity scores for 7 days and adverse events.

Results

Seventy-five patients (25 per group) were enrolled. The VAS scores of all groups decreased, but no significant difference was found in the VAS scores at 60 min after treatment between patients in the CPM group (n = 25) and those who received both CPM and dexamethasone (n = 50). At the 1-week and 1-month follow-ups, active urticaria (indicated by the urticaria activity score at 7 days) was more prevalent in the CPM/Dex/Pred group (n = 25) than in the control group.

Conclusions

The present study did not find evidence that adding IV dexamethasone improves the treatment of severe pruritus from uncomplicated acute urticaria. Oral corticosteroid therapy may be associated with persistent urticaria activity. Due to the lack of clinical benefits and the potential for side effects, using corticosteroids as an adjunctive treatment is discouraged.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^116Bh4ep]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) nonpharmacologic care and topical therapy — Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), heat, and tight clothing might exacerbate CU and avoidance of these factors might be beneficial; pseudoallergen restriction lacks convincing benefit and "Avoidance of pseudoallergens in the diet is not recommended", with pseudoallergens including "food additives, vasoactive substances, fruits, vegetables, and spices". Potent topical corticosteroids "might improve symptoms from delayed-pressure urticaria but have limited utility in the treatment of diffuse CU".

### Urticaria and angioedema: a practical approach [^113qfUoj]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Urticaria (i.e., pruritic, raised wheals) and angioedema (i.e., deep mucocutaneous swelling) occur in up to 25 percent of the U.S. population. Vasoactive mediators released from mast cells and basophils produce the classic wheal and flare reaction. Diagnosis can be challenging, especially if symptoms are chronic or minimally responsive to therapy. A thorough medical history, physical examination, and methodical investigation are necessary to uncover diagnostic clues. Although serious medical illness can occur concurrently with chronic urticaria, acute urticaria generally is benign and self-limited. The mainstay of therapy for urticaria is avoidance of known triggering agents, judicious use of oral corticosteroids, and treatment with long-acting second-generation antihistamines, H2-receptor antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants, and anti-inflammatory leukotriene antagonists. Consultation for investigative therapy may be necessary if symptoms continue despite a stepwise approach to diagnosis and therapy.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^117Btbxz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — definition, evaluation, and initial treatment: Urticaria and angioedema with a duration of less than 6 weeks is termed acute urticaria. Urticaria/angioedema with systemic signs can occur in anaphylaxis, and epinephrine should be prescribed if the diagnosis of anaphylaxis has not been excluded. Because acute urticaria and angioedema will usually resolve spontaneously, laboratory evaluation for chronic illness is also not required unless supported by the clinical history or physical examination, and empiric elimination diets (not guided by history and testing) are not recommended; extensive evaluation for specific viral pathogens or antiviral therapy is not indicated unless suggested by the clinical history. For acute urticaria, skin testing or immunoassays can be helpful if an allergic cause is suggested by history, usually after resolution of acute urticaria and after suspension of antihistamines or via serologic testing when significant dermatographism is present; skin biopsy is not indicated in most cases but might occasionally be useful for differentiating from other inflammatory disorders. Common causes, including medications and foods, should be identified by detailed history and eliminated if possible. For treatment, antihistamines are efficacious in most cases and recommended as first-line therapy; first-generation antihistamines can be associated with sedation and impaired motor skills, whereas these impairments are less evident or not evident with second-generation antihistamines as a class. In patients with poor response to antihistamines, a brief course of oral corticosteroids might also be required while eliminating suspected triggers and developing an effective plan.

### The urticaria spectrum: recognition of clinical patterns can help management [^1172t6Qk]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Urticaria has diverse clinical presentations and causes. The implication of classifying urticaria primarily by clinical presentation rather than aetiology is that management can be focused on specific clinical problems without extensive investigations. Management pathways may involve nonpharmacological measures and drug interventions, which can be grouped into first-, second- and third-line therapies. Stronger, but potentially more risky, second- and third-line approaches may be justified for patients who do not respond to first-line therapy with antihistamines even though it may not be possible to define a specific aetiology, such as autoimmune urticaria, with confidence.

### Acute and chronic urticaria: evaluation and treatment [^112Czzfq]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Urticaria commonly presents with intensely pruritic wheals, sometimes with edema of the subcutaneous or interstitial tissue. It has a lifetime prevalence of about 20%. Although often self-limited and benign, it can cause significant discomfort, continue for months to years, and uncommonly represent a serious systemic disease or life-threatening allergic reaction. Urticaria is caused by immunoglobulin E- and non-immunoglobulin E-mediated release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators from mast cells and basophils. Diagnosis is made clinically; anaphylaxis must be ruled out. Chronic urticaria is idiopathic in 80% to 90% of cases. Only a limited nonspecific laboratory workup should be considered unless elements of the history or physical examination suggest specific underlying conditions. The mainstay of treatment is avoidance of triggers, if identified. The first-line pharmacotherapy is second-generation H1 antihistamines, which can be titrated to greater than standard doses. First-generation H1 antihistamines, H2 antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, high-potency antihistamines, and brief corticosteroid bursts may be used as adjunctive treatment. In refractory chronic urticaria, patients can be referred to subspecialists for additional treatments, such as omalizumab or cyclosporine. More than one-half of patients with chronic urticaria will have resolution or improvement of symptoms within a year.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^117SCv2W]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria — alternative therapies and definition of refractory disease: Summary Statement 84 specifies that patients "not adequately controlled on maximally tolerated antihistamine therapy (eg, doxepin at a dose of 75–125 mg/d) might be considered to have refractory CU". Summary Statement 85 states "A number of alternative therapies have been studied for the treatment of CU; these therapies merit consideration for patients with refractory CU". The text notes that "as many as 50% of these patients might not achieve satisfactory control with antihistamine therapy", and alternatives are evaluated "to reduce the need for systemic corticosteroids". Summary Statement 86 adds that anti-inflammatory agents "including dapsone, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, and colchicine, have limited evidence for efficacy… and some require laboratory monitoring for adverse effects", yet "are generally well tolerated, might be efficacious in properly selected patients, and can be considered for treatment of patients with antihistamine-refractory CU".

### EAACI / GA (2) LEN / EDF / WAO guideline: management of urticaria [^111ZnxyK]. Allergy (2009). Low credibility.

This guideline, together with its sister guideline on the classification of urticaria (Zuberbier T, Asero R, Bindslev-Jensen C, Canonica GW, Church MK, Giménez-Arnau AM et al. EAACI/GA(2)LEN/EDF/WAO Guideline: definition, classification and diagnosis of urticaria. Allergy 2009;64: 1417–1426), is the result of a consensus reached during a panel discussion at the Third International Consensus Meeting on Urticaria, Urticaria 2008, a joint initiative of the Dermatology Section of the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), the EU-funded network of excellence, the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA(2)LEN), the European Dermatology Forum (EDF) and the World Allergy Organization (WAO). As members of the panel, the authors had prepared their suggestions regarding management of urticaria before the meeting. The draft of the guideline took into account all available evidence in the literature (including Medline and Embase searches and hand searches of abstracts at international allergy congresses in 2004–2008) and was based on the existing consensus reports of the first and the second symposia in 2000 and 2004. These suggestions were then discussed in detail among the panel members and with the over 200 international specialists of the meeting to achieve a consensus using a simple voting system where appropriate. Urticaria has a profound impact on the quality of life and effective treatment is, therefore, required. The recommended first line treatment is new generation, nonsedating H(1)-antihistamines. If standard dosing is not effective, increasing the dosage up to four-fold is recommended. For patients who do not respond to a four-fold increase in dosage of nonsedating H(1)-antihistamines, it is recommended that second-line therapies should be added to the antihistamine treatment. In the choice of second-line treatment, both their costs and risk/benefit profiles are most important to consider. Corticosteroids are not recommended for long-term treatment due to their unavoidable severe adverse effects. This guideline was acknowledged and accepted by the European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS).

### Chronic urticaria: a role for newer immunomodulatory drugs? [^112Xj7ff]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic urticaria is now recognized as an autoreactive disorder in a substantial fraction of patients. A serologic mediator of whealing has been demonstrated in 50–60% of patients with chronic urticaria, and autoantibodies against the high affinity IgE receptor or IgE have been detected in about half of these patients. The demonstration that chronic urticaria is frequently autoimmune has encouraged a more aggressive therapeutic approach, with the use of immunomodulatory drugs. A step-by-step approach to the management of chronic urticaria is proposed, based on our personal experience and review of current medical literature, identified through Medline research and hand searching in medical journals. The non- or low-sedating H(1) receptor antagonists (antihistamines), such as cetirizine, fexofenadine, loratadine, mizolastine and, more recently, levocetirizine, desloratadine and ebastine, represent the basic therapy for all chronic urticaria patients. Older sedating antihistamines, such as hydroxyzine and diphenhydramine, may be indicated if symptoms are severe, are associated with angioedema, and if the patient is anxious and disturbed at night. Corticosteroid therapy with prednisone or methylprednisolone can be administered for a few days (7–14) if urticarial symptoms are not controlled by antihistamines and a rapid clinical response is needed. In cases of relapse after corticosteroid suspension, leukotriene receptor antagonists, such as montelukast and zafirlukast, should be tried. In our experience, remission of urticarial symptoms can be achieved in 20–50% of chronic urticaria patients unresponsive to antihistamines alone. When urticaria is unremitting and is not controlled by combined therapy with antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonists, prolonged corticosteroid therapy may be needed. Long-term corticosteroid therapy should be administered at the lowest dose able to control urticarial symptoms, in order to minimize adverse effects. In a few patients, however, high-dose corticosteroid therapy may have to be administered for long periods. In these patients, immunosuppressive treatment with low-dose cyclosporine can be started. This type of treatment has a corticosteroid-sparing effect and is also generally effective in patients with severe, unremitting urticaria, but requires careful monitoring of cyclosporine plasma concentration and possible adverse effects. Other immunomodulating drugs that have been tried in chronic urticaria patients include hydroxychloroquine, dapsone, sulfasalazine and methotrexate, but their efficacy has not been proven in large controlled studies. Warfarin therapy may also be considered in some patients with chronic urticaria and angioedema unresponsive to antihistamines.

Chronic urticaria — cyclosporine randomized trials and internal validity concerns indicate that 4 double-blind, randomized, controlled trials in patients with CUA refractory to high-dose antihistamines were identified and appraised, but study-specific biases included imbalanced prior corticosteroid exposure (60% required corticosteroids, 78% assigned to the treatment group), early cross-over after only 2 weeks when 80% of the cetirizine arm had daily severe relapses requiring systemic steroid treatment, and one trial that randomized cyclosporine for either 1 or 3 months without a comparator group.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^111CGBHE]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — definition, evaluation, and treatment: Urticaria and angioedema with duration of less than 6 weeks is termed acute urticaria, and if urticaria of less than 6 weeks' duration has features suggesting it might progress, patients should be periodically re-evaluated until a diagnosis is clarified. Because acute urticaria and angioedema will usually resolve spontaneously, laboratory evaluation for chronic illness is also not required unless supported by the clinical history or physical examination, and although many cases are infectious, extensive evaluation for specific viral pathogens or antiviral therapy is not indicated unless suggested by the clinical history. For acute urticaria, skin testing or immunoassays can be helpful if an allergic cause is suggested by history, usually after resolution and after suspension of antihistamines or via serologic testing in the presence of significant dermatographism, and skin biopsy is not indicated in most cases though it might occasionally be useful to differentiate from other inflammatory disorders. For treatment, antihistamines are efficacious in most cases and recommended as first-line therapy; first-generation antihistamines are rapidly acting but can be associated with sedation and impaired motor skills compared with second-generation agents, patients should be warned about drowsiness or impaired performance, and in poor responders a brief course of oral corticosteroids might also be required while eliminating triggers and forming an effective plan.

### Life-threatening severe allergic reactions: urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis [^117DoAko]. Clinics in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Urticaria, angioedema and anaphylaxis are life threatening skin diseases. Allergological emergencies are common; drugs, food, food ingredients/additives, insects, and many other factors have been reported to elicit anaphylactic reactions. The severity of symptoms ranges from pruritus to generalized skin eruptions, gastrointestinal, bronchial problems to systemic anaphylaxis and cardiovascular emergencies. The pathomechanisms and treatment of urticarias, angioedema and anaphylaxis are described. In some situations emergency kit: antihistamines, steroids, betamimetics and adrenaline is needed. Familiarity with the early diagnosis and correct management should be acknowledegable for dermatologists to recognize these allergic reactions and must be prepared to administer emergency kit.

### Management of urticaria in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review [^112ZdEix]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

4.4 Patient management

Classically, the recommended algorithm for treating urticaria includes the use of second‐generation antihistamines, and if inadequate control within 2‐4 weeks, the dose can be increased up to four times the original dose. If this is still inadequate control after a further 2‐4 weeks, specialist referral should be considered, where specialists can consider prescribing omalizumab and ciclosporin to help alleviate symptoms. However, in most patients, second generation oral antihistamines provide adequate control of urticaria. The pathophysiology of COVID‐19 related urticaria demonstrates that antihistamines alone will not stop mast cell histamine degranulation but will only act to reduce the severity of urticaria.

Low systemic steroids, on the other hand, target the COVID‐19 inflammatory storm, which prevents mast cell activation, and thus histamine release. Therefore, low dose systemic steroids may be able to effectively manage urticaria in COVID‐19 through their proposed mechanism of action. Combining this with antihistamines can improve patients' clinical response to urticaria. A further benefit of low dose steroids, shown through a randomized control trial, has demonstrated an increase in survival rate in COVID‐19 patients (Randomized Evaluation of COVID‐19 Therapy [RECOVERY], ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04381936). Although corticosteroids are promising, it may increase the risk of prolonged viral replication, so it may be best to use them for the shortest duration possible until symptoms are controlled. After this, consideration should be made to promptly switch to omalizumab. Ciclosporin is currently not recommended in COVID‐19 patients.

4.5 Limitations

All included articles were case. Only three case reports detailed pathological study results. A diagnostic characteristic of urticaria is that the cutaneous lesions must be evanescent (no one lesion should last more than 24 hours), however this was only noted by Falkenhain‐López et al.

### Levocetirizine and prednisone are not superior to levocetirizine alone for the treatment of acute urticaria: a randomized double-blind clinical Trial [^1168ZE8j]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We evaluate the efficacy of a 4-day course of prednisone added to antihistamine for the management of acute urticaria in an emergency department (ED).

Methods

In this double-blind randomized clinical trial, patients were eligible for inclusion if aged 18 years or older and with acute urticaria of no more than 24 hours' duration. Patients with anaphylaxis or who had received antihistamines or glucocorticoids during the previous 5 days were not included. In addition to levocetirizine (5 mg orally for 5 days), patients were assigned to receive prednisone (40 mg orally for 4 days) or placebo. The primary endpoint of the study was itching relief 2 days after the ED visit, rated on a numeric scale of 0 to 10. Secondary endpoints were rash resolution, relapses, and adverse events.

Results

A total of 100 patients were included, 50 in each group. Seven patients in the prednisone group and 8 in the placebo group discontinued treatment. At 2-day follow-up, 62% of patients in the prednisone group had an itch score of 0 versus 76% of those in the placebo group (Δ 14%; 95% confidence interval -31% to 4%). Thirty percent of patients in the prednisone group and 24% in the placebo group reported relapses (Δ 6%; 95% confidence interval -23% to 11%). Mild adverse events were reported by 12% of patients in the prednisone group and 14% in the placebo group.

Conclusion

The addition of a prednisone burst did not improve the symptomatic and clinical response of acute urticaria to levocetirizine. This study does not support the addition of corticosteroid to H 1 antihistamine as first-line treatment of acute urticaria without angioedema.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^113yCpwb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) — systemic corticosteroids: Summary Statement 83 notes systemic corticosteroids are "frequently used in patients with refractory CU, but no controlled studies have demonstrated efficacy", and that "short-term use (eg, 1–3 weeks' duration) might be required" until other therapies control symptoms, whereas "long-term use for treatment of patients with CU should be avoided as much as possible". Short-term use guidance specifies that "Dose adjustment tapering is not necessary in patients receiving 40 mg or equivalent doses of prednisone daily for 3 weeks or less", and long-term risks include "osteoporosis with increased risk of fracture, avascular necrosis, cataracts, hyperglycemia, adrenal suppression, risk of infection, and thinning of the skin". Evidence cited includes a study of "40 patients with DPUA" using a "7-week taper of prednisone" in which "Thirty percent of subjects withdrew from the prednisone treatment group because of adverse effects", and a prospective series of "17 patients… (3–30 days per month)" where "47% had a short relapse or worsening of their urticaria on withdrawal of corticosteroids".

Chronic urticaria (CU) step-care antihistamine-based therapy — A "step-care approach has been developed for the management of CU", with second-generation antihistamines "considered first-line agents (step 1)". For patients not controlled on US Food and Drug Administration–approved monotherapy, "several treatment options can be used (step 2)", and "Higher doses of second-generation antihistamines might provide more efficacy, but data are limited and conflicting for certain agents". Add-on options where the "Addition of H2-antagonists or leukotriene receptor antagonists can be considered" and "First-generation antihistamines can also be considered" are followed by step 3, in which "Treatment with hydroxyzine or doxepin can be considered". Systemic corticosteroids "are frequently used… but no controlled studies have demonstrated efficacy", although "short-term use (eg, 1–3 weeks' duration) might be required", while "long-term use… should be avoided as much as possible". Patients not adequately controlled "on maximal antihistamine therapy (eg, step 3 care) might be considered to have refractory CU".

### Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to corticosteroids [^1157RBmf]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature on immediate hypersensitivity reactions to corticosteroids and classify them according to manifestations, routes of exposure, causative preparations, diagnostic tests, and management.

Data Sources

PubMed search for English-language publications from January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2014 using search terms corticosteroid, glucocorticoid, or steroid combined with hypersensitivity, allergy, or anaphylaxis.

Study Selection

Only reports of immediate hypersensitivity reactions that occurred sooner than 24 hours after administration of a corticosteroid were included. Excluded were reports on patients with delayed reactions, including contact dermatitis.

Results

Forty-eight articles fulfilled the criteria, reporting 120 reactions in 106 patients 2 to 90 years of age (55 male and 51 female). The most commonly reported manifestation was anaphylaxis in 60.8% (73 of 120) followed by urticaria and/or angioedema in 26.7%. Exposure to corticosteroid was through any route, with intravenous being the most common (44.2%, 53 of 120), followed by oral in 25.8% and intra-articular in 11.7%. Methylprednisolone was the most commonly implicated (40.8%) followed by prednisolone (20.0%). Some reacted to more than 1 preparation. Pharmacologically-inactive ingredients were implicated in 28.3%. Diagnosis was based primarily on medical history and in most cases was confirmed by challenge testing. Skin tests were positive in 74.1%. The vast majority of patients tolerated at least 1 alternative preparation, and very rarely desensitization was required.

Conclusion

Corticosteroids seem to be rare causes of immediate hypersensitivity reactions but possibly are misdiagnosed or under-reported relative to their worldwide use. Physicians should be cognizant of this entity and identify safe alternative preparations.

### Urticaria: a review [^111AUH2f]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Urticaria is often classified as acute, chronic, or physical based on duration of symptoms and the presence or absence of inducing stimuli. Urticarial vasculitis, contact urticaria, and special syndromes are also included under the broad heading of urticaria. Recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic urticaria include the finding of autoantibodies to mast cell receptors in nearly half of patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria. These patients may have more severe disease and require more aggressive therapies. Extensive laboratory evaluation for patients with chronic urticaria is typically unrevealing and there are no compelling data that associate urticaria with chronic infections or malignancy. Pharmacologic therapy consists primarily of the appropriate use of first- and second-generation histamine H(1) receptor antihistamines. Additional therapy may include leukotriene receptor antagonists, corticosteroids, and immunomodulatory agents for severe, unremitting disease. Despite our greater understanding of the pathogenesis of urticaria, the condition remains a frustrating entity for many patients, particularly those with chronic urticaria.

Oral corticosteroids in urticaria — short-term risk and monitoring — note that adverse effects such as adrenal suppression and bone/growth effects are unlikely with short-term use (< 2 weeks), and patients receiving oral corticosteroid therapy should be clinically monitored for response to therapy, side effects, and effects on comorbid conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes.

### Treatment of refractory chronic urticaria: current and future therapeutic options [^113tFPLY]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic urticaria is a distressing disease that affects up to 1% of the general population at a time point in life and may severely worsen the quality of life. First-line treatment has been based on antihistamines, and presently relies on the use of non-sedating, second-generation antihistamines; following the recommendations of the recent international guidelines, in patients who do not respond to antihistamines at licensed doses, the daily dosage of these drugs can be increased up to fourfold. Nonetheless, a significant proportion of patients with chronic urticaria remain poorly controlled; in these cases, alternative therapeutic approaches have to be considered. This article critically reviews all of the third- and fourth-line treatment options suggested for patients whose disease is refractory to antihistamines, including systemic corticosteroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists, several different anti-inflammatory drugs (dapsone, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine), various immunosuppressive drugs (calcineurin inhibitors, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil), intravenous immunoglobulin, and newer treatment options, such as omalizumab and other biologic drugs. In addition, the article examines possible future treatment options based on recent findings about pathogenic mechanisms, and considers the treatment of antihistamine-unresponsive urticaria in special conditions such as children and pregnancy/lactation. The evidence supporting the use of several of the discussed drugs is presently limited and thus insufficient to recommend their routine use; as a consequence, such compounds should be considered only in specific cases and in adequate settings.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^116Q7Efy]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) pharmacologic escalation — second‑generation antihistamines are considered first‑line, but monotherapy might not achieve complete control; when control is inadequate on labeled doses, higher doses, H2 antagonists or leukotriene receptor antagonists can be considered, and first‑generation antihistamines are also options. For persistent symptoms, treatment with hydroxyzine or doxepin can be considered as part of Step 3. Systemic corticosteroids are frequently used in refractory CU, but no controlled studies have demonstrated efficacy; short‑term use (e.g., 1‑3 weeks' duration) might be required to gain control, and long‑term use should be avoided as much as possible. Patients not adequately controlled on maximal antihistamine therapy (e.g. Step 3 care) might be considered refractory; Step 4 options include omalizumab and cyclosporine, with omalizumab approved by the FDA at both 150 mg and 300 mg for CU patients unresponsive to H1 antagonists 12 years of age and older.

### Guidelines for the management of chronic spontaneous urticaria: recommendations supported by the centre of evidence of the French society of dermatology [^1124LK4j]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The working group analysed the studies (two persons independently for each intervention) by describing the effect estimates, biases and harms, then graded the level of evidence (from D – no direct research evidence, to A – several multicentric double‐blinded studies with concordant positive results and acceptable risks) after reaching unanimous consensus. The comments from the eight experts who were secondarily interviewed were incorporated into the recommendations, then the synthesis was submitted to a multidisciplinary panel of 28 reviewers, including health providers and patients, who scored each recommendation from 1 to 9.

The main points from the recommendations are as follows.
(i) A second‐generation H 1 antihistamine at a single dose is the recommended first‐line treatment for CSU. There is no evidence to favour one drug over another. Some H 1 antihistamines should be avoided in individuals who present a known increase in QT interval or those on enzymatic inhibitors.
(ii) In case of treatment insufficiency, the working group recommends a rapid increase in dosage (1 week to 2 months) until quadruple dosage of H 1 antihistamines, as a second‐line treatment.
(iii) The working group does not recommend the adjunction of H 2 antihistamines or montelukast to H 1 antihistamines in CSU, owing to the lack of demonstrated efficacy.
(iv) No studies assessed the efficacy or safety of systemic steroids in CSU. The working group does not currently recommend using them.
(v) As a third‐line treatment, in case of decreased QoL of individuals linked to refractory CSU, the working group recommends the adjunction of omalizumab (300 mg every 4 weeks)or ciclosporin (4–5 mg kg −1 per day during a 6‐month period) to H 1 antihistamines. Randomized controlled trials have shown that omalizumab is more effective than placebo, with good short‐term tolerance. No head‐to‐head trials have compared omalizumab and ciclosporin.
(vi) There is no evidence to indicate the optimal delay between the failure of quadruple dosage of H 1 antihistamines and initiation of omalizumab or ciclosporin; this would likely depend on the QoL of patients and the severity of the CSU.
(vii) Isolated studies of hydroxychloroquine, dapsone, sulfasalazine, high‐dose vitamin D, phototherapy and miltefosine for CSU have been published, but the working group does not recommend them because the data are too sparse.
(viii) The working group does not recommend systematic food exclusion diets because of no evidence of benefit for individuals with CSU. No prospective studies have been published to date on therapeutic education programmes and psychotherapy in CSU.
(ix) For children < 12 years old with CSU, single‐dose H 1 antihistamines can be used. The working group recommends favouring rupatadine and desloratadine in case of dosage escalation because more data are available than for other drugs. There is a real lack of evidence for third‐line treatments in paediatric populations.
(x) During pregnancy and breastfeeding, a single dose of cetirizine, levocetirizine or desloratadine is preferred because more safety data for these H 1 antihistamines are available. In case of refractory CSU, a specialized consultation is required.

### Evaluation of pharmacological treatments for acute urticaria: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115a56An]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The effectiveness and safety of pharmacological treatments for acute urticaria remain unclear.

Objective

To systematically review and meta-analyze the efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments for acute urticaria in emergency department (ED) and non-ED settings.

Methods

We searched electronic databases and gray literature up to July 8, 2023, without language restrictions. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) relating to pharmacological interventions in patients with acute urticaria, regardless of age, were eligible for inclusion. The relevant outcomes of interest were the treatment efficacy and safety profiles. The results are presented as standardized mean differences (SMDs) or odds ratios (ORs).

Results

We identified 8 RCTs comprising 680 patients. Regarding the ED setting (2 trials, n = 118), intramuscular first-generation H1-antihistamine (fgAH) was more efficacious in decreasing pruritus symptoms (SMD, -0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.75 to -0.02) but had higher sedative effects than H2-blockers. With comparable pruritus symptom improvement (2 trials, n = 295), intravenous second-generation H1-antihistamine (sgAH) had favorable clinical outcomes compared with intravenous fgAH in the ED setting with a lower risk of return to any ED/clinic (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.12–0.83) and lower risk of any adverse event (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.09–0.63). The efficacy of adjunctive therapy with a short course of systemic glucocorticosteroids in ED and non-ED settings remains unclear. No serious concerns regarding the safety profiles were observed in any of the treatment comparisons.

Conclusions

H1-antihistamine is a crucial and effective component of acute urticaria treatment, and intravenous sgAH is preferred as an initial treatment option.

### Advances in the treatment of chronic urticaria [^112NcjVM]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

There have been a number of exciting developments in the treatment of allergic diseases in recent years, but the development of new treatments for urticaria has lagged behind. The standard treatment for chronic urticaria (CU) involves the use of H1 antagonists. A number of small but promising studies have found potential benefit with medications that are used less often. This article reviews the established therapies for CU and the experimental evidence for the use of nonstandard and relatively unknown therapies. The potential usefulness of some of the new allergy medications for the treatment of CU also is discussed.

### Leukotriene inhibitors in the treatment of allergy and asthma [^114sx2Sp]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Leukotriene inhibitors are the first new class of medications for the treatment of persistent asthma that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in more than two decades. They also have been approved for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Prescriptions of leukotriene inhibitors have outpaced the evidence supporting their use, perhaps because of perceived ease of use compared with other asthma medications. In the treatment of persistent asthma, randomized controlled trials have shown leukotriene inhibitors to be more effective than placebo but less effective than inhaled corticosteroids. The use of leukotriene inhibitors has not consistently shown an inhaled-steroid-sparing effect, a reduction in need for systemic steroid treatment, or a cost savings. For exercise-induced asthma, leukotriene inhibitors are as effective as long-acting beta2-agonist bronchodilators and are superior to placebo; they have not been compared with short-acting bronchodilators. Leukotriene inhibitors are as effective as antihistamines but are less effective than intranasal steroids for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. The use of leukotriene inhibitors in treating atopic dermatitis, aspirin-intolerant asthma, and chronic idiopathic urticaria appears promising but has not been studied thoroughly. Leukotriene inhibitors have minimal side effects and are well tolerated in most populations.

### Paediatric severe chronic spontaneous urticaria: successful management through conventional drug therapy [^113VDi8d]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) can occur in children and the clinical management is quite challenging. Here, we described a paediatric clinical case of CSU successfully managed by conventional therapy, including systemic steroids, cetirizine, anti-leukotriene drug and dietary restriction (for histamine-releasing foods). This patient showed neither atopy nor any allergic sensitisation; moreover, the autologous serum skin test resulted negative. This category of patients with no comorbidity and no evidence of atopy might benefit from the conventional drug management; however, a protracted course of steroid treatment with very slow and gradual tapering may be needed. This approach was successful and safe in our clinical case, but a careful follow-up, due to the potential side effects of steroids, should be recommended.

### Advances in drug allergy, urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis in 2018 [^111gaoyf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Many notable advances in drug allergy, urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis were reported in 2018. Broad-spectrum antibiotic use and, consequently, antibiotic resistance are widespread, and algorithms to clarify β-lactam allergy and optimize antibiotic use were described. Meaningful data emerged on the pathogenesis of delayed drug hypersensitivity reactions. Progress not only in defining biomarkers but also in understanding the effect on quality of life and developing better treatments has been made for patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria. Patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE) have gained additional access to highly efficacious therapies, with associated improvements in quality of life, and some progress was made in our understanding of recurrent angioedema in patients with normal laboratory results. Guidelines have defined clear goals to help providers optimize therapies in patients with HAE. The epidemiology and triggers of anaphylaxis and the mechanisms underlying anaphylaxis were elucidated further. In summary, these disorders (and labels) cause substantial burdens for individual persons and even society. Fortunately, publications in 2018 have informed on advancements in diagnosis and management and have provided better understanding of mechanisms that potentially could yield new therapies. This progress should lead to better health outcomes and paths forward in patients with drug allergy, urticaria, HAE, and anaphylaxis.

### Chronic spontaneous urticaria guidelines: what is new? [^1157LZBX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Urticaria is a heterogeneous inflammatory disorder that can be acute or chronic and is defined by the appearance of wheals, angioedema, or both. Very recently, the newest update and revision of the international European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology/Global Allergy and Asthma European Network/European Dermatology Forum/Asia Pacific Association of Allergy Asthma Clinical Immunology guideline for the definition, classification, diagnosis, and management of urticaria was published. It aims to help primary care physicians and specialists in the management of their patients with urticaria. The guideline applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluations approach to developing consensus recommendations. These recommendations were then discussed in a Delphi conference that included more than 250 specialists in the field, and they are endorsed by more than 50 international societies. Here, we highlight changes from previous versions of the international urticaria guideline and their impact on clinical practice.

### Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibition for the treatment of allergic disorders [^1176vwsW]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

IgE and its signaling pathway play key roles in the pathogenesis of numerous allergic disorders. Binding of specific IgE to its allergen cross-links the high-affinity receptor FcεRI on the surface of mast cells and basophils, initiating a signaling cascade which culminates in cellular degranulation (releasing histamine and other mediators), leukotriene and prostaglandin production, and cytokine synthesis. These released mediators cause the signs and symptoms of allergic disorders and are among the primary targets of current allergy pharmacotherapy, especially for treating acute allergic responses. Unfortunately, there are no therapies that reliably prevent IgE-mediated reactions, including corticosteroids. IgE-targeting biologics including omalizumab can improve symptoms of chronic urticaria and asthma through reducing availability of free IgE in circulation, but cannot completely suppress IgE-mediated activation of human mast cells and basophils. Therefore, there is an unmet need for novel therapies capable of preventing IgE-mediated allergic reactions.

Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is an essential enzyme for signaling through the FcεRI pathway in human mast cells and basophils (Figure 1A). Therefore, BTK is a major potential target for preventing IgE activation of these cells by any allergen, whether it be food, drug, venom, or aeroallergen. Though they are FDA-approved for B cell malignancies, unacceptable toxicities of the first- and second-generation BTK inhibitors (BTKis) have limited their application to non-cancer indications. Fortunately, the next-generation BTKis in development demonstrate a favorable side effect profile even with chronic use, opening numerous possibilities for the use of these drugs to treat various allergic disorders. This review discusses recent clinical trials utilizing BTKis for the prevention of acute food-induced anaphylaxis, chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), atopic dermatitis (AD), drug allergy, and asthma, as well as safety data for currently-approved BTKis and those in the pipeline.

### Omalizumab updosing in chronic spontaneous urticaria: an overview of real-world evidence [^1173Efuz]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
EAACI/GA 2 LEN/EDF/WAO International Guideline: recommended treatment algorithm for urticaria. Short course (maximum of 10 days) of corticosteroids may also be used at all times if exacerbations demand this. EAACI, European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology; EDF, European Dermatology Forum; GA 2 LEN, Global Allergy and Asthma European Network; H1-AH, H1 antihistamine; WAO, World Allergy Organization

Omalizumab (a recombinant, humanized anti-IgE antibody) is an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for CSU and the first drug approved for use in patients with CSU who remain symptomatic despite H1-AH treatment. Omalizumab is shown to be safe and effective across randomized placebo-controlled trials and several real-world studies, with a total patient exposure of 1,328,183 patient years (Novartis data on file, Dec 2019). Omalizumab binds IgE and rapidly reduces levels of free IgE by > 90%, resulting in a subsequent reduction of FcεRI, the high affinity IgE receptor, on blood basophils and mast cells in the skin. Both of these mechanisms are thought to importantly contribute to the efficacy of omalizumab in urticaria. Additional modes of action of omalizumab may exist in urticaria and further research will be necessary to fully clarify the potential of omalizumab in CSU. The definition of response to treatment in CSU differs between clinical trials, real-world studies and daily practice of individual physicians globally, and, therefore, the response to treatment in CSU also depends upon how it is measured. Commonly used categories for complete and well-controlled disease activity for CSU include Urticaria Activity Score (UAS) over 7 days (UAS7) of 0 and of ≤ 6 respectively. Omalizumab non-responders to treatment are generally considered to be those patients whose baseline UAS7 remains unchanged after treatment or who continue to present a UAS7 > 16 after six doses of omalizumab at 300 mg every 4 weeks. Partial responders are often defined by a reduction of the UAS7 by at least 30%, but by less than 90% or by patients showing a UAS7 > 6 but with an improvement in UAS7 as compared with baseline. Using the Urticaria Control Test (UCT), the cutoff values for "controlled disease" is ≥ 12 which is often considered as a complete response to treatment (complete control = 16, controlled urticaria ≥ 12, no control < 12). As per the current EAACI/GA 2 LEN/EDF/WAO guideline, the third line of treatment is recommended for the partial and non-responders to updosed AH treatment. The licensed dose of omalizumab is 300 mg in Europe and either 150 mg or 300 mg in the United States by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks. Some reports have shown examples of the optimization of omalizumab treatment in patients who show inadequate response by increasing the dose or decreasing the dosing intervals; a more flexible treatment regimen rather than a constant regimen including shortening dosing interval or augmenting dose based on the patient's symptoms is also likely to provide better symptom control. Although there is currently no algorithm for the individualized management of omalizumab treatment that is agreed on, treatment algorithms based on specific response profiles of patients refractory to AHs have been proposed to facilitate clinical management of omalizumab and enable clinicians to assess therapeutic strategy. The aim of this article is to provide a summary of the published real-world evidences for the updosing of omalizumab in the treatment of CSU.

### Chronic urticaria: do urticaria nonexperts implement treatment guidelines? A survey of adherence to published guidelines by nonexperts [^115TixA6]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines including level of evidence and grade of recommendation were recently published for chronic urticaria (CU).

Objectives

To describe the therapeutic approach in patients with CU, and to depict how recent guidelines are implemented in the daily practice of management of CU.

Methods

We performed a cross-sectional multicentre study through a questionnaire answered by 139 specialists. In total, 695 patients were evaluated, mean ± SD age 42.3 ± 15 years, 62.1% women. Of the patients, 168 were treated by an allergist, 473 by a dermatologist and in 54 cases the specialist was not stated. The drug prescribed was the main variable, and chi2 and Fisher's tests were utilized for the statistical analysis.

Results

Nonsedating anti-H1 antihistamines taken regularly were the most common drugs prescribed, followed by nonsedating anti-H1 antihistamines taken as needed, corticosteroids, sedating antihistamines taken regularly, sedating antihistamines taken as needed, anti-H2 antihistamines, leukotriene antagonists, ciclosporin and doxepin. Nonsedating antihistamines plus corticosteroids was the most frequent drug combination prescribed. When comparing between allergists and dermatologists we found a positive and significant correlation only between prescription of cetirizine, dexchlorfeniramine, leukotriene antagonists and anti-H2 antihistamines and being treated by an allergist. A positive correlation was found with desloratadine and being seen by a dermatologist. We did not find any difference in CU management in the rest of the treatments studied.

Conclusions

It is surprising that a large amount of sedating antihistamines was prescribed. In many instances these were prescribed as needed. This fact could have a negative impact on urticaria control and patient satisfaction. It seems difficult for the nonexpert to differentiate between CU and any kind of physical urticaria.

### Contact urticaria and related conditions: clinical review [^115xV1Sv]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Management

5.1 Trigger Identification and Avoidance

CoU can be prevented and successfully treated if correctly diagnosed. The most important steps are early trigger identification and complete avoidance of the culprit, especially in cases of I‐CoU. Occupational I‐CoU should be managed by eliminating the allergen from the direct work environment. If it is not possible to remove the trigger, other measures are required to reduce allergen exposure, such as using appropriate gloves and cotton liners. In cases of NI‐CoU, where the mechanism is non‐allergic and more dose‐dependent, strict avoidance may not always be necessary (e.g. in cases of sorbic acid in cosmetics). However, decreasing exposure frequency and dose may help alleviate or even eliminate signs and symptoms. Patients working in the food industry, for example, may be exposed to multiple allergens. Collaboration with occupational health services will facilitate the implementation of avoidance strategies and other safety and preventive measures in the workplace. If avoidance of further contact with causative substances is not entirely feasible and CoU impacts the patient's quality of life, pharmacological agents for symptomatic relief and prevention may be considered.

5.2 Treatment

The choice of treatment may vary depending on the type of reaction and its pathophysiology. In I‐CoU, second‐generation H 1 ‐antihistamines (sgAHs) at up to four times the licensed daily dose are the first‐line treatment, as histamine release plays a key role in its pathogenesis. In severe I‐CoU cases, with or without related PCD, where allergen avoidance is not possible or patients are refractory to sgAHs, anti‐IgE therapy with omalizumab may be beneficial. SgAHs and nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs are usually not effective for NI‐CoU. In PCD, topical corticosteroids can reduce local inflammation, while systemic glucocorticoids are typically reserved for the initial stages of severe cases. In severe PCD, other systemic therapies (e.g. cyclosporine, methotrexate) may be considered. The use of newer biologics, such as dupilumab, requires further research, particularly for PCD, as it has shown efficacy in chronic hand eczema in patients with atopic dermatitis. However, dupilumab did not benefit an isolated case of I‐CoU. Patients at increased risk for anaphylaxis should also carry an adrenaline auto‐injector at all times and wear a medical alert bracelet.

### Potential therapeutic approaches for chronic urticaria: beyond H1-antihistamines and biologics [^112wcu4p]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria is a disease that can significantly impact a patient's quality of life and ability to function. There are effective treatment options, such as nonsedating antihistamines or biologics, but some patients do not respond to these therapies, or the therapies are not available or affordable to all patients. This review aims to summarize potential treatment strategies for patients (1) who do not respond to antihistamines and (2) cannot readily access or do not respond to biologics. The review emphasizes the importance of sound clinical practice, including correct diagnosis of chronic urticaria phenotypes, treatment of associated comorbidities, and consideration of add-on pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches. Although some treatments may lack high-quality evidence, they may still be justifiable in certain cases, provided that there is shared decision-making, regular reassessment, and early recognition of adverse events.

Abstract

The global pandemic COVID‐19 has resulted in significant global morbidity, mortality and increased healthcare demands. There is now emerging evidence of patients experiencing urticaria. We sought to systematically review current evidence, critique the literature, and present our findings. Allowing PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was carried out with Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane, and Google Scholar, using key MeSH words, which include "COVID‐19", "Coronavirus", "SARS‐Cov‐2", "Urticaria", "Angioedema", and "Skin rash" up to 01 August 2020. The key inclusion criteria were articles that reported on urticaria and/or angioedema due to COVID‐19 infection and reported management and outcome. Studies were excluded if no case or cohort outcomes were observed. Our search returned 169 articles, 25 of which met inclusion criteria. All studies were case reports, reporting 26 patients with urticaria and/or angioedema, COVID‐19 infection and their management and/or response. ajority of patients (n = 16, 69%) were over 50 years old. However, urticaria in the younger ages was not uncommon, with reported case of 2 months old infant. Skin lesions resolved from less than 24 hours to up to 2 weeks following treatment with antihistamines and/or steroids. There have been no cases of recurrent urticaria or cases nonresponsive to steroids. Management of urticarial in COVID‐19 patients should involve antihistamines. Low dose prednisolone should be considered on an individualized basis. Further research is required in understanding urticarial pathogenesis in COVID‐19. This will aid early diagnostic assessment in patients with high index of suspicion and subsequent management in the acute phase.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^112rikzV]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Delayed pressure urticaria/angioedema (DPUA) management — Management differs from other types of chronic urticaria/angioedema and is often very difficult to treat; additional pharmacotherapeutic treatment is frequently required with avoidance measures, and conventional antihistamine dosing frequently lacks efficacy. Patients should be made aware of pressure or trauma triggers and avoidance is a critical element. Antihistamines at conventional doses might be efficacious for chronic urticaria but are frequently ineffective for prevention of angioedema provoked by pressure; advancing doses beyond FDA‑approved levels might be associated with greater efficacy, including a double‑blind study of cetirizine at a dose of 30 mg/d. A short course of systemic corticosteroids might be required for ongoing episodes, although long‑term systemic corticosteroid treatment is not generally regarded as favorable. Reports on nonsteroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are mixed; no benefit was observed in a double‑blind trial of 25 mg of indomethacin 3 times daily, and COX‑1–inhibiting drugs can provoke a flare in aspirin‑exacerbated urticaria/angioedema, so prescribing aspirin or aspirin‑like drugs should be approached with caution. Uncontrolled reports describe salutary effects from agents including montelukast, sulfasalazine, chloroquine, dapsone, intravenous gamma globulin, sulindac, acitretin, and anti–TNF‑α, but randomized controlled trials are required to substantiate their utility.

### Efficacy and safety of omalizumab in patients with chronic idiopathic / spontaneous urticaria who remain symptomatic on H1 antihistamines: a randomized, placebo-controlled study [^1129Bm69]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), also referred to as chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), is characterized by itchy wheals (hives), angioedema, or both that recur for > 6 weeks and have no apparent external trigger. H 1 antihistamines are licensed as first-line treatment for CIU/CSU, although many patients continue to experience symptoms despite receiving these drugs at up to four times higher than the approved dose. Recommended add-on therapy for patients unresponsive to up-dosing of H 1 antihistamines includes leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) and cyclosporine A. However, these agents have not received regulatory approval for this indication. Oral corticosteroids are used to treat CIU/CSU exacerbations, but they are not recommended for long-term treatment because of potential safety concerns with chronic use.

Cutaneous mast cells, blood basophils, and immunoglobulin E (IgE) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of chronic urticaria. Omalizumab, a humanized IgE monoclonal antibody licensed for the treatment of moderate-to-severe (US; patients aged ⩾12 years) and severe (Europe; patients aged ⩾6 years) allergic asthma, recently received approval from the European Medicines Agency and the US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for the treatment of CIU/CSU. Omalizumab may have a beneficial role in CIU/CSU by reducing mast cell and basophil activation mediated by IgE and its high-affinity receptor (FcɛRI). Data from proof-of-concept and phase II studies indicated that omalizumab improved symptoms and had an acceptable safety profile in patients with CIU/CSU.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^115o9QxV]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Corticosteroid immediate hypersensitivity — epidemiology, presentation, testing, cross-reactivity, excipients, and desensitization: Hypersensitivity reactions to corticosteroids have been reported with an estimated prevalence of 0.1% to 0.3%. Most immediate hypersensitivity reactions to corticosteroids occur within an hour of administration, with symptoms including urticaria, angioedema, wheezing, bronchospasm, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, or even cardiovascular collapse. In a review from 2004 to 2014, 120 hypersensitivity reactions to corticosteroids were reported in 106 patients; methylprednisolone was implicated in 41% of all types of reactions, followed by prednisone (20%), triamcinolone (14%), and hydrocortisone (10%), with reactions most commonly after intravenous (44% of cases) and oral (26%) administration. Identification of an alternative corticosteroid for future use is possible in most cases with skin prick and intradermal testing at nonirritating concentrations and graded challenge; whenever possible, testing should be performed with a preservative-free corticosteroid, in addition to preservative testing if needed, and negative skin test results should be confirmed with drug challenge. Reports vary on cross-reactivity: hydrocortisone is more cross-reactive with methylprednisolone than with halogenated corticosteroids such as dexamethasone and betamethasone, whereas others did not find a definite pattern based on history and skin and intradermal testing. Hydrophobic corticosteroids are sometimes chemically bonded to an ester such as sodium succinate or sodium phosphate to transform them into soluble injectable products, and immediate hypersensitivity reactions have been reported to the succinate ester component; hence, when evaluating a reaction thought to be secondary to esterified corticosteroids, it is recommended to include the suspected corticosteroids on the skin and intradermal testing, and, in addition, the same corticosteroids without the ester component or with a different ester. Immediate hypersensitivity reaction can also occur because of excipients or preservatives, and when they are present, skin testing with these agents can be considered; skin testing with milk proteins can be considered in patients with milk allergy reacting to lactose-containing corticosteroid preparations. Desensitization to methylprednisolone has been successfully performed and is an option when an alternative therapeutic agent cannot be identified.

### Chronic unremitting urticaria: is the use of antihistamines above the licensed dose effective? A preliminary study of cetirizine at licensed and above-licensed doses [^115iReEd]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Recently, several authors have suggested an off-label increase of antihistamine dosage should be given to patients with chronic urticaria (CU) not responding to the usual, recommended doses, in order to gain better control of the disease. However, this recommendation is not evidence-based. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of increased doses of antihistamines in patients with CU showing poor control at recommended doses. In total, 22 adult patients with moderate/severe CU not controlled with the usual antihistamine doses were studied. These subjects recorded urticaria severity on a visual analogue scale (range 0–10) for 2 weeks. During the first week, they were treated with cetirizine at the licensed dose (10 mg/day), and with a three-fold increased dose (10 mg x 3/day) during week 2. Only 1 patient (5%) responded satisfactorily to the increased dosage of antihistamine; in the remaining 21 subjects, urticaria scores did not change, and these patients had to be treated with steroids, ciclosporin, and in 1 case with cyclophosphamide. Disease control was eventually gained in all cases. This study suggests that the proportion of patients with severe CU that may gain a better control of their disease with high, off-label doses of antihistamines is probably small, and that most patients will eventually have to undergo more aggressive treatments.

### Urticaria: a comprehensive review: treatment of chronic urticaria, special populations, and disease outcomes [^112hwX2j]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Second-generation antihistamines are considered first-line agents in the treatment of chronic urticaria because of their safety and efficacy profile. Some patients require higher doses of H 1 antihistamines alone or in combination with other classes of medications, including H 2 antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, or first-generation H 1 antihistamines. One major therapeutic advance has been omalizumab, a humanized monoclonal anti-immunoglobulin E that was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic urticaria that is unresponsive to H 1 antagonists. In addition, the second article in this continuing medical education series outlines several evidence-based alternative treatments for urticaria and the differences in recommendations between 2 major consensus groups (the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology/World Allergy Organization and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Joint Task Force).

### Dual biologic therapy in a patient with severe asthma and other allergic disorders [^114FWLc7]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Severe asthma is very difficult to manage in many individuals, and systemic corticosteroids are often used to prevent or manage acute exacerbations. Furthermore, comorbid allergic conditions may render standard therapies inadequate. A 51-year-old man presented with severe eosinophilic asthma requiring nearly constant oral corticosteroid usage despite using high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and secondary asthma controllers. His condition was complicated by aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, including severe nasal polyposis, chronic rhinosinusitis, as well as chronic idiopathic urticaria. Mepolizumab was initiated and led to dramatic improvement of asthma over 6 months. However, he continued to experience exacerbations of chronic idiopathic urticaria not responsive to H1-antihistamines. Omalizumab was added, and the patient's urticaria attained marked improvement with only an occasional breakthrough rash. Dual biologic therapies can be a unique and useful steroid-sparing treatment option for patients with uncontrolled severe asthma and chronic idiopathic urticaria.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse systemic reactions usually occur within minutes and consist primarily of allergic symptoms such as: generalized skin erythema, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, rhinitis, induced asthma, itching of nose or throat, wheezing, laryngeal edema, dyspnea, coughing, marked perspiration and hypotension. Less commonly, nausea, emesis, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and uterine contractions may occur. Severe reactions may cause anaphylaxis or shock and loss of consciousness. Fatalities have occurred rarely.(12)To some extent, the reaction rate is related to the type and dose of administered extract and to the degree of sensitivity of the patient.

The treatment of systemic allergic reactions is dependent upon the symptom complex. Antihistamines may offer relief of recurrent urticaria, associated skin reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms. Corticosteroids may provide benefit if symptoms are prolonged or recurrent. (See Overdosage)

Local reactions consisting of erythema, itching, swelling tenderness and sometimes pain may occur at the injection site. These reactions may appear within a few minutes to hours and persist for several days. Local cold applications and oral antihistamines may be effective treatment for local reactions. For marked and prolonged local reactions steroids may be helpful.

Serious adverse reactions should be reported to Nelco Laboratories immediately and a report can be filed to MedWatch, The FDA Medical Product Problem Reporting Program, at 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852–9787, call 1–800-FDA-1088.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^115qiCv5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Clopidogrel hypersensitivity — continuation of clopidogrel with steroids and antihistamines (treating through) is used because cardiology data show a significant risk (25%-30%) of thrombosis with interruption of antiplatelet therapy. In one series, 62 patients received a 30-mg twice-daily tapering prednisone course plus benadryl 25 to 50 mg Q6–8PRN without drug stoppage and this approach was successful in 98% of patients with rashes resolving in about 5 days, failing in 1 patient who developed angioedema and required hospitalization. Among 25 patients with delayed rashes treated with methylprednisolone and antihistamines (fexofenadine 180 mg every day with 25–50 mg diphenhydramine-QHS) for a mean of 10 ± 8 days without interruption of clopidogrel, 22 of 25 (88%) had no adverse effects/events on long-term follow-up and all completed clopidogrel therapy; the mean duration of steroid treatment was 10 days, and 2 patients had recurrent symptoms treated with more corticosteroids (18 days starting with prednisone 60 mg), an antileukotriene (montelukast 10 mg), and antihistamines; in sum, 3 patients failed this therapy; another group used prednisone 30 mg twice a day with cetirizine 10 mg daily with success. This approach is reasonable for benign, maculopapular, or erythematous eruptions likely to be T-cell–mediated and without organ involvement, but it is not recommended in IgE-mediated reactions or rashes suggestive of a severe T-cell–mediated reaction, and caution is warranted for cutaneous reactions suggestive of IgE (eg, urticaria) because the studies demonstrating this approach to urticarial rashes are not robust enough to determine safety.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^111US8xR]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Are there biomarkers of activity in CSU?

The severity of CSU should be evaluated based on the intensity of its clinical symptoms. Several biomarkers, such as interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein and D-dimers, metalloproteinase-9 and complement C3 and C4, have shown distinctive patterns in CSU patients, but these molecules have still not been validated as useful biomarkers.

Key point: Although several substances may show specific levels in CSU patients, they have not yet been validated as CSU biomarkers.

Does isolated angioedema have clinical, therapeutic and/or prognostic implications?

Isolated angioedema with no hives that responds to antihistamines should be explored and phenotyped. Most guidelines – include isolated angioedema as a subtype of CSU. However, this condition does not share the typical features of chronic urticaria, such as being more frequent in women or having an autoimmune profile. In certain cases, typical CSU starts with isolated angioedema that evolves into cutaneous wheals. On the other hand, histaminergic angioedema is clearly different from bradykinin-mediated angioedema, which does not respond to antihistamines or corticosteroids, has a different physiopathology – and requires a different treatment approach. The differential diagnosis for isolated angioedema is shown in Table 5.

Table 5
Differential diagnosis of isolated angioedema

Key point: Isolated angioedema does not share the typical features of CSU.

How should the diagnosis of CSU in children be approached?

Chronic spontaneous urticaria is less frequent in children, but in general, it shares the underlying causes and physiopathology of CSU in adults. Therefore, the diagnostic approach in children and adults is the same. However, it should be noted that infants are more prone to develop acute urticaria secondary to an infection.

Key point: The diagnostic approach to CSU in children should be the same as that in adults.

### Histaminergic angioedema [^117FCcej]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Angioedema is frequently categorized into histamine- or bradykinin-mediated disease. It is critical to determine the underlying mediator of symptoms as it directs treatment. Histaminergic angioedema is the most frequent cause of angioedema. It is classified as either acute (lasting < 6 weeks) or chronic (symptoms > 6 weeks). It is further classified into angioedema presenting with or without urticaria. Some patients with acute angioedema may have disease that becomes chronic. Mast cells and basophils are central to the underlying pathophysiology of histamine-mediated angioedema. The underlying treatments of histamine-mediated angioedema are antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine.

### What's new in the treatment of urticaria and angioedema [^111qSgoj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria and angioedema are diseases often managed by Allergy and Immunology specialists. Recent international guidelines have outlined a stepwise approach to management of patients using dose escalation of second-generation antihistamines followed by use of omalizumab and finally cyclosporine in more refractory cases. In select patients (those with refractory chronic urticaria), nonbiologic alternative medications with anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressant activity may be considered. Angioedema without wheals may have several different pathophysiologic mechanisms. Optimal management of mast cell-mediated angioedema is less clear but is often managed similar to chronic spontaneous urticaria. Drug-induced angioedema due to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is a common cause of angioedema in the emergency department. Although bradykinin is thought to be a primary mediator for this type of angioedema, studies of targeted therapies have been generally disappointing. In contrast, several targeted therapies have been proven successful using acute and preventive approaches for management of hereditary angioedema. Further developments, including novel biologics, novel oral therapies, and gene therapy approaches, may hopefully continue to broaden therapeutic options to ensure optimal individual management of patients with hereditary angioedema.

There are many unsolved issues in CSU, from the underlying lack of large epidemiology studies. In the present review, practical guidance based on common questions related to the clinical management of patients with CSU is provided. We selected key questions from previously published guidelines and updated them using the most recently available evidence obtained from a careful critique of the literature. We also tried to cover a number of topics that are given less attention in current CSU guidelines, such as prognosis, severity assessment and urticaria duration.

### Increased risk of major depression subsequent to a first-attack and non-infection caused urticaria in adolescence: a nationwide population-based study [^112dK5uo]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Pharmacological treatment (corticosteroids)

There were 2,473 patients who had ever received corticosteroids for their urticaria. The prevalence of major depression was higher in the group treated with corticosteroids (n = 31, 1.3%) compared with the group without corticosteroids (n = 3, 0.1%) (p < 0.05). Moreover, in the adjusted model, the urticarial patients who had ever received corticosteroids were more likely to experience new-onset major depression compared with the control group patients (HR = 1.89; 95% CI = 1.23–2.87; p < 0.05) (Table 2).

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^111MYp4V]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Key point: Cyclosporine may be considered as an off-label therapeutic option for controlling CSU in patients who are refractory to antihistamines and omalizumab.

What is the role of oral antileukotrienes in the treatment of CSU? The efficacy of antileukotrienes has been reported in small randomized double-blind studies – with inconsistent results. Monotherapy with antileukotrienes is not advisable.

Key point: The evidence supporting leukotriene inhibitors as a therapeutic option in CSU is weak, and their use in CSU is not recommended.

Which patients with CSU should be treated with omalizumab? The efficacy and safety of omalizumab have been demonstrated in two randomized, placebo-controlled phase III studies in patients with CSU who remained symptomatic despite H 1 -antihistamine therapy at the approved dose. A third study primarily evaluated the safety of omalizumab in patients with CSU who remained symptomatic despite treatment with H 1 -antihistamines at up to four times the approved dose, and with H 2 -antihistamine and/or leukotriene inhibitors treatment. Omalizumab is the only drug indicated in Europe and the United States as an add-on therapy for the treatment of CSU in adult and adolescent (12 years and older) patients with an inadequate response to H 1 -antihistamine treatment.

3 Diagnostic Workup

A critical part of the diagnostic workup of CoU and related conditions is obtaining a thorough medical history with a high degree of suspicion. Patients should be asked about their symptoms and signs (Tables 1 and 2), the time from exposure to onset, the duration until resolution and potential triggers such as food, workplace exposures, personal care products, habits and medications. It is important to determine whether symptoms began before or after starting a particular job and if there is improvement during time away from work. Collaboration with occupational physicians is often necessary to assess potential triggers. In patients with CoU, skin reactions are often absent during physical examination, making the evaluation of photographs of skin lesions particularly valuable.

Diagnostic tests must be carefully selected, performed and interpreted by trained professionals. False‐positive results can lead to unnecessarily restrictive measures and negatively impact a patient's quality of life, while false‐negative results may result in continued exposure to triggering substances. Skin tests are summarised in Table 4.

TABLE 4
Skin tests for diagnosing immediate contact skin reactions.

NI‐CoU is generally diagnosed based on medical history, including exposure history (e.g. photographs of cosmetic product ingredients and safety material data sheets), photographs of skin reactions, and positive non‐invasive skin tests (see Section 3.1 and Table 2).

For I‐CoU, IgE sensitisation must be confirmed using skin tests (e.g. SPTs, prick‐by‐prick tests), in vitro tests, or a combination of both. It is important to note that confirmed sensitisation does not alone indicate an allergic disease. A diagnosis of IgE‐dependent allergy is based on a convincing clinical history and proven sensitisation to the culprit allergen (Table 2). Diagnosing I‐CoU caused by LMW chemicals can be challenging, as these substances are usually not commercially available for skin and in vivo tests.

NI‐CoU reactions may be suppressed by ultraviolet B (UVB) and ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation, as well as by oral and topical nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs. False‐negative reactions in I‐CoU may occur due to the use of H 1 ‐antihistamines (if taken within five plasma half‐lives of drug elimination), systemic glucocorticoids (if taken within 7 days), tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. doxepin, amitriptyline) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. paroxetine, sertraline).

### Management of chronic spontaneous urticaria made practical: what every clinician should know [^115B7twK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite its significant impact on quality of life, optimal management of chronic spontaneous urticaria remains challenging because of knowledge gaps regarding triggers, treatment response variability, and limited data for special populations. Second-generation H1-antihistamines are the first-line treatment and effective in approximately 50% of patients. For those who remain symptomatic, up-dosing up to fourfold is safe and recommended. However, prolonged ineffective antihistamine therapy should be avoided to prevent delayed disease control. In such cases, timely escalation to biologics, particularly omalizumab, is essential. Omalizumab remains the cornerstone of biologic therapy, offering rapid and sustained efficacy with an excellent safety profile. Personalized approaches involving dose escalation or interval adjustments further optimize outcomes. Cyclosporine A serves as an effective third-line option, particularly for autoimmune chronic spontaneous urticaria, but requires close monitoring because of dose-related adverse effects. Special considerations for children, pregnant individuals, and elderly people are discussed, reflecting the need for tailored approaches. Trigger avoidance, particularly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, may aid management, although evidence is limited for many suspected exacerbating factors. Regular assessment of disease activity and control using validated tools such as the Urticaria Activity Score and Urticaria Control Test is essential for guiding treatment decisions and monitoring response. Updated international guidelines are anticipated to address emerging therapies and current knowledge gaps.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Hypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, rash) have occurred after administration of FASENRA. Discontinue in the event of a hypersensitivity reaction. (5.1)
Reduction in Corticosteroid Dosage: Do not discontinue systemic or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation of therapy with FASENRA. Decrease corticosteroids gradually, if appropriate. (5.3)
Parasitic (Helminth) Infection: Treat patients with pre-existing helminth infections before therapy with FASENRA. If patients become infected while receiving FASENRA and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, discontinue FASENRA until the parasitic infection resolves. (5.4)

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, rash) have occurred following administration of FASENRA. These reactions generally occur within hours of administration, but in some instances have a delayed onset (i.e., days). In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, FASENRA should be discontinued [see Contraindications (4)].

5.2 Acute Asthma Symptoms or Deteriorating Disease

FASENRA should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms or acute exacerbations. Do not use FASENRA to treat acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus. Patients should seek medical advice if their asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens after initiation of treatment with FASENRA.

5.3 Reduction of Corticosteroid Dosage

Do not discontinue systemic or inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) abruptly upon initiation of therapy with FASENRA. Reductions in corticosteroid dose, if appropriate, should be gradual and performed under the direct supervision of a physician. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be associated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy.

5.4 Parasitic (Helminth) Infection

Eosinophils may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections. Patients with known helminth infections were excluded from participation in clinical trials. It is unknown if FASENRA will influence a patient's response against helminth infections.

Treat patients with pre-existing helminth infections before initiating therapy with FASENRA. If patients become infected while receiving treatment with FASENRA and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, discontinue treatment with FASENRA until infection resolves.

### Evaluating chronic urticaria patients for allergies, infections, or autoimmune disorders [^1135YhGJ]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Urticaria is a common disorder affecting one-fifth of the world's population. The pathophysiology is characterized by an increased propensity for mast cell degranulation with the release of potent mediators into the dermal and subdermal tissues with resulting vasoactive, chemotactic, and inflammatory effects. The final clinical manifestation of the typical urticarial lesion is the effect of several diverse effects and causes. The general classification is acute, chronic, and physical urticaria. In general, allergenic triggers can be identified in between 60–80% of acute urticarias. Physical urticarias are characterized by the onset after the specific inciting stimulus, which can reproduce the characteristic lesion which is usually of shorter duration (with the exception of delayed pressure urticaria). Chronic idiopathic urticaria is associated with thyroid autoimmunity and, more recently, anti-mast cell receptor antibodies. An extensive work-up is usually not indicated or helpful in identifying a cause. Food or other allergens are rare causes of this type of presentation. The evaluation and work-up is dependent on clues identified by history. The treatment is removal of specific and non-specific triggers and the use of symptomatic medications generally attenuating the mediator effects.

### The burden of chronic spontaneous urticaria is substantial: real-world evidence from ASSURE-CSU [^116r3aPy]. Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

The reasons for ED visits and hospitalizations may center on patient and physician awareness and education. Depending on the healthcare system in a country, the use of this high‐cost care could be due to an inaccessibility of primary‐ or secondary‐care physicians for flare‐ups and steroid prescriptions. Alternatively, patients who have been treated in the ED before may feel that it is where CSU should be treated, or they may receive secondary gain from this visit, such as sick leave. In certain circumstances, hospitalization may be used for observation or to manage angioedema when anaphylaxis is feared by inexperienced ED physicians or because of delays in specialist referral.

Treatment modalities reported included therapies recommended in the current guidelines during the study period. However, patients were not always treated along formal guideline recommendations: For example, sedating first‐generation H 1 ‐antihistamines, intravenous immunoglobulin, and long‐term oral corticosteroids were not uncommon. These results suggest that, at the time of study, some providers may have had insufficient resources or knowledge in treating patients with CSU. They may have resorted to trial‐and‐error approaches with therapies that carry significant side‐effect risks and lack efficacy evidence, 2 particularly when treating patients refractory to standard licensed therapy. Moreover, the monoclonal antibody omalizumab was included in the urticaria treatment guidelines in 2013 2 and was approved for inadequately controlled CSU in 2014. However, omalizumab had not yet launched in the study countries during data collection, and few patients (< 6%) in this study were treated with it. Future research should explore how disease burden and outcomes in CSU are affected by the introduction of omalizumab, its inclusion in the clinical guidelines, and its uptake in clinical practice.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^1122aHpj]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

How should CSU be managed in children?

Several studies have assessed the efficacy of treatment in paediatric patients with chronic urticaria, and recommendations for adults have been extrapolated to children. The treatment of choice is standard dosage of second-generation H 1 -antihistamines, according to the products' technical specifications. Currently, ketotifen and cetirizine can be used in infants from the age of 6 months; levocetirizine, loratadine, desloratadine and ebastine can be used from 2 years of age; and rupatadine can be used from 6 years of age. Recent guidelines include specific recommendations to avoid first-generation H 1 -antihistamines due to the probable impact on school performance. There are reports of successful use of cyclosporine in children similar to the response found in adults. There is little evidence of the efficacy of other therapeutic alternatives, such as systemic corticosteroids, dapsone, omalizumab, intravenous immunoglobulins and plasmapheresis; these options should be evaluated on an individual basis in cases of severe refractory chronic urticaria. None of the currently licensed antihistamines is contraindicated in children aged 12 or older, according to the British Association of Dermatologists Therapy Guidelines and Audit Subcommittee. As dosing and age restrictions for individual products vary in younger children, it is recommended that the relevant datasheets be consulted before prescribing antihistamines in children.

Key point: CSU in children should be managed in the same way as for adults.

A suggested treatment approach is included in Figure 1. It should be noted that as omalizumab is just approved as an add-on therapy, long-term data are needed to assess that omalizumab is safer and better cost-saving alternative than the remaining therapies available.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^113QwphX]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

In spite of being an old disease and apparently easy to diagnose, chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is still perceived as an uncontrollable and difficult to manage disease. The perception of the patient is that his/her condition is not well understood and that is suffering from a disorder with hidden causes that doctors are not able to tackle. Sometimes patients go through a number of clinicians until they found some CSU expert who is familiar with the disease. It is surprising that myths and believes with no scientific support still persist. Guidelines are not widely implemented, and recent tools to assess severity are infrequently used. European and American recent guidelines do not agree in several key points related to diagnosis and treatment, which further contributes to confusion. With the aim to clarify some aspects of the CSU picture, a group of allergists and dermatologists from the Spanish Dermatology and Allergy societies developed a Frequent Asked Questions leaflet that could facilitate physicians work in daily practice and contribute to a better knowledge of common clinical scenarios related to patients with CSU.

### Effective prescribing in steroid allergy: controversies and cross-reactions [^112BuWKp]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Contact allergy to topical corticosteroids should be considered in all patients who do not respond to, or are made worse by, the use of topical steroids. The incidence of steroid allergy in such patients is reported as 9% to 22% in adult patients and in 25% of children. It can often go undiagnosed for a long time in patients with a long history of dermatologic conditions and steroid use. Although rare, both immediate and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions have been reported to systemic corticosteroids with an incidence of 0.3%. Reported reactions range from localized eczematous eruptions to systemic reactions, anaphylaxis, and even death. Delayed type reactions to systemically administered steroids may present as a generalized dermatitis, an exanthematous eruption, or occasionally, with blistering or purpura. In this contribution, we clarify the issues surrounding the pathogenesis of steroid allergy, cover the importance of cross-reactions, and describe strategies for the investigation and management for patients with suspected steroid allergy.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^1179SnLv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — antihistamines — In most cases antihistamines are effective therapy, and after eliminating identifiable triggers, high-quality evidence supports antihistamines as first-line therapy. Second-generation antihistamines are designed to limit transfer across the blood-brain barrier and have less sedating effects than first-generation agents; first-generation antihistamines can be associated with sedation and impaired motor skills and should be prescribed with caution in older adults, and higher than FDA-approved doses of some second-generation antihistamines can cause sedation. Second-generation antihistamines are effective for acute urticaria when used regularly and titrated to an effective dose in most patients, with reassuring long-term safety, even in small children; other medications with potent antihistaminic activity, such as doxepin, might have efficacy when FDA-approved antihistamines lack sufficient efficacy, and Histamine 2 blockers, in combination with H1-antihistamines, might be considered, although the evidence supporting this combination is weak.

### Steroid treatment adds No benefit to antihistamines for… [^1115oS9U]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Question In patients presenting with acute urticaria, is combination antihistamine/corticosteroid treatment more effective than antihistamine alone. Bottom Line The combination approach of steroids and antihista-mines offers no added benefit to antihistamines alone for the treatment of simple urticaria. Synopsis The investigators enrolled 100 adults who presented to an emergency department with a generalized rash for less than one day with fleeting wheals and itching but without angioedema or anaphylaxis. All patients were treated with the antihistamine levocetirizine, 5 mg daily for five days, and they were all randomized, using concealed allocation, to additionally receive placebo or prednisone, 40 mg daily for four days. On follow-up by telephone, 62% of patients treated with antihistamine/prednisone and 76% receiving antihistamine/placebo were asymptomatic.

Relapse of urticaria was similar in both groups. The study had 80% power to find a difference of 28 percentage points if a difference existed, and analysis was by intention to treat.
