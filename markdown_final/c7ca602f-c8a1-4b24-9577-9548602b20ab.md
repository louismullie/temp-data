## Question

Recommendations of foods for microalbuminuria reduction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about recommendations of foods and dietary strategies to reduce microalbuminuria in people with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining microalbuminuria and confirming its prognostic significance. Then, I should verify the overarching clinical goals and the role of albuminuria reduction as a surrogate target. Next, I will examine protein intake recommendations, including quantity and source, and reconcile conflicting evidence. After that, I need to evaluate sodium restriction and its synergy with RAAS blockade. Then, I will consider broader dietary patterns, weight loss, and acid load. Finally, I should integrate pharmacologic therapy, monitoring, and practical implementation with attention to feasibility and adherence, before summarizing a unified recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions so I don't anchor on a misclassification. Microalbuminuria is defined as a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 30–300 mg/g, and it signals increased risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular events, with risk rising even at lower albumin levels, which underscores the clinical importance of reducing albuminuria when present [^115BwNSR] [^116Gs5oW] [^115xrZhi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment targets without aligning with guidelines. The clinical goal is to slow CKD progression and reduce cardiovascular risk; albuminuria reduction of at least 30% is a reasonable surrogate target in patients with albuminuria ≥ 300 mg/g, and contemporary standards emphasize integrated risk-factor management rather than any single dietary lever alone [^112Fp8ir] [^1151TkYR].

> I will now examine protein intake quantity, because this is often the most debated. Wait, let me verify the guideline consensus: for adults with diabetes and CKD stages 1–4, a protein intake of about 0.8 g/kg/day is recommended, and higher protein intake (> 20% of calories or > 1.3 g/kg/day) is associated with increased albuminuria and faster kidney function decline, so it should be avoided. Reducing protein below 0.8 g/kg/day has not shown added benefit on hard outcomes and may risk undernutrition if not carefully supervised [^113Cc5i5] [^116RcBnG] [^115W3ZB8].

> But wait, what if the patient has type 1 diabetes rather than type 2; does the evidence differ? In type 1 diabetes with CKD, meta-analyses suggest that modest protein restriction can reduce progression and even lower risk of ESRD or death, supporting the 0.8 g/kg/day target in that subgroup as well, though adherence and nutritional monitoring remain critical [^112AwXHV] [^114SfxeG].

> Next, I should review the source of protein, because quality may matter beyond quantity. Let me consider the data: replacing red meat with chicken or fish, or emphasizing plant-based proteins, may reduce albuminuria and improve lipids, plausibly via lower saturated fat and different renal hemodynamic effects. However, a randomized crossover trial in type 2 diabetes with microalbuminuria found no clear advantage of exclusively plant-based protein over mixed animal–plant protein on renal endpoints, so I need to be cautious not to overstate source-specific effects [^117RFf9M] [^113YTPTP] [^1176mbLd].

> I should double-check the sodium restriction evidence, since this is where synergy with RAAS blockade is strongest. High-certainty data show that reducing dietary sodium by roughly 73–92 mmol/day (about 1.7–2.1 g sodium/day) lowers systolic/diastolic blood pressure by about 7/4 mmHg and reduces albuminuria by roughly 30–36% in CKD, with larger effects when combined with ACE inhibitors or ARBs; guidelines generally advise < 2,300 mg/day sodium, and some recommend < 1,500–2,000 mg/day in proteinuric CKD, recognizing that individualized targets and monitoring for hypotension are needed [^115A9CQA] [^114w1PhW] [^111kt87B] [^113tnCV4].

> Let me think about broader dietary patterns, because single-nutrient advice often fails without a coherent eating pattern. A Mediterranean-style pattern emphasizing fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, unsaturated fats, and lower refined carbs and sweetened beverages is recommended in diabetes with CKD, and DASH-style diets are associated with lower incident kidney disease; importantly, a fruit-and-vegetable–focused DASH variant reduced albumin excretion in those with higher-normal baseline AER, suggesting a potential early renoprotective signal even beyond blood pressure effects [^113Li7i1] [^1118ws9Y] [^115xXh9R] [^114Kcxrh].

> I need to ensure I address weight management, since obesity and insulin resistance independently worsen glomerular hyperfiltration and albuminuria. Weight loss of about 5–10% via caloric restriction and increased physical activity improves albuminuria and eGFR, likely mediated by reductions in blood pressure and insulin; in the DIRECT trial, multiple diet strategies produced similar improvements in albuminuria, with regression observed particularly in those with baseline microalbuminuria, reinforcing that weight loss itself is a key driver of benefit [^116ENqeg] [^113QbX22] [^116Mhx94].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of acid load and phosphate burden, because these can aggravate CKD progression. Diets higher in fruits and vegetables lower net acid load and may modestly reduce proteinuria, and while potassium intake is generally protective in early CKD, I must individualize advice in those with hyperkalemia risk or advanced CKD; feasibility data show that providing fruits and vegetables with cooking instruction can sustain intake and yield small ACR reductions in high-risk communities, which is encouraging for implementation [^117RFf9M] [^114AkP9C] [^1157tj7o].

> Next, I should review pharmacologic therapy because diet rarely suffices alone. ACE inhibitors or ARBs are first-line to reduce albuminuria and slow CKD progression in diabetes, and in proteinuric CKD, tighter blood pressure targets (≤ 130/80 mmHg) are advised; SGLT2 inhibitors, nonsteroidal MRAs like finerenone, and GLP-1 receptor agonists further reduce albuminuria and improve kidney outcomes, and their effects are complementary to dietary measures, so I need to ensure these are optimized in parallel [^1151Dbmu] [^1139xS8B] [^1151TkYR].

> I should confirm monitoring and safety steps so we don't miss iatrogenic harm. Baseline and periodic checks of serum creatinine/eGFR, potassium, and albumin-to-creatinine ratio are essential, with repeat ACR measurements to confirm persistence; when initiating or intensifying RAAS blockade, SGLT2 inhibitors, or MRAs, I need to monitor for AKI and hyperkalemia, and adjust antihypertensives if dietary sodium restriction lowers blood pressure excessively, especially in those prone to hypotension or on diuretics [^113YWT6t] [^117GKq7f] [^113tnCV4].

> Let me reconsider feasibility and adherence, because recommendations that patients cannot implement won't help. Very-low-protein diets with keto acids are sometimes used in advanced CKD but have adherence challenges and uncertain added benefit in early diabetic CKD; instead, moderate protein restriction to 0.8 g/kg/day with emphasis on plant-forward patterns and practical sodium targets is more sustainable, and structured nutrition therapy with a registered dietitian improves adherence and outcomes, which I should build into the care plan [^112GSxfT] [^113XB8W2] [^114AkP9C].

> Putting this together, I should synthesize a unified, prioritized approach. Target protein intake of about 0.8 g/kg/day, avoid protein intake above 1.3 g/kg/day or > 20% of calories, favor plant-forward and fish/poultry over red and processed meats, restrict sodium to < 2,300 mg/day and consider < 1,500–2,000 mg/day in proteinuric CKD, adopt a Mediterranean or DASH-style eating pattern with high fruit and vegetable intake, pursue intentional weight loss of 5–10% if overweight, and pair these with optimized ACEi/ARB, SGLT2 inhibitor, and/or MRA therapy to achieve at least a 30% reduction in albuminuria when feasible, all under close laboratory monitoring and dietitian support [^113Cc5i5] [^113Li7i1] [^115A9CQA] [^112Fp8ir] [^1151TkYR].

> Finally, I should double-check that I've addressed the key caveats. Evidence quality varies across protein-source trials, sodium restriction shows the most consistent anti-proteinuric effect, and weight loss appears to be a dominant mediator of albuminuria reduction. Therefore, I need to tailor advice to kidney function, blood pressure, potassium handling, and cultural preferences, and I must avoid overly restrictive diets that compromise nutrition or adherence without proven incremental benefit [^113YTPTP] [^115A9CQA] [^116ENqeg] [^114AkP9C].

To reduce microalbuminuria, emphasize **plant-forward, low-sodium eating** with moderate protein (0.8 g/kg/day) [^113Cc5i5] and **limit sodium to < 2,300 mg/day** [^111kt87B] [^113tnCV4]. Prioritize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, and unsaturated fats; limit red/processed meats, refined carbs, and added sugars [^113Li7i1]. Weight loss and omega-3s may help, but **evidence is limited** [^116ENqeg] [^113QbX22] [^116dDxXf]. Combine diet with ACEi/ARB, SGLT2 inhibitors, and blood pressure control for best results [^1151TkYR] [^1148MErb].

---

## Dietary protein intake

Moderate protein restriction to **~0.8 g/kg/day** is recommended for CKD stages 1–4 [^116RcBnG] to reduce albuminuria and slow GFR decline; higher intake (> 1.3 g/kg/day or > 20% of calories) increases albuminuria and accelerates kidney function loss [^113Cc5i5]. Evidence is mixed in type 2 diabetes with preserved eGFR; some trials show no clear benefit from protein restriction, so intake should be individualized and monitored [^115DiHXt] [^1139iB6t].

---

## Sodium intake

Sodium restriction to **< 2,300 mg/day** [^111kt87B] reduces albuminuria and blood pressure, with greater benefit when combined with ACE inhibitors or ARBs [^114w1PhW] [^111kt87B]. High sodium intake (> 3.5 g/day) increases albuminuria and CKD progression risk [^116e252G].

---

## Dietary patterns

- **Mediterranean diet**: High in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, and unsaturated fats; associated with lower albuminuria and slower CKD progression [^113QbX22] [^111u8bTZ].

- **DASH diet**: Emphasizes fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, nuts, and seeds; lowers blood pressure and may reduce albuminuria [^1176mbLd].

- **Plant-based diets**: Higher in plant protein and lower in animal protein; associated with lower albuminuria and improved kidney function [^115JRmEJ] [^113Li7i1].

---

## Specific foods and nutrients

- **Omega-3 fatty acids**: Found in fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines); may reduce inflammation and albuminuria, though evidence is limited [^notfound].

- **Fiber-rich foods**: Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes improve glycemic control and may reduce albuminuria [^1157tj7o].

- **Potassium-rich foods**: May lower blood pressure and albuminuria, but intake should be individualized in advanced CKD due to hyperkalemia risk [^114AkP9C] [^112D8Twx].

---

## Foods to limit or avoid

- **High-sodium foods**: Processed meats, canned soups, fast food, and salty snacks increase albuminuria and blood pressure [^111kt87B] [^113tnCV4].

- **High-protein animal foods**: Red and processed meats may increase albuminuria and CKD progression risk [^115xXh9R] [^117RFf9M].

- **Refined carbohydrates and added sugars**: Associated with worse glycemic control and increased albuminuria [^notfound].

---

## Weight management

Weight loss in overweight/obese individuals reduces **albuminuria** and improves kidney function, likely via improved insulin sensitivity and blood pressure [^116ENqeg] [^113QbX22]. Even modest weight loss (5–10%) can significantly reduce albuminuria [^notfound].

## Conclusion and recommendations

A **plant-forward, low-sodium diet** with moderate protein, high fiber, and healthy fats is recommended to reduce microalbuminuria. Combine dietary changes with blood pressure control, glycemic management, and pharmacologic therapy (ACE inhibitors/ARBs, SGLT2 inhibitors) for optimal renal and cardiovascular outcomes [^1151TkYR] [^1148MErb].

### Microalbuminuria and cardiovascular risk [^1159fR6W]. American Journal of Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Microalbuminuria is a marker for generalized vascular dysfunction. Its prevalence in United States and European general population surveys ranges from 6% to 10%. Increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality begins with albumin excretion rates that are well within normal limits. Although microalbuminuria interacts with the traditional cardiovascular risk factors, it has an independent relationship to renal and cardiovascular outcomes. For example, microalbuminuria doubles the risk for a cardiovascular event in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus even after adjusting for the usual risk factors. Elevated rates of urinary albumin excretion predict target organ damage, notably renal disease, but are also related to left ventricular dysfunction, stroke, and myocardial infarction. Screening for microalbuminuria, which is recommended by several expert committees and associations, has become a readily accessible procedure. Screening can give clinicians prognostic information concerning cardiovascular risk and assist in guiding therapy. The goal of treatment is to prevent progression of, and even to reverse, microalbuminuria. Abundant evidence demonstrates that antihypertensive therapy is an important key to the control of urinary albumin excretion, and blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers) is the treatment of choice. These drugs have successfully halted or delayed the progression to nephropathy and have reversed elevated rates of albumin excretion to normal values, even when blood pressure reduction has been minimal.

Treatment

In the treatment of the nonpregnant patient with micro- or macroalbuminuria, either ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be used. (A)
While there are no adequate head-to-head comparisons of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, there is clinical trial support for each of the following statements: In patients with type 1 diabetes, hypertension, and any degree of albuminuria, ACE inhibitors have been shown to delay the progression of nephropathy. (A) In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and microalbuminuria, both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to delay the progression to macroalbuminuria. (A) In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, macroalbuminuria, and renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl), ARBs have been shown to delay the progression of nephropathy. (A) If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. (E)
Reduction of protein intake to 0.8–1.0 g · kg body wt⁻¹ · day⁻¹ in individuals with diabetes and the earlier stages of CKD and to 0.8 g · kg body wt⁻¹ · day⁻¹ in the later stages of CKD may improve measures of renal function (urine albumin excretion rate, GFR) and is recommended. (B)
When ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics are used, monitor serum creatinine and potassium levels for the development of acute kidney disease and hyperkalemia. (E)
Continued monitoring of urine albumin excretion to assess both response to therapy and progression of disease is recommended. (E)
Consider referral to a physician experienced in the care of kidney disease when there is uncertainty about the etiology of kidney disease (active urine sediment, absence of retinopathy, rapid decline in GFR), difficult management issues, or advanced kidney disease. (B)

### Renal function following three distinct weight loss dietary strategies during 2 years of a randomized controlled trial [^11664pmm]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

In recent years, growing evidence has linked obesity with progression of kidney disease as assessed by deteriorating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or microalbuminuria. Microalbuminuria has been identified as an early marker of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and as a predictor of progression to end-stage kidney disease. Moreover, CKD manifesting with microalbuminuria is an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and hypertension.

There is a graded association between the severity of obesity and the magnitude of microalbuminuria. Surgical weight loss can normalize glomerular hyperfiltration and the albumin excretion rate in severely obese patients, and dietary weight loss trials show benefits on albuminuria, proteinuria, and the decline in the estimated GFR (eGFR) in patients with pre-existing CKD. A review and meta-analysis of 13 studies, including 2 randomized trials, reported that nonsurgical weight loss interventions reduce proteinuria and blood pressure and seem to prevent further decline in renal function. However, most of the studies were relatively small and duration of follow-up short (typically not exceeding 12 months). Different dietary strategies to promote weight loss have not directly been compared in a randomized, long-term study. This is especially pertinent to low-carbohydrate high-protein diets that are debated for potentially adversely affecting kidney function, especially among patients with diabetes. A recent study among obese individuals showed that a low-carbohydrate high-protein weight loss diet was not associated with harmful effects on GFR and albuminuria compared with a low-fat diet.

We therefore investigated the long-term effect of low-fat, Mediterranean, and low-carbohydrate dietary intervention strategies on renal function among overweight or obese people with or without type 2 diabetes and pre-existing mild to moderate renal dysfunction in the Dietary Intervention Randomized Controlled Trial (DIRECT).

Recommendations 4.2–4.5 — hypertension management in diabetes: Therapeutic lifestyle interventions in persons with hypertension are recommended to include consultation with a registered dietitian, an overall healthy diet (such as the Mediterranean diet), weight management, reduced sodium intake (such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH] diet), daily physical activity and regular exercise, and as-needed consultation with a psychologist or certified diabetes care and education specialist (CDCES) to support long-term behavior change (Grade A; BEL 1). If BP goals cannot be met with only therapeutic lifestyle interventions, pharmacotherapy should be started to help persons with diabetes meet their BP goals (Grade A; BEL 1). Select antihypertensive agents based on their ability to reduce BP to goal and prevent or slow the progression of micro- and macrovascular disease, and use either an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) for BP control and to delay the progression of DKD or CKD in DM (Grade A; BEL 1). Intensify pharmacotherapy as needed to achieve BP goals; combinations may include an ACE inhibitor or an ARB plus diuretics, calcium channel antagonists, combined alpha-beta blockers, or newer-generation beta blockers, and consider a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist for resistant hypertension (Grade A; BEL 1).

### The effects of dietary patterns on urinary albumin excretion: results of the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) trial [^114Kcxrh]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Dietary studies designed to decrease the urinary albumin excretion rate (AER) typically reduce protein by increasing lower protein plant foods and decreasing higher protein animal products.

Study Design

We evaluated AER while increasing protein intake in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Trial (randomized, parallel group, 8 week controlled feeding).

Setting & Participants

378 individuals without diabetes with prehypertension or stage I hypertension.

Intervention

The DASH diet, 18% energy from protein, emphasizes, among other features, low-fat dairy products; and the fruit/vegetable (FV) and control diets, each with 15% energy from protein.

Outcome

AER.

Measurements

We measured AER by using immunoassay and covariates at baseline and after 8 weeks.

Results

Baseline AER had a geometric mean value of 4.0 ± 0.2 (SE) mg/24 h. In 285 participants with baseline AER less than 7 mg/24 h, AER was unchanged by diet treatment (geometric mean, 2.5 ± 0.2 mg/24 h in the control diet, 3.0 ± 0.2 mg/24 h in the FV diet, and 2.8 ± 0.2 mg/24 h in the DASH diet). Conversely, in 93 participants with baseline AER of 7 mg/24 h or greater, end-of-feeding AER was lower in the FV diet (6.6 ± 1.0 mg/24 h) than in the control (11.4 ± 1.8 mg/24 h; P = 0.01) or DASH diets (11.7 ± 1.6 mg/24 h; P = 0.005). The DASH and control diets were not different (P = 0.9).

Limitations

Long-term AER change not studied.

Conclusions

The decrease in AER after 8 weeks occurred in only those with high-normal baseline AER in the FV diet, in a pattern distinct from the blood pressure decrease. The DASH diet did not increase AER despite a 3% increase in energy from protein.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113Cc5i5]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) nutrition interventions — protein and sodium guidance: For people with stages 3–5 non–dialysis-dependent CKD, dietary protein intake should be ~0.8 g/kg body weight per day (the recommended daily allowance). Higher levels of dietary protein intake (> 20% of daily calories from protein or > 1.3 g/kg/day) have been associated with increased albuminuria, more rapid kidney function loss, and CVD mortality and therefore should be avoided. Reducing dietary protein below 0.8 g/kg/day is not recommended because it does not alter blood pressure levels, cardiovascular risk measures, or the course of GFR decline. Some organizations recommend a lower protein intake (0.6–0.8 g/kg/day), but for CKD in diabetes, the expert grade is "opinion" only. Restriction of dietary sodium (to < 2,300 mg/day) may be useful to manage blood pressure and reduce cardiovascular risk. For individuals on dialysis, higher levels of dietary protein intake should be considered since protein-energy wasting is a major problem; sodium and potassium recommendations should be individualized based on comorbid conditions, medication use, blood pressure, and laboratory data.

### Short-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of a very low-calorie-ketogenic diet interventional weight loss program versus hypocaloric diet in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113vuFZV]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our data show that VLCK diet (a low-calorie-ketogenic diet, < 50 g of carbohydrate daily) as part of a interventional weight loss program including lifestyle and behavioral modification support over a 4-month period is a safe, well tolerated, and accepted medical nutritional therapy option for subjects with T2DM. Furthermore, VLCK diet intervention in subjects with T2DM is associated with significantly larger weight loss along with amelioration of glycemic control as compared with a standard care nutritional intervention based on the ADA guidelines. The short-term efficacy of an intense caloric restriction as that reported herein for weight loss in T2DM and before bariatric surgery is well established. Our study adds to the field on the potential validity of increasing the protein content and decreasing the carbohydrate content in a VLCK diet as a safe and effective approach to medical nutritional therapy in T2DM.

The optimal mix of macronutrients of medical nutritional therapy for people with T2DM remains unsolved. However, although consensus is lacking, diets high in protein are commonly seen as less appropriate for subjects with T2DM specially if micro- or macro-albuminuria are present because of the concept that reducing protein intake appears to slightly slow progression to renal failure. Our data show that a 30–53% daily caloric content as protein does not result in increased appearance or worsening of albuminuria, nor deterioration of plasma creatinine over the course of a 4-month intervention, neither changes in eGFR in T2DM subjects with or without albuminuria but without chronic kidney disease at baseline. These findings are similar to previous report that evidenced that a low-carbohydrate diet is as safe as Mediterranean or low-fat diets in preserving renal function among moderately obese participants with or without T2DM.

### Association of dietary protein intake and microalbuminuria in healthy adults: third national health and nutrition examination survey [^114mion4]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The relationship between dietary protein intake (DPI) and microalbuminuria (MA) is unclear. We investigated whether DPI was associated with urinary albumin level in a population sample of persons with normal kidney function.

Methods

We addressed this question in adults aged 20 to 80 years from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n = 12,422). DPI was assessed from a 24-hour dietary recall and quantified as percentage of total energy intake. MA is defined as urinary albumin-creatinine ratio 30 mg/g (3 mg/mmol) or greater.

Results

In multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and coronary heart disease risk factors, DPI was not associated with MA in normotensive or nondiabetic persons. In crude models, odds ratios (ORs) for MA were 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 3.0) in persons with hypertension (n = 3,433) and 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 5.2) in those with diabetes (n = 1,165) in the highest (> 19%) versus lowest (< 11.7%) quintile of DPI. However, in models adjusted for the concurrent prevalence of diabetes or hypertension, this association attenuated to nonsignificance. Persons in the highest quintile of DPI who had both hypertension and diabetes (n = 634) had a significantly elevated OR for MA (3.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 7.8) compared with those in the lowest quintile.

Conclusion

DPI is not associated with MA in healthy persons or those with isolated hypertension or diabetes. However, in persons with both conditions, high DPI is associated with increased prevalence of MA. These findings suggest the need for further research on weight-loss strategies for high-risk persons.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^115W3ZB8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI — avoidance of high-protein diets in diabetes and CKD: High-protein diets are a special concern in patients with diabetes because they may increase albuminuria and accelerate loss of kidney function, and higher protein intake appears to produce more profound glomerular hyperfiltration and kidney damage in diabetes. Emerging epidemiological evidence indicates that higher protein intake (≥ 20% versus 10% of total daily calories) is associated with loss of kidney function in women with mildly decreased GFR (CKD stages 1 to 2 inferred) and the development of microalbuminuria. The Work Group suggests that people with diabetes and CKD should avoid high-protein diets (≥ 20% of total daily calories), with examples including Atkins®, Protein Power®, the Zone®, South Beach®, and Sugar Busters®.

### Meta-analysis of the effect of dietary sodium restriction with or without concomitant renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system-inhibiting treatment on albuminuria [^114w1PhW]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Urinary albumin excretion and/or albumin to creatinine ratio are associated with CKD and higher risk of cardiovascular events. Several studies investigated the effect of reduced dietary sodium intake on urinary albumin excretion and/or albumin to creatinine ratio in adult patient populations, but the majority was inconclusive because of insufficient statistical power. A meta-analysis of the randomized, controlled trials available could overcome this problem and lead to more definitive conclusions.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

A systematic search of the online databases available (from 1996 to October of 2014) was conducted of randomized, controlled trials that expressed urinary albumin excretion or albumin to creatinine ratio as the difference between the effects of two different sodium intake regimens. For each study, the mean difference and 95% confidence intervals were pooled using a random effect model. Heterogeneity, publication bias, subgroup, and meta-regression analyses were performed.

Results

Eleven studies met the predefined inclusion criteria and provided 23 cohorts with 516 participants and 1–6 weeks of follow-up time. In the pooled analysis, an average reduction in sodium intake of 92 mmol/d was associated with a 32.1% (95% confidence interval, -44.3 to -18.8) reduction in urinary albumin excretion. The effect of sodium restriction was higher in the cohorts including patients on concomitant renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system-blocking therapy, in the studies with intervention lasting at least 2 weeks, and among participants with evidence of kidney damage. A greater reduction of urinary albumin excretion was associated with a higher decrease in BP during the intervention. The analysis of changes in albumin to creatinine ratio provided similar results.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis indicates that sodium intake reduction markedly reduces albumin excretion, more so during concomitant renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system-blocking therapy and among patients with kidney damage.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112AwXHV]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Guideline 5 — nutritional management in diabetes and chronic kidney disease — notes evidence supporting protein restriction and cautioning against high-protein diets. Based on 2 meta-analyses, low-protein diets reduced risks of loss of kidney function and/or increased albuminuria, and even a modest limitation of dietary protein (0.89 versus 1.02 g/kg body weight per day) substantially reduced the risk of CKD stage 5 or death (RR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.72; P = 0.04) in people with type 1 diabetes and CKD stage 2. High-protein diets are a particular concern because they increase albuminuria and may accelerate loss of kidney function; higher protein intake (≥ 20% versus 10% of total daily calories) is associated with loss of kidney function in women with mild kidney insufficiency (estimated GFR < 80 and > 55 mL/min/1.73 m²) and development of microalbuminuria in people with diabetes and hypertension; therefore, people with diabetes and CKD should avoid high-protein diets.

### Effects of dietary interventions on incidence and progression of CKD [^116dDxXf]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2014). Medium credibility.

Traditional strategies for management of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have not resulted in any change in the growing prevalence of CKD worldwide. A historic belief that eating healthily might ameliorate kidney disease still holds credibility in the 21(st) century. Dietary sodium restriction to < 2.3 g daily, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables and increased water consumption corresponding to a urine output of 3–4 l daily might slow the progression of early CKD, polycystic kidney disease or recurrent kidney stones. Current evidence suggests that a reduction in dietary net acid load could be beneficial in patients with CKD, but the supremacy of any particular diet has yet to be established. More trials of dietary interventions are needed, especially in diabetic nephropathy, before evidence-based recommendations can be made. In the meantime, nephrologists should discuss healthy dietary habits with their patients and provide individualized care aimed at maximizing the potential benefits of dietary intervention, reducing the incidence of CKD and delaying its progression to end-stage renal disease. Keeping in mind the lack of data on hard outcomes, dietary recommendations should take into account barriers to adherence and be tailored to different cultures, ethnicities and geographical locations.

AACE 2023 type 2 diabetes hypertension targets and treatment recommend that AACE has set a specific BP goal for the majority of adults with T2D as < 130 mm Hg with a diastolic BP goal of < 80 mm Hg, with a lower target considered for persons with micro- or macroalbuminuria, moderate/high risk for or with established ASCVD, peripheral vascular disease, or retinopathy, and recognition that some persons with T2D may not tolerate a goal of < 130/80 mm Hg. Lifestyle therapy is part of initial management, as exercise several times per week is important because there are reductions in both systolic and diastolic BP with endurance and dynamic resistance training, and Mediterranean diets have been demonstrated to lower BP. Pharmacologic therapy specifies that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are considered first-line therapies for HTN in persons with T2D, particularly in those with DKD; there is no additional benefit for coadministration of an ACEI and an ARB together, and combination may cause harm, an ARB can substitute for ACEI intolerance, and if the initial BP is > 150/100 mm Hg, dual therapy may need to be used at the outset.

### Dietary sodium restriction: a neglected therapeutic opportunity in chronic kidney disease [^115PYGuz]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Restriction of dietary sodium is recommended at a population level as well as for groups at high cardiovascular risk, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). This review addresses recent evidence for the protective effect of dietary sodium restriction in CKD patients specifically.

Recent Findings

Sodium intake in CKD populations is generally high, and often above population average. Recent data demonstrated that moderately lower sodium intake in CKD patients is associated with substantially better long-term outcome of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)-blockade, in diabetic and nondiabetic CKD, related to better effects of RAAS-blockade on proteinuria, independent of blood pressure. This is in line with better short-term efficacy of RAAS-blockade during moderate sodium restriction in diabetic and nondiabetic CKD. This effect of sodium restriction is likely mediated by its effects on volume status. Sustainable sodium restriction can be achieved by approaches on the basis of behavioral sciences.

Summary

Moderate restriction of dietary sodium can substantially improve the protective effects of RAAS-blockade in CKD, by specific renal effects apparent from proteinuria reduction. The latter precludes straightforward extrapolation of data from nonrenal populations to CKD. Concerns regarding the adverse effects of a very low sodium intake should not distract from the protective effects of moderate sodium restriction. Prospective studies should assess the efficacy and sustainability of different strategies to target high sodium intake in CKD, along with measures at population level.

### Animal versus plant protein meals in individuals with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria: effects on renal, glycemic, and lipid parameters [^113YTPTP]. Diabetes Care (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine, for individuals with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, the effects of 6 weeks of meals containing plant-based protein (PP) versus meals with predominantly animal-based protein (AP) on renal function and secondarily on glycemia, lipid levels, and blood pressure.

Research Design and Methods

In a randomized crossover trial, we compared 6 weeks of meals containing only PP with meals containing primarily AP (60% animal, 40% plant) in 17 subjects with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria treated with diet and/or oral antidiabetic agents. Protein content was equivalent to the average American diet, and calories provided weight maintenance. Nutrients were equivalent between the two diets. Meals were prepared and packaged by a metabolic kitchen staff and were sent home weekly. At the beginning and end of each 6-week period, subjects were studied for 36 h on a metabolic unit.

Results

There were no significant differences between diets for glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, albumin excretion rate, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglyceride area under the curve (AUC), glucose and insulin AUC, HbA(1c,) blood pressure, or serum amino acids. For both diets, at the end of the treatment periods as compared with baseline, total cholesterol was significantly lower (PP and AP: from 4.75 to 4.34 mmol/l, P < 0.01), HbA(1c) had significantly improved (PP: from 8.1 to 7.5%, P < 0.01; AP: from 7.9 to 7.4%, P < 0.01), and diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower (PP: from 83 to 80 mmHg, P < 0.02; AP: from 82 to 78, P < 0.02).

Conclusions

There is no clear advantage for the recommendation of diets containing only PP rather than diets containing protein that is primarily animal-based for individuals with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria. There are, however, potential lipid, glycemic, and blood pressure benefits for following a carefully constructed, weight-maintaining, healthy diet, regardless of protein source.

### The case for a ketogenic diet in the management of kidney disease [^116vPX1E]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

Perspectives and future direction

There is a considerable body of research suggesting that a very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet is safe in individuals with moderately diminished kidney function, even in studies that had higher protein intake than what is recommended for kidney disease and diets that are not plant-based. The diet can be safely prescribed in patients with T2D for treating and remitting diabetes even if they have underlying stage 2 or 3 CKD or reduced kidney function. Beyond safety, mechanistic plausibility, preclinical data, and even some RCT studies suggest that carbohydrate-restricted diets may be beneficial in improving moderate kidney dysfunction and in reducing progression of CKD. The preliminary proof of concept from small and short duration studies in humans and animals suggests a very low carbohydrate diet could be an effective dietary intervention for patients with CKD. Furthermore, there are predeveloped ketogenic nutritional options to consider when we plan a future trial to assess the impact of ketogenic diet on patients with CKD, such as the recently developed program for treating ADPKD known as Ren. Nu. This program is a plant-focused ketogenic medical nutrition therapy, designed to avoid renal stressors like oxalate, inorganic phosphate, and purines/uric acid. It includes a medical food formulation, KetoCitra, containing BHB with alkaline citrate which helps antagonize kidney stone formation. Based on the findings from these different studies and currently available ketogenic medical therapy specific for kidney disease, there is a need for future larger and longer follow-up randomized controlled clinical trials on very low carbohydrate diet, including nutritional ketosis in patients with CKD with or without T2D on kidney hard endpoints including major adverse kidney events (a composite event of death, persistent renal decline > 25% decline in eGFR, and a new initiation of dialysis) and other kidney-related outcomes to firmly establish the long-term effectiveness. For example, a head-to-head comparison of the safety and efficacy of ketogenic nutritional therapy versus SGLT2i pharmacologic intervention (that involves the same mechanism of raising ketone levels) could be of high interest. Weight loss from the diet can improve filtration and albuminuria. Thus, including other surrogate endpoints like eGFR slope and microalbuminuria in these studies have the potential to elucidate the degree to which weight loss and blood pressure improvement from the diet affects kidney function markers and also to explore if ketone levels independently have an impact on these markers and endpoints. Furthermore, these studies should also assess the diet's overall safety in patients with T2D and CKD, specifically exploring its effect on net acid excretion, kidney stone formation, and maybe its beneficial effect on sodium retention hypertension. Finally, another important consideration in the clinical trial design for evaluating the efficacy of a very low carbohydrate diet in patients with CKD is understanding the diet's additive role, especially how the diet interacts with currently available treatment drugs for patients with CKD including renin–angiotensin system blockade (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ACEi and angiotensin receptor blockers, ARBs), SGLT2i, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA), and the non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (finerenone).

### Association of unhealthy dietary behaviors with renal function decline in patients with diabetes [^117EQP7n]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Currently, some evidence has demonstrated the benefits of reduced dietary salt for renal protection. Though still controversial, dietary salt restriction for diabetic nephropathyremains a common professional recommendation. Restricted salt intake has been shown to benefit blood pressure because of decreased volume retention and a potential escape from RAAS cycle-related adverse effects. Good hypertension control also has strong evidence for preventing diabetic nephropathic deterioration. In experimental studies, a low-sodium diet reduced proteinuria and the development of glomerulosclerosis. Additionally, renoprotective and cardioprotective effects due to medications of RAAS blockade were more predominant in patients with diabetes who received low-sodium diet (RENAAL (reduction of endpoints in NIDDM with the angiotensin II antagonist losartan) and IDNT (irbesartan diabetic nephropathy trial)). Nevertheless, the RAAS blockade confounding is minimal in this study, because we analyzed the impact of dietary behaviors by matching medications including RAAS blockade.

Unlike the consensus of sodium intake, the appropriate amount of dietary protein remains inconsistent for patients with diabetic nephropathy. Two meta-analyses revealed that dietary protein restrictions prevented renal function decline. By contrast, a third meta-analysis and a Cochrane systemic review both concluded that a low-protein diet demonstrated no significant improvement in renal function. Though the benefits of protein restriction are still debatable, dietary protein intake should be maintained at 0.8 g/kg/day according to the American Diabetes Association. High dietary protein intake is thought to increase the nitrogen load, glomerular filtration rate, and renal hypertrophy. Malhotra et al also proved that increased dietary protein was associated with the incidence of end-stage kidney disease in patients with diabetes. This study also demonstrated that patients with diabetes with excessive dietary protein may increase the 8.9% incidence of eGFR decline, ≥ 40%, but this finding was not statistically significant (OR 1.089, 95% CI 0.716 to 1.656, p = 0.690).

Diabetes and chronic kidney disease — thiazolidinediones and albuminuria: Thiazolidinediones may have unique properties that reduce albuminuria (Weak). Small randomized studies indicate that thiazolidinediones reduce albuminuria more than insulin, other oral agents (metformin or sulfonylureas), or dietary treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, and albuminuria was decreased or trended downward in all such studies. The mechanism is uncertain because thiazolidinedione therapy was associated with larger decreases in glycemia or correlated with decreases in blood pressure.

### Diabetic nephropathy: preventing progression [^114CagAY]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Up to one third of people with type 1 or 2 diabetes will develop microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria after 20 years.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments in people with type 1 diabetes and early nephropathy? What are the effects of treatments in people with type 1 diabetes and late nephropathy? What are the effects of treatments in people with type 2 diabetes and early nephropathy? What are the effects of treatments in people with type 2 diabetes and late nephropathy? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to November 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 19 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, glycaemic control, protein restriction, and tight control of blood pressure.

### Summary of KDIGO guideline. what do we really know about management of blood pressure in patients with chronic kidney disease? [^1139xS8B]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline for management of blood pressure (BP) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) supersedes the 2004 Kidney Disease Quality Outcomes Initiative document on this topic. The new guideline has been designed to assist clinical decision making in patients with CKD who are not receiving dialysis. The recommendations in the guideline acknowledge that no single BP target is optimal for all CKD patients and encourage individualization of treatment depending on age, the severity of albuminuria, and comorbidities. In general, the available evidence indicates that in CKD patients without albuminuria the target BP should be ≤ 140mmHg systolic and ≤ 90mmHg diastolic. However, in most patients with an albumin excretion rate of ≥ 30mg/24h (i.e., those with both micro- and macroalbuminuria), a lower target of ≤ 130mmHg systolic and ≤ 80mmHg diastolic is suggested. In achieving BP control, the value of lifestyle changes and the need for multiple pharmacological agents is acknowledged. Use of agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is recommended or suggested in all patients with an albumin excretion rate of ≥ 30mg/24h. Recommendations are almost identical in CKD patients with and without diabetes. Special considerations relevant to children and those of older age and those who have received a kidney transplant are included. Ongoing controversies in BP management in the context of CKD are highlighted along with key areas for future research.

### Renal function following three distinct weight loss dietary strategies during 2 years of a randomized controlled trial [^1117xtoZ]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

This study addressed the long-term effect of various diets, particularly low-carbohydrate high-protein, on renal function on participants with or without type 2 diabetes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

In the 2-year Dietary Intervention Randomized Controlled Trial (DIRECT), 318 participants (age, 51 years; 86% men; BMI, 31 kg/m²; mean estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], 70.5 mL/min/1.73 m²; mean urine microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio, 12:12) with serum creatinine < 176 μmol/L (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) were randomized to low-fat, Mediterranean, or low-carbohydrate diets. The 2-year compliance was 85%, and the proportion of protein intake significantly increased to 22% of energy only in the low-carbohydrate diet (P < 0.05 vs. low-fat and Mediterranean). We examined changes in urinary microalbumin and eGFR, estimated by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formulas.

RESULTS

Significant (P < 0.05 within groups) improvements in eGFR were achieved in low-carbohydrate (+5.3% [95% CI 2.1–8.5]), Mediterranean (+5.2% [3.0–7.4]), and low-fat diets (+4.0% [0.9–7.1]) with similar magnitude (P > 0.05) across diet groups. The increased eGFR was at least as prominent in participants with (+6.7%) or without (+4.5%) type 2 diabetes or those with lower baseline renal function of eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² (+7.1%) versus eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m² (+3.7%). In a multivariable model adjusted for age, sex, diet group, type 2 diabetes, use of ACE inhibitors, 2-year weight loss, and change in protein intake (confounders and univariate predictors), only a decrease in fasting insulin (β = −0.211; P = 0.004) and systolic blood pressure (β = −0.25; P < 0.001) were independently associated with increased eGFR. The urine microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio improved similarly across the diets, particularly among participants with baseline sex-adjusted microalbuminuria, with a mean change of −24.8 (P < 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS

A low-carbohydrate diet is as safe as Mediterranean or low-fat diets in preserving/improving renal function among moderately obese participants with or without type 2 diabetes, with baseline serum creatinine < 176 μmol/L. Potential improvement is likely to be mediated by weight loss–induced improvements in insulin sensitivity and blood pressure.

### Altered dietary salt intake for people with chronic kidney disease [^115A9CQA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence indicates that reducing dietary salt may reduce the incidence of heart disease and delay decline in kidney function in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This is an update of a review first published in 2015.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of altering dietary salt for adults with CKD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 6 October 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing two or more levels of salt intake in adults with any stage of CKD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, conducted risk of bias evaluation and evaluated confidence in the evidence using GRADE. Results were summarised using random effects models as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included 21 studies (1197 randomised participants), 12 in the earlier stages of CKD (779 randomised participants), seven in dialysis (363 randomised participants) and two in post-transplant (55 randomised participants). Selection bias was low in seven studies, high in one and unclear in 13. Performance and detection biases were low in four studies, high in two, and unclear in 15. Attrition and reporting biases were low in 10 studies, high in three and unclear in eight. Because duration of the included studies was too short (1 to 36 weeks) to test the effect of salt restriction on endpoints such as death, cardiovascular events or CKD progression, changes in salt intake on blood pressure and other secondary risk factors were examined. Reducing salt by mean -73.51 mmol/day (95% CI -92.76 to -54.27), equivalent to 4.2 g or 1690 mg sodium/day, reduced systolic/diastolic blood pressure by -6.91/-3.91 mm Hg (95% CI -8.82 to -4.99/-4.80 to -3.02; 19 studies, 1405 participants; high certainty evidence). Albuminuria was reduced by 36% (95% CI 26 to 44) in six studies, five of which were carried out in people in the earlier stages of CKD (MD -0.44, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.30; 501 participants; high certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of lower salt intake on weight, as the weight change observed (-1.32 kg, 95% CI -1.94 to -0.70; 12 studies, 759 participants) may have been due to fluid volume, lean tissue, or body fat. Lower salt intake may reduce extracellular fluid volume in the earlier stages of CKD (-0.87 L, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.58; 3 studies; 187 participants; low certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of lower salt intake on reduction in antihypertensive dose (RR 2.45, 95% CI 0.98 to 6.08; 8 studies; 754 participants). Lower salt intake may lead to symptomatic hypotension (RR 6.70, 95% CI 2.40 to 18.69; 6 studies; 678 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Data were sparse for other types of adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

We found high certainty evidence that salt reduction reduced blood pressure in people with CKD, and albuminuria in people with earlier stage CKD in the short-term. If such reductions could be maintained long-term, this effect may translate to clinically significant reductions in CKD progression and cardiovascular events. Research into the long-term effects of sodium-restricted diet for people with CKD is warranted.

(Weak) Few studies have evaluated ACE inhibitors or ARBs for the treatment or prevention of microalbuminuria in normotensive people with type 1 diabetes, and a meta-analysis found ACE inhibitors reduced both albuminuria level and progression to macroalbuminuria in normotensive subjects.

Limited evidence from three studies showed improved lipid panel by decreasing total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) levels compared to controls, including one RCT reporting a 35% reduction in TC (p < 0.05) with reductions in LDL-C and TG versus standard care. In post-transplant patients, one RCT reported significant reductions in TC, TG and LDL-C compared with a low fat diet. Other outcomes included no clear effect on blood pressure (BP) in transplant recipients and no clear effect on CRP in stage 2 patients, while one NRCT reported significant reductions in albuminuria values compared to a low protein group.

The rationale further specifies that normotensive people with diabetes and macroalbuminuria should receive an ACE inhibitor or an ARB (Moderate/Weak), and that treatments lowering urinary albumin excretion may slow progression of DKD and improve clinical outcomes, even without hypertension.

R22

In patients on hemodialysis and LDL-c above 145 mg/dL and/or with established coronary artery disease, statin initiation MAY BE CONSIDERED.

Summary of evidence

In a posthoc analysis of 731 patients with T2DM, a reduction in the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiac events was observed with the use of rosuvastatin ref. Based on a subgroup analysis of the 4D study, in which patients with LDL above 145 mg/dL benefited from reduced cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal AMI, death from any cause, and sudden death.

Nutrition therapy

R23

For individuals with non-dialysis-dependent advanced CKD, it is RECOMMENDED a dietary protein intake of around 0.8 g/kg ideal body weight per day.

Summary of evidence

Dietary protein restriction has been suggested to patients with CKD from many etiologies. However, low adherence to this dietary intervention is observed, especially because it implies a change in lifestyle habits. Due to the lack of consensus in the literature about the benefit of dietary protein restriction in patients with DM and increased UAE, but preserved eGFR, there is no specific recommendation for these patients.

In patients with increased UAE and decreased eGFR, moderate dietary protein restriction (0.8 g/kg ideal weight/day) is recommended.

Protein intake above 20% of daily calories or above 1.3 g/kg ideal weight/day is associated with increased albuminuria, more rapid loss of renal function, and CV mortality; therefore, it should be avoided. A meta-analysis with 779 patients from 13 RCTs demonstrated a benefit from a low-protein diet with improved eGFR and reduced proteinuria.

The effect of dietary protein restriction becomes more evident the greater the adherence to dietary modification and, when RAAS inhibitors are used, it is less frequent and the BP control less strict.

A high protein intake is associated with an increase in glomerular filtration rate, serum urea, acid uric acid, and urinary calcium excretion when compared to a normal/low protein intake in normal subjects, as reported in a meta-analysis including 30 randomized controlled trials.

Therefore, the rationale for protein restriction in the CKD setting is based on the decrease in kidney overload, which leads to an improvement in renal hemodynamics by decreasing the intraglomerular pressure and glomerular hyperfiltration. It is also a key strategy to control uremia and uremic toxins, as well as oxidative stress, metabolic acidosis, phosphorous, hyperparathyroidism, insulin resistance, and blood pressure.

### DASH (dietary approaches to stop hypertension) diet and risk of subsequent kidney disease [^115xXh9R]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There are established guidelines for recommended dietary intake for hypertension treatment and cardiovascular disease prevention. Evidence is lacking for effective dietary patterns for kidney disease prevention.

Study Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting & Participants

Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study participants with baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60mL/min/1.73m 2 (N = 14,882).

Predictor

The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet score was calculated based on self-reported dietary intake of red and processed meat, sweetened beverages, sodium, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes, and low-fat dairy products, averaged over 2 visits.

Outcomes

Cases were ascertained based on the development of eGFRs < 60mL/min/1.73m 2 accompanied by ≥ 25% eGFR decline from baseline, an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth/Tenth Revision code for a kidney disease-related hospitalization or death, or end-stage renal disease from baseline through 2012.

Results

3,720 participants developed kidney disease during a median follow-up of 23 years. Participants with a DASH diet score in the lowest tertile were 16% more likely to develop kidney disease than those with the highest score tertile (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.07–1.26; P for trend < 0.001), after adjusting for sociodemographics, smoking status, physical activity, total caloric intake, baseline eGFR, overweight/obese status, diabetes status, hypertension status, systolic blood pressure, and antihypertensive medication use. Of the individual components of the DASH diet score, high red and processed meat intake was adversely associated with kidney disease and high nuts, legumes, and low-fat dairy products intake was associated with reduced risk for kidney disease.

Limitations

Potential measurement error due to self-reported dietary intake and lack of data for albuminuria.

Conclusions

Consuming a DASH-style diet was associated with lower risk for kidney disease independent of demographic characteristics, established kidney risk factors, and baseline kidney function. Healthful dietary patterns such as the DASH diet may be beneficial for kidney disease prevention.

Importantly, the impact of a very low-protein diet on kidney disease progression is a subject of debate in the literature. The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study evaluated the effect of two schedules of protein restriction in patients with nondiabetic CKD 4. When the intervention of a low-protein diet (0.58 g/kg/d) was compared to a very low-protein diet (0.28 g/kg/d) supplemented with a mixture of essential keto acids and amino acids (0.28 g/kg/d), the latter group presented higher rates of mortality and no beneficial effect on CKD progression was observed.

Important note 13: Meat consumption and Diabetic Kidney Disease.

An alternative is to replace red meat with other protein sources. A diet where red meat was replaced by chicken, rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, was able to decrease the UAE in T2DM patients with micro and macroalbuminuria.

The limit for a sodium intake of up to 1.5 g/day, or of salt, up to 3.75 g/day, SHOULD BE CONSIDERED when there is arterial hypertension.

Summary of evidence

When making dietary recommendations for patients with DKD, it should be considered that, in most cases, there is associated hypertension. Thus, limiting dietary salt intake should be a goal to be achieved.

Decreasing dietary salt enhances the antihypertensive effect of drugs. Furthermore, the renal and cardiovascular effects of ARBs are enhanced when associated with the restriction of salt intake.

Salt restriction should be included in a DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet pattern, that is, high consumption of fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products. In T2DM patients, this dietary pattern is associated with lower blood pressure values. This diet, however, is not recommended for dialysis patients.

### Microalbuminuria constitutes a clinical action item for clinicians in 2021 [^111b3w4D]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects approximately 10% of the population or 800 million people globally, with diabetes being the leading cause. The presence of chronic kidney disease with impaired kidney function or with albuminuria is associated with an increased risk of a progressive loss of renal function and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and excess mortality. Screening for chronic kidney disease is critically important because during the initial stages patients often have no symptoms and because we now have available recently approved multiple interventions that can reduce the high risks dramatically. Screening should be performed with regular measurement of albumin in the urine and creatinine or cystatin C in blood for estimation of kidney function. Regretfully recent data indicates that screening for albuminuria is conducted in only 20%-50% of people at risk depending on the setting. Clinicians need to perform regular screening and concomitant management of risk factors. Recent therapeutic options must be implemented to improve outcomes. Finally, a reduction in albuminuria after initiation of intervention constitutes a treatment target because it indicates improved prognosis.

Treatment

In the treatment of the nonpregnant patient with micro- or macroalbuminuria, either ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be used. (A)
While there are no adequate head-to-head comparisons of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, there is clinical trial support for each of the following statements: In patients with type 1 diabetes, hypertension, and any degree of albuminuria, ACE inhibitors have been shown to delay the progression of nephropathy. (A) In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and microalbuminuria, both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to delay the progression to macroalbuminuria. (A) In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, macroalbuminuria, and renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl), ARBs have been shown to delay the progression of nephropathy. (A) If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. (E)
Reduction of protein intake to 0.8–1.0 g·kg body wt⁻¹·day⁻¹ in individuals with diabetes and the earlier stages of CKD and to 0.8 g·kg body wt⁻¹·day⁻¹ in the later stages of CKD may improve measures of renal function (urine albumin excretion rate and GFR) and is recommended. (B)
When ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics are used, monitor serum creatinine and potassium levels for the development of acute kidney disease and hyperkalemia. (E)
Continued monitoring of urine albumin excretion to assess both response to therapy and progression of disease is recommended. (E)
Consider referral to a physician experienced in the care of kidney disease when there is uncertainty about the etiology of kidney disease (active urine sediment, absence of retinopathy, or rapid decline in GFR), difficult management issues, or advanced kidney disease. (B)

Limitations of early detection of microalbuminuria are highlighted: no data are available to confirm that detection of microalbuminuria and initiation of treatment at this early stage of DKD leads to a decrease in hard end points (GFR decrease, CKD stage 5, and mortality), and the predictive value of microalbuminuria for DKD is not as high as originally considered.

### Renal function following three distinct weight loss dietary strategies during 2 years of a randomized controlled trial [^115RLPVw]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Furthermore, another consideration is that all estimating equations for GFR, including the MDRD Study equation, were suggested to be less accurate in patients with obesity. In fact, it has been argued that GFR estimates in obese people should be indexed to body surface area. Moreover, MDRD may be less accurate than CKD-EPI in the normal and slightly increased range of serum creatinine concentrations (< 133 mol/L [1.5 mg/dL]), which is the relevant range for detecting CKD (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m²). Therefore, we analyzed and presented the data also with the CKD-EPI equation, which resulted in similarly significant findings.

Use of the calculated eGFR and spot urine microalbuminuria (rather than a 24-h urine collection) is a limitation. Furthermore, we used single spot urine at each time point, although the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) recommends confirmation of albuminuria in two of three spot urine collections because of intraindividual day-to-day variation.

Changes in muscle mass can affect creatinine levels, thus affecting eGFR and/or the albumin-to-creatinine urine ratio, so changes in fat-free mass may potentially confound results that suggest improved renal function, though probably in opposite directions. After 2 years, however, nearly all participants had stabilized weight or tended to exhibit slight weight regain, which is not consistent with muscle breakdown.

The strengths of the study include the one-phase design, in which all participants started simultaneously, the relatively long duration of the study, the large size, the equal intensity of the intervention while achieving three significantly distinct diet patterns, the high adherence rate, and the repeated comprehensive measurements of creatinine, eGFR, and microalbumin and creatinine throughout the follow-up period. The latter allows us to determine that patients with type 2 diabetes exhibit a continuous improvement in eGFR (from baseline to 6 months and from 6 to 24 months) despite a significant degree of weight regain in the latter phase of the study, which may represent effects of the dietary intervention on kidney function independent of body weight.

### Renal function following three distinct weight loss dietary strategies during 2 years of a randomized controlled trial [^116ENqeg]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

This study addressed the long-term effect of various diets, particularly low-carbohydrate high-protein, on renal function on participants with or without type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

In the 2-year Dietary Intervention Randomized Controlled Trial (DIRECT), 318 participants (age, 51 years; 86% men; BMI, 31 kg/m²; mean estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], 70.5 mL/min/1.73 m²; mean urine microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio, 12:12) with serum creatinine < 176 μmol/L (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) were randomized to low-fat, Mediterranean, or low-carbohydrate diets. The 2-year compliance was 85%, and the proportion of protein intake significantly increased to 22% of energy only in the low-carbohydrate diet (P < 0.05 vs. low-fat and Mediterranean). We examined changes in urinary microalbumin and eGFR, estimated by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formulas.

Results

Significant (P < 0.05 within groups) improvements in eGFR were achieved in low-carbohydrate (+5.3% [95% CI 2.1–8.5]), Mediterranean (+5.2% [3.0–7.4]), and low-fat diets (+4.0% [0.9–7.1]) with similar magnitude (P > 0.05) across diet groups. The increased eGFR was at least as prominent in participants with (+6.7%) or without (+4.5%) type 2 diabetes or those with lower baseline renal function of eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² (+7.1%) versus eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m² (+3.7%). In a multivariable model adjusted for age, sex, diet group, type 2 diabetes, use of ACE inhibitors, 2-year weight loss, and change in protein intake (confounders and univariate predictors), only a decrease in fasting insulin (β = -0.211; P = 0.004) and systolic blood pressure (β = -0.25; P < 0.001) were independently associated with increased eGFR. The urine microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio improved similarly across the diets, particularly among participants with baseline sex-adjusted microalbuminuria, with a mean change of -24.8 (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

A low-carbohydrate diet is as safe as Mediterranean or low-fat diets in preserving/improving renal function among moderately obese participants with or without type 2 diabetes, with baseline serum creatinine < 176 μmol/L. Potential improvement is likely to be mediated by weight loss-induced improvements in insulin sensitivity and blood pressure.

### Microalbuminuria as a target to improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes [^116Gs5oW]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Albuminuria is a cardiovascular and renal risk factor in patients with diabetes, patients with hypertension, and the general population. Risk has been shown to increase continuously with increasing urinary albumin levels, starting at levels that once were considered normal. This association is maintained even after adjusting for numerous other factors. Studies also established that a decrease in albuminuria leads to improvement in both cardiovascular and renal outcomes. These data suggest that urinary albumin should be measured routinely and treated to afford cardiovascular and renoprotection.

### Dietary risk factors for incidence or progression of chronic kidney disease in individuals with type 2 diabetes in the European union [^115GKYHx]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is ∼ 30% in the group of people with diabetes, data on interventions in the very early stage of the disease are still missing. Furthermore, the effects of modifiable lifestyle factors such as nutrition on incidence and progression of CKD in patients with diabetes in Europe remain elusive.

Methods

We analyzed whether diet quality and adherence to dietary guidelines using the modified Alternate Healthy Eating Index (mAHEI) score was associated with CKD incidence or progression after 5.5 years in 3088 European participants of the ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) with type 2 diabetes and baseline normo- or micro-albuminuria. Death was considered as a competing risk in the multinomial logit regression models, which were adjusted for age, gender, duration of diabetes, ONTARGET randomization, baseline albuminuria and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We also estimated the potential impact on population health of improvement in diet quality.

Results

At study end, 450 (14.6%) participants had died and 926 (30%) had experienced the renal endpoint of incidence or progression of CKD, of which 422 (13.7%) participants had progressed to micro- or macro-albuminuria, 596 (19.3%) had a GFR-decline of > 5% per year and 18 (0.6%) had developed end-stage renal disease. Participants in the healthiest tertile of the mAHEI score had a decreased risk of incidence or progression of CKD (odds ratio 0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.68–0.94) and death (0.65, 0.52–0.81) compared with participants in the least healthy tertile. If individuals with a suboptimal dietary quality (e.g. mAHEI < 28) were able to improve their diet to an mAHEI of 28, 3.2% of CKD incidence or progression and 10.0% of deaths might be avoided in 5.5 years.

Conclusions

If the association between diet and these endpoints is causal, then optimizing diet quality in individuals with diabetes who have no CKD or very early CKD would have substantial population benefits in terms of prevention of CKD incidence or progression and mortality in this high-risk population.

### Renal function following three distinct weight loss dietary strategies during 2 years of a randomized controlled trial [^116vgzLs]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In this study, we describe the renal outcome in a relatively large, long-term randomized controlled trial in which low-carbohydrate, Mediterranean, and low-fat diets were used to induce weight loss in obese and overweight subjects with or without type 2 diabetes and serum creatinine of ≤ 176 µmol/L. The low-carbohydrate diet was at least as effective as the Mediterranean or low-fat diets in improving eGFR, an effect likely mediated in all three diets by the weight loss-induced improvement in blood pressure and in insulin sensitivity. Remarkably, this trend of apparent improvement in renal functions was not attenuated, and indeed tended to be more pronounced, in participants with pre-existing (baseline) conditions indicating diminished renal function or being at high risk for deterioration of renal function; namely, lower baseline eGFR, type 2 diabetes, and microalbuminuria.

Several limitations of our study warrant consideration. Few women were enrolled in the study, thus compromising our ability to identify sex-specific risk factors in the effects of the various diets on kidney function, although there seemed to be similar weight loss-induced improvements in eGFR and microalbuminuria in men and women (data not shown). In addition, although the subgroups of patients with diabetes and advanced renal impairment are of great interest to assess the effects of weight loss diets on kidney function, most of our participants were not diabetic and had relatively conserved kidney function. In particular, only 23 had microalbuminuria at baseline. Use of this relatively healthy population could have potentially led to underestimation of the beneficial effect of weight loss on kidney function in the most vulnerable groups. Nevertheless, a significant improvement in eGFR could still be observed in addition to robust regression of microalbuminuria, thus underscoring the importance of weight loss on slowing the progression, and perhaps even regressing, CKD at early stages of the disease in patients with and without diabetes.

### Microalbuminuria: do we need a new threshold? [^115xrZhi]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Microalbuminuria (30–300 mg of albumin/24 h) is a well-known independent risk factor for kidney and cardiovascular disease and of mortality in diabetic, hypertensive and in the general population. However, recent studies indicate that increased risk is observed at levels of albuminuria much lower than those currently employed to define microalbuminuria. Such low levels were shown to predict heart disease and death, independent of age, sex, renal function, diabetes, hypertension and lipids, in subjects with cardiovascular disease, hypertension and in the general population; as well as to predict progression to hypertension. Correction of obesity and metabolic derangements lowered levels of albuminuria below 30 mg/24 h to levels not associated with increased risk (5–7 mg/24 h). Despite the lack of outcome studies, there is substantial evidence to indicate that the threshold for defining microalbuminuria (that is, albuminuria associated with increased risk) should be lowered by nearly three to four-fold from the currently defined threshold. It would be advisable that clinical scores and future guidelines would consider including microalbuminuria at the lower rates as an independent risk factor, and as an indication for implementing early intervention. Unfortunately, and despite the abundance of evidence, albuminuria measurements are still underutilized in clinical practice.

KDOQI — dietary protein restriction in diabetes with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 1 to 4: Management of diabetes and CKD should include nutritional intervention. A dietary protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight per day (about 10% of total calories), the recommended daily allowance (RDA), has been achieved in intervention studies and in 2 meta-analyses low-protein diets reduced risks of progression of albuminuria/proteinuria and loss of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The Work Group concluded that limiting dietary protein to the RDA level of 0.8 g/kg body weight per day should stabilize or reduce albuminuria, slow the decrease in GFR, and may prevent CKD stage 5; the current recommendation for dietary protein in diabetes and CKD stages 1 to 4 represents an update to the diet recommended by the NKF-KDOQI CPGs for Hypertension and Antihypertensive Agents in CKD. In people with type 1 diabetes and stage 2 CKD, a modest limitation (0.89 versus 1.02 g/kg body weight per day) reduced the risk of CKD stage 5 or death (relative risk [RR], 0.23; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.72; P = 0.04).

Steno Study multifaceted risk-factor intervention in type 2 diabetes with microalbuminuria — an intensive approach including behavioral modification and pharmacological therapies for hyperglycemia, hypertension (emphasizing RAS inhibitors), dyslipidemia, CVD prevention with aspirin, and a vitamin/mineral supplement was compared with usual care; a mean decrease in albuminuria in the intensive group (albumin excreted 20 mg/24 h) contrasted with a mean increase in the usual-care group (albumin excreted 30 mg/24 h), but the trial was underpowered to assess effects on CVD events or death over 8 years. The Work Group recognizes the importance of addressing multiple risk factors in an integrated fashion and notes that the incremental effects of a multifaceted approach appear to add up to substantial clinical benefits; obesity is recognized as a risk factor for diabetes, hypertension, CVD, and possibly CKD, with NHANES estimating that 31% of the US population is obese, and maintaining a normal weight (BMI, 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2) improves risk factors.

We further cross-classified our population by randomized diet group and CKD stage and further by diabetes status and performed a similar analysis, as described above. We performed a multivariable regression analysis to identify predictors of change in eGFR, including in the model age, sex, diet group, diabetes status, and use of ACE inhibitors and the univariate significant predictors of changes in insulin and blood pressure. We calculated the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio to assess changes in microalbuminuria after 2 years of dietary intervention because the protein-to-creatinine ratio in a random urine specimen provides evidence of the presence of significant proteinuria. We defined microalbuminuria as a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 25 for women or > 17 for men and also evaluated this ratio as a continuous variable. We performed univariate analysis to evaluate the associations between changes in the albumin-to-creatinine ratio and changes in blood biomarkers, clinical measurements, and dietary assignment among those with or without microalbuminuria at baseline.

A multivariable model, adjusted for age, sex, diet group, diabetes status, use of ACE inhibitors, 2-year weight loss, decrease in fasting insulin level, blood pressure, and 2-year change in saturated fat was performed to evaluate the independent diet-induced changes in microalbuminuria. Data analysis is presented for the MDRD and CKD-EPI equations.

Dietary intervention

There are several modalities for a dietary intervention in DN, whether changing protein content or through the manipulation of lipid content. However, few have their efficacy shown based on long term randomized clinical trials.

In patients with type 1 DM, in different stages of renal disease, protein restriction in the diet has shown that it can reduce the decline of renal function and albuminuria. According to a meta-analysis of studies performed with type 1 DM patients and clinical nephropathy, dietary protein restriction retards DN progression. However, several of these studies were randomized with a crossover design, and the maximum time of follow up was 36 months. Besides, in these studies there was no evidence of benefit on hard outcomes such as mortality or risk of end stage chronic renal failure. A randomized controlled clinical trial with patients with type 1 DM and DN followed for four years, showed that a diet with a moderate protein restriction (0.9 g/kg/day) was associated with a 76% reduction of the risk of end stage chronic renal failure or death.

In patients with type 2 DM this benefit has not been well established. There are few studies with type 2 DM patients addressing this issue, showing no benefit on renal function, probably due to lack of compliance with the diet and short follow-up. A recent meta-analysis performed with eight studies including patients with type 1 and 2 DM showed a benefit of protein restriction on proteinuria reduction, but not on GFR reduction. The American Diabetes Association recommends moderate protein restriction (0.8–1.0 g/kg/day) for patients in the initial stages of DN, and a reduction to 0.8 g/kg/day for patients in a more advanced stage of this complication.

Interventions in the dietary lipid content has also been suggested, especially by manipulating the type of meat in the diet. Substituting red meat by chicken meat in the diet over the short term proved be able to reduce UAE, and also the serum levels of total cholesterol, LDL and apolipoprotein B in patients with type 2 DM and micro and macroalbuminuria. Recently it was also observed that the beneficial effect of this dietary intervention on renal function was similar to the use of enalapril for a 12-month period in patients with type 2 DM. This effect is probably related to the lower saturated fat content and greater proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids, observed in chicken meat compared to red meat. Long term studies are needed to confirm this favorable effect.

Two-year changes of urine albumin and creatinine

Among the 23 participants who met the criteria for microalbuminuria at baseline, sex-adjusted levels of urinary albumin and creatinine decreased after 2 years (mean −24.8 ± 51.6 mg/L, P < 0.05; Fig. 2). This decrease was −37.9 and significantly borderline only in the low-carbohydrate group (P = 0.079), −0.2 in the Mediterranean group (P = 0.993), and −52.7 in the low-fat diet (P = 0.270). Among the 299 participants without microalbuminuria at baseline, the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio did not significantly alter. Overall, only 4 of the 23 remained microalbuminuric after 2 years of intervention (82.6% cure), whereas 7 of 299 participants who did not have baseline microalbuminuria progressed to having microalbuminuria after 2 years (2.3% progression).

### Management of hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and albuminuria in patients with diabetes and CKD: a systematic review for a KDOQI clinical practice guideline [^112rzLP5]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In 2007, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) published clinical practice guidelines and recommendations for treating patients with diabetes and kidney diseases. Given recent studies that may enhance our understanding of the benefits and harms of glycemic, lipid, and albuminuria management in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD), the NKF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate data on the management of these patients.

Study Design

Systematic review and evidence synthesis.

Setting & Population

Patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes with or without CKD.

Selection Criteria For Studies

English-language publications indexed in the MEDLINE database from January 2003 to October 2010, as well as cited references in these publications and publications identified after consultation with the NKF Diabetes Work Group were screened. Randomized controlled trials providing evidence for the management of hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and albuminuria in individuals with diabetes were included.

Interventions

(1) Intensive glycemic control; (2) lipid management; (3) interventions aimed at prevention of incident albuminuria and/or progression of albuminuria in normotensive patients.

Outcomes

For all interventions, all-cause mortality was the primary outcome and secondary clinical outcomes included death from cardiovascular causes, incident kidney failure, and nonfatal cardiovascular events. Intermediate outcomes included changes in albuminuria and measures of kidney function. For intensive glycemic control only, severe and mild hypoglycemia were secondary and intermediate outcomes, respectively.

Results

5 studies (n = 27,159) assessed the impact of intensive versus conventional glycemic control strategies on clinical outcomes in type 2 diabetes. Intensive glycemic control reduced the development of micro- and macroalbuminuria, but did not reduce the incidence of primary or secondary clinical outcomes and was associated with a 2.5-fold increase in severe hypoglycemia. 11 studies (n = 7,539) assessed lipid management. Statins did not reduce all-cause mortality or stroke compared to placebo in adults with diabetes and CKD. Fenofibrate increased regression of microalbuminuria to normoalbuminuria compared to placebo. 3 studies reported inconsistent effects of different angiotensin II receptor blockers on the incidence of microalbuminuria, and one study reported that telmisartan reduced macroalbuminuria in normotensive participants. No study demonstrated a benefit on primary or secondary clinical outcomes.

Limitations

Patients with CKD constituted a subgroup in most studies. Substantial heterogeneity with respect to population, interventions, outcome measures, and duration of follow-up.

Conclusions

Intensive glycemic control and lipid interventions did not improve clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. Although interventions typically improved albuminuria, evidence was insufficient to determine whether treatment of albuminuria in normotensive patients provides beneficial effects on clinical outcomes. More intensive clinical management of patients with diabetes and CKD has inherent risks, including severe hypoglycemia, which should be considered when formulating treatment strategies.

Comparison with recent research — systematic and Cochrane reviews — indicates that a cohort-based systematic review found no effect of dietary pattern on CKD progression with follow-up times ranging from 4 to 6.4 years, but reported a relationship between a diet rich in vegetables, fruit, fish, cereals, whole grains, fiber, legumes, and nuts and seeds, and lower in red meat, sodium, and refined sugars and improved outcomes from 4 to 13 years of follow up with RR (95% CI): 0.73 (95% CI, 0.63 to 0.83); a Cochrane review of 6 RCTs across specified diet types (n = 191; n = 355; n = 181; n = 12) concluded effects on all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events were uncertain, while low quality evidence suggested reduced systolic and diastolic BP and higher GFR and albumin levels following dietary interventions.

### Renal function following three distinct weight loss dietary strategies during 2 years of a randomized controlled trial [^117RFf9M]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

For patients with diabetes, the wariness regarding use of high-protein diets is even greater, because dietary protein restriction was shown to slow the progression of nephropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes and the risk of end-stage renal disease. Similar observations were confirmed in a meta-analysis of five studies including 108 patients in which dietary protein restriction resulted in a slower progression of diabetic nephropathy. In type 2 diabetes, a low protein diet has also been suggested to improve renal function among patients with macroalbuminuria, although no benefit could be documented among patients with normal renal function or with microalbuminuria.

Several studies have provided evidence that the source of the dietary protein may be more important for renal function than the absolute amount of protein consumed. For example, replacing red meat with chicken in the usual diet reduced urinary albumin excretion by 46% in patients with type 2 diabetes with microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria. Moreover, a diet including a high amount of fish protein, consumption of which was encouraged in our interventional trial, provided protection from the development of diabetic nephropathy. Some of the differences observed between the various sources of dietary proteins have been attributed to different proportions of saturated versus polyunsaturated fat in meat, chicken, and fish. A higher content of polyunsaturated fatty acids was reported to have beneficial effects on endothelial function that could reduce albuminuria and renal injury.

Nephropathy Screening and Treatment

General recommendations

To reduce the risk or slow the progression of nephropathy, optimize glucose control. (A)
To reduce the risk or slow the progression of nephropathy, optimize blood pressure control. (A)

Screening

Perform an annual test to assess urine albumin excretion (UAE) in type 1 diabetic patients with diabetes duration of ≥ 5 years and in all type 2 diabetic patients, starting at diagnosis. (E)
Measure serum creatinine at least annually in all adults with diabetes regardless of the degree of UAE. The serum creatinine should be used to estimate GFR and stage the level of chronic kidney disease (CKD), if present. (E)

Treatment

In the treatment of the nonpregnant patient with micro- or macroalbuminuria, either ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be used. (A)
While there are no adequate head-to-head comparisons of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, there is clinical trial support for each of the following statements: In patients with type 1 diabetes, with hypertension and any degree of albuminuria, ACE inhibitors have been shown to delay the progression of nephropathy. (A) In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and microalbuminuria, both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to delay the progression to macroalbuminuria. (A) In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, macroalbuminuria, and renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl), ARBs have been shown to delay the progression of nephropathy. (A) If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. (E)
Reduction of protein intake to 0.8–1.0 g·kg body wt⁻¹·day⁻¹ in individuals with diabetes and the earlier stages of CKD and to 0.8 g·kg body wt⁻¹·day⁻¹ in the later stages of CKD may improve measures of renal function (UAE rate, GFR) and is recommended (B)
When ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics are used, monitor serum creatinine and potassium levels for the development of acute kidney disease and hyperkalemia. (E)
Continued monitoring of UAE to assess both response to therapy and progression of disease is recommended. (E)
Consider referral to a physician experienced in the care of kidney disease when there is uncertainty about the etiology of kidney disease (active urine sediment, absence of retinopathy, rapid decline in GFR), difficult management issues, or advanced kidney disease. (B)

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^114AkP9C]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Appendix R — dietary management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) advises that recommending a generally healthy well-balanced diet, rich in fruits and vegetables is reasonable for all patients with chronic disease burden, and that the dietary evaluation and management of patients with CKD should be individualized with support from a registered dietitian to avoid a one-size-fits-all approach to dietary education. A sodium restricted diet may mitigate proteinuria in patients with proteinuric CKD; however, among CKD patients in whom salt wasting is a feature of the disease, these recommendations may not apply. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Mediterranean diets are recommended in the management of hypertension, and both are generally higher in potassium; fresh fruits and vegetables are typically higher in potassium, which may be problematic in some patients who develop hyperkalemia as a result of their CKD, thus adjustments may be needed. In the early stages of CKD, a high intake of foods naturally rich in potassium appears to be protective against disease progression, and dietary restriction of foods naturally containing potassium, such as fruits and vegetables, may be harmful.

KDOQI research recommendations — intensive multifaceted intervention and weight loss in diabetes with chronic kidney disease (CKD) identify questions about benefits for patients already receiving renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, whether such intensive care provides CKD and cardiovascular disease (CVD) benefits at earlier or later CKD stages, feasibility in other clinical settings, the effect in overweight and obese individuals (BMI > 24.9 kg/m²) of weight loss using a balanced calorie-restricted diet on glycemic control, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urinary albumin excretion, and CVD risk factors, and the benefits and risks of rimonabant for weight loss.

### Renal function following three distinct weight loss dietary strategies during 2 years of a randomized controlled trial [^116Mhx94]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Moreover, weight loss per se may improve kidney function indirectly by its effects on blood pressure, glycemia, and lipid profile, which may outweigh the potential deleterious effects of specific dietary macro- or micronutrients. Therefore, the beneficial effects of Mediterranean and low-carbohydrate diets on insulin sensitivity and lipid profile, respectively, and the lack of inferiority in improving kidney function and regression of microalbuminuria compared with the low-fat diet, suggest that these diets could be an alternative dietary approach for overweight and obese people with mild renal dysfunction and/or type 2 diabetes.

We found a strong association between a decrease in systolic blood pressure and fasting insulin level with improvement in eGFR and regression of microalbuminuria. Elevated blood pressure is a well-characterized risk factor for kidney damage and microalbuminuria, as well as hyperinsulinemia, which is strongly correlated with the development of microalbuminuria early in the course of metabolic syndrome and diabetes, independent of glucose levels. In an experimental model in mice lacking the gene for the melanocortin-4 receptor, the relative contribution of hyperinsulinemia and hypertension to the development of renal dysfunction could be differentiated. These mice were hyperinsulinemic but normotensive, yet developed glomerular hyperfiltration and albuminuria. When hypertension was induced, their GFR and albuminuria further increased significantly. These data support the concept of an additive or even synergistic effect of obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and elevated blood pressure on glomerular hemodynamics.

In conclusion, we found that dietary interventions to reduce weight cause progressive improvement in eGFR and marked regression of microalbuminuria regardless of the dietary approach. In patients with a pre-existing moderate renal dysfunction and microalbuminuria, or in patients with type 2 diabetes, a low-carbohydrate high-protein diet is not inferior to other dietary approaches in improving kidney function.

Amount of protein, individuals with DKD

Four parallel RCTs examined the effects of lower versus usual protein intake on glycemic control, CVD risk factors, and renal function markers in individuals with types 1 and 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria, or both. Durations of follow-up ranged from 1 to 4 years, sample sizes were small (23–47 participants in the intervention groups), and retention rates were > 80% in two studies. One study blinded physicians to diet treatment. Two studies achieved lower protein intakes of 0.86–0.89 g protein/kg/day versus usual protein intakes (1.02–1.24), whereas in the other two studies, the lower-protein group had higher actual protein intakes versus the control groups. None of the studies found significant differences between groups for glycemia, CVD risk factors, or renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR], various measures of proteinuria). At the levels of protein achieved, no reduction in serum albumin was noted.

Two meta-analyses addressed protein restriction in people with diabetes and micro- and macroalbuminuria. The meta-analysis by Pan et al. included four studies meeting this review's criteria, and the Cochrane analysis by Robertson et al. included three studies. These four studies are included above.

Source of protein, individuals with DKD

Four RCTs examined the effects of source of protein intake on glycemic control, CVD risk factors, and renal function in individuals with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria. Durations of follow-up ranged from 4 weeks to 4 years, and sample sizes were small (14–20 participants in the designated source interventions). Two studies had completion rates of > 80%.

The nutrition source focus for two RCTs was soy. HDL cholesterol increased significantly and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio decreased significantly with soy powder versus casein powder supplementation. The 4-year RCT reported that the replacement of 35% of animal protein with textured soy protein resulted in significant improvements in FBG and total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and TGs, but no significant changes in kidney function versus control. In two crossover RCTs from the same author group, the dark chicken meat group significantly improved total cholesterol, TGs, and urinary albumin excretion rate, and the low-protein/vegetables group significantly improved total cholesterol and GFR versus the red meat control group.

### Limited impact of lifestyle education in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria: results from a randomized intervention study [^115t49Kq]. Diabetic Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the effect of intensified education on lifestyle (diet, exercise and smoking) as part of an intensified multifactorial intervention over a 4-year period in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus with microalbuminuria.

Methods

Patients, aged 45–65 years, were randomly assigned either to an intensive group focusing on change of behaviour as well as polypharmacological treatment (n = 80) or to a control group receiving conventional treatment (n = 80). Diet intervention focused on dietary fat and carbohydrate. Food intake was estimated by dietary history interviews and nutrients were calculated from food tables. Exercise and smoking habits were evaluated by interviews.

Results

Mean follow-up was 3.8 (SD 0.3) years. The decrease in total fat intake (% of energy intake) was larger in the intensive group as compared to the control group (41.2 (6.2) to 34.2 (6.0) vs. 41.9 (6.5) to 38.3 (6.4)%, P = 0,0001). The decrease in saturated fatty acids (% of total fat intake) was from 47 (4) to 44 (6)% with intensive therapy vs. 45 (5) to 46 (5)%, P = 0.001 and the increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids was from 14 (4) to 18 (6) vs. 16 (5) to 14 (4)%, P < 0.0001. Also the increase in carbohydrate was larger with intensive therapy. However, changes in exercise and smoking habits did not differ between groups.

Conclusion

Despite the many resources invested in behaviour modification in this study, only modest changes were obtained in nutrient intake. Further studies are required to determine the best method of inducing long-lasting changes in behaviour in Type 2 diabetic patients.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^116UXzhC]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Management of albuminuria in normotensive patients with diabetes — implementation issues state that in normotensive people with diabetes and albuminuria the target dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) is unknown, and in the absence of side effects or adverse events the Work Group recommends titration up to the maximum approved dose. Placing people with microalbuminuria and diabetes on therapy with an ACE inhibitor or ARB may lead to less attention to glycemic control, and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999 to 2000 demonstrated that glycemic control has worsened in patients with diabetes and microalbuminuria, which may be caused by health care providers believing that renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition will reduce albuminuria and thus protect patients from clinical end points; the Work Group emphasizes the importance of glycemic control to prevent and treat albuminuria, as well as to reduce the overall risks of diabetes. Given uncertainty about kidney disease and clinical end points in microalbuminuria, the Work Group's recommendations for use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in normotensive people with diabetes and microalbuminuria are less strong than in those with macroalbuminuria.

Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). High credibility.

Low- and very-low-carbohydrate diets — medication management and monitoring: Individuals with diabetes who choose to follow a very-low-CHO diet or KD are at an increased risk of hypoglycemia and thus individuals following a very-low-CHO diet for T2D management should be medically supervised; OHAs and/or insulin may need to be reduced or discontinued after initiation, and patients should be instructed to monitor their blood glucose levels before taking OHAs or insulin to prevent hypoglycemia. Patients taking sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors should avoid VLCHF/KDs because of an increased risk of SGLT2 inhibitor–associated ketoacidosis, and discontinuing SGLT2 inhibitors before initiating a very-low-CHO KD was recommended because of the risk of normoglycemic ketoacidosis. In patients with hypertension on these diets, a reduction in blood pressure frequently occurs; patients should monitor blood pressure at home or in clinic, antihypertensive medications may need to be tapered or discontinued, and diuretics may need to be tapered or discontinued to prevent dehydration and/or hypotension; in T2D with microalbuminuria, continuing a low dose of a renal-protective antihypertensive medication was recommended if a patient does not become hypotensive. Patients taking a vitamin K antagonist for anticoagulation should be instructed on consistent vitamin K intake, consider the potential for increased vitamin K intake from nonstarchy and green leafy vegetables, and more frequent monitoring of anticoagulation therapy may be required because of the potential change in vitamin K intake and its effect on anticoagulation therapy.

### Altered dietary salt intake for preventing diabetic kidney disease and its progression [^113tnCV4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

There is strong evidence that our current consumption of salt is a major factor in the development of increased blood pressure (BP) and that a reduction in our salt intake lowers BP, whether BP levels are normal or raised initially. Effective control of BP in people with diabetes lowers the risk of strokes, heart attacks and heart failure and slows the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in people with diabetes. This is an update of a review first published in 2010.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of altered salt intake on BP and markers of cardiovascular disease and of CKD in people with diabetes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 31 March 2022 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register were identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of altered salt intake in individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Studies were included when there was a difference between low and high sodium intakes of at least 34 mmol/day.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed studies and resolved differences by discussion. We calculated mean effect sizes as mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the random-effects model. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

Thirteen RCTs (313 participants), including 21 comparisons (studies), met our inclusion criteria. One RCT (two studies) was added to this review update. Participants included 99 individuals with type 1 diabetes and 214 individuals with type 2 diabetes. Two RCTs (four studies) included some participants with reduced overall kidney function. The remaining studies either reported that participants with reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were excluded from the study or only included participants with microalbuminuria and normal GFR. Five studies used a parallel study design, and 16 used a cross-over design. Studies were at high risk of bias for most criteria. Random sequence generation and allocation concealment were adequate in only three and two studies, respectively. One study was at low risk of bias for blinding of participants and outcome assessment, but no studies were at low risk for selective reporting. Twelve studies reported non-commercial funding sources, three reported conflicts of interest, and eight reported adequate washout between interventions in cross-over studies. The median net reduction in 24-hour urine sodium excretion (24-hour UNa) in seven long-term studies (treatment duration four to 12 weeks) was 76 mmol (range 51 to 124 mmol), and in 10 short-term studies (treatment duration five to seven days) was 187 mmol (range 86 to 337 mmol). Data were only available graphically in four studies. In long-term studies, reduced sodium intake may lower systolic BP (SBP) by 6.15 mm Hg (7 studies: 95% CI -9.27 to -3.03; I² = 12%), diastolic BP (DBP) by 3.41 mm Hg (7 studies: 95% CI -5.56 to -1.27; I² = 41%) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 4.60 mm Hg (4 studies: 95% CI -7.26 to -1.94; I² = 28%). In short-term studies, low sodium intake may reduce SBP by 8.43 mm Hg (5 studies: 95% CI -14.37 to -2.48; I² = 88%), DBP by 2.95 mm Hg (5 studies: 95% CI -4.96 to -0.94; I² = 70%) and MAP by 2.37 mm Hg (9 studies: 95% CI -4.75 to -0.01; I² = 65%). There was considerable heterogeneity in most analyses but particularly among short-term studies. All analyses were considered to be of low certainty evidence. SBP, DBP and MAP reductions may not differ between hypertensive and normotensive participants or between individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. In hypertensive participants, SBP, DBP and MAP may be reduced by 6.45, 3.15 and 4.88 mm Hg, respectively, while in normotensive participants, they may be reduced by 8.43, 2.95 and 2.15 mm Hg, respectively (all low certainty evidence). SBP, DBP and MAP may be reduced by 7.35, 3.04 and 4.30 mm Hg, respectively, in participants with type 2 diabetes and by 7.35, 3.20, and 0.08 mm Hg, respectively, in participants with type 1 diabetes (all low certainty evidence). Eight studies provided measures of urinary protein excretion before and after salt restriction; four reported a reduction in urinary albumin excretion with salt restriction. Pooled analyses showed no changes in GFR (12 studies: MD -1.87 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI -5.05 to 1.31; I² = 32%) or HbA1c (6 studies: MD -0.62, 95% CI -1.49 to 0.26; I² = 95%) with salt restriction (low certainty evidence). Body weight was reduced in studies lasting one to two weeks but not in studies lasting for longer periods (low certainty evidence). Adverse effects were reported in only one study; 11% and 21% developed postural hypotension on the low-salt diet and the low-salt diet combined with hydrochlorothiazide, respectively.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review shows an important reduction in SBP and DBP in people with diabetes with normal GFR during short periods of salt restriction, similar to that obtained with single drug therapy for hypertension. These data support the international recommendations that people with diabetes with or without hypertension or evidence of kidney disease should reduce salt intake to less than 5 g/day (2 g sodium).

### New insights into protein intake and progression of renal disease [^113CXSwY]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

For several decades, dietary protein restriction has been considered as a strategy to slow renal disease progression. Recently, a National Kidney Foundation advisory board incorporated recommendations for supervised low-protein diets into guidelines for the care of non-dialyzed patients with chronic kidney failure. Despite this consensus statement, the clinical utility of dietary modification remains controversial. This article reviews new investigations of protein intake as a mediator of renal function and physiology published since 1 October 2002.

Recent Findings

Population-level data indicate graded risk for progressive renal functional decline with increasing protein intake among women with mild renal insufficiency, and support a possible association of higher protein consumption with the risk of microalbuminuria in people with concomitant diabetes and hypertension. A link between the quantity of protein intake and the rate of renal deterioration is suggested by preliminary prospective studies among incident peritoneal dialysis patients, renal transplant recipients, and animal models of kidney disease. Varied renal consequences based on protein composition were reported in population-based studies, animal-model experiments, and animal studies of in-utero protein exposure. Clinical trial experience raises concern for the feasibility of dietary interventions in practice.

Summary

New research supports the view that high-protein diets accelerate renal disease progression, suggests differential consequences based on protein source, and explores risk among defined sub-populations. Topics for future exploration include the renal impact of high-protein weight-loss regimens, implications of dietary protein quantity and type across the stages of chronic kidney disease, and translation of animal studies of prenatal nutrition to humans.

Reducing dietary sodium consumption and increasing potassium intake are effective approaches in reducing the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases. Whether this is also true for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is still debated. Elfassy et al. have examined associations between urinary sodium and potassium excretion and the incidence of CKD in young, 30-year-old subjects followed for 20 years. Although they failed to find an association between sodium intake and CKD incidence, there was an inverse association between high potassium intake and the development of albuminuria.

Recommendations for Diabetes and CKD — albuminuria/proteinuria change and clinical outcomes — secondary analyses from the RENAAL trial and IDNT have directly correlated albuminuria/proteinuria reduction with clinical benefit, yet in the opinion of the Work Group, there currently is insufficient evidence to assume that lowering albuminuria levels will necessarily lead to improvements in clinical outcomes such as progression to CKD stage 5, CVD events, or death. Conversely, the failure to reduce albuminuria does not preclude a beneficial clinical effect on diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and to be considered efficacious, potential treatments for DKD must demonstrate benefits not only on albuminuria reduction but also on clinical end points such as CKD stage 5, CVD events, or death.

### Renal function following three distinct weight loss dietary strategies during 2 years of a randomized controlled trial [^115hK5eW]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

RESULTS

The DIRECT participants at baseline (age, 51 years; 86% men; BMI, 31 kg/m²; mean eGFR, 70.5 mL/min/1.73 m²; mean urine microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio, 12.12) had similar distribution of serum creatinine and urine biomarkers, as well as demographic and clinical characteristics across the three assigned diet groups. At baseline (Table 1), 31% of the participants had eGFR of 30 to ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73 m², defined as CKD stage III (moderate), and were distributed similarly across the three diets. Compared with the participants with CKD stage I/II, those with CKD stage III were older, had a higher proportion of men, had lower levels of adiponectin, apoA1, and leptin, and were less likely to use ACE inhibitors and statins (P < 0.05 between groups for all).

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of the DIRECT study population according to baseline CKD stage

Two-year changes of eGFR

Dietary intervention resulted in a significant increase in eGFR, regardless of the dietary strategy: the low-carbohydrate diet (ΔeGFR +5.3% [95% CI 2.1–8.5]) was as effective as the Mediterranean (ΔeGFR +5.2% [3.0–7.4] or low-fat diets (ΔeGFR +4.0% [0.9–7.1], P < 0.05 for all compared with baseline), with similar magnitude (P > 0.05) of effect across the diet groups (Fig. 1 A). Dietary intervention resulted in a significant increase in eGFR, regardless of the dietary strategy: the low-carbohydrate diet (ΔeGFR +1.6%; P = 0.004) was as effective as the Mediterranean (ΔeGFR +1.8%; P < 0.001) or low-fat diets (ΔeGFR +0.4%; P = 0.09), with similar magnitude (P > 0.05) of effect across the diet groups; importantly, this apparent improvement in renal function was not blunted in subgroups with pre-existing conditions, indicating renal dysfunction or high risk for deterioration of renal function.

Protein

For people with diabetes and no evidence of diabetic kidney disease, evidence is inconclusive to recommend an ideal amount of protein intake for optimizing glycemic control or improving one or more CVD risk measures; therefore, goals should be individualized. (C)
For people with diabetes and diabetic kidney disease (either micro- or macroalbuminuria), reducing the amount of dietary protein below the usual intake is not recommended because it does not alter glycemic measures, cardiovascular risk measures, or the course of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline. (A)
In individuals with type 2 diabetes, ingested protein appears to increase insulin response without increasing plasma glucose concentrations. Therefore, carbohydrate sources high in protein should not be used to treat or prevent hypoglycemia. (B)

Several RCTs have examined the effect of higher protein intake (28–40% of total energy) to usual protein intake (15–19% total) on diabetes outcomes. One study demonstrated decreased A1C with a higher-protein diet. However, other studies showed no effect on glycemic control. Some trials comparing higher protein intakes to usual protein intake have shown improved levels of serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, and/or LDL cholesterol. However, two trials reported no improvement in CVD risk factors. Factors affecting interpretation of this research include small sample sizes and study durations of less than 6 months.

Several RCTs comparing protein levels in individuals with diabetic kidney disease with either micro- or macroalbuminuria had adequately large sample sizes and durations for interpretation. Four studies reported no difference in GFR and/or albumin excretion rate, while one smaller study found some potentially beneficial renal effects with a low-protein diet. Two meta-analyses found no clear benefits on renal parameters from low-protein diets. One factor affecting interpretation of these studies was that actual protein intake differed from goal protein intake. Two studies reported higher actual protein intake in the lower protein group than in the control groups. None of the five reviewed studies since 2000 demonstrated malnourishment as evidenced by hypoalbuminemia with low-protein diets, but both meta-analyses found evidence for this in earlier studies.

There is very limited research in people with diabetes and without kidney disease on the impact of the type of protein consumed. One study did not find a significant difference in glycemic or lipid measures when comparing a chicken- or red meat–based diet. For individuals with diabetic kidney disease and macroalbuminuria, changing the source of protein to be more soy-based may improve CVD risk factors but does not appear to alter proteinuria.

### Low-protein diets and its synergistic role in the SGLT2 inhibitor era [^1121pFHG]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Low-protein diets (LPDs), usually defined as a daily dietary protein intake of 0.6 to 0.8 g/kg body weight, have been recommended for decades as a safe and effective lifestyle modification to ameliorate inflammatory damage and proteinuria, reduce glomerular hyperfiltration, and improve metabolic acidosis control in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The mechanism for this is largely attributed to altered tubuloglomerular feedback and afferent arteriole contraction leading to decreased glomerular pressure. Additionally, low protein intake reduces urea generation, which can help delay dialysis initiation in advanced CKD. LPDs have different types including plant-dominant LPDs that can exert additional kidney protective effects as a result of dietary protein quality in addition to quantity. In addition, strong clinical evidence shows that a new class of diabetes mellitus medications, the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, reduces albuminuria and slows the estimated glomerular filtration rate decline in CKD, even in patients without diabetes mellitus, especially if significant proteinuria is present. Given prior studies investigating the effect of LPDs used in conjunction with angiotensin pathway modulators, we argue that LPDs have a synergistic role in disease management and are expected to display additive effects when combined with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor usage or other pharmacologic agents. Even with medical therapy, it is prudent to implement tailored LPDs for different types of CKD.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) dietary monitoring — vegetable protein diets (VPD) risk and follow-up: There are no obvious risks or harms associated with this recommendation; compliance to diets should be monitored frequently during the first year of dietary intervention by dietary interviews (3 is optimal) and urine collection for urea output measures, and then yearly follow-up may be recommended until start of maintenance dialysis; although costs of medical nutrition therapy (MNT) sessions and reimbursements vary, MNT sessions are essential for improving outcomes.

Summary of amount and source of protein research since 2002

For individuals without DKD, higher protein eating patterns (30% of calories) may or may not improve A1C; however, they appear to improve one or more CVD risk measures.

For individuals with DKD and either micro- or macroalbuminuria, reducing the amount of protein from normal levels does not appear to alter glycemic measures, CVD risk measures, or the course of GFR. For individuals with DKD and macroalbuminuria, changing the source of protein to be more soy based may improve CVD risk measures but does not appear to alter proteinuria.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) albuminuria reduction — observational analyses from RENAAL and IDNT found that the magnitude/degree of albuminuria/proteinuria reduction predicted reduced risk for CVD and kidney end points; however, the Work Group states there currently is insufficient evidence to assume that lowering albuminuria levels will necessarily lead to improvements in outcomes such as progression to CKD stage 5, CVD events, or death, and therefore potential treatments for DKD must demonstrate benefits not only on albuminuria reduction but also on clinical end points such as CKD stage 5, CVD events, or death. Conversely, the failure to reduce albuminuria does not preclude a beneficial clinical effect on DKD from a potential intervention.

Conclusions

We conclude that integrating dietary manipulations into a comprehensive strategy will help prevent or ameliorate complications of CKD including acidosis, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia and uremic symptoms and possibly influence CKD progression. We believe particular attention should be paid: 1) to correcting metabolic acidosis with either sodium bicarbonate supplements or more simply with diet instructions how to include supplements of fruits and vegetables; and 2) to lower the intake of sodium chloride as well as phosphates by choosing foods that provide low contents of these ions. Changing the diet by concentrating on these dietary constituents will allow us to maximize the renoprotective anti-proteinuric effect of renin angiotensin system blockers. These considerations on dietary approaches for CKD prevention and management are particularly valuable for low-resource setting worldwide where patients with CKD are beset with numerous challenges often traceable to poverty and a lack of access to life-saving dialysis and transplantation. The feasibility of these management approaches for CKD and its risk factors even in low-income countries is exemplified by the program set up in the communities of Eastern Nepal in collaboration with the International Society of Nephrology (ISN). Dietary recommendation of low-sodium intake and increase of fruits and vegetable together with low-cost anti-hypertensive, anti-diabetic or renoprotective drugs as deemed appropriate, have been able to control proteinuria and slow renal function decline in more than a third of 3,400 individuals on active monitoring.

Regarding the very low protein diet with essential keto acids and amino acids regimen, there is recent and reassuring evidence for its efficacy and nutritionally safety but efforts are needed to improve compliance with dietary regimens. Nutritional educational programs and dieticians could help to increase patient adherence to dietary recommendations. We also recommend that components of the diet and regular monitoring of nutritional status should be jointly assessed by physicians and dieticians, just as recommended for patients with inherited metabolic defects, cirrhosis and diabetes.

KDOQI — DASH diet protein targets and sources with blood pressure effects: In the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and DASH-Sodium diets, a relatively high protein intake (1.4 g/kg body weight per day, or about 18% of total calories) is recommended, with protein sources emphasizing vegetables, low-fat or nonfat dairy products, whole grains, nuts, legumes, fish, and poultry and red meat eaten in only small amounts. In people with prehypertension or untreated stage 1 hypertension, higher protein intake from either soy or predominantly vegetable sources decreased blood pressure in short-term (6 to 12 weeks) feeding studies, and along with the DASH trials these data suggest that predominantly nonanimal protein may have a beneficial effect on blood pressure; small studies suggest that vegetable or soy protein sources may be kidney sparing compared with red meat sources in diabetes and CKD.

Kidney function and proteinuria in CKD — Restriction of sodium intake may slightly reduce kidney function markers of creatinine clearance and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in short-term crossover trials of stage 1–5 nondialysis populations (low-certainty evidence), whereas a single 6-month parallel RCT found no difference in eGFR. Sodium restriction may reduce proteinuria, supported by randomized crossover, parallel RCTs, and observational studies. A 3-month self-management intervention using sodium intake < 100 mmol/d reduced proteinuria but this reversed after stopping the restriction, and higher sodium intake was associated with increased risk for progressing to end-stage kidney disease compared with a lower sodium diet < 100 mmol/d.

Diabetes and chronic kidney disease with microalbuminuria — In hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and a GFR greater than 70 mL/min/1.73 m², studies demonstrated equivalent efficacy of the 2 agents in slowing loss of kidney function, and follow-up in most studies of microalbuminuric patients generally was in the range of 2 to 4 years. Because no trials of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients with diabetes and microalbuminuria have demonstrated a reduction in such clinical outcomes as CKD stage 5, doubling of serum creatinine level, or death, the Work Group concluded that evidence for treatment of microalbuminuric patients with these medicines is moderate, representing a change in level of evidence grading from "strong" in the NKF-KDOQI CPGs on Hypertension and Antihypertensive Agents in CKD; in the absence of participation in such a clinical trial, the Work Group recommends this treatment despite moderate evidence.

### Effect of an intensive weight-loss lifestyle intervention on kidney function: a randomized controlled trial [^113QbX22]. American Journal of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Large randomized trials testing the effect of a multifactorial weight-loss lifestyle intervention including Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) on renal function are lacking. Here, we evaluated the 1-year efficacy of an intensive weight-loss intervention with an energy-reduced MedDiet (erMedDiet) plus increased physical activity (PA) on renal function.

Methods

Randomized controlled "PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea-Plus" (PREDIMED-Plus) trial is conducted in 23 Spanish centers comprising 208 primary care clinics. Overweight/obese (n = 6,719) adults aged 55–75 years with metabolic syndrome were randomly assigned (1:1) to an intensive weight-loss lifestyle intervention with an erMedDiet, PA promotion, and behavioral support (intervention) or usual-care advice to adhere to an energy-unrestricted MedDiet (control) between September 2013 and December 2016. The primary outcome was 1-year change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Secondary outcomes were changes in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), incidence of moderately/severely impaired eGFR (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and micro- to macroalbuminuria (UACR ≥ 30 mg/g), and reversion of moderately (45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) to mildly impaired GFR (60 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) or micro- to macroalbuminuria.

Results

After 1 year, eGFR declined by 0.66 and 1.25 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the intervention and control groups, respectively (mean difference, 0.58 mL/min/1.73 m2; 95% CI: 0.15–1.02). There were no between-group differences in mean UACR or micro- to macroalbuminuria changes. Moderately/severely impaired eGFR incidence and reversion of moderately to mildly impaired GFR were 40% lower (HR 0.60; 0.44–0.82) and 92% higher (HR 1.92; 1.35–2.73), respectively, in the intervention group.

Conclusions

The PREDIMED-Plus lifestyle intervention approach may preserve renal function and delay CKD progression in overweight/obese adults.

### Protein restriction, glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized trial [^112EqzNr]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Protein restriction delays the progression of non-diabetic and type 1 diabetic renal disorders. This study assessed whether protein restriction delays the onset or early progression of renal disorders in type 2 diabetes.

Design

Randomized controlled trial. Outcomes were albuminuria (mg/24 h) and, as an estimate of the glomerular filtration rate, cimetidine-influenced creatinine clearance.

Setting

Primary care.

Subjects

Patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria or at least detectable albuminuria, or a diabetes duration > 5 y.

Interventions

The experimental group received dietary counselling on protein restriction (n = 63); a control group (n = 68) received the usual dietary advice. The duration of intervention and follow-up was 28 ± 7 months.

Results

After 6 months, protein intake differed only by 0.08 g/kg/day between the study groups. Subsequently, this difference decreased and eventually disappeared. An initial effect of protein restriction on albuminuria in favor of the experimental group was not sustained, and the glomerular filtration rate decreased in the experimental group at a 1.6 ± 2.2 ml/min/1.73 m² y lower rate than in the control group (P = 0.5). Comparison of patients in the experimental group with a decrease in protein intake of at least 0.20 g/kg/day, with controls with no decrease, indicated a similarly small and insignificant effect on glomerular filtration rate.

Conclusions

It is concluded that, in the longer term prevention or delay of renal damage in patients with type 2 diabetes, protein restriction is neither feasible nor efficacious.

Microalbuminuria course and classification guidance states that as many as 30% to 50% of microalbuminuric patients may revert to normoalbuminuria, the ADA do not specifically recommend use of a first morning urine sample or overnight collections and postural microalbuminuria or proteinuria may be a confounding factor, particularly in young type 1 patients; patients who are persistently normoalbuminuric tend to be at low risk of DKD, whereas microalbuminuric patients have a 3- to 4-fold increased risk; and, for classification purposes, the Work Group recommends that health care providers consider as macroalbuminuric all patients who have been diagnosed as such before ACE-inhibitor and/or ARB treatment.

CKD: Sodium intake and dry body weight — In adults with CKD 3–5D, we suggest reduced dietary sodium intake as an adjunctive lifestyle modification strategy to achieve better volume control and a more desirable dry body weight (2B). A nutrition prescription that is too high or too low in sodium may result in adverse outcomes. Implementation notes indicate evidence for real‑world adoption is either short term (< 6 months) or only apparent whilst receiving an active intervention, and that sodium intake can be measured in objective (urine collection over 24 hours or spot sample) and self‑report methods; currently, there is too much uncertainty in the evidence to advise on the effectiveness of sodium restriction based on specific thresholds of proteinuria. There are no obvious costs associated with the implementation of these recommendations.
