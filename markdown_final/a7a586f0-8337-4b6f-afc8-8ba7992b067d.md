## Question

What is the initial spironolactone dose for treating hypertension?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what initial spironolactone dose to start for hypertension. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the authoritative dosing from FDA labels for Aldactone (tablets) and Carospir (suspension). Then, I should review resistant hypertension trial data (e.g. PATHWAY-2, DENERVHTA) for practical starting doses and titration. Next, I will consider guideline positioning of spironolactone in treatment algorithms. After that, I need to check renal and potassium monitoring requirements and hyperkalemia mitigation strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a clear initial-dose recommendation with titration and safety checkpoints, and verify there are no contraindication overstatements, especially around eGFR thresholds.

> Let me first confirm where spironolactone fits in hypertension care pathways. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — spironolactone is not typically first-line for essential hypertension; guidelines position it primarily as an add-on for resistant hypertension after optimized triple therapy, though it remains FDA-labeled for hypertension broadly, which is a key distinction I should keep in mind. Contemporary European and Canadian guidelines recommend adding spironolactone as a preferred fourth agent when BP remains uncontrolled on maximally tolerated ACEi/ARB + CCB + thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, aligning with PATHWAY-2 results supporting efficacy in resistant hypertension [^114auHg5] [^116M3vAi] [^113or4c5].

> I will now examine the FDA-labeled dosing for the tablet formulation (Aldactone) in essential hypertension. The label recommends an initial total daily dose of 25 to 100 mg given once daily or in divided doses, with titration at two-week intervals; importantly, doses above 100 mg/day generally do not produce additional BP lowering, so I need to ensure we do not encourage escalation beyond that without another indication. Wait, let me verify the titration cadence — yes, two-week intervals are specified on the label, which supports a measured, safety-conscious approach to up-titration [^1137xmkg] [^115cktnt] [^115kdYMB].

> Next, I should review the oral suspension (Carospir), as its bioavailability differs and the dosing is not interchangeable with tablets. Carospir's initial daily dose for essential hypertension is 20 mg (4 mL) to 75 mg (15 mL), given once daily or in divided doses with two-week titration intervals; doses above 75 mg/day generally do not add BP benefit and the suspension is not therapeutically equivalent to Aldactone, so I need to emphasize that clinicians should not assume tablet-suspension dose equivalence. Hold on, I should confirm the caution about higher suspension doses — yes, the label notes that suspension doses above 100 mg can lead to higher-than-expected spironolactone concentrations, reinforcing adherence to the labeled 20–75 mg/day BP range [^114uyW1L] [^113fUZCr].

> Now, let me consider resistant hypertension–specific dosing informed by trials. The robust PATHWAY-2 RCT used 25 mg once daily for 6 weeks with forced uptitration to 50 mg once daily for another 6 weeks; DENERVHTA used a near-identical 25 mg start with forced uptitration to 50 mg at one month, which is reassuring for a pragmatic 25 → 50 mg pathway. But wait, I should double-check the dose-response beyond 50 mg; while some meta-analytic data support effects across 25–100 mg, the pivotal resistant HTN trials centered on 25–50 mg, so 50 mg is often the practical ceiling in resistant HTN unless there's a compelling reason to go higher. These data align with a typical 2–6 week reassessment window before uptitration [^113TDUJC] [^111yj9hp] [^111ygs61] [^114FxcCe] [^115kdYMB].

> I need to check renal function and potassium considerations, and here I must be careful not to conflate heart failure labeling with hypertension. The Aldactone label advises for heart failure that in eGFR 30–50 mL/min/1.73 m², consider 25 mg every other day due to hyperkalemia risk — wait, that's heart failure guidance, not hypertension-specific, so I should not over-apply it, but it does underscore the physiological risk and the need for conservative dosing and close monitoring in CKD. For hypertension labeling, there is no explicit eGFR-based dosing mandate, but baseline K and creatinine are required and rechecked within about a week after initiation or dose change; bear in mind that PATHWAY-2 excluded eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², so eGFR < 45 is not a formal contraindication, but trial evidence is limited there and caution is warranted [^1137xmkg] [^116K1ha6] [^113TDUJC].

> But wait, what if the patient is on an ACE inhibitor or ARB already, as many resistant HTN patients are — does that materially change the hyperkalemia risk profile? Yes, concomitant RAAS blockade raises hyperkalemia risk, and case series document life-threatening hyperkalemia particularly in the setting of renal dysfunction or intercurrent illness; thus, I need to ensure strict electrolyte and renal monitoring, avoid potassium supplements and high-K diet, and consider lowering or holding other K-raising drugs if potassium rises. If hyperkalemia risk limits spironolactone use in CKD, the AMBER program demonstrates that patiromer can enable more persistent spironolactone use by mitigating K elevations, a practical strategy in stage 3b CKD where resistant hypertension is common [^113C5K6G] [^117WSszd] [^112khCLq].

> Let me synthesize the practical starting doses and titration strategy while cross-checking formulation nuances. For essential hypertension using tablets, a reasonable individualized starting point is 25 mg once daily within the FDA-labeled 25–100 mg/day range, with titration every 2 weeks based on BP and lab safety; avoid exceeding 100 mg/day because it rarely adds benefit for BP lowering. For the suspension, start 20 mg once daily and titrate within 20–75 mg/day, again avoiding higher doses that do not improve BP and may increase exposure; for resistant hypertension, start 25 mg once daily and increase to 50 mg once daily after 2–6 weeks if tolerated and BP remains uncontrolled, reflecting the pivotal trial protocols. I should double-check that I haven't overstated the maximum effective dose — correct, tablets > 100 mg/day generally do not add BP benefit, and suspension > 75 mg/day generally does not add BP benefit per label [^1137xmkg] [^115kdYMB] [^114uyW1L] [^113TDUJC].

> I should confirm the monitoring cadence and actionable thresholds. Baseline serum potassium and creatinine/eGFR are mandatory, with repeat testing within about 1 week of starting or increasing the dose, then periodically; if potassium trends upward or eGFR falls substantially, consider dose reduction (including every-other-day dosing in higher-risk patients), holding interacting agents, and reassessing volume status. Hmm, wait a minute — did I clearly note food consistency and bioavailability? Yes, both Aldactone and Carospir can be taken with or without food but should be taken consistently with respect to meals to limit PK variability, which is a small but practical point for stable exposure [^116K1ha6] [^1137xmkg] [^114uyW1L].

> Hold on, I should verify alignment with guideline sequencing and alternatives if spironolactone is not tolerated. ESC 2024 supports adding spironolactone for resistant hypertension and suggests eplerenone if spironolactone is ineffective or not tolerated; amiloride appears noninferior to spironolactone for home SBP reduction at 12 weeks in resistant hypertension, offering another pathway when MRAs are contraindicated or poorly tolerated. I need to ensure I do not imply eplerenone is superior for BP — guidelines suggest it as an alternative, often with fewer endocrine adverse effects but generally less potent than spironolactone at equivalent doses, so selection should be individualized [^114auHg5] [^117ADaty] [^114UjGue].

> Final check for internal consistency: start at 25 mg daily for most adults with resistant hypertension and titrate to 50 mg if needed; for essential hypertension, use the FDA-labeled 25–100 mg/day (tablet) or 20–75 mg/day (suspension) ranges with two-week titrations, but in real-world practice it is prudent to begin at the lower end with careful lab monitoring and only escalate if needed. I need to ensure I haven't inadvertently turned the PATHWAY-2 eGFR < 45 exclusion into a contraindication — good, I framed it correctly as a trial exclusion informing caution, not a label prohibition, and I emphasized monitoring and hyperkalemia mitigation strategies in CKD to keep the recommendation safe and evidence-aligned [^1137xmkg] [^114uyW1L] [^113TDUJC] [^117WSszd].

The recommended starting dose of spironolactone for hypertension is **25 mg once daily** [^1137xmkg]. Titrate to **50 mg once daily** after 2–4 weeks if blood pressure remains uncontrolled and potassium is ≤ 5.0 mmol/L [^1137xmkg]. Monitor **serum potassium and renal function** within 1 week of initiation or dose change, then periodically; reduce dose or discontinue if potassium rises above 5.5 mmol/L or if significant renal impairment occurs [^116K1ha6] [^116SSRJ7]. In patients with eGFR 30–50 mL/min/1.73 m², consider 25 mg every other day; **avoid use if eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²**. Spironolactone is most effective as add-on therapy in **resistant hypertension** [^113TDUJC] and is generally well tolerated with appropriate monitoring [^1118jLbr].

---

## Recommended starting dose

The **initial dose** is 25 mg once daily (tablet formulation) [^1137xmkg] [^115cktnt], or 20 mg (4 mL) once daily for the **suspension formulation** [^114uyW1L].

---

## Dose titration

Titrate to **50 mg once daily** after 2–4 weeks if blood pressure remains uncontrolled and potassium is ≤ 5.0 mmol/L [^1137xmkg]; the **maximum dose** is 100 mg/day, as higher doses generally do not provide additional blood pressure reduction [^115kdYMB].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing recommendations

The **PATHWAY-2 trial** found that spironolactone 25–50 mg/day significantly reduced blood pressure in resistant hypertension [^113TDUJC], and the **ASCOT-BPLA analysis** reported a median dose of 25 mg/day with significant blood pressure reduction and good tolerability [^1118jLbr].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

### Renal function

Patients with **eGFR 30–50 mL/min/1.73 m²** should be considered for 25 mg every other day [^1137xmkg]; those with **eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²** should avoid spironolactone due to hyperkalemia risk.

---

### Potassium levels

- **Baseline potassium**: ≤ 5.0 mmol/L before initiation [^1137xmkg].
- **Monitoring**: Check potassium within 1 week of initiation or dose change, then periodically [^116K1ha6].
- **Hyperkalemia management**: Reduce dose or discontinue if potassium > 5.5 mmol/L.

---

### Concomitant medications

- **ACE inhibitors/ARBs**: Increased hyperkalemia risk; monitor closely [^116K1ha6] [^113C5K6G].
- **NSAIDs**: May reduce efficacy and increase renal impairment risk [^116K1ha6].
- **Lithium**: May increase lithium levels; monitor lithium levels [^116K1ha6].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Blood pressure**: Monitor regularly to assess efficacy [^116iPpfD].
- **Serum potassium and renal function**: Monitor within 1 week of initiation or dose change, then periodically [^116K1ha6] [^116osiB2].
- **Adverse effects**: Watch for hyperkalemia, gynecomastia, and renal impairment [^116K1ha6] [^113THZRX].

---

## Special populations

### Elderly patients

In elderly patients, **start at lower doses and titrate cautiously** due to a higher risk of hyperkalemia and renal impairment.

---

### Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)

In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), **start at lower doses and monitor potassium and renal function closely**.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^113TDUJC]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

The PATHWAY-2 study, published by Bryan Williams and colleagues in 2015 in the journal Lancet, investigates the role of add-on spironolactone in patients with drug-resistant hypertension. This multicenter, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) focused on individuals with hypertension and involved 335 patients (105 female, 230 male).

Patients included were aged 18 to 79 years with a seated clinic systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg and home SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, despite being on maximally tolerated doses of three antihypertensive drugs for at least three months. Key exclusion criteria encompassed secondary/accelerated hypertension, type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 45 mL/min, sustained atrial fibrillation, and non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment.
- **Interventions**: The study assigned 285 participants to receive spironolactone (25 mg/day for six weeks with forced uptitration to 50 mg/day for the next six weeks) and 274 participants to a matching placebo daily for 12 weeks.
- **Primary outcome**: The primary outcome demonstrated a significant reduction in home SBP between week 6 and week 12 (12.8 mmHg reduction with spironolactone vs. 4.1 mmHg with placebo; adjusted difference (AD) 8.7 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.69 to 9.72).
- **Secondary outcomes**: The study also reported a significant increase in reduction in home SBP at week 12 (14.4 mmHg reduction with spironolactone vs. 4.2 mmHg with placebo; AD 10.2 mmHg, 95% CI 8.74 to 11.7).

### Aldactone [^1137xmkg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Aldactone can be taken with or without food but should be taken consistently with respect to food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
- **Dosage and administration**:
	- **Heart failure**: Initiate treatment at 25 mg once daily. In patients with serum potassium ≤ 5.0 mEq/L and eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73 m², 25 mg once daily is the starting dosage. Patients who tolerate 25 mg once daily may have their dosage increased to 50 mg once daily as clinically indicated. For those who develop hyperkalemia on 25 mg once daily, the dosage may be reduced to 25 mg every other day [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In patients with an eGFR between 30 and 50 mL/min/1.73 m², consider initiating therapy at 25 mg every other day due to the risk of hyperkalemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].
	- **Hypertension**: The recommended initial daily dose is 25 to 100 mg of Aldactone, administered in either single or divided doses. Dosage can be titrated at two-week intervals. Doses greater than 100 mg/day generally do not provide additional reductions in blood pressure.
	- **Edema**: Initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly. The recommended initial daily dose is 100 mg in single or divided doses.
	- **Primary hyperaldosteronism**: Initiate treatment at 100 to 400 mg in preparation for surgery. For patients unsuitable for surgery, use the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient.

### Effect of spironolactone on blood pressure in subjects with resistant hypertension [^1118jLbr]. Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Spironolactone is recommended as fourth-line therapy for essential hypertension despite few supporting data for this indication. We evaluated the effect among 1411 participants in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Blood Pressure Lowering Arm who received spironolactone mainly as a fourth-line antihypertensive agent for uncontrolled blood pressure and who had valid BP measurements before and during spironolactone treatment. Among those who received spironolactone, the mean age was 63 years (SD: ± 8 years); 77% were men, and 40% had diabetes. Spironolactone was initiated a median of 3.2 years (interquartile range: 2.0 to 4.4 years) after randomization and added to a mean of 2.9 (SD: ± 0.9) other antihypertensive drugs. The median duration of spironolactone treatment was 1.3 years (interquartile range: 0.6 to 2.6 years). The median dose of spironolactone was 25 mg (interquartile range: 25 to 50 mg) at both the start and end of the observation period. During spironolactone therapy, mean blood pressure fell from 156.9/85.3 mm Hg (SD: ± 18.0/11.5 mm Hg) by 21.9/9.5 mm Hg (95% CI: 20.8 to 23.0/9.0 to 10.1 mm Hg; P < 0.001); the BP reduction was largely unaffected by age, sex, smoking, and diabetic status. Spironolactone was generally well tolerated; 6% of participants discontinued the drug because of adverse effects. The most frequent adverse events were gynecomastia or breast discomfort and biochemical abnormalities (principally hyperkalemia), which were recorded as adverse events in 6% and 2% of participants, respectively.

### Carospir [^114uyW1L]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **General considerations**: Carospir is not therapeutically equivalent to Aldactone. Follow the dosing instructions provided here. For patients requiring a dose greater than 100 mg, use another formulation. Doses of the suspension greater than 100 mg may result in spironolactone concentrations higher than expected [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Carospir can be taken with or without food, but it should be taken consistently with respect to food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
- **Treatment of heart failure**: In patients with serum potassium ≤ 5.0 mEq/L and eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73 m², initiate treatment at 20 mg (4 mL) once daily. Patients who tolerate 20 mg (4 mL) once daily may have their dosage increased to 37.5 mg (7.5 mL) once daily, as clinically indicated. Patients who develop hyperkalemia on 20 mg (4 mL) once daily may have their dosage reduced to 20 mg (4 mL) every other day [see Warning and Precautions (5.1)]. In patients with an eGFR between 30 and 50 mL/min/1.73 m², consider initiating treatment at 10 mg (2 mL) due to the risk of hyperkalemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].
- **Treatment of essential hypertension**: The recommended initial daily dose is 20 mg (4 mL) to 75 mg (15 mL) administered in either single or divided doses. Dosage can be titrated at two-week intervals. Doses > 75 mg/day generally do not provide additional reductions in blood pressure.
- **Treatment of edema associated with hepatic cirrhosis**: In patients with cirrhosis, initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] and Clinical Pharmacology.

### SPL drug information for spironolactone [^116K1ha6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of spironolactone PO (also known as Aldactone, Carospir):

- **Electrolyte abnormalities**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as spironolactone may cause electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities, including hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hypochloremic alkalosis, hyperglycemia, and hyperuricemia. Monitor serum electrolytes, uric acid, and blood glucose periodically.
- **Gynecomastia**: Spironolactone can cause gynecomastia in a dose-dependent manner, with an onset varying from 1–2 months to over a year. Watch for symptoms and monitor serum electrolytes, uric acid, and blood glucose periodically.
- **Hypotension and renal dysfunction**: Use caution in patients with salt depletion or concomitant use of ACEis/ARBs or nephrotoxic drugs, such as aminoglycosides, cisplatin, and NSAIDs. Monitor volume status and renal function periodically. Pay special attention to the diuretic effect when co-administered with NSAIDs.
- **Increased serum lithium levels**: Exercise caution in patients taking lithium preparations. Monitor lithium levels periodically.
- **Increased serum potassium**: Caution is advised in patients with renal impairment or concomitant use of potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes, or medications that increase potassium serum levels, such as ACEis or ARBs. Monitor serum potassium levels within one week of initiation or up-titration and regularly thereafter.

### Hyzaar [^115kJVQ7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hypertension**: The usual starting dose of Hyzaar is 50/12.5 (losartan 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) once daily. The dosage can be increased after 3 weeks of therapy to a maximum of 100/25 (losartan 100 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg) once daily as needed to control blood pressure [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

	- Initiate a patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with losartan 50 mg monotherapy with Hyzaar 50/12.5 once daily. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after about 3 weeks of therapy, the dosage may be increased to two tablets of Hyzaar 50/12.5 once daily or one tablet of Hyzaar 100/25 once daily.

	- Initiate a patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with losartan 100 mg monotherapy with Hyzaar 100/12.5 (losartan 100 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) once daily. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after about 3 weeks of therapy, increase the dose to two tablets of Hyzaar 50/12.5 once daily or one tablet of Hyzaar 100/25 once daily.

	- Initiate a patient whose blood pressure is inadequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, or is controlled but experiences hypokalemia with this regimen, on Hyzaar 50/12.5 once daily. This reduces the dose of hydrochlorothiazide without reducing the overall expected antihypertensive response. Evaluate the clinical response to Hyzaar 50/12.5, and if blood pressure remains uncontrolled after about 3 weeks of therapy, increase the dose to two tablets of Hyzaar 50/12.5 once daily or one tablet of Hyzaar 100/25 once daily.

### Patiromer versus placebo to enable spironolactone use in patients with resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease (AMBER): Results in the pre-specified subgroup with heart failure [^116SSRJ7]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

Drug treatments: Open‐label oral spironolactone was started at 25 mg once daily and increased to 50 mg once daily at week 3 in patients with serum K+ ≤ 5.1 mmol/L if systolic AOBP remained ≥ 120 mmHg. Patients initiated study drug [two similarly unmarked packets of 4.2 g of patiromer (Relypsa, Inc, a Vifor Pharma Group Company, Redwood City, CA, USA) or microcrystalline cellulose placebo], taken once daily with food at least 3 hours before or 3 hours after other medications (including spironolactone).

Study drug dosing adjustments were made at intervals of ≥ 1 week: upward adjustment for local laboratory serum K+ > 5.1 mmol/L and downward adjustment for serum K+ < 4.0 mmol/L. The maximum daily dosage of patiromer/placebo was six packets (25.2 g in the patiromer group), and the minimum was no packets. The titration algorithm was designed to maximize spironolactone dose while avoiding hyperkalaemia, decreases in eGFR, and hypotension.

There were three protocol‐specified criteria for treatment withdrawal because of high serum K+:
(i) K+ ≥ 5.5 and < 6.0 mmol/L, and on maximum dose of patiromer or placebo, and repeat K+ within 1 day remained ≥ 5.5 mmol/L;
(ii) K+ ≥ 5.5 and < 6.0 mmol/L, not on maximum dose but after dose was increased by two packets, and repeat K+ within 3 days remained ≥ 5.5 mmol/L; and
(iii) K+ ≥ 6.0 mmol/L and repeat K+ within 1 day remained ≥ 6.0 mmol/L. Patients who discontinued patiromer or placebo were required to discontinue spironolactone at the same time. Patients who discontinued spironolactone and patiromer or placebo for any reason remained in the study.

### The potential of spironolactone to mitigate the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in hypertensive populations: evidence from a cohort study [^114hdszj]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

To further investigate the association between spironolactone use and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), we conducted a cumulative drug dose analysis for all participants using spironolactone. The results showed that in model 1, each 100 mg increase in spironolactone dose was associated with a 7.4% reduction in the risk of NAFLD. In the fully adjusted model 5, this effect remained consistent, with a 7.7% reduction in NAFLD risk. To further assess the dose–response relationship, the restricted cubic splines (RCS) results indicated that when the cumulative dose of spironolactone exceeded 635 mg*months, the risk of NAFLD was significantly reduced. Specifically, the two-stage comparative analysis showed that participants with a cumulative dose of 635 mg*months or greater had a 71.9% lower risk of NAFLD compared to those with a cumulative dose below 635 mg*months. These findings further support a significant association between spironolactone and a reduced risk of NAFLD. Moreover, as the cumulative dose of spironolactone increased, the risk of NAFLD gradually decreased, highlighting the potential benefit of spironolactone in reducing the future occurrence of NAFLD in hypertensive patients.

### Life-threatening hyperkalemia during combined therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and spironolactone: An analysis of 25 cases [^113C5K6G]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The beneficial effects of spironolactone are additive to those of ACE inhibitors among patients with heart failure and/or hypertension. However, it is essential to identify patients prone to developing serious hyperkalemia during combined treatment and to evaluate the associated morbidity and mortality.
- **Subjects and methods**: We studied 25 patients treated with ACE inhibitors and spironolactone who were admitted to the emergency room with a serum potassium level > 6 mmol/L. Patients were followed up for at least one month after admission.
- **Results**: The mean age of the patients (11 males, 14 females) was 74 ± 13 years. Five patients were diabetics. On admission, the serum potassium was 7.7 ± 0.7 mmol/L and the serum creatinine was 3.8 ± 1.8 mg/dL. These values were significantly higher than the most recent follow-up laboratory measurements (4.6 ± 0.5 mmol/L and 1.9 ± 1.2 mg/dL, respectively) obtained at 13 ± 5 weeks before admission. The arterial pH on admission was 7.3 ± 0.1 and the plasma bicarbonate was 18 ± 5 mmol/L. The main causes for acute renal failure were dehydration (n = 12) and worsening heart failure (n = 9). The mean daily dose of spironolactone was 57 ± 32 mg, and 12 patients were concomitantly treated with other drugs that may cause hyperkalemia. Two patients died, and 2 patients were resuscitated but survived. Hemodialysis was necessary in 17 patients and 12 patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. The mean duration of hospitalization was 12 ± 6 days. Two patients needed to be started on maintenance hemodialysis therapy.

### Endocrine and haemodynamic changes in resistant hypertension, and blood pressure responses to spironolactone or amiloride: The PATHWAY-2 mechanisms substudies [^112EHGs8]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

The rationale for the extra measurements or intervention that we report here was to link the pathophysiology of resistant hypertension with response to treatment. This link became of particular interest when the primary outcome showed spironolactone to be substantially superior to the alternatives. Although this outcome was scarcely a complete surprise, we had not expected superiority to be exhibited across almost the entire distribution of plasma renin, with the crossover design permitting demonstration that only ten (3%) of 326 patients in PATHWAY-2 had a plasma renin concentration that predicted a better blood pressure response to α blockade or β blockade than to spironolactone. It seems reasonable now to conclude that resistant hypertension, as previously suspected, is predominantly a salt-retaining state, often caused by primary or secondary aldosteronism.

One of the best measures of sodium balance is plasma renin, as shown by the dose-related, several-times increases in plasma renin caused by each of the diuretic treatments in PATHWAY-3. Definition of normal ranges for plasma renin is difficult in patients receiving multiple antihypertensive drugs — in particular the A+C+D classes required for a diagnosis of resistant hypertension, all of which increase concentrations of plasma renin. However, the median plasma renin value of 34 mU/L in PATHWAY-2 was only three times greater than the median value (11 mU/L) in the 605 patients with untreated hypertension in PATHWAY-1, who had similar blood pressure values on no treatment.

We conducted an open observational study evaluating the use of spironolactone (25–50 mg) for managing patients with resistant hypertension. This medication was recommended in 133 patients already receiving an angiotensin-blocking drug, alongside other therapies.

Of these patients, three defaulted from follow-up, and 11 could not tolerate spironolactone. Consequently, we have outcome data on 119 patients. The addition of spironolactone (median dose 25 mg) was associated with a mean (SD) reduction in systolic blood pressure of 21.7 mmHg (24.0; P < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure of 8.5 mmHg (14.9; P < 0.001). In two patients, spironolactone had to be discontinued due to an increase in serum potassium above 6.0 mmol/l; overall, the mean increase in serum potassium was 0.3 mmol/l.

With careful monitoring of plasma electrolytes, low-dose spironolactone proves to be an effective adjunct in patients with hypertension resistant to a regimen that includes an angiotensin-blocking agent.

### Spironolactone use and improved outcomes in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction with resistant hypertension [^1133Zkd8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

This study, however, has several limitations. First, it was a secondary analysis of the TOPCAT study; therefore, a randomized controlled trial would be required to confirm the results of this study, to evaluate if the use of spironolactone is beneficial and safe in patients with HFpEF with resistant hypertension. Second, the TOPCAT study included patients with HFpEF with controlled blood pressure; thus, it remains unclear whether similar results would be observed in patients with HFpEF with uncontrolled high blood pressure. Third, we could not clarify the doses of antihypertensive medications such as ACEIs, ARBs, CCBs, and diuretics. In addition, this study did not include information regarding other antihypertensive medication classes beyond ACEIs, ARBs, CCBs, diuretics, and beta blockers. Further investigation is needed to verify our findings using data with more detailed information, including the doses and classes of antihypertensive medications taken.

In conclusion, the results of our study demonstrated that spironolactone use led to a decreased risk of composite cardiovascular events, all‐cause mortality, and heart failure hospitalization in patients with HFpEF with resistant hypertension, but this trend was not observed in those without resistant hypertension. Spironolactone use may be an effective add‐on medication for patients with HFpEF with resistant hypertension who are already taking ACEIs/ARBs, CCBs, and diuretics.

### Spironolactone reduces aortic stiffness in patients with resistant hypertension independent of blood pressure change [^116a9wZc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The data supporting the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.
- **Study population and study design**: Study participants (n = 30, 54 ± 7 years) were selected from a group of 45 consecutive patients referred for resistant hypertension (RHTN) to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hypertension Clinic. These participants agreed to participate in a 6-month follow-up research on spironolactone treatment, including cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, to assess the role of hyperaldosteronism in cardiac volume overload in RHTN. Those with dedicated phase-contrast velocity mapping CMR imaging of the ascending aorta were included in the present analysis.

	- RHTN was defined as blood pressure > 140/90 mm Hg at two clinic visits despite the use of three antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic, at pharmacologically effective doses. Patients with a history of heart failure, primary hyperaldosteronism before enrollment, chronic kidney disease, or chronic steroid therapy were excluded. Patients with secondary causes of hypertension other than hyperaldosteronism, such as renovascular hypertension, pheochromocytoma, or Cushing syndrome, were also excluded. At the time of enrollment, all patients had been taking a stable antihypertensive regimen for ≥ 4 weeks.

	- Clinical, biochemical, and CMR imaging studies were performed at baseline and after 6 months of spironolactone treatment. In the present analysis, 5 participants were excluded because their baseline or 6-month CMR imaging studies lacked the phase-contrast images used for assessing aortic stiffness. Another 10 patients did not complete the 6-month follow-up study.

Regarding medical management for primary aldosteronism, specifically with respect to mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, the HC 2020 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in patients who are ineligible for, or refusing surgery, even with confirmed unilateral hypersecretion. It is important to recognize that blood pressure-lowering responses to other antihypertensive medications, such as ARBs, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers, are often only modest to moderate.

### Aldactone [^116E4HKq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

A total of 1663 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either spironolactone or a placebo. Among these patients, 87% were white, 7% were black, and 2% were Asian. The cohort comprised 73% males, with a median age of 67 years. The median ejection fraction was recorded at 26%. Of the patients, 70% were classified as NYHA class III, while 29% were class IV. Heart failure etiology was ischemic in 55% of the patients and non-ischemic in 45%. There was a history of myocardial infarction in 28% of patients, hypertension in 24%, and diabetes in 22%. The median baseline serum creatinine was noted to be 1.2 mg/dL, with a median baseline creatinine clearance of 57 mL/min.

At the study's outset, all patients (100%) were taking loop diuretics, and 95% were on an ACE inhibitor. Additional medications administered at any point during the study included digoxin (78%), anticoagulants (58%), aspirin (43%), and beta-blockers (15%).

The primary endpoint of the RALES study was the time to all-cause mortality. The study was terminated early due to a significant mortality benefit observed during a planned interim analysis. Spironolactone was found to reduce the risk of death by 30% compared to placebo (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval 18% to 40%). It also reduced the risk of hospitalization for cardiac causes, defined as worsening heart failure, angina, ventricular arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction, by 30% (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval 18% to 41%).
- **Survival analysis**: The survival curves for each treatment group are depicted in Figure 1.

- **Subgroup analysis**: Mortality hazard ratios for various subgroups are illustrated in Figure 2. The beneficial effect of spironolactone on mortality appeared consistent across genders and all age groups, except for patients younger than 55.

Unfortunately, the excerpt concludes abruptly, indicating a potential truncation.

### Aldactone [^114R5RRx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Spironolactone and its active metabolites are specific pharmacologic antagonists of aldosterone, acting primarily through competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone-dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Spironolactone causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted, while potassium is retained. By this mechanism, spironolactone acts both as a diuretic and as an antihypertensive drug, and it may be given alone or with other diuretic agents that act more proximally in the renal tubule.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Increased levels of the mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, are present in primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism. Edematous states in which secondary aldosteronism is usually involved include congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome. Spironolactone competes with aldosterone for receptor sites, providing effective therapy for the edema and ascites in those conditions. It counteracts secondary aldosteronism induced by the volume depletion and associated sodium loss caused by active diuretic therapy.

- **Absorption**: The mean time to reach peak plasma concentration of spironolactone and the active metabolite, canrenone, in healthy volunteers is 2.6 and 4.3 hours, respectively.

- **Effect of food**: Food increased the bioavailability of spironolactone (as measured by AUC) by approximately 95.4%. Patients should establish a routine pattern for taking Aldactone with regard to meals [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

### A randomized, multicenter, open-label, blinded end point trial comparing the effects of spironolactone to chlorthalidone on left ventricular mass in patients with early-stage chronic kidney disease: Rationale and design of the SPIRO-CKD trial [^113vL8hE]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

For those patients wanting to take part but not immediately eligible because they are either on existing diuretic therapy, not taking ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, or taking both of these agents, a 4- to 6-week run-in phase is used. For patients on existing loop or thiazide diuretic therapy who wish to take part in the trial, diuretic therapy is stopped after obtaining consent, and the patient is reviewed after 4 weeks to ensure that he/she meets the eligibility criteria. For patients not on ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, after obtaining consent, an ACE inhibitor or ARB of the physician's choice is introduced and titrated to a well-tolerated therapeutic dose over a 4-week period. The patient is then reviewed to ensure eligibility. For patients on dual ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy, after obtaining consent, either the ACE inhibitor or the ARB is stopped, and patients are then reviewed to ensure eligibility. Those patients who fulfill all entry criteria are consented and randomized into the main SPIRO-CKD trial.

Once informed consent is received and the baseline assessments are completed, patients are entered into the main SPIRO-CKD trial. Participants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either spironolactone (25 mg once a day) or chlorthalidone (half a 50-mg tablet once a day, as there are no 25-mg tablets available for use in the UK) for 40 weeks without blinding. A secure central randomization service was provided by the Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit (University of Birmingham) using a computer-generated program and a minimization algorithm.

When managing hypertension, specifically concerning the choice of antihypertensives and subsequent therapy, the JNC 8 2014 guidelines recommend increasing the dose of the initial drug or adding a second drug from one of the following classes: thiazide-type diuretics, CCBs, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs. This adjustment should occur if the goal blood pressure is not reached within a month of treatment. It is essential to continue assessing blood pressure and modify the treatment regimen until the desired blood pressure goal is achieved.

### The role of spironolactone in the treatment of patients with refractory hypertension [^116vgeeC]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Hypertension is resistant to pharmacologic therapy in 5% to 10% of patients. This study tested whether the addition of spironolactone to the treatment of patients with refractory hypertension would lead to adequate blood pressure (BP) control.
- **Methods**: Among 520 patients who were referred for treatment of hypertension to one medical clinic from 1997 to 1999, a total of 25 patients who met the inclusion criteria of refractory hypertension were prospectively included in this study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) hypertension of ≥ 6 months without any apparent cause; 2) clinical BP measurement and mean 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring > 140/90 mm Hg despite treatment with at least two antihypertensive drugs; 3) no prior therapy with spironolactone; and 4) no renal insufficiency. Spironolactone was added to the previous regimen at a dosage of 1 mg/kg/day while any angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor was suppressed. Serum potassium and creatinine levels were checked before the introduction of spironolactone and 1 month later.
- **Results**: After 1 month of therapy with spironolactone, 23 patients had a clinical BP < 140/90 mm Hg. Ambulatory BP monitoring, when compared before and 1 month after initiation of spironolactone, showed significant decreases (systolic BP from 152 ± 2 mm Hg to 128 ± 2 mm Hg, P < .001; and diastolic BP from 86 ± 2 mm Hg to 76 ± 2 mm Hg, P < .013). By 3 months after the introduction of spironolactone, the mean number of antihypertensive drugs required per patient was significantly reduced from 3.2 ± 0.2 to 2.1 ± 0.2 (P < .001).

### Patiromer versus placebo to enable spironolactone use in patients with resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease (AMBER): Results in the pre-specified subgroup with heart failure [^112khCLq]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

The AMBER trial demonstrated that the concomitant use of patiromer enabled the more persistent use of spironolactone by reducing the risk of hyperkalaemia in patients with resistant hypertension and advanced chronic kidney disease. We report herein the pre‐specified subgroup analysis in patients with heart failure (HF).
- **Methods and results**: Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either placebo or patiromer (8.4 g once daily), in addition to open‐label spironolactone (starting at 25 mg once daily) and their baseline blood pressure medications. Dose titrations were permitted after 1 week for patiromer/placebo and after 3 weeks for spironolactone. The primary endpoint was the between‐group difference at week 12 in the proportion of patients on spironolactone. Efficacy endpoints and safety were assessed in all randomized patients (intention to treat). A total of 295 patients were enrolled, of whom 132 (45%) had HF. In the HF subgroup, 68.1% of patients receiving placebo remained on spironolactone at week 12, compared with 84.1% of patients receiving patiromer (P = 0.0504). The reason for discontinuation from spironolactone use was hyperkalaemia in the majority of both groups. There was no significant interaction between the subgroups with HF and without HF (P = 0.8085) for the primary endpoint.
- **Conclusions**: Consistent with the overall AMBER trial results, this pre‐specified subgroup analysis in patients with HF, resistant hypertension, and advanced chronic kidney disease demonstrated that patiromer enabled more persistent use of spironolactone by reducing the risk of hyperkalaemia.

### Spironolactone versus sympathetic renal denervation to treat true resistant hypertension: Results from the DENERVHTA study - A randomized controlled trial [^114FxcCe]. Journal of Hypertension (2016). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension is a significant health concern due to its prevalence, estimated to be around 5–15% when factors like nonadherence, inadequate treatment, and white-coat hypertension are excluded, and its associated cardiovascular risk. It is well known that patients with resistant hypertension exhibit higher rates of subclinical target organ damage, major cardiovascular events, and mortality compared to those with controlled hypertension. Recently, sympathetic renal denervation (RDN), a nondrug minimally invasive treatment, has gained attention for its potential as a treatment modality in this demographic. Initial promising results indicated 25–30 mmHg reductions in office systolic blood pressure (SBP) at six months, which supported the widespread adoption of this technique.

However, the randomized controlled trial Symplicity HTN-3 did not demonstrate a significant blood pressure reduction compared to a 'sham' control group. Concurrently, several studies have highlighted the potential role of spironolactone, an antagonist of aldosterone receptors, in treating resistant hypertension. The Addition of Spironolactone in Patients with Resistant Arterial Hypertension trial showed that spironolactone as an add-on treatment achieved reductions in both office SBP (14.6 mmHg) and 24-hour SBP (10.6 mmHg) significantly greater than those in control groups, where baseline antihypertensive treatment was continued. More recent findings from the PATHWAY-2 study further explore these developments.

### Blood pressure control in type 2 diabetic patients [^111ANacN]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

Low-dose spironolactone has been found effective in controlling blood pressure in patients with hypertension and diabetes. The addition of spironolactone is particularly effective for those with serum potassium levels below 4.5 mmol/L. To prevent hyperkalemia, thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics should be continued when aldosterone antagonists are added.

The inclusion of spironolactone in conventional antihypertensive treatment for diabetic patients has been shown to reduce albuminuria. In patients with albuminuria, adding an aldosterone antagonist to an ACE inhibitor has been proven to have superior renoprotective effects compared to adding an angiotensin receptor blocker, even when blood pressure reduction rates are similar.

Finerenone, a new non-steroidal anti-mineralocorticoid, shows less affinity for other steroid hormone receptors than spironolactone and eplerenone, resulting in fewer adverse effects such as gynecomastia, impotence, low sex drive, and hyperkalemia. A recent study indicated that in patients with diabetic nephropathy, adding finerenone to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker improved the urinary albumin-creatinine ratio better than a placebo.

Aldosterone antagonists appear to have a renoprotective effect independent of systemic hemodynamic alterations. Diabetic individuals tend to develop type 4 renal tubular acidosis, raising concerns about hyperkalemia when treated with aldosterone antagonists, especially in combination with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, although the long-term risk is low.

### Patiromer versus placebo to enable spironolactone use in patients with resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease (AMBER): a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^117WSszd]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

Spironolactone is effective at reducing blood pressure in patients with uncontrolled resistant hypertension. However, the use of spironolactone in patients with chronic kidney disease can be restricted by hyperkalaemia. We evaluated the use of the potassium binder patiromer to allow more persistent use of spironolactone in patients with chronic kidney disease and resistant hypertension.

- **Methods**: In this phase 2 multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we enrolled participants aged 18 years and older with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate 25 to ≤ 45 mL/min per 1.73 m²) and uncontrolled resistant hypertension from 62 outpatient centres in ten countries (Bulgaria, Croatia, Georgia, Hungary, Ukraine, France, Germany, South Africa, the UK, and the United States). Patients meeting all eligibility criteria at the final screening visit were stratified by local serum potassium measurement (4.3 to < 4.7 mmol/L vs. 4.7 to 5.1 mmol/L) and history of diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) with an interactive web response system to receive either placebo or patiromer (8.4 g once daily), in addition to open-label spironolactone (starting at 25 mg once daily) and their baseline blood pressure medications. Participants, the study team that administered treatments and measured blood pressure, and the investigators were masked to assigned treatment groups. Dose titrations were permitted after 1 week (patiromer) and 3 weeks (spironolactone). The primary endpoint was the between-group difference at week 12 in the proportion of patients.

### Efficacy of low-dose spironolactone in subjects with resistant hypertension [^111xmw5e]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Previous reports have demonstrated the antihypertensive efficacy of high doses of spironolactone in subjects with primary aldosteronism and, to a lesser degree, subjects with resistant hypertension.
- **Methods**: In this analysis, we examined the antihypertensive benefit of adding low-dose spironolactone to multidrug regimens that included a diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in subjects with resistant hypertension, with and without primary aldosteronism. Subjects referred for resistant hypertension were evaluated with early morning plasma renin activity, 24-hour urinary aldosterone, and sodium during high dietary salt ingestion. The diagnosis of primary aldosteronism was confirmed with a renin activity of 12 µg/24 h and urinary sodium > 200 mEq/24 h. After biochemical evaluation, spironolactone (12.5 to 25 mg/d) was added to each subject's antihypertensive regimen. If blood pressure (BP) remained uncontrolled, the dose of spironolactone was titrated up to 50 mg/d. Follow-up BP was determined at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months.
- **Results**: A total of 76 subjects were included in the analysis, 34 of whom had biochemical primary aldosteronism. Low-dose spironolactone was associated with an additional mean decrease in BP of 21 ± 21/10 ± 14 mm Hg at 6 weeks and 25 ± 20/12 ± 12 mm Hg at 6-month follow-up. The BP reduction was similar in subjects with and without primary aldosteronism and was additive to the use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, specifically with respect to the choice of antihypertensives, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend initiating combination BP-lowering treatment in most patients with confirmed hypertension (BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg) as initial therapy. It is preferred to combine a renin-angiotensin system blocker (either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB) with a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker or a diuretic. Combination treatment should be avoided in patients aged ≥ 85 years, and in patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, moderate-to-severe frailty, or elevated BP (SBP 120–139 mmHg or DBP 70–89 mmHg) who have a concomitant indication for treatment.

### Altace [^116ty8TW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hypertension**: The recommended initial dose for patients not receiving a diuretic is 2.5 mg once a day. Adjust the dose according to blood pressure response. The usual maintenance dosage range is 2.5 mg to 20 mg per day, administered as a single dose or in two equally divided doses. In some patients treated once daily, the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval. In such patients, consider an increase in dosage or twice-daily administration. If blood pressure is not controlled with Altace alone, a diuretic can be added.
- **Reduction in risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death from cardiovascular causes**: Initiate dosing at 2.5 mg once daily for 1 week, 5 mg once daily for the next 3 weeks, and then increase as tolerated to a maintenance dose of 10 mg once daily. If the patient is hypertensive or recently post-myocardial infarction, Altace can also be given as a divided dose.
- **Heart failure post-myocardial infarction**: For the treatment of post-myocardial infarction patients who have shown signs of congestive heart failure, the recommended starting dose of Altace is 2.5 mg twice daily (5 mg per day). A patient who becomes hypotensive at this dose may be switched to 1.25 mg twice daily. After one week at the starting dose, increase the dose (if tolerated) toward a target dose of 5 mg twice daily, with dosage increases being about 3 weeks apart.

	- After the initial dose of Altace, observe the patient under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^111yj9hp]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

The study PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. bisoprolol) was published in 2015 in the journal Lancet and addresses hypertension. The trial question investigated whether spironolactone is superior to add-on bisoprolol in patients with drug-resistant hypertension. This multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) included a population of 335 patients (105 female, 230 male).

- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients were aged 18–79 years with seated clinic systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg and home SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of three antihypertensive drugs for at least three months.

- **Key exclusion criteria**: These included secondary/accelerated hypertension, type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 45 mL/min, sustained atrial fibrillation (AF), and non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment.
- **Interventions**: Participants were divided into two groups; 285 received spironolactone (25 mg/day through week 6 with forced uptitration to 50 mg/day through week 12) and 285 received bisoprolol (5 mg/day through week 6 with forced uptitration to 10 mg/day through week 12).
- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant increase in the reduction of home SBP from week 6 to week 12 (12.8 mmHg vs. 8.3 mmHg; absolute difference 4.48 mmHg, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.46 to 5.5).

### Spironolactone dose in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: findings from TOPCAT [^113PpUPA]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

Spironolactone up-titration may be limited by side effects that could be minimized at lower than target doses; however, whether these lower doses remain efficacious is unknown. In TOPCAT, spironolactone (or placebo) was started at 15 mg/day, with increases up to a maximum of 45 mg/day. The prognostic implications related to spironolactone dose are yet to be reported. The aim was to assess the average spironolactone/placebo doses provided during the trial, both overall and within high-risk subgroups (e.g. elderly, renal dysfunction, high potassium); discontinuation rates; and the efficacy of lower than target doses in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.
- **Methods and results**: Overall, 1767 patients from 'TOPCAT-Americas' were included. Linear, logistic, and Cox regressions were applied. Patients randomized to spironolactone received lower doses than placebo: 22.5 (15.0–27.5) mg/day vs. 27.5 (17.5–27.5) mg/day (P < 0.05). Patients with risk factors, such as renal dysfunction or high potassium > 4.5 mmol/L, received lower spironolactone doses (median ≈ 20 mg/day). This pattern of dose differences was not observed in placebo patients, where the between-subgroup placebo doses were similar (spironolactone-placebo by subgroup P interaction < 0.05). Among spironolactone patients, 25.4% discontinued the drug during the first year, compared with 18.3% of placebo patients (P < 0.001). Discontinuation rates in the high-risk subgroups reached 30% during the first year. Spironolactone reduced the primary outcome.

### The potential of spironolactone to mitigate the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in hypertensive populations: Evidence from a cohort study [^116oYzvr]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

While the link between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hypertension is well recognized, the potential protective effects of the widely used antihypertensive medication, spironolactone, on NAFLD risk remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of spironolactone on the development of NAFLD in hypertensive patients, shedding light on its potential broader clinical benefits beyond blood pressure control.
- **Methods**: A total of 7241 participants were included. Propensity score matching (1:4 ratio) was employed to minimize confounding factors, creating balanced groups of spironolactone users and nonusers. Multivariate Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were used to evaluate the association between spironolactone use and NAFLD risk. Restricted cubic splines (RCS) were applied to assess the dose-response relationship, and subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to validate the robustness of the findings.
- **Results**: After matching, the study included 4110 participants (822 spironolactone users and 3288 nonusers). Spironolactone use was associated with a significantly lower risk of NAFLD, with a 16.3% reduction in risk compared with nonusers (hazard ratio: 0.821; 95% confidence interval: 0.714–0.944). The RCS analysis revealed that a cumulative spironolactone dose exceeding 635 mg*months was associated with a significant reduction in NAFLD risk. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses confirmed the consistency of these findings across various patient characteristics and conditions.
- **Conclusion**: This study demonstrates a signi

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^115dKGKX]. Nature Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The study BARACK-D was published by F D Richard Hobbs and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Nature Medicine. This study is related to chronic kidney disease. In the BARACK-D study, the trial question was the role of spironolactone in patients with stage 3b CKD. The study design was a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial. The population consisted of 1372 patients, including 748 females and 624 males. The inclusion criteria were adult patients with stage 3b CKD. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy or lactation, type 1 diabetes mellitus, terminal disease, chronic heart failure or known left ventricular systolic dysfunction, recent myocardial infarction, active cancer with less than a one-year life expectancy or in palliative care, and alcohol or drug abuse.

The interventions were divided into two groups: one consisting of 677 patients receiving spironolactone at a dose of 25 mg once daily in addition to usual care, and the other consisting of 695 patients receiving usual care alone. The primary outcome showed no significant difference in the first occurrence of death, hospitalization for heart disease, stroke, heart failure, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral arterial disease, nor the first onset of any condition listed that was not present at baseline at the 3-year follow-up (16.7% vs. 16%; HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.37).

The secondary outcomes indicated no significant difference in cardiovascular disease at 3 years (9.7% vs. 8.8%; HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.61) and no significant difference in death at 3 years (6.2% vs. 5.5%; HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.7). However, there was a significant decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate at 3 years (41.7 mL/min/1.73 m² vs. 42 mL/min/1.73 m²; treatment effect -1.14, 95% CI -1.92 to -0.37).

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^111LpQpW]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of portal hypertension, specifically in relation to the management of ascites, the EASL 2018 guidelines recommend initiating spironolactone. The starting dose is 100 mg/day PO, with stepwise increases every 72 hours to a maximum of 400 mg/day if there is no response to lower doses. This is advised for patients experiencing a first episode of grade 2 ascites.

### Blood pressure responses to small doses of amiloride and spironolactone in normotensive subjects [^115sSrNF]. Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is a principal site for sodium reabsorption and plays an important role in blood pressure (BP) regulation. Amiloride, a direct inhibitor of ENaC, has mild antihypertensive properties, suggesting that ENaC has minor influences on BP regulation. Counter-regulatory influences may prevent amiloride from effectively lowering BP. Aldosterone secretion increases in response to reduced sodium reabsorption following amiloride inhibition of ENaC. Since aldosterone upregulates ENaC function, we considered the possibility that secondary hyperaldosteronism mitigates amiloride's ability to reduce BP.

In the present study, BP responses to amiloride (5 mg per day), spironolactone (25 mg per day), the combination of both drugs, and placebo were studied in healthy normotensive subjects. Over four weeks of treatment, the combination of amiloride and spironolactone lowered systolic BP by 4.6 ± 1.6 (mean ± SEM) mm Hg (P = 0.022) and diastolic BP by 2.2 ± 1.2 mm Hg (P = 0.30), whereas either drug alone had no significant effect on BP.

These findings suggest that the two drugs, with their different modes of action — amiloride being a direct inhibitor of ENaC and spironolactone a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist — may complement each other's ability to inhibit ENaC, thereby reducing sodium reabsorption to a point where BP decreases. However, we cannot rule out that the BP response resulted from a greater dose of the total drug.

### Urine haptoglobin and haptoglobin-related protein predict response to spironolactone in patients with resistant hypertension [^113jnqMY]. Hypertension (2019). Low credibility.

Resistant hypertension prevalence is progressively increasing, and prolonged exposure to suboptimal blood pressure control results in higher cardiovascular risk and end-organ damage. Among various antihypertensive agents, spironolactone seems the most effective choice to treat resistant hypertension once triple therapy, including a diuretic, fails. However, success in blood pressure control is not guaranteed, adverse effects are significant, and no clinical tools are available to predict a patient's response.

Complementary to our previous study of resistant hypertension metabolism, we investigated urinary proteome changes with the potential capacity to predict response to spironolactone. Twenty-nine resistant hypertensives were included in a prospective study, where basal urine was collected before spironolactone administration. Patients were classified as responders or nonresponders in terms of blood pressure control. Protein quantitation was performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, with ELISA and target mass spectrometry analysis conducted for confirmation.

Among 3310 identified proteins, HP (haptoglobin) and HPR (haptoglobin-related protein) showed the most significant variations, with increased levels in nonresponders compared with responders before drug administration (variation rate, 5.98 and 7.83, respectively). Protein-coordinated responses were also evaluated by functional enrichment analysis, finding oxidative stress, chronic inflammatory response, blood coagulation, complement activation, and regulation of focal adhesions as physiopathological factors.

### Toprolxl [^113q15kd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Hypertension**:
	- **Adults**: The usual initial dosage is 25 to 100 mg daily in a single dose. Adjust the dosage at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. In general, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will be apparent after one week of therapy. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied.

	- **Pediatric hypertensive patients ≥ 6 years of age**: The recommended starting dose of Toprol-XL is 1 mg/kg once daily, but the maximum initial dose should not exceed 50 mg once daily. Adjust the dosage according to blood pressure response. Doses above 2 mg/kg (or in excess of 200 mg) once daily have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Toprol-XL has not been studied in pediatric patients < 6 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

- **Angina pectoris**:
	- Individualize the dosage of Toprol-XL. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, given in a single dose. Gradually increase the dosage at weekly intervals until an optimum clinical response has been obtained or there is a pronounced slowing of the heart rate. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1–2 weeks [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].
- **Heart failure**:
	- Dosage must be individualized and closely monitored during up-titration. Prior to initiation of Toprol-XL, stabilize the dose of other heart failure drug therapy. The recommended starting dose of Toprol-XL is 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYH.

### Incidence, predictors and clinical management of hyperkalaemia in new users of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists [^116osiB2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), such as spironolactone and eplerenone, are recommended by hypertension and heart failure clinical guidelines, due to their capacity to lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications and mortality as demonstrated in large randomized, placebo-controlled trials. However, MRAs may induce hyperkalaemia, and fear of hyperkalaemia likely limits their use.

Randomized controlled trials of MRAs report rates of hyperkalaemia that may not reflect the heterogeneous reality of clinical practice. 'Real-world' observational studies show suboptimal MRA use, dose titration, and poor clinical follow-up, which may increase hyperkalaemia risk. Management of hyperkalaemia is most often centered on eliminating modifiable causes, such as lowering dietary potassium (K+) intake and/or discontinuing or lowering the dose of hyperkalaemia-inducing medications. Some measures involve therapeutic compromises, as the cessation of MRAs deprives patients of their beneficial cardiovascular effects. Understanding the extent of this practice and identifying patients at risk of MRA discontinuation is clinically important. However, rates of MRA discontinuation after hyperkalaemia in real-world settings have been poorly quantified.

Studies with broader coverage, such as those derived from healthcare records, may be relevant to inform clinical practice. We constructed a large, contemporary, and region-representative cohort of unselected new users of MRA to estimate the 1-

Regarding medical management for hypertension, and specifically the choice of antihypertensives for subsequent therapy, the HC 2025 guidelines recommend considering the addition of spironolactone. This is advised if blood pressure remains above target despite a three-drug combination therapy consisting of an ACE inhibitor or ARB, a thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic, and a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, all at their maximally tolerated doses.

The 2024 ESC guidelines provide specific recommendations for the medical management of hypertension, focusing on the choice of antihypertensives and subsequent therapy. They suggest considering the initiation of eplerenone instead of spironolactone. Additionally, they recommend adding a β-blocker if it is not already indicated. If blood pressure is not controlled with a three-drug combination and spironolactone is ineffective or not tolerated, a centrally acting blood pressure-lowering medication, an α-blocker, hydralazine, or a potassium-sparing diuretic should be considered.

### Spironolactone reduces aortic stiffness in patients with resistant hypertension independent of blood pressure change [^114RJ7Ue]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Hypertension is the most prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke, and renal disease, and one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Using the new thresholds from the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, the prevalence of hypertension is 45.6% among US adults. A substantial proportion of these patients do not achieve a target goal of < 130/80 mm Hg. Various factors account for poor blood pressure (BP) control, including lack of treatment, nonadherence to recommended treatment, and resistance to guideline-directed medical therapy.

Resistant hypertension (RHTN) is defined as BP that remains above goal despite the concurrent use of three antihypertensive agents of different classes, one of which is ideally a diuretic, all prescribed at maximum recommended or maximally tolerated dosages. Among adults with treated hypertension, apparent RHTN occurs in 12% to 15% of population-based and 15% to 18% of clinic-based reports. Patients with hypertension have a high mortality rate, and aortic stiffness (AS) is an independent predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Moreover, the presence of AS predicts cardiovascular events in the general population, even in the absence of hypertension or cardiovascular disease.

### Endocrine and haemodynamic changes in resistant hypertension, and blood pressure responses to spironolactone or amiloride: the PATHWAY-2 mechanisms substudies [^115zV8Er]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

We propose that spironolactone, or amiloride if spironolactone is not tolerated, should be the first-line treatment for resistant hypertension. This should be in addition to background treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, a calcium channel blocker, and a diuretic, in patients with an eGFR greater than 45 mL/min/1.73 m² and serum potassium within the normal range. Among this cohort, there are likely many patients whose hypertension is caused by primary aldosteronism. We encourage a reconsideration of which diagnostic thresholds for primary aldosteronism are appropriate in patients with resistant hypertension, to facilitate recognition of potentially curable aldosterone-producing adenomas.

Understanding the mechanism of the blood pressure-lowering superiority of spironolactone in resistant hypertension would help delineate the pathophysiological basis of resistant hypertension. This understanding could provide a rationale for developing alternative treatment strategies for patients in whom spironolactone is poorly tolerated. The hypothesis underpinning PATHWAY-2 was that resistant hypertension is predominantly a sodium-retaining state (despite background treatment with thiazide-type diuretics) and that further diuretic (more correctly, natriuretic) treatment would be the most effective means of lowering blood pressure. PATHWAY-2 incorporated a series of prespecified hormonal and haemodynamic measurements designed to facilitate investigation of the pathophysiology.

### Eplerenone for hypertension [^116c6gYm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Eplerenone is an aldosterone receptor blocker that is chemically derived from spironolactone. In Canada, it is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy to reduce mortality for heart failure patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II systolic chronic heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. It is also used as adjunctive therapy for patients with heart failure following myocardial infarction. Additionally, it is indicated for the treatment of mild and moderate essential hypertension for patients who cannot be treated adequately with other agents. It is important to determine the clinical impact of all antihypertensive medications, including aldosterone antagonists, to support their continued use in essential hypertension. No previous systematic reviews have evaluated the effect of eplerenone on cardiovascular morbidity, mortality, and magnitude of blood pressure lowering in patients with hypertension.
- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of eplerenone monotherapy versus placebo for primary hypertension in adults. Outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events (fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction), cerebrovascular events (fatal or non-fatal strokes), adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers up to 3 March 2016. We handsearched references from retrieved studies to identify any studies missed in the initial search.

### Spironolactone versus sympathetic renal denervation to treat true resistant hypertension: Results from the DENERVHTA study - A randomized controlled trial [^1176JPZQ]. Journal of Hypertension (2016). High credibility.

The main finding of the DENERVHTA study is that in patients with true resistant hypertension, the addition of spironolactone to the baseline antihypertensive drug therapy reduced 24-hour systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 6 months more than renal denervation (RDN). Correspondingly, the 6-month 24-hour SBP control rate was significantly higher in the group with added spironolactone. The percentage of patients who needed to add or withdraw antihypertensive drugs was similar in both groups, and there were no differences regarding the occurrence of self-reported adverse events. As for office blood pressure (BP), the decrease in both SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from baseline to 6 months did not significantly differ between groups.

Initial studies showed a decrease of 26–28 mmHg in office SBP at 6 months after RDN in patients with resistant hypertension. However, these studies suffered from various shortcomings, including the absence of a control group with a different therapeutic strategy beyond the maintenance of basal drug treatment, or the lack of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) assessment, a more reliable tool to evaluate changes in BP than office BP. Furthermore, the well-designed Symplicity HTN-3 study, where patients were randomized to RDN or to a 'sham' procedure, failed to demonstrate between-group statistically significant differences in SBP decrease, neither when assessed by office BP nor by 24-hour ABP recording. Other studies have compared RDN and the 'sham' procedure to treat patients with resistant hypertension, and some trials have compared RDN versus adjusted antihypertensive drug treatment. Taken together, as shown in a recent meta-analysis, although these studies s

### Using renin activity to guide mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy in patients with low renin and hypertension [^116fW1hy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

- **Scatterplot analysis**: Figure 1 depicts the relationship between baseline aldosterone levels and the highest mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) dose, expressed in spironolactone equivalent, required to achieve unsuppressed renin levels. The correlation coefficient "r" is 0.52, indicating a moderate correlation.

Over the course of treatment, the mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased from 148.0 (SD 18.4) to 125.8 (SD 11.8) mm Hg, and the mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decreased from 81.2 (SD 17.5) to 71.6 (SD 11.6) mm Hg (P < 0.001 for both). The mean plasma renin activity (PRA) increased from 0.49 (SD 0.22) to 4.66 (SD 5.58) ng/ml/h (P < 0.001). Changes in individual patients' blood pressure and renin levels are shown in Figure 2. The mean aldosterone-to-renin ratio decreased from 55.0 (SD 63.2) to 22.7 (SD 38.0) (P < 0.001). A majority (24 out of 39; 61.5%) of patients had at least one baseline antihypertensive medication discontinued during MRA up-titration. Mean potassium levels increased from 4.18 (SD 0.48) to 4.66 (SD 0.41) mEq/dL (P < 0.001), while mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decreased from 71.9 (SD 19.9) to 61.9 (SD 21.1) ml/min/1.73 m² (P < 0.001).
- **Individual patient changes**: According to Figure 2, changes in systolic blood pressure (a), diastolic blood pressure (b), and plasma renin activity (c) are observed on an individual patient level.

In the subgroup of 32 patients (82.1%) who achieved unsuppressed PRA, mean systolic blood pressure decreased from 144.9 (SD 14.6) to 125.3 (SD 11.5) mm Hg, and mean DBP decreased from 78.8 (SD 14.9) to 71.4 (SD 11.1) mm Hg, respectively (P < 0.001 for both). The mean number of antihypertensive medications was reduced from 3.4 (SD 1.3) at baseline to 2.4 (SD 1.5) after achieving unsuppressed PRA (P < 0.001).

### Spironolactone for hypertension [^114tVnfi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). High credibility.

Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist, considered fourth-line therapy for hypertension in patients already treated with multiple medications.
- **Objectives**: Primary: To determine the effect of spironolactone on patient mortality and morbidity, and to quantify the magnitude of blood pressure-lowering effect of spironolactone monotherapy. Secondary: To determine the prevalence of adverse reactions observed with spironolactone monotherapy and to evaluate if there is a blood pressure-lowering dose response with spironolactone.
- **Search strategy**: We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (3rd Quarter 2009), MEDLINE (2005 - Sept. 2009), and EMBASE (2007 - Sept. 2009). References from retrieved studies were reviewed to identify any studies missed in the initial search. No language restrictions were applied.
- **Selection criteria**: We selected RCTs studying patients with primary hypertension. We excluded studies of patients with secondary or gestational hypertension, and studies where patients were receiving multiple antihypertensives.
- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently reviewed the search results for studies meeting our criteria. Three reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality using a standardized data extraction form. Data synthesis and analysis were performed using RevMan 5.
- **Main results**: Meta-analysis of the 5 crossover studies found a reduction in SBP of 20.09 mmHg (95% CI: 16.58–23.06, p < 0.00001) and a 6.75 mmHg (95% CI: 4.8–8.69, p < 0.00001) reduction in DBP. These results were statistically significant.

### Spironolactone versus sympathetic renal denervation to treat true resistant hypertension: Results from the DENERVHTA study - a randomized controlled trial [^111ygs61]. Journal of Hypertension (2016). High credibility.

After eligibility confirmation, all patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either receive sympathetic renal denervation (RDN) plus baseline antihypertensive treatment or spironolactone plus baseline antihypertensive treatment. The randomization sequence was generated by computer and stratified by centers using randomized blocks of small size and permutation of treatments within each block. For patients allocated to the spironolactone arm, the drug was started in a morning daily dosage of 25 mg with forced titration to 50 mg after 1 month. Physicians were encouraged to maintain study participants of both treatment groups on the initial antihypertensive drug regimen throughout the study. However, for safety reasons, the protocol provided the possibility of modifications when strictly required.

The open design of the study allowed us to realize that the decrease in blood pressure (BP) could be higher in the spironolactone group; therefore, we performed an interim analysis that confirmed this suspicion. Based on this analysis, the inclusion of patients was definitely discontinued earlier than planned. The results of patients randomized until that point were analyzed and are presented here.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, specifically in the management of resistant hypertension (HTN), ESC 2024 guidelines recommend considering adding spironolactone to the existing treatment regimen in patients with resistant HTN and uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) despite the use of first-line BP-lowering therapies. If spironolactone is not effective or tolerated, consider initiating eplerenone instead. Additionally, a β-blocker may be added if not already indicated, followed by a centrally acting BP-lowering medication, an α-blocker, hydralazine, or a potassium-sparing diuretic.

### Patiromer versus placebo to enable spironolactone use in patients with resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease (AMBER): Results in the pre-specified subgroup with heart failure [^114pf3GW]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). High credibility.

The study had a screening/run‐in period (up to 4 weeks), a double‐blind treatment period (12 weeks), and a follow‐up visit 2 weeks after the week 12 visit or early termination. The screening period, consisting of four visits separated by 4 to 10 days, ensured that patients were on stable doses of medication, had true resistant hypertension, and met all inclusion criteria. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive web response system at the final screening visit to receive patiromer 8.4 g once daily or a matching placebo, in addition to open‐label spironolactone 25 mg once daily and their baseline antihypertensive medications, starting on day 1 of randomized treatment. Visits during the double‐blind treatment period were weekly (weeks 1–4) and then biweekly (weeks 6–12), at which time blood pressure, body weight, blood samples for serum chemistry assessments, and adverse events (AEs) were collected.

At each visit after the initial screening visit, unattended AOBP measurements were recorded for each patient as described. Investigators were instructed to keep baseline antihypertensive medications constant except for AE‐related reasons, where changes to baseline medications could be justified.

### US hypertension management guidelines: A review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^114yMY2E]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide-type diuretic, CCB, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or ARB. For the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB. In individuals aged ≥ 18 years with CKD, initial (or add-on) antihypertensive treatment should include an ACEI or ARB to improve kidney outcomes. If the goal BP is not reached within 1 month of treatment, the dose of the initial drug should be increased or a second drug added. If the goal BP cannot be achieved with two drugs, a third drug should be added and titrated. Referral to a hypertension specialist is recommended for patients who cannot attain their goal BP.
- **Basis of recommendations**: In contrast to treatment targets, most professional societies agree on the class of antihypertensives to use for specific comorbid disease categories. For the nonblack population without diabetes, all society recommendations include thiazide diuretics, CCBs, ACEIs, and ARBs as first-line therapies. An important consideration with thiazide diuretics is that the strength of individual drugs within the class varies in BP-lowering effects.

A Cochrane Review of over 60 RCTs for thiazide monotherapy versus placebo in adults with primary hypertension (BP 140 to < 160/90 to < 100 mm Hg) examined the BP effects of six different thiazide diuretics. Hydrochlorothiazide, unlike the other thiazide medications studied, demonstrated a dose-dependent effect.

### Zestril [^115B51dd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Zestril is used for treating hypertension.

- **Hypertension (including use with diuretics)**: The recommended initial dose for adults is 10 mg once a day. Dosage should be adjusted based on blood pressure response, typically ranging from 20 mg to 40 mg per day in a single dose. Although doses up to 80 mg have been used, they do not seem to provide a greater effect. If Zestril alone does not control blood pressure, a low dose of a diuretic, such as hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg, might be added. After adding a diuretic, it may be possible to reduce the dose of Zestril. For adult patients with hypertension who are also taking diuretics, the recommended starting dose is 5 mg once per day.
- **Pediatric hypertension (ages 6 and older)**: For pediatric patients with a glomerular filtration rate greater than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², the recommended starting dose is 0.07 mg per kg once daily, up to a maximum of 5 mg. Dosage adjustments should be made according to the blood pressure response, with a maximum of 0.61 mg per kg, up to 40 mg, once daily. Doses above 0.61 mg per kg or in excess of 40 mg have not been studied in pediatric patients. Zestril is not recommended for pediatric patients younger than 6 years or those with a glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m².
- **Heart failure**: For systolic heart failure, when used with diuretics and usually digitalis as adjunctive therapy, the recommended starting dose of Zestril is 5 mg once daily. The starting dose is recommended for these patients especially with hyponatremia.

### Use and side-effect profile of spironolactone in a private cardiologist's practice [^113THZRX]. Clinical Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The beneficial effects of spironolactone on the treatment of cardiovascular diseases are well known, but translating these benefits into private practice can be challenging due to the drug's side-effect profile.
- **Hypothesis**: When patients are monitored over the long term, spironolactone can be used safely with an acceptable side-effect profile.
- **Methods**: We retrospectively studied 762 patients taking spironolactone over a seven-year period in a cardiologist's referral-based practice, monitoring them for side effects from the medication.
- **Results**: Data were available on 762 patients. The average age of our patients when starting the medication was 67.2 ± 0.5 years. Of these, 585 (76.8%) were treated for heart failure and 155 (20.3%) for hypertension. An average dose of 38.4 ± 1.4 mg of spironolactone was used. Of the 762 patients, 81 (10.6%) experienced side effects while using the medication; 40 had hyperkalemia (5.3%), 14 had gynecomastia (1.8%), and 15 had gastritis (2%). Among the patients with hyperkalemia, average creatinine clearance decreased from 64.6 ± 5.8 ml/min at therapy start to 50.3 ± 5.5 ml/min at the onset of side effects.
- **Conclusion**: Spironolactone can be used with an acceptable side-effect profile if patients are monitored long term while receiving the medication.

### The spironolactone initiation registry randomized interventional trial in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (SPIRRIT-HFpEF): Rationale and design [^112Qh78D]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). High credibility.

Patients are randomized 1:1 to open-label MRA (either spironolactone or eplerenone) plus usual care versus usual care alone. Patients randomized to MRA receive a prescription to be filled and paid for out of pocket. In both Sweden and the US, spironolactone can be obtained for approximately 10 US cents per day. In Sweden, patients pay out-of-pocket for prescription medications up to an annual maximum of approximately 250 Euro, after which additional medication costs are covered by the government.

Spironolactone is more potent than eplerenone, but the initial dose in guidelines and clinical practice is generally 25 mg/day for both drugs and is the dose recommended in SPIRRIT-HFpEF. A dose of 25 mg every other day or 25 mg, half tablet every day, may be prescribed at investigator discretion for patients judged to be at higher risk of hyperkalemia or kidney dysfunction. Patients who at baseline are known not to tolerate spironolactone due to gynecomastia or who prefer eplerenone will be prescribed eplerenone. Eplerenone is relatively inexpensive, although more expensive than spironolactone. Spironolactone (or eplerenone) is recommended to be increased to a target dose of 50 mg daily if tolerated.

Most previous RRCTs in Sweden have involved one-time interventions (i.e. not chronic therapy) without the need for monitoring during follow-up. Spironolactone is familiar to all clinicians but is associated with a risk of hyperkalemia and worsening kidney function. Therefore, there are no required in-person follow-up visits in the trial.
