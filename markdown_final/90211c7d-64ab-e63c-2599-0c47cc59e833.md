## Question

What are the common causes of Cheilitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common causes of cheilitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define cheilitis and its major etiologic buckets. Then, I should verify the most prevalent causes within each category and quantify them where possible. Next, I will examine less common but important entities that must not be missed. Finally, I will synthesize a practical hierarchy of common causes and note key diagnostic steps and exceptions, making sure I anchor each point to the best available evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and framework so I don't jump to conclusions. Cheilitis is inflammation of the vermilion lip and can be categorized as exogenous (contact, irritant, allergic, infectious, actinic), endogenous (systemic, inflammatory, nutritional, medication-related), or idiopathic, which aligns with contemporary reviews and practice parameters, and I should keep in mind that some cases are multifactorial or overlap categories.

> I will now examine contact dermatitis because it is repeatedly cited as a leading cause. Wait, let me verify the proportions. In a tertiary cohort of 202 patients with eczematous cheilitis, endogenous causes predominated at 53%, allergic contact dermatitis accounted for 34%, and irritant contact dermatitis for 5.4%, with females comprising 90% of cases, which suggests that while endogenous atopic cheilitis is common, allergic contact cheilitis is a major contributor in patch-test cohorts and is often linked to lip cosmetics and toothpaste ingredients such as fragrances, balsam of Peru, and nickel, with pediatric data showing similar fragrance and preservative triggers and benefit from avoidance strategies [^115yHhuv] [^113imDfE] [^112CZffG] [^111NStVB].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of actinic cheilitis because it is frequently encountered in fair-skinned individuals with sun exposure. Actinic cheilitis is a premalignant keratosis of the lower lip vermilion with dysplasia on histology and a meaningful risk of progression to squamous cell carcinoma, and it is commonly managed with vermilionectomy, laser, photodynamic therapy, or topical 5-fluorouracil, with ablative laser vermilionectomy considered a primary option for extensive disease in oncology guidelines, so I need to ensure I flag this as both common and high risk in the right population [^112mDMAw] [^112mDMAw] [^112mDMAw].

> Next, I should review infectious etiologies, especially Candida and angular cheilitis. Angular cheilitis is commonly due to Candida albicans with or without Staphylococcus aureus, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression, diabetes, denture use, or xerostomia, and is well described in older adults and immunocompromised hosts; HSV can also cause cheilitis, though recurrent herpes labialis is more often perioral rather than true vermilion-limited disease, so I need to be precise about distribution and risk factors when attributing causality [^1121R8mG] [^116a3bFi] [^114V8hXG].

> Let me consider granulomatous cheilitis and orofacial granulomatosis, because missing systemic disease here would be a mistake. Granulomatous cheilitis presents with persistent painless lip swelling and noncaseating granulomas on biopsy, and it is a diagnosis of exclusion that requires ruling out Crohn's disease and sarcoidosis; case series emphasize colonoscopy and chest imaging in appropriate patients, and emerging reports suggest JAK inhibition may help refractory cases, so I should confirm that any nonresolving macrocheilia prompts a granulomatous workup [^113Jn3EM] [^113RF85Z] [^115RBeRo].

> I need to check nutritional deficiencies next, especially riboflavin and iron, because they are classic and treatable. Riboflavin deficiency produces angular cheilitis with a magenta tongue and is a recognized feature after bariatric surgery or malnutrition, while iron deficiency anemia is linked to angular cheilitis in Plummer-Vinson syndrome; zinc and other B vitamins can also contribute, so dietary history and targeted labs are prudent when the clinical picture fits [^113t2BVQ] [^111UCxva] [^111pv246].

> But wait, what if the cheilitis is medication-induced. Isotretinoin is notorious for dose-related cheilitis and can predispose to secondary infections or even lip abscesses, and other drugs such as acitretin, EGFR inhibitors, and several chemotherapeutics also cause cheilitis; I should double-check the medication list and counsel on infection risk and lip care during isotretinoin therapy [^114ev4XN] [^111QKHzm] [^111pv246].

> Let me reconsider exfoliative or factitial cheilitis, because mislabeling it as "just dryness" delays care. Artifactual pseudo-cheilitis presents with thick white scale, the "protrusion sign", and significant psychosocial distress; it is often refractory to standard anti-inflammatory therapy and improves with behavioral strategies and psychiatric support, so I should screen for stress, body-focused repetitive behaviors, and comorbid anxiety or depression when the story fits [^116eo5Jb] [^117Qz4KG].

> I should confirm systemic inflammatory associations so I don't miss red flags. Oral lichen planus and lupus can involve the lips and may mimic or coexist with contact dermatitis, and orofacial Crohn's disease can present with lip swelling, cobblestoning, or deep ulcers; in children, eruptive lingual papillitis can include angular cheilitis and intrafamilial spread, reminding me to ask about household contacts and recent viral prodromes [^1137Bkps] [^112hknLa] [^116aWnVg].

> Next, I should review less common but important entities so I don't anchor prematurely. Cheilitis glandularis is rare, often in older men with photodamage, and carries a risk of squamous cell carcinoma; plasma cell cheilitis is a diagnosis of exclusion with a dense plasma cell infiltrate and may respond to intralesional steroids; actinic prurigo can be lip-limited and histologically show follicular cheilitis; and drug-induced angular cheilitis has been reported with continuous glucagon infusion, so I need to keep an open mind when the history is atypical [^116NZmP8] [^111Ru2Ev] [^112f18BT] [^111RkjG7].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic approach so my hierarchy translates into action. For chronic or recurrent cheilitis, patch testing is the gold standard to identify allergic contactants, and I should also obtain a careful history of lip products, oral care items, occupational exposures, and habits like lip licking; when macrocheilia or granulomas are present, I should pursue biopsy and targeted evaluation for Crohn's and sarcoidosis; for suspected actinic cheilitis, biopsy helps grade dysplasia and guide therapy; and for refractory or atypical cases, I should reconsider nutritional, infectious, medication, and psychosocial contributors rather than escalating steroids indefinitely [^116N3kRh] [^113Jn3EM] [^116ka7L4].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that my hierarchy reflects both frequency and clinical impact. The most common causes of cheilitis are contact dermatitis (allergic and irritant), actinic cheilitis in sun-exposed patients, infectious angular cheilitis (Candida ± Staphylococcus), atopic or endogenous eczematous cheilitis, medication-induced cheilitis (notably isotretinoin and other retinoids), granulomatous cheilitis/orofacial granulomatosis (including Crohn's-associated), and nutritional deficiencies (riboflavin, iron, zinc), with exfoliative or artifactual cheilitis representing a distinct psychodermatologic subset that is not rare in anxious patients; less common but important entities include cheilitis glandularis, plasma cell cheilitis, actinic prurigo, and systemic inflammatory diseases such as lichen planus and lupus, so I need to tailor the workup to duration, morphology, risk factors, and response to initial measures [^111pv246] [^115yHhuv] [^112mDMAw] [^1121R8mG] [^114ev4XN] [^113Jn3EM] [^113t2BVQ] [^111UCxva] [^116eo5Jb].

---

Cheilitis has a broad differential, but the **most common causes** are **contact dermatitis** (allergic or irritant) [^113imDfE], **angular cheilitis** (Candida ± Staphylococcus) [^1121R8mG], and **actinic cheilitis** (sun damage) [^112mDMAw]. Other frequent contributors include atopic dermatitis [^111iTfLx], medications (notably isotretinoin [^114ev4XN] and retinoids [^115vxfYo]), infections (HSV [^114V8hXG], syphilis, HIV) [^111pv246], and nutritional deficiencies (iron, B2, B12, zinc) [^111pv246]. Less common but important causes are granulomatous cheilitis (including Crohn's) [^113Jn3EM], actinic prurigo [^112f18BT], and exfoliative cheilitis (often psychogenic) [^116eo5Jb]. Evaluation should include history, exam, and targeted testing (patch testing, cultures, labs, biopsy) to identify the cause and guide therapy [^116N3kRh].

---

## Contact dermatitis

Contact dermatitis is the **most common cause of cheilitis**, accounting for a large proportion of cases [^115yHhuv]. It can be either allergic or irritant in nature [^113imHK6].

- **Allergic contact cheilitis**: Common allergens include fragrances (e.g. balsam of Peru), preservatives, flavorings, lipsticks, toothpaste, and dental materials [^113imHK6] [^112CZffG]. Patch testing is essential for identifying specific allergens [^116N3kRh].

- **Irritant contact cheilitis**: Caused by repeated exposure to irritants such as saliva (lip licking), harsh weather conditions, or acidic foods [^113imHK6].

---

## Angular cheilitis

Angular cheilitis, also known as perleche, is characterized by inflammation and fissuring at the corners of the mouth. It is commonly associated with **Candida albicans** infection, often in conjunction with Staphylococcus aureus [^1121R8mG]. Predisposing factors include immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, and denture use [^1121R8mG].

---

## Actinic cheilitis

Actinic cheilitis is a **premalignant condition** caused by chronic sun exposure, primarily affecting the lower lip [^112mDMAw]. It presents as rough, scaly, or white patches on the vermilion border and carries a risk of progression to squamous cell carcinoma [^116ka7L4].

---

## Infectious causes

Several infectious agents can cause cheilitis, including:

- **Herpes simplex virus (HSV)**: Presents as recurrent vesicular lesions on the lips (herpes labialis) [^114V8hXG].

- **Syphilis**: Secondary syphilis can cause mucous patches or fissures on the lips.

- **Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)**: Associated with chronic cheilitis due to immunosuppression and opportunistic infections [^111pv246].

---

## Nutritional deficiencies

Nutritional deficiencies are a significant cause of cheilitis, particularly angular cheilitis. Common deficiencies include **iron deficiency anemia**, which causes angular cheilitis along with glossitis and koilonychia, and **vitamin B2 (riboflavin) deficiency**, which produces angular cheilitis, glossitis, and seborrheic dermatitis. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also cause cheilitis, often alongside oral mucosal changes.

---

## Medications

Certain medications can induce cheilitis as a side effect. Notably, **isotretinoin** frequently causes cheilitis due to its drying and keratolytic effects [^114ev4XN], and **retinoids** (acitretin, etretinate) commonly produce cheilitis as part of their mucocutaneous toxicity profile [^115vxfYo].

---

## Granulomatous cheilitis

Granulomatous cheilitis is a rare, chronic inflammatory condition characterized by non-caseating granulomas. It may be idiopathic or associated with systemic diseases such as **Crohn's disease** or sarcoidosis [^113Jn3EM].

---

## Actinic prurigo

Actinic prurigo is a chronic photodermatitis that often involves the lips, causing pruritic, hyperpigmented, and fissured lesions. It is more common in individuals with darker skin types and those with indigenous ancestry [^112f18BT].

---

## Exfoliative cheilitis

Exfoliative cheilitis is characterized by chronic scaling and peeling of the lips, often associated with psychological factors such as anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder. It may also be linked to repetitive lip picking or licking behaviors [^116eo5Jb].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A thorough diagnostic approach is essential to identify the underlying cause of cheilitis. This includes a detailed history (exposures, habits, medications, systemic symptoms), a focused physical examination (morphology, distribution, associated lesions), and targeted testing — **patch testing** for suspected allergic contact dermatitis [^116N3kRh], cultures for suspected infections, laboratory tests for nutritional deficiencies, and biopsy for granulomatous or neoplastic conditions [^113Jn3EM].

---

Cheilitis has diverse causes, but **contact dermatitis, angular cheilitis, and actinic cheilitis** are the most common. A structured evaluation — history, exam, and targeted tests — enables accurate diagnosis and management.

Introduction

We report a case of a 66-year-old woman with the simultaneous onset of oral lichen planus (OLP) and granulomatous cheilitis (GC). Both diseases are relatively rare, and further investigation for systemic or environmental causes of disease is warranted in new patients with either OLP or GC. This case and reports of a so-called lichenoid and granulomatous dermatitis in the literature beg the question, is there some unifying etiologic explanation for OLP and GC?

### Granulomatous cheilitis: differential diagnosis in patients with macrocheilia [^113RF85Z]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Macrocheilia, or lip enlargement, has a varied aetiology, but granulomatous conditions, both infective and non-infective, comprise a significant proportion of patients. Diagnosis starts with clinical investigations while histological examination is required for a definitive diagnosis. In the case presented, a young man presented with painless swelling of upper lip over the past 3months. Given the clinical history and biopsy results, the diagnosis of granulomatous cheilitis was made which is considered a rare manifestation of metastatic Crohn's disease. Treatment options remain debated, though in the situation presented a conservative approach was adopted, consisting of antibiotics and corticosteroid therapy, which resulted in significant remission in lip swelling without recurrence after a 3-month follow-up.

### Contact dermatitis: a practice parameter-update 2015 [^1177mrsV]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Medium credibility.

Executive summary — common sites, hand eczema, facial dermatitis, and cheilitis — The latest NACDG lists the top 3 most common body locations of contact dermatitis as scattered and/or generalized distribution, the hands, and the face, and attention should be given to specific anatomical sites, particularly the eyelids, neck, scalp, axillae, lower extremities, and anogenital area. Facial ACD may present as a generalized facial eruption in specific regions such as the forehead, periorbital, or perioral areas, and sensitizers in commercial facial products that are in direct skin contact are the most common causes of facial ACD. Patients presenting with acute or chronic hand eczema should undergo patch testing, and it is strongly recommended to evaluate all patients with chronic hand eczema for ACD by obtaining a detailed history of contact allergy and performing patch testing. Acute or chronic inflammation of the lips manifested as eczematous cheilitis can be characterized by itching, burning, redness, edema, and fissuring, and Fragrance mix (FM), balsam of Peru (BOP, Myroxylon pereirae), and nickel are the most common positive allergens on PT.

Discussion

The demographics, treatment regimens, and outcomes of these 5 cases are detailed in Table I. All patients presented with thick white scales on the upper and lower lips, with minimal erosion of the underlying tissue but some variety of bacterial and fungal colonization. The mean duration of symptoms was 1.6 years (range, 8 months-3 years), and the patients had seen multiple providers before presenting to us. The lesions commonly started during stressful periods, although 4 of the 5 patients denied a known initial insult. Three patients reported past psychiatric illness, a risk factor for variants of EC. The mean age of onset was 26.2 years, and there was a female predominance, consistent with reports of similar cases.

Table I
Patient demographics and treatment regimens

Different subtypes of EC may present with overlapping findings. EC most commonly occurs due to chronically inflamed lips and cutaneous inflammatory conditions, but it may also be the result of infection or medications. EC secondary to conscious extensive manipulation typically leads to minimal impairment of patients' lives, and these patients freely admit to manipulation of the lips. Patients with "factitial cheilitis" are often aware of, but unfazed by, their lip condition. It is theorized that these patients participate in self-injurious behaviors in response to psychosocial stressors and are unconcerned about their condition, leading to low treatment adherence.

In this report, we characterize a distinct form of EC that may occur because of repeated subconscious trauma to the lips during times of stress, causing irritation and hyperkeratosis. Keratin scale then accumulates and is exacerbated by fear of touching the lips to avoid worsening symptoms. Subsequent stressors then lead to additional subconscious trauma, perpetuating this cycle. Microbial colonization may exacerbate this condition, explaining the partial improvement seen with antibiotics and antifungals. Patients are excessively concerned with their appearance and experience significant impairment of daily living, in contrast to patients with other forms of EC, and demonstrate characteristic puckering of the lips (Fig 2 and Supplementary Figs 1 to 3). This puckering has been termed the "protrusion sign" by Nico et alBecause of the unique etiology and absence of underlying disease, we suggest that the term "artifactual pseudo-cheilitis" be used for this variant of EC.

### Artifactual pseudo-cheilitis: a case series of an underreported condition [^117Qz4KG]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Exfoliative cheilitis (EC) is a labial disorder affecting the vermillion lip and characterized by thick keratin scale followed by subsequent desquamation.EC is typically a consequence of chronically inflamed lips due to an underlying condition, but it may also occur in the absence of primary labial disease following a psychosocial stressor. Although the terms "factitial cheilitis" and "artifactual cheilitis" have been used interchangeably, the artifactual variant appears to be distinct due to the intense distress that is not present in the factitial variant. Because artifactual cheilitis is underreported in the literature and there are few guidelines on diagnosis and treatment, patients often undergo extensive and unnecessary diagnostic workup.

We report a case series of 5 patients with artifactual EC and review the relevant literature. This condition can be difficult to diagnose and may be refractory to treatment, emphasizing the need to raise awareness and improve outcomes through increased early recognition, reduction in unnecessary diagnostic procedures, and increased multidisciplinary collaboration.

### New-onset oral lichen planus and granulomatous cheilitis in a 66-year-old woman [^117CuVM4]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

OLP is an inflammatory condition, ranging from asymptomatic lesions to severe, painful ulcers. OLP usually presents in middle age with slight female predominance and can affect the buccal mucosa, gingiva, tongue, and vermillion border of the lip. Idiopathic OLP is believed to be a T- cell–mediated response toward an unknown antigen and may represent an autoimmune reaction. Spontaneous remission is rare, and therapy is directed toward dampening the inflammatory response using corticosteroids or immune modulators. Patients may be refractory to treatment, and although reduction in symptoms can be achieved, no definitive cure has been identified. OLP carries a significant risk for transformation into squamous cell carcinoma, requiring surveillance for malignant changes. On examination, classic OLP is often indistinguishable from oral lichenoid tissue reactions (OLTR), highlighting the importance of thorough history taking. OLTR may be caused by systemic drug effects, localized contact reactions, or graft-versus-host disease. Adding to the diagnostic challenge, idiopathic OLP and OLTR have an identical histologic appearance that includes liquefactive changes of the basal keratinocytes with a bandlike array of activated T lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Histology isn't the diagnostic gold standard for OLP, and many infectious and immune-mediated diseases can induce oral lichenoid changes that mimic OLP. Oral lichenoid contact reactions (OLCR) likely represent a delayed hypersensitivity reaction and removal of the allergen can lead to complete resolution. Given the similarities, oral lichenoid contact reactions can be misdiagnosed as OLP, leading to improper disease management. This patient presented with a rare and unique set of findings. The simultaneous onset of OLP and GC in an otherwise healthy woman may very well indicate a common immunologic or inflammatory etiology for 2 uncommon diseases of the oral cavity.

### Oral candidiasis and angular cheilitis [^1121R8mG]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Candidiasis, an often encountered oral disease, has been increasing in frequency. Most commonly caused by the overgrowth of Candida albicans, oral candidiasis can be divided into several categories including acute and chronic forms, and angular cheilitis. Risk factors for the development of oral candidiasis include immunosuppression, wearing of dentures, pharmacotherapeutics, smoking, infancy and old age, endocrine dysfunction, and decreased salivation. Oral candidiasis may be asymptomatic. More frequently, however, it is physically uncomfortable, and the patient may complain of burning mouth, dysgeusia, dysphagia, anorexia, and weight loss, leading to nutritional deficiency and impaired quality of life. A plethora of antifungal treatments are available. The overall prognosis of oral candidiasis is good, and rarely is the condition life threatening with invasive or recalcitrant disease.

### Prevalence and causative allergens of contact cheilitis in Thailand [^112CZffG]. Contact Dermatitis (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cheilitis is an inflammatory condition of the lips. Its causes can be exogenous (irritants, allergens), endogenous (atopic dermatitis, systemic disorders) or unknown.

Objectives

To determine the prevalence of allergic contact cheilitis (ACC), its risk factors, and common allergens in patients with cheilitis at a Thai university-based tertiary care hospital.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients with cheilitis referred for patch testing between January 2007 and December 2021.

Results

Among 5366 patients referred for patch testing, 410 (7.6%) had cheilitis. ACC was diagnosed in 32% of the cheilitis patients. Compared to non-ACC cases, the patients with ACC were more likely to be young and female and have a disease duration of < 3months, no underlying disease and a white-collar job (p-value < 0.05). The most common contact allergens were patient's products (73.3%), nickel sulfate (29.8%), potassium dichromate (14.5%), castor oil (14.3%) and benzalkonium chloride (13.0%). Lip cosmetics and toothpastes were major ACC sources.

Conclusions

ACC should be considered in cheilitis patients, especially in patients with specific risk factors. Castor oil is an emerging allergen. Patch testing using commercial allergen series and patients' own products is crucial for identifying causative agents. The development of a specific cheilitis series is warranted.

### Actinic prurigo cheilitis: a clinicopathologic review of 75 cases [^112f18BT]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2016). Low credibility.

Actinic prurigo (AP) is a chronic idiopathic photodermatosis that primarily affects American Indians in the United States and Mestizos in Latin American countries. Clinically, the onset of the disease is usually in the first decade of life but may appear initially in adult life, and it is characterized by symmetric involvement of sun-exposed areas of the skin, particularly areas of the face, resulting in polymorphic erythematous papules, macules, and plaques in different stages of evolution. Lower lip involvement includes swelling, scaling, fissures, hyperpigmentation, and ulcerations of the vermilion border. and in some cases could represent the only manifestation of the disease. The histopathologic features of AP have been studied; however, there is a controversy regarding whether AP cheilitis has distinct histopathologic features that could allow accurate separation from other specific and nonspecific forms of cheilitis. The diagnosis can be challenging, mainly when lip lesions are the only manifestation of the disease. In this study, the authors investigate the clinicopathologic features of 75 cases of AP cheilitis to provide further criteria for its diagnosis and classification. All 75 patients presented with lip lesions. Thirty-three cases were diagnosed as AP cheilitis with cutaneous lesions and 42 cases were diagnosed as AP cheilitis without cutaneous lesions (only lip lesions). Histologically, of the 33 cases with AP cheilitis with cutaneous lesions, 17 (52%) cases showed follicular cheilitis, and of the 42 cases that had only lip lesions, 18 (43%) cases showed follicular cheilitis. Histologically, AP cheilitis can present as follicular cheilitis; thus, supporting the diagnosis. Also, our findings confirm that lip lesions can present as the only manifestation of the disease, showing typical histological and clinical features. This form of cheilitis has not being well described in the dermatologic and dermatopathologic literature.

### Plasma-cell cheilitis: successful treatment with intralesional injections of corticosteroids [^111Ru2Ev]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Plasma-cell cheilitis is a rare inflammatory disorder of the lip characterized histologically by a band-like infiltrate of plasma cells in the upper dermis. It is considered an oral counterpart of plasma-cell balanitis. Clinically, it presents as a circumscribed, flat to slightly raised, eroded area of the lip. The cause of plasma-cell cheilitis is unknown, and the treatment is often disappointing. We describe a 55-year-old woman who had a long-lasting painful, swollen, and eroded area on her lips, which responded poorly to various topical treatments. Biopsy showed a band-like infiltrate composed mainly of mature plasma cells in the dermis. A diagnosis of plasma-cell cheilitis was made after excluding contact dermatitis, lichen planus, bacterial, fungal and spirochaete infections, and an extramedullary plasmacytoma. Dramatic improvements were observed after intralesional injections of corticosteroids. The lesion cleared up after two treatments, and there has been no recurrence in 1 year of follow-up.

### White oral lesions, actinic cheilitis, and leukoplakia: confusions in terminology and definition: facts and controversies [^115RY7zo]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Many diseases affecting the cutaneous tissues may incur observable changes to the mucosal tissues of the oral cavity. As a consequence, the dermatologist should always assess the oral mucosal tissues of their patients as a matter of routine. Equivocal lesions should be referred to a dentist for further assessment. Although most encountered white oral lesions are innocuous, some potentially serious conditions may mimic an innocuous white lesion. As examples, oral lichen planus may cause significant patient discomfort and is associated with some degree of increased malignant risk, whereas actinic cheilitis and leukoplakia have a confirmed association with an increased malignant risk. This contribution reviews the characteristics and management strategies for some of the more common white oral lesions that the dermatologist may observe in clinical practice.

### An uncommon case of lip swelling: granulomatous cheilitis associated with Crohn's disease [^116ryFHC]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Medium credibility.

Unbeknownst to most otolaryngologists, there is quite a range of oral manifestations which commonly manifest in the context of inflammatory bowel disease. As providers who will encounter such patients in consultation it is beneficial to be aware of that association. Lip swelling (granulomatous cheilitis) is just one such presentation, which is often otherwise mistaken for angioneurotic edema and can lead to unwarranted testing and misdirected treatment. We present such a case to highlight the educational value of this patient encounter.

### Contact dermatitis: a practice parameter-update 2015 [^113imDfE]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Medium credibility.

Lip and perioral dermatitis (Summary Statement 7) — "Evaluate patients presenting with lip dermatitis (cheilitis) and perioral dermatitis for both irritant and allergic causes of contact dermatitis. [Strength of Recommendation: Moderate; C Evidence]". "Eczematous cheilitis is an acute or chronic inflammation of the lips and is characterized by itching, burning, redness, edema, and fissuring" and "is most commonly caused by physical (eg, cold, dryness, wind) or chemical irritants (saliva, lip cosmetics, or other oral products)". Epidemiology includes that "in a series of more than 10,000 patients reported by the NACDG, 2% of patients presented with lip dermatitis and 85% of these cases were women". Diagnostic yield data indicate that "history combined with patch testing was able to confirm ACC in only 34% to 38% of patients", with common positive allergens "FM, BOP, and nickel", and that "relevant positive PT to allergens that were not part of the NACDG patch test series have been identified in 36% of patients with ACC".

### Allergic contact cheilitis in children and improvement with patch testing [^117Mk5iH]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric cheilitis can be a debilitating condition for the child and parents. Patch testing can help isolate allergens to avoid. Here we describe a 2-year-old boy with allergic contact cheilitis improving remarkably after prudent avoidance of contactants and food avoidance.

### Allergic contact cheilitis in children and improvement with patch testing [^111NStVB]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Cheilitis is an inflammatory disorder of the vermilion. Eczematous cheilitis may be endogenous or exogenous. Exogenous causes are from contact dermatitis, which can either be irritant contact cheilitis or allergic contact cheilitis (ACC). If a child has a personal or family history of atopy, the cheilitis is usually thought to be caused by atopic cheilitis. There are few reports on the benefits of patch testing for cheilitis in children compared with patch testing in atopic dermatitis.

Fragrance mix, and balsam of peruare common allergens in both adults and children with ACC. Fifty percent of the children and adolescents patch tested for oral or perioral symptoms showed relevant positive results to contactants such as fragrances, gentamicin, lanolin, dodecyl gallate, and benzoyl peroxide. A study from Italy, which included adults, showed that the common relevant allergens causing ACC were nickel (14%), fragrance mix (14%), balsam of peru (11%), and euxyl K400 (11%). The relevance of nickel in ACC is unclear, but the metal can be found occasionally in cosmetics and canned foods. Another study from Singapore, also including adults, showed that patients' own cosmetics (34%), ricinoleic acid (22%), toothpastes (16%), fragrance mix (12%), and balsam of peru (4%) were common causes of ACC.

According to the Pediatric Contact Dermatitis Registry data from 2015 to 2016, the top 10 allergens for children (0–5 years old) include nickel (42%), balsam of peru (19%), fragrance mix I (18%), neomycin (17%), formaldehyde (15%), cocamidopropyl betaine (15%), cobalt dichloride (14%), MCI/MI (12%), propylene glycol (9%), bacitracin, bronopol, and wool alcohols (8%). These results significantly overlap those reported by a recent study of the top 10 pediatric allergens in the literature. The authors propose that up to 30% of pediatric patients with allergic contact dermatitis could benefit from avoiding the top 10 allergens, known as the pre-emptive avoidance strategy.

### Deep suppurative glandular cheilitis: a pediatric case report [^112iYt4q]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glandular cheilitis (GC) is an extremely rare condition affecting minor salivary glands of the lips, mostly described in adult men, whose pathogenesis and ideal management remain elusive. Three types of GC are recognized as GC simplex, superficial suppurative, and deep suppurative, with only few case reports in literature of the latter form.

Here, we report a case of deep suppurative GC occurred in a female pediatric patient, refractory to conservative measures and successfully treated with vermilionectomy without recurrences at 3-year follow-up.

### Epidemiology of eczematous cheilitis at a tertiary dermatological referral centre in Singapore [^115yHhuv]. Contact Dermatitis (2000). Low credibility.

In a retrospective epidemiologic study of 202 patients with eczematous cheilitis attending a patch test clinic, females (182 (90%)) predominated over males (20 (10%)). The mean age of our patients was 30.9 years. There was no significant difference between the mean age of females (31 years) presenting with cheilitis compared to males (29 years). Endogenous cheilitis (53%) was the commonest diagnosis, followed by allergic contact dermatitis (34%) and irritant contact dermatitis (5.4%). A personal history of atopy was recorded in 33%. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of atopy between the sexes or among the diagnoses. The mean duration of cheilitis was 16.4 months. The duration was significantly longer in males (29 months) than in females (15 months) (p = 0.004). The mean number of positive patch test reaction in patients with allergic contact cheilitis (2.8) was significantly higher than in those with irritant contact cheilitis (0.2) (p = 0.012) or endogenous cheilitis (0.5) (p = 0.00). The commonest cause of allergic contact cheilitis were lip cosmetics, including lipsticks and lipbalms, followed by toothpastes. The commonest cause of irritant contact cheilitis was lip-licking, lipsticks and medication. In 81/202 (40%) patients, 1 or more causes of contact cheilitis could be ascertained. In females, lip cosmetics were the commonest cause, accounting for 54% (44/81) of cases. Toothpastes accounted for 21% (17/81), followed by topical medication 7% (6/81). For males, toothpastes were the commonest cause of allergic contact cheilitis. Ricinoleic acid and the patient's own lip preparations were the commonest relevant contact allergens.

Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) evaluation — consider ACD in the differential diagnosis of patients with chronic eczematous or noneczematous dermatitis [Strength of Recommendation: Strong; C Evidence]. In patients suspected of ACD, patch testing is the gold standard to confirm the diagnosis [Strength of Recommendation: Strong; C Evidence]. In addition to personal products used by a patient suspected of ACD, review the home and workplace for other sources of contact allergens [Strength of Recommendation: Moderate; D Evidence]. Evaluate patients for both irritant and allergic causes, especially in those presenting with hand dermatitis [Strength of Recommendation: Strong; C Evidence]. Allergic contact dermatitis should be suspected and evaluated in the patient with both generalized and anatomically localized skin eruptions (such as the hands, face, eyelids) that come in contact with the substances in the environment [Strength of Recommendation: Moderate; C Evidence]. In a patient with a facial rash involving the periorbital area (eg, eyelids), evaluate for ACD caused by components of cosmetics, such as fragrances, preservatives, and excipients, because these are common sensitizers of the facial skin [Strength of Recommendation: Moderate; C Evidence]. Evaluate patients presenting with lip dermatitis (cheilitis) and perioral dermatitis for both irritant and allergic causes of contact dermatitis [Strength of Recommendation: Moderate; C Evidence].

### Oral hypersensitivity reactions [^116MkZ7p]. Dermatologic Clinics (2020). Medium credibility.

Allergic contact hypersensitivity reactions of the oral mucosa pose a significant medical concern for some patients. Oral hypersensitivity reactions can result from a vast number of allergenic chemicals, but occur commonly from dental materials, flavorings, and preservatives. Clinical presentation is varied and often overlaps with other oral conditions, complicating their diagnosis and management. The most common clinical entities associated with oral hypersensitivity reactions are oral lichenoid reactions and allergic contact cheilitis. In addition to reviewing these conditions and their most common corresponding allergens, this article summarizes the pathogenesis of oral hypersensitivity reactions and addresses patch testing pearls.

### Common oral lesions… [^114V8hXG]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Candidiasis Approximately 30% to 60% of healthy individuals have oral Candida colonization, most commonly with C. albicans. 5–7 Opportunistic infection can occur secondary to oral or inhaled corticosteroid use, immunocompromise, diabetes mellitus, malnourishment, antibiotics, and denture use. 5 Brushing dentures with toothpaste should be avoided because this can cause surface scratching. An important differential diagnosis for hyperplastic candidiasis is leukoplakia, and if lesions do not completely resolve with antifungal therapy, then a biopsy is indicated. 6, 7 Accumulation of saliva in skin folds at the external corners of the mouth with Candida and Staphylococcus aureus infection can cause angular cheilitis with pain and fissuring. 5–7. Figure 5A) and herpetic gingivostomatitis. HSV-1 has a 60% to 95% worldwide prevalence in adults and is normally acquired by adolescence.

14, 15 HSV-1 has classically been identified as the cause of oral lesions, whereas HSV-2 was associated with genital lesions; however, more data indicate substantial overlap. 16 The initial infection with oral HSV can be markedly symptomatic with numerous vesicles throughout the mouth and may be accompanied by fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, and pain that can interfere with speech and eating.
16. 18 Erythroplakia is much less common and manifests as a smooth or pebbly, well-defined red patch, whereas erythroleukoplakia has red and white components. Leukoplakia has a variably reported incidence of oral epithelial dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, and squamous cell carcinoma of 10% to 46%, which varies based on the clinical definition. In contrast, almost all cases of erythroplakia show dysplasia, with 90% exhibiting severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or invasive squamous cell carcinoma. 18, 19. 25–27.

### New-onset oral lichen planus and granulomatous cheilitis in a 66-year-old woman [^113sq13P]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

In 1945, the term granulomatous cheilitis was used to label granulomatous infiltration and lymphatic obstruction of the lips. Decades earlier, the neuromucocutaneous triad of orofacial edema, tongue fissuring, and unilateral facial paralysis, indistinguishable from Bell's palsy, was identified by Melkersson and Rosenthal. In 1985, the term orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) was coined, and referred to noncaseating granulomas of the face and oral cavity in the absence of systemic granulomatous disease. OFG encompasses a spectrum of cutaneous granulomatous conditions from Miescher's GC to Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. OFG is a diagnosis of exclusion, as localized granulomatous swelling of the oral cavity may be caused by systemic disease. Therefore, perioral granulomas warrant further workup to rule out conditions including Crohn's disease, sarcoidosis and tuberculosis. Isolated cutaneous granulomas may also occur as a foreign body reaction.

### Tender violaceous nodules and petechia on the legs [^115Gy8VT]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What are the most common cutaneous manifestations of this condition?
A. Cheilitis, glossitis, and seborrheic dermatitis
B. Follicular hyperkeratosis, petechiae, and ecchymoses
C. Generalized xerosis, follicular hyperkeratosis, and bitot spots
D. Photosensitive dermatitis and hyperpigmentation
E. Alopecia and periorificial dermatitis

Answers:
A. Cheilitis, glossitis, and seborrheic dermatitis – Incorrect. Cheilitis, glossitis, and seborrheic dermatitis are common cutaneous manifestations seen in vitamin B2 (riboflavin) deficiency.
B. Follicular hyperkeratosis, petechiae, and ecchymoses – Correct. The most common and early cutaneous manifestations of vitamin C deficiency include follicular hyperkeratosis, scattered petechiae, and ecchymoses. Vitamin C is crucial for collagen synthesis, and deficiency can lead to blood vessel fragility and poor wound healing, thereby contributing to these skin findings.
C. Generalized xerosis, follicular hyperkeratosis, and bitot spots – Incorrect. Although follicular hyperkeratosis may also be seen with vitamin C deficiency (scurvy), generalized xerosis and bitot spots are cutaneous manifestations mostly associated with vitamin A deficiency or phrynoderma.
D. Photosensitive dermatitis and hyperpigmentation – Incorrect. While hyperpigmentation can occur in various vitamin deficiencies, dermatitis in sun-exposed areas such as the face, neck, and hands is more specific to vitamin B3 (niacin) deficiency. In particular, the Casal necklace is characterized by a circular, broad collar rash around the neck that affects dermatomes C3 and C4. If the deficiency is severe, it can manifest as Pellagra, which is characterized by the "3 D's" – dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia.
E. Alopecia and periorificial dermatitis – Incorrect. Alopecia and periorificial dermatitis are cutaneous manifestations often seen in vitamin B7 (biotin) deficiency.

### Common oral lesions: part I. superficial mucosal lesions [^116hPJMb]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Common superficial oral lesions include candidiasis, recurrent herpes labialis, recurrent aphthous stomatitis, erythema migrans, hairy tongue, and lichen planus. Recognition and diagnosis require taking a thorough history and performing a complete oral examination. Knowledge of clinical characteristics such as size, location, surface morphology, color, pain, and duration is helpful in establishing a diagnosis. Oral candidiasis may present as pseudomembranous candidiasis, glossitis, or perlèche (angular cheilitis). Oral candidiasis is common in infants, but in adults it may signify immune deficiency or other illness. Herpes labialis typically is a mild, self-limited condition. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis most often is a mild condition; however, severe cases may be caused by nutritional deficiencies, autoimmune disorders, or human immunodeficiency virus infection. Erythema migrans is a waxing and waning disorder of unknown etiology. Hairy tongue represents elongation and hypertrophy of the filiform papillae and most often occurs in persons who smoke heavily. Oral lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory condition that may be reticular or erosive. Certain risk factors have been associated with each of these lesions, such as poor oral hygiene, age, tobacco use, and alcohol consumption, and some systemic conditions may have oral manifestations. Many recommended therapies for oral lesions are unsupported by randomized controlled trials.

### Recurrent granulomatous cheilitis associated with Crohn's disease successfully treated with ustekinumab: case report and literature review [^115J8RKj]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Here we describe a clinical case of CD limited to the ileum with associated type I pauciarticular arthritis that required treatment with salazopyrin, methotrexate and subsequently infliximab. The patient developed severe recurrent granulomatous cheilitis, which was successfully treated by switching from infliximab to ustekinumab.

Granulomatous cheilitis, originally described by Miescher in 1945, is a rare entity of unknown aetiology, characterized clinically by persistent inflammation of the lips and histologically by granulomatous infiltrate. The term orofacial granulomatosis (OFG) is used to encompass not only isolated cheilitis but a variety of other chronic granulomatous inflammatory manifestations of the oral cavity and maxillofacial region, including deep buccal ulcerations, prominent aphthous stomatitis, oral cobblestoning or angular cheilitis.OFG can occur as an isolated phenomenon or as a manifestation of CD, called oral CD (OCD). Oral disease may predate intestinal CD involvement, especially in young patients. Currently, OCD and OFG are separated on clinical grounds, where OFG tends to present with more labial pathology like isolated cheilitis and less buccal ulceration or cobblestoning.

### Guidelines of care for the management of actinic keratosis [^114XMZU4]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Actinic keratosis (AK) guideline scope and methods — the guidelines address the management of AK from the perspective of US dermatologists, other practitioners who treat AK, and patients, and consider various AK treatments including topical agents, cryosurgery, and photodynamic therapy (PDT); premalignant neoplasia on nonkeratinizing epithelium, such as actinic cheilitis, is not addressed. Clinical characteristics, histologic classification, natural history, risk of progression, and dermatologic surveillance of AKs are discussed. A multidisciplinary Work Group conducted a systematic review to address 5 clinical questions and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for assessing the certainty of the evidence and formulating and grading clinical recommendations. Adherence to these guidelines will not ensure successful treatment in every situation and they should not be interpreted as setting a standard of care; the ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific therapy must be made by the physician and the patient, and the guideline reflects the best available data at the time prepared with possible revisions as new data emerge.

### Deep suppurative glandular cheilitis: a pediatric case report [^116cWz6L]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic criteria have been proposed by Reiter et al, including both clinical and histopathologic aspects, suggesting the importance of biopsy in the diagnosis. Histologically, GC shows ductal mucin deposition and ectasia, mucous ⁄oncocytic metaplasia, sialectasia, and chronic inflammation.

The most common differential diagnoses are actinic cheilitis, irritant and allergic contact cheilitis, atopic cheilitis, lichen planus, sarcoidosis, granulomatous cheilitis, actinic prurigo, multiple mucoceles, chronic sialadenitis of the minor salivary glands, as well as infective forms caused by human herpes virus infection, primary or secondary syphilis, and HIV.

Moreover, the association between GC and the development of squamocellular carcinoma is not fully clarified. Although cases of squamocellular carcinoma of the vermilion border have been described in the context of deep suppurative form, GC is not considered a premalignant condition per se.

Currently, there are different possibilities of management described in literature, without a definitive consensus and with short follow-up period. In milder forms, sun screen, topical and intralesional steroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, and systemic antibiotic therapy together with avoidance of risk factors have been proposed for treatment. In the deep suppurative subtype, after the failure of conservative measures, surgical therapy with labial stripping or lower lip vermilionectomy and dissection of the minor salivary glands is often the therapy of choice.

Our patient was extremely symptomatic and refractory to conservative treatment: vermilionectomy of the lower lip, even if performed at a young age, led to complete remission, which was maintained without any other recurrence or further therapy after 3 years of follow-up, suggesting good results of this surgical procedure in deep suppurative GC.

In conclusion, GC is a rare and difficult-to-diagnose entity, especially in its deep suppurative form, which can be present also in pediatric patients. Vermilionectomy could be a valid treatment option also in this population. However, more studies are necessary to understand its prevalence, pathogenesis, and the ideal management.

### Lower lip lesions in fair-skinned patients: time to make specific diagnoses other than actinic cheilitis [^113rS9bK]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Patients with light skin and chronic sun damage commonly develop lower lip lesions that are diagnosed as having actinic cheilitis. Unfortunately, there is no uniform definition for "actinic cheilitis" in the dermatologic or dental literature, impeding optimal patient treatment. Furthermore, unrelated, disparate cutaneous conditions have been labeled as "actinic cheilitis", preventing comparisons between studies. We sought to reassess the diagnosis of patients who have been considered to have actinic cheilitis using only histopathologic diagnoses that are reproducible on other areas of the skin. To this end, we reanalyzed biopsies and vermilionectomy specimens that were obtained from 117 patients who were formerly diagnosed with actinic cheilitis in our hospital. A total of 117 biopsy specimens from 117 patients were reanalyzed. An additional 797 slides from vermilionectomy specimens that were acquired from several of these patients were examined. The following diagnoses were made: solar elastosis with normal or atrophic epithelium (603 slides from 83 patients); lichen simplex chronicus (105 slides from 30 patients); actinic keratosis/squamous cell carcinoma (85 slides from 50 patients); and lichen planus (4 slides from 4 patients). Actinic cheilitis is not a specific diagnosis; furthermore, such a diagnosis can be misleading in the treatment of patients. Specific dermatologic diagnoses should always be considered to improve patient treatment.

### Chronic macrocheilia: a clinico-pathological study of 28 patients [^114NfktC]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic macrocheilia has a multifactorial aetiology and is often a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Epidemiological information on this condition is scarce, most of the data reported relating only to granulomatous cheilitis. We have performed a detailed clinico-pathological analysis of all patients with chronic macrocheilia presenting to us during the last 6.5 years. Of the 28 patients identified, 13 (46.4%) had granulomatous cheilitis (GC), six (21.4%) had tuberculosis of the lip, three (10.7%) had leprous macrocheilia, two (7.1%) had multiple endocrine neoplasia type IIb, and one each had Ascher's syndrome and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Two patients were diagnosed as 'nonspecific cheilitis'. Histopathological differentiation between tuberculosis and GC was often not possible; but PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was positive in all patients with tuberculosis and negative in four patients with GC in whom M. tuberculosis was sought. In spite of detailed clinical examination and investigations, a therapeutic trial was required to confirm the diagnosis in five (17.9%) patients. We have reviewed the available literature on this subject, and to our knowledge this study is the first of its kind. More such studies from other centres will help physicians to make an accurate aetiological diagnosis and treat this uncommon but disfiguring condition with confidence.

### Proceedings of the 32nd European paediatric rheumatology congress [^114kozko]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Correspondence: S. Delli Noci

Pediatric Rheumatology, 23(2): P369

Introduction: Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology that primarily affects children under five years of age. Exanthema is reported in 50%–90% of cases, typically within the first five days of illness, presenting as a diffuse, nonspecific erythematous maculopapular rash, often described as morbilliform, scarlatiniform, or urticarial. Less commonly, pustular or erythema multiforme-like eruptions have been described, usually during the convalescent phase. The occurrence of psoriasiform dermatitis during the active phase of KD is exceptional and may pose diagnostic challenges.

Objectives: To describe a rare case of psoriasiform dermatitis during the active phase of KD, and to highlight the importance of differential diagnosis and multidisciplinary management in the setting of persistent systemic inflammation.

Methods: We present the case of a 3-month-old male infant who developed a classical form of KD, including persistent fever, maculopapular rash, cheilitis, conjunctival injection, swelling of the hands and feet, and elevated inflammatory markers. Initial treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and corticosteroids led to temporary resolution of symptoms.

Results: On day 8 of illness, fever recurred, and by day 10 a new cutaneous eruption emerged, prompting a second IVIG infusion and escalation to anakinra due to persistent inflammation. The new rash consisted of crusted erythematous papules predominantly on the limbs, with perioral and perineal involvement. Additional features included erosive cheilitis and crusted blepharitis. These findings were atypical for classical KD and raised suspicion of viral or bacterial co-infection, alternative vasculitis, or a drug-related eruption. Herpes simplex virus co-infection was clinically suspected, leading to empirical initiation of intravenous acyclovir and temporary discontinuation of anakinra. Concurrently, coronary artery aneurysms developed, indicating ongoing systemic inflammation. Virologic testing (PCR on blood and skin) was negative. A skin biopsy revealed a psoriasiform dermatitis without cytopathic changes, ruling out viral etiology. After multidisciplinary review, the eruption was interpreted as KD-related psoriasiform dermatitis. Anakinra and corticosteroids were then reintroduced, with progressive improvement in systemic, cardiac, and cutaneous manifestations.

### Aphthous ulcers associated with imiquimod and the treatment of actinic cheilitis [^111wvYQG]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Our case series report is the first documented depiction of the appearance of aphthous ulcers secondary to imiquimod application. This case series presentation discusses the underlying pathophysiology of aphthous ulcer development and imiquimod therapy in terms of the stimulation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). The literature review suggests more than just a mere coincidence for the development of aphthous ulcers subsequent to the treatment of actinic cheilitis with imiquimod application.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: squamous cell skin cancer, version 1.2022 [^116ka7L4]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

NCCN squamous cell skin cancer — actinic cheilitis and hyperkeratotic AKs: Prospective studies on the treatment of actinic cheilitis are limited, and therapies tested include surgical vermilionectomy, lip shave, electrodesiccation, laser vermilion ablation, laser resurfacing, 5-FU, laser + 5-FU, trichloroacetic acid chemical peel, PDT, PDT + imiquimod, and diclofenac; the NCCN Panel considers ablative laser vermilionectomy to be of value as a primary treatment option for extensive actinic cheilitis. For hyperkeratotic AKs, pretreatment may include topical tazarotene, curettage, or topical keratolytics prior to treatment with 5-FU with or without calcipotriol, imiquimod, or tirbanibulin; the development of AKs may also be reduced by oral retinoid treatment, with significant side effects especially in patients with childbearing potential and benefits limited to the time of treatment. Another treatment that may be considered for severe refractory disease after progression on oral retinoids is low-dose oral capecitabine, investigated in a small cohort of transplant patients with varying side effects.

### Cheilitis glandularis: a clinicopathological study in 22 patients [^116NZmP8]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Cheilitis glandularis (CG) is a condition in which thick saliva is secreted by minor labial salivary glands and adheres to a swollen lip causing discomfort to the patient. Most publications refer to single case reports or small case series.

Objective

We sought to report and to analyze clinical, pathological, and therapeutic data on 22 patients with CG seen at the department of dermatology at our university.

Method

Retrospective data about 22 patients with CG are reviewed and presented.

Results

Seventeen patients were male and 5 were female. All were fair skinned, including 6 albino individuals. Several of them presented significant signs of photodamage on the lips. Surgical treatment was performed in 10 severely affected patients and consisted of a vermilionectomy followed by minor salivary gland removal. Histopathological study revealed various degrees of chronic sialadenitis and vermilion epithelial changes. Superficially invasive and in situ squamous cell carcinoma of the vermilion was detected in 3 cases.

Limitations

Biopsy and surgery were not performed in all patients.

Conclusions

CG is strongly related to sun sensitivity and may be more severe in albino patients. The swollen, sun-exposed lip may become more susceptible to the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma.

There are a wide variety of inflammatory, infectious, and cystic lesions which may lead patients to seek acute care for facial swelling. Computed tomography (CT) has become the mainstay for imaging in the urgent/emergent setting. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can also serve as a powerful problem solving tool in the modern era. As volume continues to increase, a wide variety of facial pathology will be encountered by the emergency radiologist. Recognition of both common and uncommon pathology will assist in diagnosis and value-based care. This article serves as an image-rich review of the many causes of facial swelling with an emphasis on key imaging findings and possible complications.

Abstract

Cheilitis granulomatosa (CG) is an idiopathic, rare, and chronic granulomatous disorder involving the lips. We characterized the pathological and immunohistopathological findings of these granulomas and their relationship with the lymphatic vessels. Pathologically confirmed cases of primary CG from 2001 to 2016 were collected. Cases of inflammatory cheilitis without the presence of granuloma were included in the control group. Demographic data, clinical presentation, response to therapy, and pathological differences were compared. Periodic acid-Schiff and acid-fast stains excluded patients having infections. CD68, CD163, and D2-40 stains demonstrated features of granuloma, macrophage polarization, and the relationship between granuloma and lymphatic vessels. Thirteen patients diagnosed with CG were enrolled. Thirteen people were enrolled in the control group. The granulomas were either mononuclear or sarcoidal. They were predominantly positive for CD68 but negative for CD163. Perilymphatic granulomas were found in all patients. Intralymphatic histiocytosis and lymphatic dilatation were more commonly observed in patients diagnosed with CG than those in controls (54% vs. 15%, P = 0.03 and 92% vs. 23%, P < 0.01). TH1 immune response due to CD68+ M1 macrophages results in CG. Perilymphatic aggregation of macrophages and intralymphatic histiocytosis were important pathological clues for diagnosis.

### Diagnosis, clinical features, and management of patients with granulomatous cheilitis… [^113Jn3EM]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Granulomatous cheilitis is a rare disorder characterized by noncaseating granulomatous inflammation of the lips in the absence of systemic disease, eg, Crohn disease or sarcoidosis. 1 A subtype of orofacial granulomatosis, the term GC was proposed in 1985 by Wiesenfeld and colleagues to encompass the spectrum of idiopathic, noncaseating granulomatous diseases of the face and mouth. 2 When GC is found with lingua plicata and facial palsy, it is referred to as Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. Granulomatous cheilitis can have a chronic disfiguring course that is exceedingly difficult to manage. 3 There are few published case-series studies describing responses to specific treatments for GC. 4 This review of cases at a tertiary referral center seeks to better describe the demographic characteristics, presenting features, associated disorders, and response to treatment of GC.

We identified 19 patients whose records included results of a lip biopsy that demonstrated noncaseating granulomatous inflammation. All patients underwent chest imaging to rule out sarcoidosis. To rule out CD, 7 of 9 patients underwent colonoscopy; 2 declined. Nine of the patients had GC. The mean age of patients with GC at presentation was 46. 6 years, 7 of 9 were female, and their chief concern was painless upper-lip edema. Of the 10 patients excluded for other diagnoses, 2 were diagnosed with CD, 2 with sarcoidosis, 4 with allergic contact dermatitis, and 2 were undiagnosed owing to insufficient workup. A rare, poorly understood disorder, GC presents with painless orofacial swelling and noncaseating granulomatous inflammation on histopathological examination. To the best of our knowledge, only 3 case-series studies of more than 5 patients with GC have been published to date.

5 We describe the clinical features and therapeutic outcomes of 9 patients with GC. Diseases including allergic contact dermatitis, CD, and sarcoidosis must be considered and excluded prior to diagnosing GC. In this cohort of 9 patients, all received chest imaging to rule out sarcoidosis, and 7 underwent colonoscopy to rule out CD. Patch testing and ophthalmologic examination may also be useful in evaluating allergic contact dermatitis and sarcoidosis, respectively.

### Melkersson-rosenthal syndrome of the vulva [^116MUuwy]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

MRS of the vulva is a rarely reported phenomenon. The etiology of MRS and vulvitis granulomatosa remains unknown. Patients often present with acute inflammation that eventually follows a chronic relapsing-remitting course. When a patient presents with vulvar swelling, the differential diagnoses include Bartholin abscess, hidradenitis suppurativa, angioedema, infection, or foreign body reaction; many of which can be ruled out based on histological features. Histology of a MRS lesion reveals collections of Langhans giant cells within a background of lymphoplasmacytic dermal inflammation. Reports in the literature also reveal that the presence of polarizable crystalline-like material within the giant cells may be specific to vulvitis granulomatosa. Treatment options for MRS include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and immunosuppressants. A specific treatment protocol has not yet been established. Intralesional Kenalog or a combination of steroids and minocycline are two common first-line treatment options. Surgery is only indicated in patients with significant disfigurement.

An association between cutaneous granulomatosis and Crohn's disease has been increasingly acknowledged. In fact, many advocate for routine screening of the GI tract after a diagnosis of MRS or other associated granulomatous cutaneous disorders, even in the absence of bowel symptoms. Oral manifestations, such as cheilitis granulomatosa, are more commonly reported and found to precede the GI symptoms associated with Crohn's disease.

This case brings attention to the rare presentation of MRS in the vulva. The association between vulvitis granulomatosa and Crohn's disease must be recognized and considered when formulating a treatment plan. If symptoms are significant, there is a low threshold for further exploration to determine if there is internal involvement.

### Lipstick cheilitis… [^112uE2i6]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

CHEILITIS is one of the most commonly seen dermatoses in clinical practice. Among the most frequent causes of this disease in women is the dye used to impart lasting qualities to indelible lipsticks. This dye is dibromfluorescein, tribromfluorescein or tetrabromfluorescein. Many other causative agents of cheilitis have been reported in the literature. Various authors have reported cases of cheilitis due to the following: actinic or chemically active rays of sunlight, 1 cold urticaria, 2 carmine and anilin dyes in liquid rouge, 3 trout, 4 lipstick, 5 methyl heptine carbonate in the perfume of lipstick, 6 dental plates, 7 eosin dye in lipstick, 8 denture creams containing oil of anise, 9 lipstick in which local factors play a part, 10 mouth washes and cigaret holders, 11 derivatives of bromfluorescein, a husband's moustache wax, amalgam fillings for teeth, toothpaste and a preparation for gums.

### Oral granulomatous disease [^112RPa4R]. Dermatologic Clinics (2020). Medium credibility.

Granulomatous diseases are chronic inflammatory disorders whose pathogenesis is triggered by an array of infectious and noninfectious agents, and may be localized or a manifestation of systemic, disseminated disease. As in the skin, oral manifestations of granulomatous inflammation are often nonspecific in their clinical appearance. Thus, in the absence of overt foreign material or a recognizable infectious agent, identifying the underlying cause of the inflammation can be challenging. This article highlights various conditions known to induce granulomatous inflammation within the oral soft tissues.

### Diseases of the lips [^116Q9qQ4]. Clinics in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Heath care providers should be comfortable with normal as well as pathologic findings in the lips, because the lips are highly visible and may display clinical manifestations of local, as well as systemic inflammatory, allergic, irritant, and neoplastic alterations. Fortunately, the lips are easily accessible. The evaluation should include a careful history and physical examination, including visual inspection, as well as palpation of the lips and an examination of associated cervical, submandibular, and submental nodes. Pathologic and microscopic studies, as well as a review of medications, allergies, and habits, may further highlight possible etiologies. Many lip conditions, including premalignant changes, are relatively easy to treat, when the abnormalities are detected early; however, advanced disease and malignancies are challenging for both the patient and clinician. Treatment should be focused on eliminating potential irritants or allergens and treatment of the primary dermatosis. In this paper we review physiologic variants as well as pathologic conditions of the lips.

Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) deficiency — features and bariatric surgery management note characteristic mucocutaneous signs and limited routine monitoring. Vitamin B2/riboflavin is a water-soluble nutrient involved with many cellular processes, and its deficiency may cause a distinctive bright pink tongue, cracked lips, angular cheilitis, throat swelling, scleral erythema, lowered blood cell count, coma, and death. Vitamin B2 deficiency is rarely reported after bariatric surgery; riboflavin deficiency can be mitigated with appropriate nutrition and a high-quality multivitamin supplement, and post-operative riboflavin levels are usually monitored only with signs and symptoms of deficiency.

### Granulomatous cheilitis in a young woman… [^115NvK6V]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

A woman in her 20s presented with a 6-month history of persistent painless swelling of the lower lip. She had no previous incidents of local trauma, exposure to irritants, or known drug or food allergies. The patient's medical history indicated prior treatment with topical tacrolimus ointment, oral antihistamines, and methacycline, none of which yielded any improvement. Physical examination revealed that the lower lip and perioral area were diffusely swollen, firm, and nontender, with scaling and vertical fissures in the lower lip. The tongue was normal-appearing and there were no signs of regional lymphadenopathy. Full review of systems revealed no obvious abnormalities. The result of a patch test was negative. A chest high-resolution computed tomography scan displayed no abnormalities. Prior upper- and lower-gastrointestinal endoscopy results were unremarkable. Su Z, Zhao S, Zeng Y.

### Oral lesions in autoimmune bullous diseases: an overview of clinical characteristics and diagnostic algorithm [^1137Bkps]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Main Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of erosive oral lesions include infectious agents, due to viruses and bacteria, drug-induced reactions, inflammatory conditions, and systemic diseases (Table 1). These conditions have some specific morphological features and overlapping clinical features, therefore histology is required for the diagnosis.

Table 1
Differential diagnosis of oral blisters, ulcers, gingivitis, and stomatitis

SJS/TEN Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis

Oral lesions caused by infectious agents are usually transient. Primary infection with herpes simplex is the most common viral cause of erosions and blisters in the oral mucosa. Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are severe, mostly drug-induced reactions with an abrupt onset of erosive stomatitis and hemorrhagic cheilitis followed by widespread skin lesions (Fig. 1 j–l). The gingiva is rarely affected in Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Other mucosal involvement is frequently seen, such as ocular and genital involvement.

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis is the most frequent inflammatory condition of the oral mucosa with recurrent self-limiting ulcers affecting non keratinized mucosa. Multiple factors are involved in the etiology of recurrent aphthous stomatitis. Behçet syndrome is a chronic multi-system condition characterized by diffuse aphthous erosions and ulcers on the labial, buccal, and lateral tongue mucosa. Ocular and genital involvement is also frequently seen.

Lupus erythematosus is a systemic autoimmune disorder with a wide variety of clinical features. Oral lesions in lupus erythematosus are usually multiple, located on the buccal mucosa, hard palate, lips, and gingiva. The distribution is asymmetrical with different morphological features ranging from plaques, erythema, and ulcerations.

Oral lichen planus is a chronic immune mediated disease with highly variable clinical features ranging from subtle white reticular patterns to erosions and ulcerations (Fig. 1 m–o). Lesions are usually symmetrically distributed in the oral cavity. Affected sites of the oral cavity include the buccal mucosa, tongue, and gingiva. Histopathologic biopsies of oral lichen planus often show sub-epithelial blistering without preservation of the basal cells, in contrast to pemphigoid.

### Common oral conditions in older persons [^116a3bFi]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Older persons are at risk of chronic diseases of the mouth, including dental infections (e.g., caries, periodontitis), tooth loss, benign mucosal lesions, and oral cancer. Other common oral conditions in this population are xerostomia (dry mouth) and oral candidiasis, which may lead to acute pseudomembranous candidiasis (thrush), erythematous lesions (denture stomatitis), or angular cheilitis. Xerostomia caused by underlying disease or medication use may be treated with over-the-counter saliva substitutes. Primary care physicians can help older patients maintain good oral health by assessing risk, recognizing normal versus abnormal changes of aging, performing a focused oral examination, and referring patients to a dentist, if needed. Patients with chronic, disabling medical conditions (e.g., arthritis, neurologic impairment) may benefit from oral health aids, such as electric toothbrushes, manual toothbrushes with wide-handle grips, and floss-holding devices.

### Erythematous swelling of the lip associated with Sjögren's syndrome and mimicking cheilitis granulomatosa [^115o2zbk]. The Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

A 64-year-old Japanese woman developed therapy-resistant erythematous swelling of her upper lip. Our tentative clinical diagnosis of cheilitis granulomatosa was ruled out later by the laboratory findings including increased levels of anti-nuclear-antibody (ANA), anti-SSA/Ro antibody, and positive Schirmer test as well as by a histopathological picture showing a dense perivascular infiltration of plasma cells and mononuclear cells in the dermis instead of granulomatous changes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first patient in whom annular erythema associated with S ogren's syndrome involved only the upper lip and produced clinical features simulating cheilitis granulomatosa.

### Lip abscess associated with isotretinoin treatment of acne vulgaris [^111hyGL3]. JAMA Dermatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

Isotretinoin is frequently prescribed for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Among the numerous documented adverse effects, most common are xerostomia and cheilitis. Lip abscesses as a consequence of cheilitis present dramatically and may pose a diagnostic challenge.

Observations

We present a case of a 15-year-old boy with a severe lip abscess requiring incision and drainage and hospital admission for intravenous antibiotic treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. We discuss the pathophysiologic characteristics of isotretinoin therapy and the likely causative role that the medication played in the development of the lip abscess.

Conclusions and Relevance

Although rare, lip abscesses related to isotretinoin therapy present with substantial morbidity and should be promptly recognized. Misdiagnosis of mucositis and angioedema may delay appropriate therapy.

Case series

Case 1

A 29-year-old woman was seen in the clinic for evaluation of constant "lip peeling" for more than 8 months. She denied lip picking or using any new lip products and reported excessive concern about her condition. The results of outside laboratory panels and biopsy were unremarkable. Previous treatment with petroleum jelly, topical steroids, and fluconazole was unsuccessful. The physical examination was significant for distinctive lip puckering and thick white scale on the upper and lower lips without involvement of the oral mucosa (Fig 1, A).

Fig 1
Hyperkeratotic scale of patient 1, who showed significant improvement from (A) initial presentation (B) after using topical, oral, and antidepressant therapies.

Thorough history taking revealed that her symptoms started when she felt depressed from stressful events at home and at work. The patient was encouraged to discuss using a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and undergoing behavioral therapy with her psychiatrist. Her cheilitis significantly improved at subsequent monthly follow-up visits, with a regimen of saline soaks, petroleum jelly, tacrolimus ointment, desvenlafaxine, and therapy sessions (Fig 1, B).

Case 2

A 29-year-old man was evaluated via telehealth for constant "lip peeling". He had experienced symptoms for 3 years and denied lip picking or using any new lip products. Thorough history taking revealed that the patient had been verbally assaulted repeatedly by his previous employer, leading to decreased self-confidence, reduced self-worth, depression, and social isolation. The results of multiple outside dermatologic evaluations were unremarkable, and there was no improvement with salicylic acid gel and topical steroids. Mirtazapine had decreased his symptoms when prescribed for depression in the past.

The physical examination was significant for angular cheilitis, distinctive lip puckering, and thick white scale on the upper and lower lips without oral mucosal involvement (Supplementary Fig 1, A, available via Mendeley at). He was placed on a regimen of saline soaks, petroleum jelly, tacrolimus ointment, escitalopram, and oral fluconazole for angular cheilitis. He noted gradual significant improvement at subsequent follow-ups (Supplementary Fig 1, B).

Specific cutaneous manifestations

Orofacial Crohn's disease and orofacial ulcerative colitis

In Crohn's disease (CD), oral manifestations occur in 8–9% of the patients. They are more common in the pediatric population, and may precede intestinal involvement. When there is oral involvement, the likelihood of other extraintestinal manifestations is greater. CD may appear in the oral cavity as aphthous ulcerations or superficial bleeding ulcers. However, a wide variety of disease-specific oral lesions have been described in patients with intestinal CD (Table 2).

Table 2
Oral lesions in patients with Crohn's disease

CD in the oral cavity usually takes the form of aphthous ulceration of the mucosal surface. Aphthae and mucosal tags are frequently seen if the oral cavity is carefully evaluated in patients with newly diagnosed CD. Deep tissue inflammation occurs uncommonly and may lead to labial, lingual, and facial swelling and fistula formation can result. CD sometimes shows only orofacial manifestations.

In ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, lesions of the oral cavity may appear as aphthous ulcerations, superficial hemorrhagic ulcers or angular cheilitis. In general, oral lesions coincide with exacerbations of the colonic disease. Similar ulcerations may arise on the buttocks, abdomen, thighs and face. Aphthous ulcers or angular stomatitis occur in as many as 5–10% of patients.

Indeed, classification of granulomatous orofacial disease is complex (particularly in the absence of inflammation elsewhere) and there is considerable overlap between orofacial CD, Melkersson Rosenthal syndrome, cheilitis granulomatoses, and the other orofacial granulomatosis. Therefore, diagnosis should include tissue sampling of the involved orofacial region for histopathologic examination.

Effective treatment for specific orofacial CD has not been defined. Many patients who are found to have OCD manifestations may be completely asymptomatic, since the oral findings are not clinically problematic.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Pediatric HIV — clinical manifestations of oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis include varied OPC phenotypes and symptom profiles. Clinical manifestations of OPC vary and include pseudomembranous (thrush), erythematous (atrophic), hyperplastic (hypertrophic), and angular cheilitis presentations. Thrush appears as creamy white, curd-like patches with inflamed underlying mucosa that is exposed after removal of the exudate and can be found on the oropharyngeal mucosa, palate, and tonsils. Erythematous OPC is characterized by flat erythematous lesions on the mucosal surface. Hyperplastic candidiasis presents as raised white plaques on the lower surface of the tongue, palate and buccal mucosa, and cannot be removed. Angular cheilitis presents as red fissured lesions in the corners of the mouth. Esophageal candidiasis often presents with odynophagia, dysphagia, or retrosternal pain, and children, unlike adults, often experience nausea and vomiting; therefore, children with esophageal candidiasis may present with dehydration and weight loss. Classic symptoms and signs of OPC may be absent in children with esophageal candidiasis, particularly those receiving ART. New-onset fever in a child with HIV infection who has advanced disease, a central venous catheter, or both is the most common clinical manifestation of candidemia. Detection of end organ involvement is often dependent on radiographic imaging, and renal candidiasis can present with candiduria while ultrasonographic demonstration of renal parenchymal lesions is often not associated with symptoms related to renal disease.

### Rapid resolution of cheilitis granulomatosa with addition of oral metronidazole to a multidrug regimen [^113nHnYd]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

An English-language PubMed search of "granulomatous cheilitis" OR "cheilitis granulomatosa" OR "cheilitis granulomatosa of Miescher" AND "metronidazole" yielded 8 reports detailing 11 cases of CG, 10 of which were successfully treated with metronidazole. The single reported treatment failure described a patient who exhibited no response (or poor tolerance) to metronidazole but subsequently responded to intralesional corticosteroid. Of the 10 successfully treated cases (ie, complete clinical resolution of disease), 3 were solely managed with metronidazole, 3 received metronidazole monotherapy after failing other treatments (ie, ketotifen, intralesional corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, mesalamine, and/or doxycycline),3 received metronidazole as part of a multidrug regimen at the onset; and 1 patient was started on a combination of metronidazole and minocycline following an inadequate response to systemic corticosteroids. In the cases described by Dummer et al and Koracin et al, all patients achieved a complete clinical response within 3 weeks of starting metronidazole. Our case offers additional evidence in support of oral metronidazole as an effective treatment for refractory CG. Through the induction of DNA strand breakage, metronidazole interferes with protein synthesis and is commonly prescribed for protozoal and anaerobic bacterial infections. It also possesses anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, likely accounting for its therapeutic benefit in the setting of CG among other inflammatory disorders.

Topical formulations of metronidazole are readily available and US Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of inflammatory rosacea. Although clinically distinct, the granulomatous variant of rosacea and CG exhibit histologic similarities, particularly the presence of granulomas. Current literature does not report the use of topical metronidazole for CG; however, given its efficacy for the treatment of granulomatous rosacea, it conceptually may offer potential benefit for CG patients, such as sustaining clinical remission. Although our patient's clinical response cannot be solely attributed to oral metronidazole, the resolution of his disease was hastened by the addition of metronidazole to his treatment regimen.

LE-Nonspecific Oral Ulcers

Aphthous Ulcers

An aphthous ulcer is described as a white to yellow painful ulcer with a surrounding red rim. The lesion is usually presented with multiple lesions or in a group, and tends to involve primarily lining tissue: the soft palate, buccal and labial mucosa. Aphthous ulcers are more common in JSLE patients than in adult SLE and usually occur when disease is active. There are four types of aphthous ulcer, classified as (a) minor ulcers, smaller than 1 cm, usually healing without scar; (b) major ulcers, larger than 1 cm, often healing with scar; (c) herpetiform ulcers, a group of small ulcers (more than ten lesions); and (d) severe ulcers, a continuous minor ulcer lasting months. In our observations, the most common type of aphthous ulcer in JSLE patients is multiple minor ulcers and less than ten lesions (Fig. 1 d).

Lupus Cheilitis

Lupus cheilitis is an inflammation of the buccal lips. The typical lesion is small or diffuse, erythematous and edematous, and may turn into crusty painful ulcers. Cheilitis often involves the vermilion zone of the lower lip (typical lupus cheilitis). As the lesion is found in the sun-exposed area, lupus cheilitis is usually associated with photosensitivity in JSLE patients. Extensive erosive lupus cheilitis that involves both upper and lower lips has also been reported in JSLE patients and appears in active disease (Fig. 1 e).

Other LE-Nonspecific Oral Lesions

Bullous SLE is a rare clinical manifestation developed by circulating antibodies against type VII collagen at the sub-epidermis. It typically presents with multiple tense bullae at the face, neck and trunk. Bullous LE at buccal mucosa has been reported in adult SLE and JSLE patients.

### Actinic cheilitis: clinical and histological features [^112mDMAw]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinical and histological features of actinic cheilitis (AC).

Patients and Methods

A total of 29 patients with AC were clinically evaluated, and incisional biopsies were performed to confirm the clinical diagnosis. Histological features were analyzed, and dysplasia was classified as mild, moderate, or severe. The chi(2) test was used for the following variables: gender, age, race, and smoking habits. The degree of dysplasia was related to these variables (Fisher's test) to test for independence between them (P < .05).

Results

Of the patient group, 72.41% were male, 75.86% were over age 40 years, 93.10% were white, and 72.41% were nonsmokers. Clinically, all patients presented with multifocal lesions. The following manifestations were seen: dryness, atrophy, scaly lesions, swelling of the lip, erythema, ulceration, blurred demarcation between the lip vermilion border and the skin, marked folds along the lip vermilion, white spots or plaques, crusts, blotchy areas, and areas of pallor. Keratosis, granulosis, hyperplasia, acanthosis, or atrophy and dysplasia were found in the epithelial tissue; elastosis, inflammatory infiltrate, and vasodilatation were found in the connective tissue. Dysplasia was mild in 10.34% of the patients, moderate in 27.59%, and severe in 62.07%. Absence of sample homogeneity was observed in regard to gender, age, race, and smoking habits. It was not possible to reject the hypothesis of independence between mild, moderate, or severe dysplasia and gender, age, race, and smoking habits.

Conclusions

Dryness, atrophy, and scaly lesions were the most common clinical findings observed. Dysplasia, inflammatory infiltrate, and vasodilatation, as well as elastosis, were the most common histological findings observed. Gender, age, race, or smoking habits were not related to the degree of dysplasia in the sample.

Methods

This was a retrospective, interventional, nonrandomized, sequential case series set in a tertiary referral, dermatologic surgery unit. Ninety-nine consecutive patients with actinic cheilitis treated with the Er:YAG laser between January 2001 and June 2008 underwent a case note review, of which 77 went on to a structured telephone interview. The main outcome measures were a subjective improvement in lip symptoms related to actinic cheilitis and objective improvement in the lips at routine follow-up.

Results

Mean time to interview follow-up was 65.7 months. Of those interviewed, 92.2% believed there had been an improvement in the cosmetic appearance of their lips; one hundred percent believed the function of their lips had improved or remained unchanged; and 84.8% remained completely disease free at the time of follow-up. The majority of patients (93.5%) were satisfied with the laser treatment. Scarring as a direct result of the laser occurred in 5.1% of patients.

Limitations

Retrospective nature of data collection; inability to interview all patients who underwent treatment.

Conclusion

The Er:YAG laser is a successful modality for the treatment of actinic cheilitis with good functional and cosmetic results and only a small risk of long-term scarring. It should be considered as a first-line treatment for the disease.

### Plummer-vinson syndrome following gastric bypass surgery [^111UCxva]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Plummer-Vinson syndrome (PVS) is the combination of dysphagia, angular cheilitis, atrophic glossitis, and esophageal webbing in the setting of iron deficiency anemia. Although it is relatively uncommon, this condition is important to recognize because it is a source of dysphagia and it confers an increased risk for hypopharyngeal cancer. Cases of PVS associated with gastrointestinal conditions such as celiac disease and gastric cancer have been previously reported in the literature, but as far as we know, no case of PVS associated with bariatric surgery has been previously reported. We describe the case of a 39-year-old woman who developed PVS following gastric bypass surgery, and we briefly discuss the current knowledge of this syndrome.

### Daylight photodynamic therapy with methyl-aminolevulinate for the treatment of actinic cheilitis [^1157FyGJ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Actinic cheilitis (AC) is a common premalignant condition that requires an effective treatment to reduce the risk of malignant transformation. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been recently added to the armamentarium available for AC treatment. Daylight PDT (D-PDT) is a novel PDT modality in which the activation of the topical photosensitizer is induced by the exposure to natural daylight instead of artificial light sources without preliminary occlusion. This simplified procedure was found to be more tolerated as compared to conventional PDT. We report our preliminary experience on the use of D-PDT using methyl-aminolevulinate cream in 10 patients with refractory AC of the lower lip. Patients received two consecutive D-PDT sessions with an interval of 7–14 days. At 3 months after therapy, a complete response was observed in seven patients, with sustained results in five patients over an observational period of 6–12 months. Treatment was well tolerated.

### Treatment of actinic cheilitis by photodynamic therapy with 5-aminolevulinic acid and blue light activation [^111TPJjL]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Actinic cheilitis (AC), a common disorder of the lower lip, should be treated early to prevent progression to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) activated by blue light for the treatment of AC. Fifteen patients with clinically evident or biopsy-proven AC received two treatments with ALA PDT with blue light activation. Treatments were spaced three to five weeks apart. Most patients achieved 65% to 75% clearance three to five weeks after the first treatment and all achieved more than 75% clearance one month after the second treatment. Three patients achieved complete clearance. Pain and burning during irradiation were absent or mild. All patients said they would repeat the procedure. ALA PDT with 417 nm blue light is a promising option for the treatment of AC of the lower lip.

### Cheilitis caused by contact allergy to toothpaste containing stannous (tin)-two cases [^113S3ynk]. Contact Dermatitis (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We have described two patients with allergic contact cheilitis caused by tin present in Sensodyne Rapid Relief toothpaste, which contains 0.454% w/w tin in the form of stannous (tin) fluoride. Stannous fluoride (CAS no. 7783‐47‐3) is a chemical compound that can be found as an ingredient in toothpaste. 1 Fluorides are considered to be the most active ingredient in toothpaste with beneficial effects on caries, dental plaque, gingivitis, and halitosis. 1, 2 It can also be beneficial for dentin hypersensitivity and is used for tubule occlusion causing nerve desensitization. 2, 3

Patient 1 had used this toothpaste for over 20 years without complaints. After the diagnosis of contact allergy to tin was made, he switched to a toothpaste without tin and 2 weeks afterwards all skin complaints had resolved. Patient 2 had already switched from Sensodyne Rapid Relief toothpaste to Urtekram Aloe vera toothpaste with initial improvement of her gingival and skin complaints; however, these later recurred. This may well have been caused by her allergy to hydroperoxides of limonene; limonene was found to be an ingredient of the Urtekram toothpaste. After discontinuation of this toothpaste, the patient's peri‐oral and gingival symptoms resolved completely.

Contact allergy to toothpaste and its ingredients has been critically reviewed by de Groot. 2 Symptoms usually manifest as cheilitis and dermatitis around the mouth can be present as well. Intra‐oral symptoms are less common. Even though cheilitis is the main symptom of contact allergy to toothpaste ingredients, toothpastes may be under‐recognized as a potential cause of cheilitis, 4 possibly because contact allergy to toothpastes is infrequent. 2 In the literature, flavouring agents are the most frequently reported cause of toothpaste allergy. 2 Of the 34 critically reviewed reports by de Groot 2, only one case report described contact allergy caused by stannous fluoride. 5 However, the toothpaste itself was not tested and no controls were included. 5 Recently, another case with allergic contact dermatitis caused by stannous fluoride in toothpaste has been reported. 6

### Identical twins presenting with pyogenic granuloma-like vascular proliferations during isotretinoin therapy [^115fjqtz]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oral isotretinoin remains the most effective treatment for severe cystic acne, given its ability to reduce sebum production, prevent comedogenesis, decrease Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes) colonization, and induce anti-inflammatory properties. Common adverse effects of isotretinoin include xerosis, xerophthalmia, cheilitis, and myalgias. Pyogenic granuloma-like vascular proliferations have been reported as a rare adverse effect of oral isotretinoin therapy. However, the etiology and appropriate treatment regimen remain poorly understood. We report the first case, to our knowledge, of identical twins presenting with pyogenic granuloma-like vascular proliferations and discuss the possible genetic etiology of this rare skin finding.

### Pain from the oral cavity [^1158ZDCj]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The head, face, mouth, and throat collectively is the most frequent site of pain in humans. Facial pain is a particularly distressing problem because identification and effective treatment of the underlying cause is often challenging and sometimes elusive. This article focuses on the more common causes of facial pain that originate in the oral cavity and associated structures and outlines a general approach to diagnosis and management of these problems.

### Down syndrome: lip lesions (angular stomatitis and fissures) and Candida albicans [^1158vJzo]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of angular cheilitis (angular stomatitis, perleche, commissural fissures) appears to be increased in people with Down syndrome (DS). Lip fissures are also (in our clinical impression) a fairly regular feature, yet this is scarcely mentioned in the literature.

Objectives

To establish the incidence of angular cheilitis and lip fissures in a substantial group of patients with DS and to examine the relationship with Candida albicans.

Patients and Methods

The prevalence of orofacial soft tissue lesions was investigated in a group of 77 DS patients. Swabs were taken from lip lesions, palate and tongue and inoculated on Sabouraud's agar discs for the isolation of C. albicans, identified with commercially available kits.

Results

Lip fissures were seen in at least one-quarter of DS patients. Angular cheilitis was also found in a similar percentage.

Conclusions

C. albicans was isolated from a substantial proportion of lesions tested, and was present more frequently than in those without lip lesions, but it is uncertain whether this represents cause or effect.

A 42-year-old male with skin type I and a history of rosacea and eczema presented with crusting, erythema, and pustules distributed on the left oral commissure. Angular cheilitis was diagnosed and regular petrolatum use recommended until resolution of the lesion. Eight days later, with no improvement in symptoms, fungal and bacterial cultures were performed which resulted in the growth of cutibacterium acnes, a variant of p. acnes.

### Allergic contact cheilitis in children and improvement with patch testing [^113RxtnZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

A balsam-free diet has helped patients who did not improve with external fragrance avoidance in systemic contact dermatitis. Given the perioral involvement in our case, balsam of peru was likely a strong culprit. Balsam of peru can be added to foods for flavor or spice. Besides changing toothpaste (Nature's Gate Fluoride-Free Cherry), our patient also avoided tomatoes, citrus fruits, cola, sweet flavorings, and spices with marked improvement. On follow-up, the patient's mother recalled a flare after ingestion of cake with frosting.

Formaldehyde releaser preservatives are not common allergens for ACC. Sensitization to bronopol was judged not relevant for the cheilitis in our case. Since 2005, MI, which is a preservative frequently found in cosmetics products, has been an emerging allergen after its approval for use at a maximum concentration of 100 ppm, especially in children 0 to 5 years of age. Prior to this, MI was found in a lower concentration of 1:3 with MCI. Wet wipes contain these preservatives and are often used in the perianal region but are also used periorally causing ACC in susceptible individuals. Although our patient tested positive to both MCI/MI (Kathon CG) and MI, there was no exposure history to wet wipes.

We report this pediatric case of ACC to highlight the usefulness of patch testing in children with cheilitis and to show the remarkable improvement with prudent avoidance of contactants, including food avoidance. Should our patient present with recurrent flares, he may benefit from the pre-emptive avoidance strategy or additional patch testing to his own products.

### Interventions for rosacea based on the phenotype approach: an updated systematic review including GRADE assessments [^111Y1yFk]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Isotretinoin versus placebo

Low‐dose isotretinoin 0.25 mg kg −1 was compared with placebo over 4 months in difficult‐to‐treat 'papulopustular' rosacea (cyclin‐refractory or frequently relapsing) in a study at unclear risk of bias. 39 After 4 months, participants assessed satisfaction on a visual analogue scale of 0–100 (higher score being better) showed a median score of 80 in the isotretinoin group vs. a score of 9 in the placebo group (low‐certainty evidence). Isotretinoin likely improves quality of life, as measured with the Skindex (moderate‐certainty evidence), with scores showing median relative variations of −49.4% in the isotretinoin‐treated group (108 participants) vs. −18.0% in the placebo group (48 participants) (investigators reported a P ‐value of 0.002). Sixty‐two of 108 (57.4%) patients treated with isotretinoin achieved a 90% reduction in inflammatory lesion count vs. five of 48 (10.4%) in the placebo group [RR 5.51, 95% CI 2.37–12.83 (P < 0.001); NNTB 2, 95% CI 2–3; high‐certainty evidence]. The median reduction in lesion count was 13 (92% reduction) in the isotretinoin‐treated group and six lesions in the placebo group (36%). This was supported by the physicians' assessments. Treatment‐related adverse events were more frequently reported in the group treated with isotretinoin [75/108 (69%)] than with placebo [21/48 (44%)] [RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.12–2.24 (P = 0.009); NNTH 4, 95% CI 2–11; moderate‐certainty evidence]. Eczema, cheilitis, dry skin, abdominal pain, myalgias/arthralgias and dry eyes, which are well‐known side‐effects of isotretinoin, were reported in the active treatment group.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^111QKHzm]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Isotretinoin — procedural timing, infection risk, and pregnancy precautions are outlined as follows: Early case series described delayed wound healing or keloid formation with isotretinoin, leading to a recommendation to delay dermabrasion or laser resurfacing until 6 to 12 months after discontinuation; recent small prospective studies did not find atypical scarring with chemical peels or manual dermabrasion, and retrospective studies and case reports demonstrate safety with laser hair removal, pulsed dye laser, and CO2 laser; however, elective procedures should be delayed for 6 to 12 months when possible, with case-by-case consideration. Higher rates of S aureus colonization have been seen with systemic isotretinoin, increasing minor skin infections, and the combination of cheilitis and S aureus colonization can cause lip or perioral abscesses requiring prompt attention. Despite FDA-mandated iPLEDGE enrollment, fetal exposure has not significantly decreased since iPLEDGE, with approximately 150 isotretinoin-exposed pregnancies in the United States each year; nearly one-third of women of child-bearing potential in a US study admitted noncompliance with iPLEDGE pregnancy prevention, including 29% not complying with condom use and 39% missing ≥ 1 contraceptive pill in the prior month. Every woman of child-bearing potential taking isotretinoin should be carefully counseled regarding available contraceptive methods and iPLEDGE requirements at each clinic visit, and patient-independent forms of birth control, including long-acting reversible contraceptives, should be considered whenever appropriate.

### Oral manifestations of COVID-19 disease: a review article [^117LYnb3]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Dysgeusia is the first recognized oral symptom of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In this review article, we described oral lesions of COVID-19 patients. We searched PubMed library and Google Scholar for published literature since December 2019 until September 2020. Finally, we selected 35 articles including case reports, case series and letters to editor. Oral manifestations included ulcer, erosion, bulla, vesicle, pustule, fissured or depapillated tongue, macule, papule, plaque, pigmentation, halitosis, whitish areas, hemorrhagic crust, necrosis, petechiae, swelling, erythema, and spontaneous bleeding. The most common sites of involvement in descending order were tongue (38%), labial mucosa (26%), and palate (22%). Suggested diagnoses of the lesions were aphthous stomatitis, herpetiform lesions, candidiasis, vasculitis, Kawasaki-like, EM-like, mucositis, drug eruption, necrotizing periodontal disease, angina bullosa-like, angular cheilitis, atypical Sweet syndrome, and Melkerson-Rosenthal syndrome. Oral lesions were symptomatic in 68% of the cases. Oral lesions were nearly equal in both genders (49% female and 51% male). Patients with older age and higher severity of COVID-19 disease had more widespread and sever oral lesions. Lack of oral hygiene, opportunistic infections, stress, immunosuppression, vasculitis, and hyper-inflammatory response secondary to COVID-19 are the most important predisposing factors for onset of oral lesions in COVID-19 patients.

### Reproduction of features of the glucagonoma syndrome with continuous intravenous glucagon infusion as therapy for tumor-induced hypoglycemia [^111RkjG7]. Endocrine Practice (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the adverse effects of continuous intravenous infusion of glucagon as therapy for tumor-induced hypoglycemia and to correlate these treatment-related effects with symptoms of endogenous hyper-glucagonemia.

Methods

We reviewed three cases in which patients received continuous glucagon therapy for tumor-induced hypoglycemia and experienced adverse side effects to the treatment. We noted that these adverse events were consistent with changes that are described in the literature as symptoms of the glucagonoma syndrome.

Results

Continuous intravenous glucagon infusion has evolved as a reliable and efficacious modality for the treatment of tumor-induced hypoglycemia. We report the adverse events of venous thromboembolism, necrolytic migratory erythema, and angular cheilitis in conjunction with continuous intravenous glucagon treatment. These complications resemble symptoms that characterize the human model of hyperglucagonemia — the glucagonoma syndrome — which is associated with hyperglucagonemia and alpha-islet cell neoplasms of the pancreas.

Conclusion

Symptoms that characterize the islet cell neoplasm-related glucagonoma syndrome may develop in patients receiving an infusion of exogenous glucagon. This observation lends support to the suggestion that glucagon may have a direct, causative role.

### MASCC / ISOO expert opinion on the management of oral problems in patients with advanced cancer [^1169msFa]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Management

The management of confirmed oral candidosis primarily involves the use of antifungal medication (i.e. polyenes, azoles). However, antifungal medication (especially azoles) should preferably be reserved for patients with laboratory-confirmed oral candidosis (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V), since other oral conditions can have similar features, and antifungal resistance is reported to be common in this group of patients. Importantly, antifungal medication should be combined with treatment of predisposing factors (see above) (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V), since many patients will recur after the course of antifungal medication is completed (due to persistence of predisposing factors).

A variety of topical and systemic antifungal medications are available for treating oral candidosis. The choice of treatment depends on a number of factors (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V): (a) extent of disease – topical agents are appropriate for treating localised disease, whilst systemic agents are more appropriate for treating multifocal/generalised disease; (b) immunocompetence – systemic agents are more appropriate for treating immunosuppressed patients; (c) drug resistance – resistance to the polyenes is uncommon, although resistance to the azoles is relatively common; (d) concomitant disease – azoles have a number of relative/absolute contraindications; (e) concomitant medication – systemic azoles have a number of drug interactions; (f) patient preference; (g) ease of use – topical agents are more difficult to use, and efficacy is dependent on correct usage (i.e. contact with lesions) and (g) patient adherence. (Currently, there is no robust evidence to support the use of single doses of fluconazole in this condition (no guideline possible)).

Other options for patients with recurrent/resistant oral candidosis, or patients with difficulties in using conventional antifungal medication, include chlorhexidine (no guideline possible) and tea tree oil (no guideline possible).

It should be noted that the successful management of denture-related stomatitis (with/without angular cheilitis) depends on a combination of antifungal drug treatment, and disinfection of the denture (see Box 3) (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V). When the patient wears a denture, the denture should be treated as well to prevent reinfection of the oral cavity, e.g. by immersing it in a chlorhexidine mouth rinse.

### Facial bacterial infections: folliculitis [^112XcfYJ]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Facial bacterial infections are most commonly caused by infections of the hair follicles. Wherever pilosebaceous units are found folliculitis can occur, with the most frequent bacterial culprit being Staphylococcus aureus. We review different origins of facial folliculitis, distinguishing bacterial forms from other infectious and non-infectious mimickers. We distinguish folliculitis from pseudofolliculitis and perifolliculitis. Clinical features, etiology, pathology, and management options are also discussed.

### Painful facial, oral, and genital ulcers [^1118kGyS]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old otherwise healthy male presented to the dermatology clinic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with a 2-day history of multiple painful, non-pruritic ulcers in the genital and facial regions, fever, odynophagia, headache, and fatigue. Physical examination revealed pustules and vesicles with central umbilication at the same stage of development and targetoid crusted ulcers on the right inguinal area (Fig 1), base of the penis, right gluteal region, and left cheek along with bilateral painful inguinal adenopathy. The oropharynx showed erythematous patches and erosions with white exudate.

Question 1: Based on the clinical presentation, what is the most likely etiology of the patient's ulcers?
A. Treponema pallidum
B. Monkeypox virus
C. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)
D. Candida albicans
E. Non-infectious inflammation

Answers:
A. Treponema pallidum – Incorrect. Primary syphilis infection is classically characterized by a painless genital ulcer, often associated with non-tender inguinal lymphadenopathy. Serologies for syphilis were negative in this case.
B. Monkeypox virus – Correct. Upon further questioning, the patient reported frequent unprotected sexual intercourse with alternating male partners and recent contact with symptomatic partners. After 7 days, the patient developed additional lesions on the bilateral thighs, face, right anterior neck, and buttocks. Lesions evolved to erosions with overlying crusts, with spontaneous resolution of all lesions after 3 weeks. Monkeypox is a zoonotic Orthopoxvirus. Beginning in May of 2022, a rapid increase in the number of monkeypox cases emerged. Historically, lesions began on the face and spread across the trunk and extremities. In the current outbreak, it has been observed that lesions begin primarily in the genital region in men who have sex with men.
C. HSV – Incorrect. Genital herpes presents as painful grouped vesicles or ulcers. Disseminated HSV could present as facial and genital ulcers in an immunocompromised patient. Serologies for HIV were negative.
D. Candida albicans – Incorrect. Cutaneous candidiasis presents as bright red erythema surrounded by satellite pustules and papules in moist areas. Deep fungal infections can cause genital ulcers but C. albicans is not the typical pathogen.
E. Non-infectious inflammation – Incorrect. Behcet syndrome is characterized by recurrent oral apthae associated with genital ulcers. The precise etiology is unknown, but an autoimmune etiology has been proposed. The classic triad includes uveitis as well.

### Palmoplantar pompholyx secondary to interleukin 17A inhibitor therapy for psoriasis: a case series [^112DLaLE]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Newer antipsoriatic biologics, including interleukin-17 (IL-17) inhibitors have revolutionized the management of moderate to severe psoriasis due to their unprecedented disease control and favorable safety profile. With increased use in the real world, adverse events not previously described in large phase III clinical trials are being recognized. Of interest to dermatologists are those pertaining to the skin.

Eczematous reactions secondary to IL-17 inhibitor therapy used for psoriasis have been increasingly described in the literature, including phenotypic forms such as atopic dermatitis-like, flexural dermatitis, periorbital dermatitis/blepharitis, nose dermatitis, and angular cheilitis. Dyshidrotic eczema or palmoplantar pompholyx has also been described as a rarer variant of such eczematous phenotypes. Pompholyx dermatitis is characterized by vesicles or bullae on the glabrous skin of the palms and soles.

We describe 2 cases of palmoplantar pompholyx reactions occurring in patients treated with the IL-17 inhibitor secukinumab for their psoriasis.

### Eruptive lingual papillitis with household transmission: a prospective clinical study [^116aWnVg]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Eruptive lingual papillitis with household transmission (ELP) is an acute stomatitis of unknown cause occurring in children, with possible spread to one or several members of the family.

Objectives

To verify clinical features and search for clinical characteristics of ELP.

Methods

A prospective case series, including an analysis of epidemiological and clinical factors, was conducted within private paediatric practices in collaboration with a dermatology department at the University Hospital of Nice, France.

Results

Thirty-eight children (21 girls and 17 boys) with clinical criteria of ELP referred from 1 February 2000 to 31 January 2002 were included in the study. Mean age at diagnosis was 3 years and 6 months. Thirty-three children attended day nursery or school. The seasonal distribution of observed cases showed a peak of incidence in spring. The eruption started abruptly. Fever was found in 15 (39%) cases. Difficulties in feeding were observed in all cases; intense salivation in 23 (61%) cases. The glossitis was characterized by inflammatory hypertrophy of the fungiform papillae on the tip and dorsolateral part of the tongue. Enlarged submaxillary or cervical lymph nodes were noted in 16 (42%) cases. Angular cheilitis was observed in four (11%) children. Spontaneous regression of the stomatitis occurred between the second and 15 days of clinical evolution. Mean duration was 7.3 days. Transmission to one or several members of the family was noted in 20 (53%) cases. Recurrence of symptoms was observed in five (13%) children.

Conclusions

This study confirms some clinical characteristics of ELP: localized lesions of the fungiform papillae on the tip and dorsolateral part of the tongue, high frequency of intrafamilial transmission, and possibility of recurrence. This study also showed unsuspected clinical data such as possible occurrence of fever and angular cheilitis. ELP resembles an entity termed 'transient lingual papillitis' or commonly 'lie bumps'. The origin of this eruption remains unknown, but the transmission data could suggest a possible infectious origin.

### The dental management of troublesome twos: renal tubular acidosis and rampant caries [^111YiQqN]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Renal tubular acidosis is a group of disorders in which there is metabolic acidosis due to defect in renal tubular acidification mechanism to maintain normal plasma bicarbonate and blood pH. Irrespective of organ system involved, oral cavity often reflects the disease occurring anywhere in the body. Thus congenital chronic renal diseases, causing acid-base disturbances affects development and structure of the teeth. Chronic renal tubular acidosis causes enamel defects, dental caries, oral candidiasis, angular cheilitis, etc. We hereby present an unusual case report of a 4-year-old boy suffering from renal tubular acidosis associated with rampant caries, whose full mouth rehabilitation has been done.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^113GWcwF]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — diagnostic evaluation emphasizes that a minority of facial paresis/paralysis cases have identifiable causes and should not be treated as Bell's palsy; approximately 70% of facial nerve palsies are Bell's palsy and 30% have other causes, so clinicians should take a comprehensive history, confirm the acute onset of symptoms, document other cranial nerve function, inquire about viral prodrome or hyperacusis and underlying conditions (e.g., prior stroke, brain or parotid tumors, skin cancers of the head/face, trauma, recent infections), and perform a comprehensive physical examination including inspection of the ear canal, tympanic membrane, parotid gland, and head/face/cheek skin, ruling out ear infection, cholesteatoma, and vesicular rashes; atypical presentations (including bilateral facial nerve paresis/paralysis) may warrant additional specialized and more extensive laboratory testing, and clinicians should consider infrequent causes such as Lyme disease in endemic areas, sarcoidosis, Guillain–Barré syndrome, Sjögren's syndrome, and leprosy; Bell's palsy is a diagnosis of exclusion and Table 7 outlines categories and distinguishing features of other causes, with disproportionate presentation among pregnant women and people with diabetes, influenza, a cold, or other upper respiratory illness.

### A longitudinal follow-up of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 [^113fvd57]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Two-thirds of the patients with hypoparathyroidism were diagnosed before the age of 15 years. One young female patient (patient 38) died of seizures at age 3 years, probably from undiagnosed hypoparathyroidism.

Thirty patients with PAI (91%) were diagnosed before age 25 years, including 21 (64%) before the age of 15 years. Two young females died in acute adrenal failure during the follow-up period.

The clinical course of CMC varied from periodic to chronic. Fourteen patients (27%) developed CMC before age 10 years and only three after the age of 30 years. Eleven had angular cheilitis at the time of examination and another 10 reported previous episodes. Eight patients (15%) were diagnosed with candida esophagitis, sometimes without typical symptoms or coexisting oral candidiasis. One patient (patient 34) developed stenosis of the esophagus requiring endoscopic dilation. Twelve of the 31 patients examined by a dentist tested positive for Candida albicans by culture. One patient (patient 51) suffered from severe candida otitis.

Other endocrinopathies

Hypothyroidism was the third most frequent endocrinopathy followed by gonadal failure. No male hypogonadism was found. Diabetes mellitus type 1 was rare (n = 4) and had a relatively late onset.

Oral cavity and teeth

Six of 31 examined patients had extensive composite dental restorations, most probably secondary to underlying enamel defects. Another 18 (72%) had enamel hypoplasia typical for APS1 (Figure 2), and five had enamel hypomineralization without enamel hypoplasia, which could be of different etiology. The enamel hypoplasia varied in extent and location. Nine patients had gingivitis, and eight patients presented pathologically low (below 0.1 mL/min) unstimulated salivary flow.

Figure 2.
Typical enamel hypoplasia in APS1. A, Hypomineralization (white areas on front teeth) and enamel hypoplasia revealed by horizontal hypoplastic bands. B, Severe enamel hypoplasia with loss of normal enamel structure. C, Enamel hypoplasia varying in size and location, affecting both front teeth and molars.

Skin diseases

Vitiligo was variable in extent and location, from spots to almost universal, but was not classified into segmental or nonsegmental forms. The time of diagnosis of alopecia was highly variable, and the clinical picture varied from chronic to periodical.

### Association of oral manifestations with severity of the disease in ulcerative colitis patients [^1179Pwe1]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

In various studies, several oral manifestations have been linked to UC. These include PSV — characterized by pustules and ulcerations on the oral mucosa — Recurrent Aphthous Ulcers (RAU), Atrophic Glossitis (AG) affecting taste perception, Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS), Angular Cheilitis (AC) at the corners of the mouth, Dry Mouth (Xerostomia), altered taste perception, Halitosis (Bad Breath), and an increased risk of periodontitis. These manifestations can sometimes serve as early indicators of UC and are valuable for monitoring patients' health. Dentists and gastroenterologists may not always recognize the potential connection between the severity of gastrointestinal diseases and specific oral lesions in these patients. Consequently, this relationship often remains undiscovered. Poor oral and dental health is linked to a reduced risk of future UC. Patients with Crohn's disease who have proximal gastrointestinal or perineal involvement exhibit a higher incidence of oral lesions, estimated to be between 20% and 50%. Additionally, individuals with moderate and severe UC show a greater prevalence of oral manifestations.

This study investigates the relationship between oral signs and symptoms and disease severity, while also determining the prevalence of such signs and symptoms in these patients.

### Glucagonoma and glucagonoma syndrome: an updated review [^117Nbtma]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Glucagonoma is a rare well‐differentiated slowly proliferating pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour, characterized by several manifestations including necrolytic migratory erythema, weight loss, diabetes and anaemia.

Aim

The purpose of the current review was to acknowledge literature about this rare tumour discerning the clinical features, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of glucagonoma by comparing three different periods.

Results

A study published by Song reviewed 216 cases from studies published between 1999 and 2016, making a comparison with 407 cases reported before 1998 by Soga and Yakuwa. The current review consisted of 86 cases reported in studies published in and after 2017: 40 males and 46 females, with an average age of 48.2 years. The male‐to‐female ratio was 0.87. The rate of typical clinical findings was as follows: NME, 93.2% (69/74); DM, 70.3% (50/74); weight loss, 62.2% (46/74); anaemia, 44.6% (33/74); glossitis or stomatitis or cheilitis, 31.1% (23/74). A total of 85 cases reported the location of the tumour as the pancreas and 38.8% of these cases involved the tail of the pancreas. The average tumour size was 4.6 cm in patients between 2017 and 2024. Metastasis was detected in 52.3% of patients (45/86). The comparison with previous series highlighted an earlier age of diagnosis of glucagonoma and a higher rate of NME, consistent with a higher diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusions

Glucagonoma is a rare pathology, with peculiar characteristics that need to be acknowledged to achieve a timely diagnosis and finally improve patient prognosis.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^115k9ZwP]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Clinical manifestations of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) and esophageal disease in children with HIV are described, including that clinical manifestations of OPC vary and include pseudomembranous (thrush), erythematous (atrophic), hyperplastic (hypertrophic), and angular cheilitis presentations, with thrush appearing as creamy white, curd-like patches on the oropharyngeal mucosa, palate, and tonsils; erythematous OPC characterized by flat erythematous lesions; hyperplastic candidiasis presenting as raised white plaques on the lower surface of the tongue, palate and buccal mucosa that cannot be removed; and angular cheilitis presenting as red fissured lesions in the corners of the mouth. Esophageal candidiasis often presents with odynophagia, dysphagia, or retrosternal pain, and children, unlike adults, often experience nausea and vomiting, so children with esophageal candidiasis may present with dehydration and weight loss, and classic symptoms and signs of OPC may be absent in children with esophageal candidiasis, particularly those receiving ART. New-onset fever in a child with HIV infection who has advanced disease, a central venous catheter, or both is the most common clinical manifestation of candidemia; there are limited clinical signs or symptoms to denote dissemination and detection of end organ involvement is often dependent on radiographic imaging, and renal candidiasis can present with candiduria but ultrasonographic demonstration of renal parenchymal lesions is often not associated with symptoms related to renal disease.
