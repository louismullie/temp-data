## Question

Is vitamin K indicated for osteopenia treatment?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether vitamin K is indicated for the treatment of osteopenia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how osteopenia is defined and what the treatment goals are. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about vitamin K for fracture prevention and bone health. Next, I will appraise randomized trial data on vitamin K and bone outcomes, and reconcile these with mechanistic and observational data. After that, I should consider special populations and safety or drug–nutrient interactions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, evidence-based answer with clear clinical guidance.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: osteopenia reflects low bone mass on DXA and is managed with the aim of mitigating fracture risk, typically through lifestyle measures, calcium and vitamin D adequacy, and pharmacotherapy in appropriately selected higher-risk individuals; I need to ensure I'm not conflating osteopenia with osteoporosis where drug indications are clearer [^116s28Ns] [^117Bg992].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines before jumping to conclusions; the 2023 Canadian osteoporosis guideline explicitly recommends avoiding vitamin K supplementation for the prevention of fractures in postmenopausal women and men, which argues against its routine use in low bone mass states like osteopenia, and major endocrine guidelines emphasize calcium and vitamin D but do not recommend vitamin K for bone health, which I should double-check to avoid overinterpreting silence as endorsement [^111aLwcS] [^1124UKFY] [^116s28Ns] [^111J52a5] [^1113qXWH].

> Hold on, I should verify whether USPSTF or ACOG mention vitamin K in primary fracture prevention; USPSTF addresses vitamin D and calcium with generally insufficient or negative recommendations for routine supplementation and does not include vitamin K, which supports the notion that vitamin K is not part of standard primary prevention, while ACOG focuses on vitamin D sufficiency without endorsing vitamin K either [^112noAMp] [^113WxxFh] [^112UMBRj] [^115rgjSU] [^111aLwcS] [^117Bg992].

> Now, I will appraise the randomized evidence; in older adults receiving adequate calcium and vitamin D, adding phylloquinone 500 µg/day for three years did not improve femoral neck, spine, or total body BMD, and although vitamin K lowers undercarboxylated osteocalcin, a high-quality trial in postmenopausal women showed no change in BMD or bone turnover markers with either K1 or MK-4, while a two-year trial found only a small, site-limited benefit at the ultradistal radius when vitamin K was combined with vitamin D and calcium, suggesting biologic activity that has not translated into consistent, clinically meaningful skeletal benefits [^111CAeMT] [^1112pcnB] [^1174Myto].

> Wait, let me verify the tendency to extrapolate from observational and mechanistic data; lower vitamin K status correlates with lower BMD in some cohorts and with lower bone turnover in girls, and vitamin K clearly γ-carboxylates osteocalcin, but these associations and surrogate changes have not reliably produced fracture or BMD benefits in randomized trials, so I should be cautious not to overweigh non-causal signals or spaceflight analog data that argue against routine K1 supplementation for bone protection on Earth [^114choqq] [^117CQy6e] [^112Q87uV].

> I need to check whether special populations alter the calculus; in dialysis patients, MK‑7 360 µg/day for two years produced mixed site-specific BMD effects — attenuation of lumbar spine loss but accelerated loss at the cortical 1/3 distal radius — with no clear advantage on clinical fractures or vascular calcification endpoints, and expert commentary urges caution given power and design limitations, which means these findings cannot be generalized to community-dwelling adults with osteopenia [^113JDaT6] [^114r1Shs] [^116MK5eJ] [^114vh4BF].

> But wait, what about safety and interactions; I should double-check potential anticoagulant issues and malabsorption risks; MK‑7 can antagonize oral anticoagulants and alter INR control, observational meta-analyses do not show a robust fracture signal with vitamin K antagonists compared to NOACs overall, bile acid sequestrants like colesevelam can impair fat-soluble vitamin absorption including vitamin K, and parenteral phytonadione is indicated for coagulopathy, not bone health, so indiscriminate vitamin K supplementation may complicate anticoagulation without proven osteopenia benefit [^115cx4zc] [^116o6Zwj] [^116PdaRT] [^113UYqoE].

> Let me think about practical management steps I can confidently recommend for osteopenia while I avoid overpromising on vitamin K; ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D intake per guidelines, implement weight-bearing and resistance exercise and fall prevention, and stratify fracture risk to decide on pharmacotherapy when appropriate, recognizing that routine vitamin K supplementation is not supported by guidelines for improving BMD or preventing fractures in osteopenia [^116s28Ns] [^117Bg992] [^112noAMp] [^113WxxFh] [^111aLwcS].

> I should confirm edge cases where correcting deficiency is reasonable even if it is not "treating osteopenia"; in malabsorption states such as cystic fibrosis, or with bile acid sequestrants, targeted vitamin K repletion may be needed for coagulation and possibly bone turnover markers, but evidence for fracture or BMD benefit remains limited, so any use should be individualized and coordinated with anticoagulation management if relevant [^111VwRkW] [^116PdaRT] [^116sfp8G].

> Bottom line, after reviewing guidelines and trials and pausing to reconsider mechanistic appeal versus clinical outcomes, vitamin K is not indicated as a routine treatment for osteopenia to improve BMD or prevent fractures; prioritize guideline-based measures and reserve vitamin K for correcting true deficiency or managing coagulopathy, not as an osteopenia therapy [^111aLwcS] [^111CAeMT] [^1112pcnB] [^116s28Ns].

No, vitamin K is **not indicated** for osteopenia treatment [^111aLwcS]. Current evidence shows **no consistent benefit** of vitamin K supplementation on bone mineral density or fracture risk in osteopenia, and major guidelines do not recommend it for this purpose [^1124UKFY]. Vitamin K may be considered only in confirmed deficiency or malabsorption, not as routine therapy for osteopenia [^111VwRkW].

## Clinical evidence on vitamin K and bone health

### Observational studies

Observational studies link low vitamin K status to lower BMD [^114choqq] and higher fracture risk [^112Ynw4B], but these associations **do not establish causality**.

---

### Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)

- RCTs in older adults show vitamin K1 supplementation improves carboxylation of osteocalcin [^111CAeMT] but **does not significantly affect BMD or fracture risk**.

- The renaKvit trial in dialysis patients [^114r1Shs] found MK-7 prevented lumbar spine BMD loss [^113JDaT6] but accelerated distal radius BMD loss, with **no overall fracture benefit** [^111ZwuWQ] [^114vh4BF].

- A meta-analysis of 36 RCTs [^1177k3C7] found **no significant effect** of vitamin K on vertebral fracture incidence in postmenopausal or osteoporotic patients.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- The 2023 Canadian osteoporosis guideline explicitly **recommends against vitamin K supplementation** for fracture prevention [^111aLwcS].

- The 2023 Osteoporosis Canada guideline similarly **advises against vitamin K** for fracture prevention in men [^1124UKFY].

- **No major guideline endorses** vitamin K supplementation for osteopenia treatment [^111aLwcS].

---

## Safety considerations and interactions

Vitamin K is generally safe, but high-dose K2 (MK-7) may **interfere with warfarin** [^115cx4zc] and other vitamin K antagonists, requiring careful monitoring. It can also interact with anticoagulants, potentially **altering INR and bleeding risk** [^115L1gfA].

---

## Comparison with established osteopenia treatments

Compared with established therapies (calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonates, denosumab [^114CjqSN], teriparatide [^111yHpAZ]), which have robust evidence for improving BMD and reducing fractures, vitamin K **lacks consistent evidence** for meaningful BMD or fracture benefits in osteopenia.

---

## Specific patient populations

Vitamin K may be considered in confirmed deficiency or malabsorption [^116PdaRT] (e.g. cystic fibrosis [^111VwRkW], inflammatory bowel disease [^116sfp8G]), but **not as routine osteopenia therapy**.

---

## Current research gaps and future directions

More large, **well-designed RCTs are needed** to clarify vitamin K's role in osteopenia — including optimal forms, doses, and durations — and to identify subgroups (e.g. vitamin K deficiency) that might benefit from supplementation [^117X1ofx].

---

Vitamin K is **not indicated** for osteopenia treatment due to **insufficient evidence** of benefit [^1177k3C7]. It may be considered only in confirmed deficiency or malabsorption, not as routine therapy.

### Vitamin K, vertebral fractures, vascular calcifications, and mortality: Vitamin K Italian (VIKI) dialysis study [^114eDggS]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2012). Low credibility.

Vitamin K (vitamin K1 or phylloquinone and vitamin K2, a series of menaquinones [MKs]) is involved in the production of bone and matrix amino acid γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) proteins, regulating bone and vascular calcification. Low vitamin K concentrations are associated with increased risks of fractures and vascular calcification, frequent complications in hemodialysis patients. We carried out an observational study to establish the prevalence of vitamin K deficiency and to assess the relationship between vitamin K status, vertebral fractures, vascular calcification, and survival in 387 patients on hemodialysis for ≥ 1 year. We determined plasma levels of vitamin K compound, bone-Gla-protein, matrix-Gla-protein, and routine biochemistry. Vertebral fractures (reduction in vertebral body height by ≥ 20%) and aortic and iliac calcifications were also investigated using a spine (D(5)-L(4)) radiograph. Three-year patient survival was analyzed.

Important proportions of patients had a deficiency of MK7 (35.4%), vitamin K1 (23.5%), and MK4 (14.5%). A total of 55.3% of patients had vertebral fractures, 80.6% had abdominal aorta calcification, and 56.1% had iliac calcification. Vitamin K1 deficiency was the strongest predictor of vertebral fractures (odds ratio [OR], 2.94; 95% confidence interval, 1.38–6.26). MK4 deficiency was a predictor of aortic calcification (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.14–7.01), whereas MK5 deficiency actually protected against it (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.15–0.95). MK7 deficiency was a predictor of iliac calcification (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.03–2.60).

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: Current evidence and outstanding questions [^116THhCZ]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Many RCTs have been performed with vitamin D, usually combined with calcium, focusing on BMD and fractures as outcome criteria. The effects on BMD are most evident at the femoral neck, showing an average increase of +0.8% (range, 0.2% to 1.4%) according to a recent meta-analysis. However, this meta-analysis did not include the Lyon clinical trial. In this trial, conducted in a very vitamin D-deficient population, the difference in total hip BMD between the vitamin D and the control group was 7.3%.

In the large VIDA study of adults in New Zealand (mean age, 69 years; mean baseline serum 25OHD, 56 nmol/L), a modest increase in BMD at the femoral neck (+0.5%) was observed in the group treated with 100,000 IU of vitamin D3 per month for 2 years. In the subgroup with a baseline serum 25OHD < 30 nmol/L, BMD remained stable during the 2 years in vitamin D-supplemented subjects, whereas a 2% decrease was observed in the control group. The effect of vitamin D on fracture incidence was studied in at least 19 RCTs. In these trials, vitamin D was administered at different intervals, ranging from daily to once per year.

- **Vitamin D alone trials**: In five trials, vitamin D was given alone. In two of these, a significant decrease in fracture incidence was observed, either with an annual injection or with a 4-monthly oral dose. The other three trials with vitamin D alone were negative.

- **Vitamin D and calcium combined trials**: In 13 RCTs, vitamin D and calcium were combined. The greatest effect was observed in the first trial in a very deficient French nursing home population (mean age, 84 years) treated with vitamin D3 (800 IU/d) and calcium (1200 mg/d) versus double placebo.

### Is supplementation of vitamin D beneficial for fracture healing? A short review of the literature [^112GNaJJ]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

There has been a surge of interest regarding the benefits of vitamin D supplementation to prevent fractures. But can it also make them heal more quickly once they have occurred — that is, is supplementation of vitamin D beneficial for fracture healing? We found 13 studies that met our inclusion criteria; 11 of these were performed in animals. Two animal studies showed negative results, 2 showed neutral results, and 7 showed positive results. One clinical case series in humans was inconclusive in our opinion, and one randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial showed that supplementation of vitamin D3 and calcium in elderly women with reduced bone mass and a proximal humerus fracture had a positive influence on bone healing. The major weakness of the latter study is the low number of participants. A clear statement on the benefits of vitamin D for fracture healing awaits further trials, but all types of fractures in elderly individuals indicate the need for secondary prevention and the implementation of appropriate guidelines concerning falls, vitamin D, and osteoporosis.

### Vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling adults: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112noAMp]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for postmenopausal osteoporosis, specifically concerning calcium supplementation, the USPSTF 2018 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to assess the balance of the benefits and harms of daily calcium supplementation at doses greater than 1,000 mg for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal females.

### Short-term and long-term effects of osteoporosis therapies [^114CjqSN]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Progress continues to be made in the development of therapeutics for fracture prevention. Bisphosphonates are now available orally and intravenously, often as inexpensive generics, and remain the most widely used interventions for osteoporosis. The major safety concern associated with the use of bisphosphonates is the development of femoral shaft stress fractures, and although rare, this adverse event affords the principal rationale for restricting bisphosphonate therapy to those individuals with femoral T-scores for more than five years.

Newer antiresorptive therapies, in the form of denosumab and cathepsin K inhibitors, might increase efficacy and possibly circumvent some of the safety concerns associated with bisphosphonate use, such as gastrointestinal and renal complications. The combination of teriparatide with antiresorptives markedly increases effects on BMD, and new anabolic agents are also very promising in this regard. However, whether or not these changes in BMD translate into improved efficacy of fracture prevention remains to be determined.

Vitamin D is important for the prevention of osteomalacia but does not influence BMD or fracture risk in patients not deficient in vitamin D. The balance of risks and benefits of calcium supplementation is contentious, but patients should be encouraged to adhere to a balanced diet aimed at maintaining a healthy body weight. Consideration of a patient's risk of falling, and its mitigation, are also important.

### Health effects of vitamin and mineral supplements [^116FLEB6]. BMJ (2020). Low credibility.

Recent evidence regarding the effects of vitamin D and calcium supplementation is inconsistent. A meta-analysis of trials in community-living older adults found that vitamin D or calcium supplementation did not reduce the risk of hip fracture or total fracture. In contrast, another meta-analysis reported that while vitamin D alone did not reduce fracture risk, combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation decreased the relative risk of hip fracture by 16% and all fractures by 6% among older adults. Ongoing research is assessing the effect of high-dose vitamin D supplements on several health outcomes, including fractures. However, a recent three-year trial of 400, 4000, or 10,000 IU/day reported that the higher doses reduced volumetric bone density, suggesting potential for harm. In the absence of clear evidence on supplementation, it is prudent to ensure that dietary recommendations on calcium and vitamin D intakes are met through food and supplementation.

### Effect of supplementation with vitamins D3 and K2 on undercarboxylated osteocalcin and insulin serum levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial [^114yR7fH]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). High credibility.

The secretion of insulin depends on the availability of calcium and adequate concentrations of vitamin D. For this reason, vitamin D deficiency would lead to deterioration in the use of glucose; it is also for this reason that supplementation with this vitamin contributes to an improvement in insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduction in circulating glucose levels, as was observed in our study. This indicates that supplementation with vitamin D could be considered a possible adjunctive therapy in the integral management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Notably, all three groups demonstrated improvements in HOMA-IR, the percentage of functional pancreatic beta cells, and glucose levels, with all groups reaching serum glucose concentrations below 200 mg/dL. These changes could decrease comorbidities and mortality among this group of individuals while also improving quality of life.

After three months of treatment, an increase in the cOC concentration was observed in all studied groups. However, only in the total population and the group with vitamin K2 supplementation was this increase statistically significant. This could be explained by the action of vitamins D3 and K2 on the mineral deposits in the bone and by the role of vitamin K2 as a coenzyme of carboxylases during the carboxylation of osteocalcin.

Vitamin D3 administration significantly decreased the concentration of uOC at the end of treatment. It should be remembered that bone resorption is the main mechanism of release of uOC from the bone, which is produced by the acidic pH generated by the acid hydrolases of the osteoclasts.

### Vitamin K: Key vitamin in controlling vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease [^111XtzNx]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Vascular calcification has emerged as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, especially in chronic kidney disease. Deficiencies in calcium-regulatory proteins directly relate to the development of calcifications. McCabe and colleagues report that vitamin K is a key regulator of vascular calcification via carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent proteins such as matrix Gla protein. Knowledge about vitamin K status may propel therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat vascular calcification with high vitamin K supplementation.

### Risk of osteoporosis in patients with atrial fibrillation using non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants or warfarin [^112e6VmK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

In our study, we used a large-scale cohort study design with a long-term follow-up duration and comprehensive analyses. Our study not only performed comparisons of osteoporosis risk between all NOACs and warfarin, but also compared specific NOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban) with warfarin and with each other. Our findings provide stronger and more comprehensive evidence for the association between osteoporosis and the different OACs.

- **Subanalysis**: Of note, in our subanalysis for each specific NOAC, a significantly lower osteoporosis risk was observed only in the rivaroxaban and apixaban subgroups, but not in the dabigatran subgroup, when compared with that in warfarin users. This finding appears to be incompatible with that of a previous study that found dabigatran, compared with warfarin, to be associated with lower fracture risks. Because of the undetermined fracture mechanism in that study (as mentioned above), as well as the retrospective cohort study design used in both that study and ours, we suggest that further prospective studies, including randomized controlled trials in which detailed bone mineral density data and fracture mechanisms are included, should be conducted in the future.

Although the exact mechanisms underlying the association between a lower osteoporosis risk and NOAC use compared with warfarin are not well understood, there are some possible explanations. Previous studies have indicated that warfarin may interfere with processes that contribute to bone formation because of its antagonistic actions against vitamin K.

### Vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling adults: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^113WxxFh]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for postmenopausal osteoporosis, specifically concerning vitamin D supplementation, the USPSTF 2018 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to assess the balance of the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation of more than 400 IU/day for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal females.

### Welchol [^116PdaRT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Vitamin K or fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies**: Welchol may decrease the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Patients who are susceptible to deficiencies of vitamin K, such as those on warfarin or with malabsorption syndromes, may be at increased risk when taking Welchol. Patients on oral vitamin supplementation should take their vitamins at least 4 hours prior to Welchol [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Drug interactions**: Welchol reduces gastrointestinal absorption of some drugs. Administer drugs with known interactions at least 4 hours prior to Welchol [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Due to the potential for decreased absorption of other drugs that have not been tested for interaction, especially those with a narrow therapeutic index, consider administering them at least 4 hours prior to Welchol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Risks in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU)**: Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with PKU. Welchol for oral suspension contains phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each 3.75 gram packet contains 27 mg of phenylalanine. Before prescribing Welchol for oral suspension to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including Welchol for oral suspension.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: An Endocrine Society guideline update [^116s28Ns]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to calcium supplementation, the ES 2020 guidelines recommend offering daily calcium supplementation to prevent hip fractures in postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis at high risk of fractures who are unable to tolerate bisphosphonates, estrogen, selective estrogen response modulators, denosumab, tibolone, teriparatide, and abaloparatide.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: Current evidence and outstanding questions [^113h4Daw]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Many meta-analyses have evaluated the effect of vitamin D on BMD and fracture incidence. The outcomes of meta-analyses vary greatly. In general, the meta-analyses show that the effect of vitamin D is greater when (1) given to older individuals (70 to 80 years or ≥ 80 years) than to younger subjects (60 to 70 years), (2) given to those in a residential care setting rather than independently living elderly, or (3) the daily dose is at least 800 IU, or when baseline serum 25OHD is low.

- **Systematic review and meta-analysis**: The Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis stated that vitamin D alone is unlikely to be effective in preventing hip fracture or any new fracture. However, it also showed that combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation induces a 16% decrease in hip fracture risk, a 14% decrease in new nonvertebral fracture risk, and a 5% decrease in the risk for any fracture. To avoid one hip fracture, 1000 older persons must be treated for 1 year. Treatment is much more efficacious in high-risk persons, such as the institutionalized, where approximately 110 persons must be treated for 1 year to save one hip fracture. This number decreases further when other nonvertebral fractures are included.

- **Side effects**: Side effects of calcium and vitamin D include hypercalcemia (rare) and renal stones. Mortality decreases by 6%, but this was not significant. One meta-analysis concluded that the effect was trivial as the decrease in fracture incidence was not greater than 15%. However, it may be argued that a 10% to 15% decrease in fracture incidence is considerable, as this therapy can be implemented in a very large number of subjects at risk, at very low cost.

### Vitamin D and bone health in postmenopausal women [^111z9NC4]. Journal of Women's Health (2003). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis, a disease of increased skeletal fragility, is becoming increasingly common as the U.S. population ages. Adequate vitamin D and calcium intake is the cornerstone of osteoporosis prevention and treatment. Age-related changes in vitamin D and calcium metabolism increase the risk of vitamin D insufficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Although longitudinal data have suggested a role of vitamin D intake in modulating bone loss in perimenopausal women, studies of vitamin D and calcium supplementation have failed to support a significant effect during early menopause. There is a clearer benefit in vitamin D and calcium supplementation in older postmenopausal women. Vitamin D intake between 500 and 800 IU daily, with or without calcium supplementation, has been shown to increase bone mineral density (BMD) in women with a mean age of approximately 63 years.

In women older than 65, there is even more benefit with vitamin D intakes of between 800 and 900 IU daily and 1200–1300 mg of calcium daily, with increased bone density, decreased bone turnover, and decreased nonvertebral fractures. The decreases in nonvertebral fractures may also be influenced by vitamin D-mediated decreases in body sway and fall risk. There are insufficient available data supporting a benefit from vitamin D supplementation alone, without calcium, to prevent osteoporotic fracture in postmenopausal women.

### Vitamin K supplementation and bone mineral density in dialysis: Results of the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled RenaKvit trial [^114r1Shs]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

In the present randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the effects on bone of daily supplementation with 360 µg vitamin K2 (MK-7) were compared with placebo in 123 patients receiving chronic dialysis treatment. In the ITT analysis, an accelerated BMD loss of the 1/3 distal radius was observed with MK-7 supplementation compared with placebo, whereas the decrease in lumbar spine BMD observed in the placebo-supplemented participants was prevented with MK-7. The RenaKvit trial is the first to investigate the effect of vitamin K supplementation on BMD in patients on dialysis treatment.

Surprisingly, we found the primary outcome, BMD of the 1/3 distal radius, to decrease approximately 3% after 2 years of MK-7 supplementation compared with placebo, whereas BMD of the remaining distal radius sites was unaffected. However, these findings could not be confirmed in per protocol analysis. This may be because the participants able to complete the study represent only a subgroup of participants not randomly distributed between the groups. It may also be due to a type 1 statistical error in the ITT analysis.

Four randomized studies, all in postmenopausal women with no kidney impairment, have examined the 2-year effect of vitamin K supplementation on distal radius BMD. One open-label study in 396 Japanese women examined the 1/3 distal radius and found a reduced BMD loss with supplements of vitamin K2 (MK-4) compared with no treatment. Another open-label, non-placebo-controlled study found an increase in ultradistal radius BMD with vitamin K supplementation compared with vita…

### Effect on bone anabolic markers of daily cheese intake with and without vitamin K: a randomised clinical trial [^116WrB82]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2022). High credibility.

Vitamin K is important for bone health, and low intake of vitamin K has been associated with increased risk of fractures. Supplementation with vitamin K2, vitamin D, and calcium is a recommended first-line treatment for osteoporosis. Vitamin K2 is essential for the carboxylation or activation of Gla proteins. Osteocalcin is one of the 17 Gla proteins in humans, and carboxylated osteocalcin has a key role in bone formation and maintenance. The ratio between circulating carboxylated and undercarboxylated osteocalcin reflects the extrahepatic vitamin K status.

Vitamin K2, or menaquinone (MK), has many variants. The short-chained MK-4 can be formed from vitamin K1 in humans and is found in animal products such as liver. The long-chained vitamin K2 vitamers like MK-7, MK-8, MK-9, and MK-9(4H) are of bacterial origin and occur in certain fermented foods such as cheese. These variants have greater extrahepatic activity than MK-4 and vitamin K1, possibly due to more efficient uptake and much longer serum half-life. Prospective cohort studies have demonstrated health benefits that can be attributed to the intake of vitamin K2, but not K1. In the Western diet, cheese is the major source of long-chained vitamin K2.

MK-9 is the most important K2 vitamer in cheese, but the amount varies considerably. Some cheeses also contain MK-9(4H), and Jarlsberg cheese is particularly rich in both MK-9 and MK-9(4H). This cheese is made with lactic acid bacteria producing MK-8 and MK-9 and Propionibacterium freudenreichii producing MK-9(4H).

### Efficacy of vitamin K on bone fragility: Puzzling findings from which we should learn how to design a rigorous study [^117X1ofx]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

In conclusion, while RCTs in the general population indicate that PK or MK4 confer bone protective effects, findings in CKD patients seem to be more puzzling. The latter may be related to the fact that the pathophysiology of bone disease in CKD is complex and that changing one risk factor does not necessarily translate into improved skeletal outcomes. Alternatively, heterogeneous findings may be due to shortcomings in study design, in part related to incomplete knowledge of the metabolism of vitamin K in CKD. Importantly, not all types of vitamin K are equal. The present study, with negative findings, thus should not temper enthusiasm, but rather, should help in designing the ideal trial to answer the clinically highly relevant question of whether vitamin K supplementation prevents bone fractures and/or attenuates the progression of vascular calcification.

### New and emerging treatments for osteoporosis [^116nZj4E]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

A variety of new treatments for osteoporosis have become available within the last several years, and a number of emerging treatments remain in late clinical stage development. New and emerging treatments include more potent members or more convenient formulations of existing classes of therapy, but a number of the emerging treatments are first-generation compounds addressing specific therapeutic targets based on recent advances in understanding of basic bone biology. These new and emerging treatments include agents with anticatabolic effects, compounds with anabolic effects, and one agent possibly containing both anticatabolic and anabolic effects. The increasing variety of new and emerging treatments increases the possibility that effective therapy will be targeted to the specific needs of the individual patient.

### Assessment of vitamin K levels in women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy [^115Hz2Er]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

There is not enough evidence in the literature to characterize the effects of vitamin K during pregnancy. Vitamin K's effects on chronic renal disease, coronary heart disease, osteodystrophy, osteoporosis, and other disorders have been well-researched in the general population. Furthermore, there is evidence of a probable involvement for hypovitaminosis K in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, although further research is required. At the same time, because vitamin K is required for bone metabolism, it has been used as a safe treatment for pregnancy-related osteoporosis. Vitamin K2 has been demonstrated to suppress some cancer cells without causing side effects, making it a promising chemical for cancer prevention and treatment. Vitamin K2 has been shown in clinical tests to have the potential to improve the prognosis of cancer patients.

### Vitamin k treatment reduces undercarboxylated osteocalcin but does not alter bone turnover, density, or geometry in healthy postmenopausal North American women [^1112pcnB]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2009). Low credibility.

Low vitamin K status is associated with low BMD and increased fracture risk. Additionally, a specific menaquinone, menatetrenone (MK4), may reduce fracture risk. However, whether vitamin K plays a role in the skeletal health of North American women remains unclear. Moreover, various K vitamers (e.g. phylloquinone and MK4) may have differing skeletal effects. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of phylloquinone or MK4 treatment on markers of skeletal turnover and BMD in nonosteoporotic, postmenopausal, North American women.

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 381 postmenopausal women received phylloquinone (1 mg daily), MK4 (45 mg daily), or placebo for 12 months. All participants received daily calcium and vitamin D(3) supplementation. Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSALP) and n-telopeptide of type 1 collagen (NTX) were measured at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Lumbar spine and proximal femur BMD and proximal femur geometry were measured by DXA at baseline, and at 6 and 12 months.

At baseline, the three treatment groups did not differ in demographics or study endpoints. Compliance with calcium, phylloquinone, and MK4 treatment was 93%, 93%, and 87%, respectively. Phylloquinone and MK4 treatment reduced serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin but did not alter BSALP or NTX. No effect of phylloquinone or MK4 on lumbar spine or proximal femur BMD or proximal femur geometric parameters was observed. This study does not support a role for vitamin K supplementation in osteoporosis prevention among healthy, postmenopausal, North American women.

### Vitamin K status in spaceflight and ground-based models of spaceflight [^112Q87uV]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

Aside from any association with spaceflight, a low vitamin K status is often associated with lower bone mass in observational studies. However, the preponderance of randomized clinical trials in men and women suggests that phylloquinone supplementation has no impact on age-related bone loss under conditions of normal gravity (that is, on the ground). One suggestion for the discrepancy between the findings of observational studies and the clinical trials is that vitamin K intake tracks a healthy lifestyle, and hence there is a lower risk for bone loss. This inconclusiveness of the ground-based data on phylloquinone supplementation for bone protection further supports the idea that supplementation during spaceflight for mitigation of bone loss is not warranted at this time.

The vitamin K supplementation case study was conducted on the Russian space station Mir in 1995, and the food system was composed entirely of Russian foods. On the ISS, and on Mir flights when US crew members were aboard, the food system was about half American space food and half Russian space food. Whether this difference affected vitamin K intakes is impossible to know, but the supplement administered in the Russian space study contained 10 mg/day, which, given its high dose, would have superseded any dietary effects on measures of vitamin K status.

Although the initial goals and hypotheses of the bed rest studies presented here did not include the study of vitamin K status in particular, we presented the data here as evidence supporting the spaceflight data. Bed rest is a well-accepted model for certain conditions.

### Two-year randomized controlled trial of vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) and vitamin D3 plus calcium on the bone health of older women [^1174Myto]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). High credibility.

Dietary supplementation with vitamin K(1), vitamin D(3), and calcium, or their combination was examined in healthy older women during a 2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The combination of vitamin K with vitamin D plus calcium was associated with a modest but significant increase in bone mineral content (BMC) at the ultradistal radius, but not at other sites in the hip or radius.

- **Introduction**: The putative beneficial role of high dietary vitamin K(1) (phylloquinone) on bone mineral density (BMD) and the possibility of interactive benefits with vitamin D were studied in a 2-year double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in healthy Scottish women aged 60 years and older.

- **Materials and methods**: Healthy, nonosteoporotic women (n = 244) were randomized to receive either (1) placebo, (2) 200 micrograms/day vitamin K(1), (3) 10 micrograms (400 IU) vitamin D(3) plus 1000 mg calcium/day, or (4) combined vitamins K(1) and D(3) plus calcium. Baseline and 6-month measurements included DXA bone mineral scans of the hip and wrist, markers of bone turnover, and vitamin status. Supplementation effects were tested using multivariate general linear modeling, with full adjustment for baseline and potential confounding variables.

- **Results**: Significant bone mineral loss was observed only at the mid-distal radius, with no significant difference between groups. However, women who took combined vitamin K and vitamin D plus calcium showed a significant and sustained increase in both BMD and BMC at the ultradistal radius. Serum status indicators responded significantly to respective supplementation with vitamins K and D.

### Phytonadione [^113UYqoE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Clinical pharmacology**: Phytonadione injectable emulsion, an aqueous colloidal solution of vitamin K1 for parenteral injection, possesses the same type and degree of activity as naturally occurring vitamin K. It is necessary for the production, via the liver, of active prothrombin (factor II), proconvertin (factor VII), plasma thromboplastin component (factor IX), and Stuart factor (factor X). Vitamin K serves as an essential cofactor for a microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the post-translational carboxylation of multiple, specific, peptide-bound glutamic acid residues in inactive hepatic precursors of factors II, VII, IX, and X. The resulting gamma-carboxy-glutamic acid residues convert the precursors into active coagulation factors, which are subsequently secreted by liver cells into the blood.

	- In normal animals and humans, phytonadione is virtually devoid of activity. However, in animals and humans deficient in vitamin K, the pharmacological action of vitamin K is related to its normal physiological function, namely, to promote the hepatic biosynthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: The action of the aqueous dispersion, when administered intravenously, is generally detectable within an hour or two, and hemorrhage is usually controlled within 3 to 6 hours. A normal INR may often be obtained in 12 to 14 hours.

- **Pharmacokinetics**:
	- **Absorption**: Phytonadione is readily absorbed following intramuscular administration.
	- **Distribution**: After absorption, phytonadione is initially concentrated in the liver.

### Osteoporosis: The role of micronutrients [^116b7jSy]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis and low bone mass are currently estimated to be major public health threats. Adequate nutrition plays a critical role in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. The micronutrients of greatest importance are calcium and vitamin D. Calcium has been shown to have beneficial effects on bone mass at all ages, although the results are not always consistent. Higher doses than the US recommendation (600 IU) of vitamin D in the elderly (age ≥ 65 years) may actually be required for optimal bone health (800–1000 IU/day).

The elderly can clearly benefit from increased vitamin D intakes; however, the potential importance of vitamin D in peak bone mass is just being investigated. Vitamin D has been related to falls, with supplementation reducing the number of falls. There are clear fracture benefits demonstrated in randomized clinical trials of calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Other micronutrient needs for optimizing bone health can be easily met by a healthy diet high in fruits and vegetables. This ensures adequate intakes of magnesium, potassium, vitamin C, vitamin K, and other potentially important nutrients.

Healthcare professionals need to be aware of the importance of adequate calcium and vitamin D intakes (easily monitored by serum 25(OH)D) for optimal bone health, as well as the prevention of falls and fractures. In addition, a healthy diet that includes five servings a day of fruits and vegetables should optimize the intake of micronutrients required for bone health.

### Associations between vitamin K biochemical measures and bone mineral density in men and women [^114choqq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Few data exist on the association between vitamin K status and bone mineral density (BMD) in men and women of varying ages. We examined cross-sectional associations between biochemical measures of vitamin K status and BMD at the hip and spine in 741 men and 863 women (mean age, 59 years; range, 32–86 years) who participated in the Framingham Heart Study (1996–2000). Vitamin K status was assessed by plasma phylloquinone and percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%ucOC).

Among the men, low plasma phylloquinone concentrations adjusted for triglycerides and elevated serum %ucOC levels were associated with low BMD at the femoral neck (P = 0.03 and 0.009, respectively). Among postmenopausal women not using estrogen replacements, low plasma phylloquinone concentrations were associated with low spine BMD (P = 0.007), with a nonsignificant trend of an elevated serum %ucOC with low spine BMD (P = 0.08). In contrast, there were no significant associations between biochemical measures of vitamin K and BMD in either premenopausal women or postmenopausal women using estrogen replacements.

Clinical trials are required to isolate any putative effects of vitamin K on rates of bone loss. The target population in these trials, particularly in regard to estrogen use, may be critical, as suggested by the findings of this study.

### Vitamin K supplementation for cystic fibrosis [^111VwRkW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Malabsorption and deficiency of fat-soluble vitamin K may occur in cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder affecting multiple organs. Vitamin K plays an important role in both blood coagulation and bone formation, necessitating a review of its supplementation for individuals in this category. This paper presents an updated version of the review.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of vitamin K supplementation in people with cystic fibrosis and investigate the hypothesis that vitamin K will decrease deficiency-related coagulopathy, increase bone mineral density, decrease the risk of fractures, and improve quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis. The study also aims to determine the optimal dose and route of administration of vitamin K for both routine and therapeutic use.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register was searched, including references from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. The most recent search was conducted on 12 August 2019.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials of all preparations of vitamin K used as a supplement, compared to either no supplementation (or placebo), at any dose or route and for any duration, in patients with cystic fibrosis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details, and assessed their risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE criteria.

- **Main results**: Three trials involving a total of 70 participants, aged 8 to 46 years, were included.

### Vitamin K, bone turnover, and bone mass in girls [^117CQy6e]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Vitamin K has been suggested to have a role in bone metabolism, and low vitamin K intake has been related to low bone density and increased risk of osteoporotic fracture.

- **Objective**: The objective of this study was to determine whether phylloquinone (vitamin K(1)) intake and biochemical indicators of vitamin K status are related to bone mineral content (BMC) and markers of bone formation and bone resorption in girls.

- **Design**: Vitamin K status [plasma phylloquinone concentration and percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%ucOC)] was measured at baseline in a study of 245 healthy girls aged 3–16 years. Cross-linked N-telopeptide of type 1 collagen (NTx) breakdown, osteocalcin, and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase were measured to reflect bone resorption and formation. BMC of the total body, lumbar spine, and hip, along with dietary phylloquinone intake, were measured annually for four years.

- **Results**: Phylloquinone intake (median: 45 micrograms/day) was not consistently associated with bone turnover markers or BMC. Better vitamin K status (high plasma phylloquinone and low %ucOC) was associated with lower bone resorption and formation. Plasma phylloquinone was inversely associated with NTx and osteocalcin concentrations (P < 0.05), and %ucOC was positively associated with NTx and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase concentrations (P < 0.05). Indicators of vitamin K status were not consistently associated with BMC or gain in BMC over the four-year study period.

- **Conclusions**: Better vitamin K status was associated with decreased bone turnover in healthy girls consuming a typical US diet.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between vitamin K antagonist use and fracture [^116o6Zwj]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) anticoagulant use is suspected to increase the risk of bone fracture through inhibition of vitamin K-dependent cofactors of bone formation, an effect not seen with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). The purpose of our systematic review and meta-analysis is to investigate the association between VKA use and fracture.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for studies analyzing fracture in adults using VKAs versus controls. Two authors independently reviewed articles. We assessed for risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and calculated pooled effects using random effects models.

- **Results**: We included 23 articles (22 observational studies and 1 randomized controlled trial), studying 1,121,582 subjects. There was no increased odds of fracture in VKA users versus controls (pooled OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.89, 1.14) or in VKA users versus NOAC users (pooled OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.78, 1.15). Subjects using a VKA for 1 year or longer did not have increased odds of fracture (pooled OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.90, 1.27). Compared to controls, there was increased odds of fracture in women (pooled OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02, 1.21) and older VKA users (≥ 65) (pooled OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01, 1.14).

- **Discussion**: We found no increase in odds of fracture in VKA users versus controls or NOAC users. There was a small increase in odds of fracture among female and elderly VKA users, which may not be clinically important when accounting for other considerations in choosing an anticoagulant.

### Vitamin K-containing dietary supplements: Comparison of synthetic vitamin K1 and natto-derived menaquinone-7 [^115cx4zc]. Blood (2007). Low credibility.

Vitamin K is a cofactor in the production of blood coagulation factors in the liver, osteocalcin in bone, and matrix Gla protein in cartilage and vessel walls. Accumulating evidence suggests that for optimal bone and vascular health, relatively high intakes of vitamin K are required. The synthetic short-chain vitamin K1 is commonly used in food supplements, but recently, the natural long-chain menaquinone-7 (MK-7) has also become available as an over-the-counter (OTC) supplement.

The purpose of this paper was to compare, in healthy volunteers, the absorption and efficacy of K1 and MK-7. Serum vitamin K species were used as a marker for absorption, and osteocalcin carboxylation as a marker for activity. Both K1 and MK-7 were absorbed well, with peak serum concentrations at 4 hours after intake. A major difference between the two vitamin K species is the very long half-life time of MK-7, resulting in much more stable serum levels and accumulation of MK-7 to higher levels (7- to 8-fold) during prolonged intake.

MK-7 induced more complete carboxylation of osteocalcin, and hematologists should be aware that preparations supplying 50 µg/day or more of MK-7 may interfere with oral anticoagulant treatment in a clinically relevant way.

### Effect of vitamin K supplementation on bone loss in elderly men and women [^111CAeMT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Vitamin K has been implicated in bone health, primarily in observational studies. However, little is known about the role of phylloquinone supplementation on the prevention of bone loss in men and women.

- **Objective**: The objective of this study was to determine the effect of a 3-year phylloquinone supplementation on the change in bone mineral density (BMD) of the femoral neck bone in older men and women who were calcium and vitamin D replete.

- **Design, participants, and intervention**: In this 3-year, double-blind, controlled trial, 452 men and women (aged 60–80 years) were randomized equally to receive a multivitamin that contained either 500 µg/day phylloquinone or no phylloquinone, plus a daily calcium supplement (600 mg elemental calcium) and vitamin D supplement (400 IU).

- **Main outcome measures**: Measurements of the femoral neck, spine (L2-L4), and total-body BMD, bone turnover, and vitamin K and D status were measured every 6–12 months. Intent-to-treat analysis was used to compare changes in measurements among 401 participants who completed the trial.

- **Results**: There were no differences in changes in BMD measurements at any of the anatomical sites measured between the two groups. The group that received the phylloquinone supplement had significantly higher phylloquinone levels and significantly lower percent undercarboxylated osteocalcin concentrations compared with the group that did not receive phylloquinone. No other biochemical measures differed between the two groups.

- **Conclusions**: Phylloquinone supplementation at a dose attainable in the diet does not confer any additional benefit for bone health at the spine or hip.

### What is the evidence for a role for diet and nutrition in osteoarthritis [^113Xwbgh]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

The postulated role of vitamin K in osteoarthritis presents an interesting perspective. Aside from its role in the complement cascade, vitamin K is involved in bone and cartilage mineralization. It serves as a cofactor for the enzyme γ-glutamyl carboxylase, which is responsible for the γ-carboxylation and functionality of vitamin-K-dependent (VKD) proteins. VKD proteins found in bone and cartilage include matrix Gla protein, periostin, gla-rich protein, gas 6, and osteocalcin. Inadequate vitamin K intake may lead to decreased carboxylation of these VKD proteins, affecting functional status and resulting in abnormalities that parallel those seen in osteoarthritis.

Human evidence on vitamin K in osteoarthritis is limited. Many studies address the effects of vitamin K on osteoarthritis in vivo, with a primary focus on phylloquinone. Cross-sectional studies have shown a positive association between plasma phylloquinone concentrations less than 1.0 nM and the development of osteoarthritis, as well as an inverse association between knee osteoarthritis and plasma phylloquinone levels. Furthermore, phylloquinone intake is inversely associated with individual and multiple inflammatory markers.

In longitudinal studies, vitamin K-deficient subjects were more likely to suffer from articular cartilage and meniscus damage, often developing osteoarthritis in one or both knees. Despite these promising results, the only randomized controlled trial of vitamin K failed to find a significant beneficial effect of phylloquinone supplementation against the progression of hand osteoarthritis. However, only a subsection of the study group was vitamin K insufficient at baseline. In that subset, those who attained sufficient concentrations at follow-up showed.

### Vitamin K supplementation and bone mineral density in dialysis: results of the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled RenaKvit trial [^116MK5eJ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

The BMD of the lumbar spine decreased in the placebo group to a similar extent as reported in a previous two-year observational study in patients on dialysis. This decrease was prevented, as BMD was maintained in the MK-7-supplemented group. The observed difference in changes in lumbar spine BMD between the study groups, corresponding to an approximate 5% BMD increase with MK-7 supplementation, translates into a 10% reduction in vertebral fractures according to observations in CKD.

In postmenopausal women without kidney impairment, the influence of vitamin K on lumbar spine BMD varies. Whereas three non-blinded, non-placebo-controlled Japanese randomized two-year studies, and one Dutch randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled three-year study found similar protective effects on lumbar spine BMD, two three-year interventional studies in Caucasian postmenopausal women found no effect of MK-7 or MK-4 on lumbar BMD.

The BMD of the femoral neck decreased in both study groups after two years, although to a lesser extent with MK-7 supplementation, showing borderline significance between treatment groups. Four randomized controlled trials in elderly Caucasian populations without kidney impairment investigated the three-year effect of vitamin K supplementation on BMD of the femoral neck. Two studies observed increased BMD with supplements of MK-7 and vitamin K1, while two other studies found no effect with supplements of lower dosages of MK-4 or vitamin K1. No short-term studies have found any effect of vitamin K1, MK-4, or MK-7 on BMD.

In ESKD, low BMD predicts fractures. Osteoporosis is diagnosed by DXA of the lumbar spine.

### Vitamin K supplementation and bone mineral density in dialysis: Results of the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled RenaKvit trial [^111ZwuWQ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

- **Markers of mineral and bone turnover**: There were no significant differences between the study groups in the markers of mineral metabolism or bone turnover at any time (all P-values > .05).

- **Conventional X-ray of the lumbar spine**: After 1 and 2 years, AAC scores increased in both study groups, but the changes from baseline (P = 0.51 and .41) and the absolute scores (P = 0.19 and .68) did not differ between groups. The number and extent of lumbar vertebral compression fractures did not differ between the study groups at baseline (P = 0.16) and remained unchanged after 2 years.

- **Clinical outcomes**: The number of participants who experienced bone fracture, parathyroidectomy, a thromboembolic event, or death during the study did not differ between study groups (ITT analyses; all P-values > .05). Due to more events in one placebo-supplemented participant, the number of thromboembolic events differed between the study groups (P = 0.02).

- **Adherence and AEs**: The mean adherence to study tablets was > 90% after year 1 and 2 in both study groups. A total of 110 participants experienced 968 AEs during the trial and 481 SAEs occurred in 90 participants. The number of participants who experienced an AE or SAE did not differ between groups (all P-values > .05).

### Vitamin K antagonists' use and fracture risk: Results from a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112v8GFJ]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Although vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) lower serum values of bone deposition markers, the link with osteoporosis and fractures remains controversial.

- **Objectives**: To assess whether the use of VKAs is associated with an increased prevalence and/or incidence of osteoporosis, fractures, or lower bone mineral density (BMD) values.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic PubMed and EMBASE literature search until August 31, 2014, and performed a meta-analysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies investigating fractures and BMD. These studies compared patients treated with VKAs and healthy controls (HCs) or with patients with medical illness (medical controls, MCs). Standardized mean differences ± 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for BMD, and risk ratios (RRs) were calculated for prevalent and incident fractures.

- **Results**: Of 4597 initial hits, 21 studies were eligible, including 79,663 individuals treated with VKAs vs. 597,348 controls. Compared with HCs, VKA-treated individuals showed significantly higher fracture risk in cross-sectional (three studies; RR = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.12–1.39, P < 0.0001) and longitudinal studies (seven studies; RR = 1.09; 95% CI: 1.01–1.18, P = 0.03) and more incident hip fractures (four studies; RR = 1.17; 95% CI: 1.05–1.31, P = 0.003). Analyzing studies that matched VKA participants with HCs (four studies) rendered these findings in longitudinal studies non-significant. Notably, the VKA and MC group had similar BMD values at all investigated sites. Compared with HCs, a single study showed significantly lower spine T-scores in the VKA-treated group.

### Vitamin K deficiency from long-term warfarin anticoagulation does not alter skeletal status in male rhesus monkeys [^117UWVLw]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). Low credibility.

Vitamin K inadequacy may cause bone loss; thus, K deficiency induced by anticoagulants such as warfarin may be a risk factor for osteoporosis. The skeletal impact of long-term warfarin anticoagulation was evaluated in male monkeys, and no effect on BMD or bone markers of skeletal turnover was observed. This study suggests that warfarin-induced K deficiency does not have skeletal effects.

- **Introduction**: The skeletal role of vitamin K remains unclear. It is reasonable that a potential role of vitamin K in bone health could be elucidated by the study of patients receiving oral anticoagulants that act to produce vitamin K deficiency. However, some, but not all, reports find K deficiency induced by warfarin anticoagulation to be associated with low bone mass. Additionally, epidemiologic studies have found warfarin use to be associated with either increased or no change in fracture risk. Such divergent results may imply that human studies are compromised by the physical illnesses for which warfarin was prescribed.

- **Materials and methods**: To remove this potential confounder, we prospectively assessed skeletal status during long-term warfarin anticoagulation of healthy nonhuman primates. Twenty adult male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), aged 7.4 to 17.9 years with a mean of 11.7 years, were randomized to daily warfarin treatment or control groups. Bone mass of the total body, lumbar spine, and distal and central radius was determined by DXA at baseline and after 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months of warfarin treatment. Serum chemistries, urinary calcium excretion, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and total and percent u…

### Management of postmenopausal osteoporosis: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 2 [^117Bg992]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

To provide updated evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, this guideline targets postmenopausal patients with primary osteoporosis.

This guideline was developed using an a priori protocol by a writing team composed of two specialists in obstetrics and gynecology appointed by the ACOG Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines-Gynecology, along with one external subject matter expert. ACOG medical librarians conducted a comprehensive literature search for primary literature in the Cochrane Library, Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PubMed, and MEDLINE. Studies progressing to the full-text screening stage were evaluated by two authors from the writing team using standardized inclusion and exclusion criteria. Quality assessment was conducted on included studies, and a modified GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) evidence-to-decision framework was used to interpret and translate the evidence into recommendation statements.

This Clinical Practice Guideline includes updated recommendations regarding who should receive osteoporosis pharmacotherapy, the benefits and risks of available pharmacotherapy options, treatment monitoring and follow-up, and the role of calcium and vitamin D in managing postmenopausal osteoporosis. Recommendations are classified by strength and evidence quality, with ungraded Good Practice Points providing guidance when formal recommendations could not be made due to inadequate or non-existent evidence.

### Vitamin K supplementation and bone mineral density in dialysis: Results of the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled RenaKvit trial [^112U4AYy]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

According to our power calculation, we aimed to include 2 × 70 participants. Due to challenged recruitment, we unfortunately ended up with only 61 + 62 participants. Furthermore, the dropout rate in year two was higher than anticipated. For these reasons, only 30 + 32 patients contributed to the two-year primary outcome data, a number somewhat lower than required according to the power calculations (2 × 49). Nonetheless, we managed to detect significant changes in the primary outcome variable. A larger sample size and a longer trial duration might have demonstrated more convincing differences in the response between treatment groups, and possibly other significant differences in outcomes as well.

Previous studies have reported worsening of bone mineral density (BMD) on the arteriovenous fistula arm. The number of functioning fistulas was similar in the two study groups; however, neither the placement nor the number of closed fistulas was registered. Lumbar spine BMD may be increased by osteoarthritis, compression fractures, severe aortic calcification — which is common in the dialysis population — and intestinal deposition of phosphate binders.

In the present study, we cannot exclude that lumbar spine osteoarthritis may have been unevenly distributed in the two study groups. However, neither abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) scores nor vertebral fractures differed between the study groups. Although dual-energy X-ray absorptiometries (DXAs) were performed with abdomens empty of dialysis fluids, the intake of phosphate binders and leftover peritoneal dialysis fluids may have affected measurements of lumbar spine BMD.

### Vitamin K status of healthy Japanese women: age-related vitamin K requirement for gamma-carboxylation of osteocalcin [^116xkYpg]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Vitamin K deficiency is associated with low bone mineral density and an increased risk of bone fracture. Phylloquinone (K1) and menaquinone 4 (MK-4) and 7 (MK-7) are generally observed in human plasma; however, data is limited on their circulating concentrations and their associations with bone metabolism or with gamma-carboxylation of the osteocalcin molecule.

- **Objectives**: The objectives were to measure the circulating concentrations of K1, MK-4, and MK-7 in women and to ascertain whether each form of vitamin K is significantly associated with bone metabolism.

- **Design**: Plasma concentrations of K1, MK-4, MK-7, undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC; measured using the new electrochemiluminescence immunoassay), intact osteocalcin (iOC), calcium, and phosphorus; bone-derived alkaline phosphatase activity; and concentrations of urinary creatinine, N-terminal telopeptide, and deoxypyridinoline were measured in healthy women (n = 396).

- **Results**: On average, MK-7 and MK-4 were the highest and lowest, respectively, of the three vitamers in all age groups. K1 and MK-7 inversely correlated with ucOC, but associations between the nutritional basal concentration of MK-4 and ucOC were not observed. Multiple regression analysis indicated that not only K1 and MK-7 concentrations but also age were independently correlated with ucOC concentration and the ratio of ucOC to iOC. The plasma K1 or MK-7 concentration required to minimize the ucOC concentration was highest in the group aged ≥ 70 years, and it decreased progressively for each of the younger age groups.

- **Conclusions**: The definite relationship between vitamin K status and osteocalcin gamma-carboxylation in healthy Japanese women was established.

### Vitamin K supplementation and bone mineral density in dialysis: Results of the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled RenaKvit trial [^111ZAKPo]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Statistical methods

No data on changes in bone mineral density (BMD) over time of the 1/3 distal radius were available in patients on dialysis when the study was planned. The sample size calculation was therefore based on cross-sectional data, in which a difference in BMD of the 1/3 distal radius of 0.26 g/cm² in patients on dialysis with or without fractures and an overall standard deviation (SD) in BMD of the 1/3 distal radius of 0.46 g/cm² was found. To detect a minimal relevant change in the 1/3 distal radius BMD of 0.26 g/cm² (5% significance level, 80% power), at least 2 × 49 patients were needed. With an expected annual dropout rate of 20% in our study population with well-described high mortality, we aimed at including at least 2 × 70 patients in the study.

Parametric and non-parametric statistics were applied on normally and non-normally distributed data, respectively. Categorical data were analyzed with the Pearson's chi-squared or Fisher's exact test. Mixed effects linear regression models were used to estimate longitudinal treatment effects. With the applied methodology, missing values were handled and list exclusion avoided, meaning that analyses were intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. Maximum likelihood procedures were used for estimation, thus, under the assumption of missing at random, unbiased effect sizes are estimated. The analyses were adjusted for baseline measures by constraining the baseline means of the two study groups to be equal, thereby considering participants as a random sample of the background prior to intervention, as suggested by Twisk et al.

### Efficacy of vitamin K on bone fragility: Puzzling findings from which we should learn how to design a rigorous study [^113mhYJY]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

MK7 was chosen to replenish vitamin K stores. While widespread availability and long half-life are truly assets, it should be acknowledged that epidemiological evidence linking MK7 to favorable bone outcomes is very limited, if not nonexistent, especially for the synthetic form of MK7. More importantly, recent experimental and clinical data indicate that both metabolism and transport of MK7 are profoundly disturbed in CKD. MK7 supplements thus seem not the best choice in CKD, or should be given at higher doses.

Of note, while MK7 levels significantly increased in the active treatment arm, levels of dp-ucMGP, a marker of functional vitamin K deficiency, did not normalize. However, none of the trials that studied vitamin K supplementation in dialysis achieved a "normal" dp-ucMGP. These insights call for caution in extrapolating present results to other vitamin K treatment regimes, testing different vitamins, doses, and/or follow-up time.

Designing the ideal study to assess the skeletal efficacy of vitamin K supplementation is a real challenge. Knowledge of the many pitfalls is evolving and will help in the pursuit of this challenge in the future. An RCT with a well-defined treatment regimen assessing hard endpoints would overall be considered the "nec plus ultra". Such trials, however, are not always feasible, often deal with relatively short follow-up duration, and the participants in many cases are homogeneous and highly selected for safety considerations, and adherence to intervention is well-controlled. For several reasons, RCTs may both overestimate and underestimate treatment effects.

### National Osteoporosis Society vitamin D guideline summary [^113zRN7e]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

The National Osteoporosis Society (NOS) published its document, Vitamin D and Bone Health: A Practical Clinical Guideline for Patient Management, in 2013 as a practical clinical guideline on the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease. There has been no clear consensus in the UK on vitamin D deficiency, its assessment, and treatment, leading to inconsistent clinical practice. This guideline is aimed at clinicians, including doctors, nurses, and dieticians.

It recommends the measurement of serum 25 (OH) vitamin D (25OHD) to estimate vitamin D status in the following clinical scenarios: bone diseases that may be improved with vitamin D treatment; bone diseases prior to specific treatment where correcting vitamin D deficiency is appropriate; musculoskeletal symptoms that could be attributed to vitamin D deficiency.

The guideline also states that routine vitamin D testing is unnecessary when vitamin D supplementation with an oral antiresorptive treatment is already planned. It sets the following serum 25OHD thresholds: 50 nmol/L is sufficient for almost the whole population. For treatment, oral vitamin D3 is recommended, with fixed loading doses of oral vitamin D3 followed by regular maintenance therapy when rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency is required. Loading doses are not necessary where correction of deficiency is less urgent or when co-prescribing with an oral antiresorptive agent. For monitoring, serum calcium (adjusted for albumin) should be assessed.

### Vitamin K supplementation and bone mineral density in dialysis: results of the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled RenaKvit trial [^111RAP7m]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Similar to our findings, MK-7 supplementation had contrasting effects on trabecular and cortical bone as assessed by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography in a 3-year study of Caucasian postmenopausal women. This dual effect of MK-7 on bone metabolism appears to be similar to that of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which increases cortical resorption and trabecular bone formation simultaneously. In the present study, levels of intact PTH (iPTH) did not differ between study groups; still, an interaction between MK-7 and iPTH cannot be excluded.

Vitamin D regulates the expression of OC, and appropriate vitamin D status may therefore be of importance for the effects of vitamin K supplementation on bone. In the present study, participants were vitamin D replete, and adjustments for vitamin D status did not change the results.

In accordance with other studies, we found a significantly lesser increase in tOC with MK-7 supplementation compared with placebo, which may reflect carboxylation of ucOC. This carboxylation enables its binding to hydroxyapatite in the bone matrix, as seen in human in vitro studies. The observed effect on tOC may reflect an improvement in bone mineral maturation and bone structure with MK-7 supplementation.

Even though markers of bone turnover may be affected by ESKD, MK-7 did not appear to influence bone turnover in terms of changes in bone turnover markers in the present study, which is in accordance with observations in the elderly general population.

In uraemia, this absence of convincing beneficial effects of MK-7 supplementation on bone might be explained by underlying pathophysiological conditions affecting bone health.

### Vitamin k supplementation and bone mineral density in dialysis: results of the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled RenaKvit trial [^113JDaT6]. Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Vitamin K deficiency is highly prevalent in patients on dialysis and may contribute to their low bone mineral density (BMD) and increased risk of fracture. This study investigated the effect of menaquinone-7 (MK-7) supplementation on BMD in patients on chronic dialysis.

In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention trial, 123 patients on chronic dialysis were randomized to a daily oral supplement of either MK-7 360 µg or placebo for 2 years. BMD of the distal radius (1/3, mid, ultradistal, and total), femoral neck, lumbar spine (L1–L4), and whole body was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Serum levels of vitamin K1 and MK-7, and plasma levels of total osteocalcin, dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein, and protein induced by vitamin K absence II were measured to assess vitamin K status.

After 2 years, an accelerated BMD loss of the 1/3 distal radius was found with MK-7 supplementation [mean difference of changes relative to placebo −0.023 g/cm² (95% confidence interval (CI) −0.039 to −0.008)], whereas the decrease in lumbar spine BMD seen in the placebo group was prevented [mean difference of changes between groups 0.050 g/cm² (95% CI 0.015–0.085)]. No significant effects were observed at the remaining skeletal sites. Vitamin K status strongly improved in MK-7-supplemented participants.

Compared with placebo, an accelerated BMD loss of the 1/3 distal radius was found after 2 years of MK-7 supplementation, whereas a decline in lumbar spine BMD was prevented.

### Forteo [^111yHpAZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Forteo is indicated for several patient groups:

- **Postmenopausal women with osteoporosis**: Forteo is used to treat women who are at a high risk for fracture, defined as having a history of osteoporotic fractures or multiple risk factors for fracture, or those who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapies. In these women, Forteo reduces the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures.

- **Men with primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis**: Forteo helps increase bone mass in men who are at high risk for fracture or who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapies.

- **Men and women with osteoporosis related to glucocorticoid therapy**: This includes individuals with osteoporosis associated with sustained systemic glucocorticoid therapy (daily dosage equivalent to 5 mg or greater of prednisone) who are at high risk for fracture or who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapies.

Forteo is a parathyroid hormone analog (PTH 1–34) and is specifically indicated for:

- Treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapies.
- Increase in bone mass for men with primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapies.
- Treatment of men and women with osteoporosis associated with sustained systemic glucocorticoid therapy at high risk for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapies.

### Vitamin K supplementation and bone mineral density in dialysis: Results of the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Renakvit trial [^112GY89r]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

As kidney function declines, disturbances in mineral metabolism cause abnormalities in bone turnover, mineralization, and bone loss, as well as increased vascular and other soft-tissue calcification, known as chronic kidney disease–mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). In patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on dialysis, the risk of fractures is increased up to four times compared to the general population. Fractures are associated with increased morbidity and all-cause mortality. Compared to the general population, low bone mineral density (BMD) is more frequent and predicts future fractures in patients on dialysis treatment.

BMD may be affected by vitamin K status. In observational studies, vitamin K levels were positively associated with BMD in both the elderly general population and patients on dialysis. Furthermore, reduced levels of vitamin K are associated with an increased risk of fracture in both the elderly general population and patients on dialysis. Additionally, treatment with vitamin K antagonists increases fracture risk.

Patients treated with dialysis are often vitamin K deficient, with highly elevated levels of vitamin K–dependent proteins. Vitamin K supplementation has been demonstrated to improve vitamin K status, as systemic levels of osteocalcin (OC; as undercarboxylated osteocalcin [ucOC]), matrix Gla protein (MGP; as dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein [dp-ucMGP]), and protein induced by vitamin K absence II (PIVKA-II) significantly decreased during supplementation. So far, the effect of vitamin K supplementation…

### Efficacy of vitamin K on bone fragility: Puzzling findings from which we should learn how to design a rigorous study [^114vh4BF]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Results from a recent vitamin K intervention study in dialysis patients by Levy-Schousboe et al, published in this issue of NDT, should be interpreted against this background. The investigators conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled (RCT), double-blind study to evaluate the impact of vitamin K supplementation on BMD in dialysis patients. Patients in the active study arm were treated with 360 μg of MK7 for 2 years. BMD results were mixed; somewhat surprisingly, patients in the active study arm showed an accentuated BMD loss at the distal 1/3 radius site. No BMD differences were observed at other sites of the radius. MK supplementation reduced BMD loss at the lumbar spine but not at the femoral neck. VF incidence and progression of vascular calcification, evaluated according to Kauppila's method, did not differ between groups.

This study, being among the few RCTs on vitamin K, should be applauded and warmly welcomed. However, power issues and peculiarities of the study design with regard to the choice of (primary) endpoint and intervention call for a cautious interpretation of the results.

Like many RCTs, the study by Levy-Schousboe et al. suffered from recruitment difficulties and a higher than anticipated drop-out rate. As already highlighted, the outcome of MK7 supplementation differed according to the skeletal site under investigation: BMD loss at the distal 1/3 radius (primary endpoint) and BMD gain at the lumbar spine. While these different outcomes may have a biological explanation, as these sites refer to predominantly cortical and trabecular bone, respectively, one should consider these factors in future studies.

### Vitamin K supplementation and bone mineral density in dialysis: Results of the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled RenaKvit trial [^117A55jA]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

A total of 689 patients on dialysis were screened for eligibility (Fig. 1). Of those, 123 patients were enrolled and randomized to either MK-7 (n = 61) or placebo (n = 62). Twenty-six participants (21%) dropped out during year 1, leaving 97 participants (79%) available for the 1-year follow-up. An additional 32 participants dropped out during year 2, leaving 65 participants (53%) available for the 2-year follow-up (Fig. 1). All participants were Caucasian except for one participant of Asian ancestry and one of Latino ancestry. Baseline characteristics are shown in Tables 1 and 2.

- **DXA scans**: DXA scans were performed in 92 of the 97 participants at year 1 and in 62 of the 65 participants completing the study at year 2 (Fig. 1). Causes of missing measurements are shown in Supplementary Table 5S. At baseline, the number of participants with a T-score below the osteoporosis-defining threshold of −2.5 at any BMD site did not differ between the MK-7 and placebo groups (69% and 54%, respectively; p = 0.10).

### Poor vitamin K status is associated with low bone mineral density and increased fracture risk in end-stage renal disease [^112Ynw4B]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease and osteoporosis are major public health problems associated with an aging population. Vitamin K insufficiency is prevalent among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Preliminary data indicate that poor vitamin K status may compromise bone health and that increased inflammation may be in the causal pathway. We performed an ancillary analysis of data collected in the frame of prospective observational cohort studies exploring various aspects of bone health in de novo renal transplant recipients to investigate the association between vitamin K status, inflammation, bone mineral density, and incident clinical fractures.

Parameters of mineral metabolism, including biointact PTH and FGF23, sclerostin, calcidiol, and calcitriol, and inflammation (CRP and IL-6), osteoprotegerin, bone turnover markers (P1NP, BsAP, and TRAP5B), and dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated Matrix Gla Protein (dp-ucMGP), were assessed on blood samples collected immediately prior to kidney transplantation in 468 patients. Areal bone mineral density (aBMD) was measured at the lumbar spine and femoral neck by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry within 14 days post-transplant.

Poor vitamin K status, defined by dp-ucMGP > 500 nmol/L, was highly prevalent (90%). High dp-ucMGP levels independently associated with elevated inflammatory markers and low aBMD. No associations were observed between vitamin K status and bone turnover markers. During a median follow-up of 5.1 years, 33 patients sustained a fragility fracture. In Cox-proportional hazards analysis, a dp-ucMGP above the median associated with an increased risk of fractures.

### Vitamin K status in patients with Crohn's disease and relationship to bone turnover [^116sfp8G]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

There is a high prevalence of osteopenia among patients with Crohn's disease (CD). There is some evidence that a deficiency of certain bone-active nutrients, including vitamins K and D, may have a partial role in this bone loss.

- **Aims**: To compare the intake and the status of vitamin K in CD patients, currently in remission, with age- and sex-matched controls and further investigate the relationship between vitamin K status and bone turnover in these patients.

- **Subjects**: CD patients (n = 44; mean age: 36.9 years) and matched controls (n = 44) were recruited from the Cork University Hospital and Cork City area, respectively.

- **Methods**: Blood samples were analyzed for the total and undercarboxylated (Glu)-osteocalcin, and urine was analyzed for cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTx). Vitamin K1 intake was estimated by a food frequency questionnaire.

- **Results**: Vitamin K1 intake in CD patients tended to be lower than controls (mean (SD), 117 (82) vs. 148 (80) μg/d, respectively; p = 0.059). Glu and NTx concentrations in CD patients were higher than controls (mean (SD), 5.1 (3.1) vs. 3.9 (2.1) ng/ml, respectively; p = 0.03 for Glu; and 49 (41) vs. 25.8 (19.5) nM BCE/mM creatinine, respectively; p = 0.001 for NTx). In CD patients, Glu was significantly correlated with NTx (r = 0.488; p < 0.001), even after controlling for age, gender, vitamin D status, calcium intake, and corticosteroid use.

- **Conclusion**: Vitamin K status of CD patients was lower than the healthy controls. Furthermore, the rate of bone resorption in the CD was inversely correlated with…

### Early vascular ageing in chronic kidney disease: Impact of inflammation, vitamin K, senescence and genomic damage [^1177k3C7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

Accelerated ageing processes often manifest with cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications, muscle wasting, osteoporosis, and frailty, concomitant with chronic, low-grade inflammation. A large body of epidemiological studies has shown the possible involvement of vitamin K in ageing-related disease phenotypes. Data from the Health ABC study indicate that a lower vitamin K status, measured by vitamin K1 and desphospho-uncarboxylated matrix Gla-protein (dp-ucMGP), was associated with reduced lower extremity function during 4–5 years of follow-up. The prospective data analysis from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, a cohort study with a 13-year follow-up, found that poor vitamin K status, indicated by high dp-ucMGP levels at baseline, was associated with a higher frailty index score in ageing subjects.

With regard to the effect of vitamin K in osteoporosis, the results from different clinical studies remain equivocal. While some studies conducted in the Japanese population have shown that high doses of vitamin K2 are effective in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, data from a systemic review and meta-analysis, including 36 randomized controlled trials, concluded that vitamin K had no effect on vertebral fracture incidences among postmenopausal and osteoporotic patients. Given the variability and heterogeneity of vitamin K supplementation involved in different studies, it can be speculated that different forms and dosages of vitamin K may have different efficacy and that a higher dose of vitamin K supplement is most likely to ensure a better carboxylation of osteocalcin that is crucial for bone health.
