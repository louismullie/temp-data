## Question

GVHD causing diaphargmatic paralysis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) can cause diaphragmatic paralysis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the neuromuscular complications of chronic GVHD that could plausibly affect the diaphragm. Then, I should verify whether there is direct evidence linking GVHD to diaphragmatic paralysis. Next, I will consider indirect mechanisms such as phrenic nerve injury or steroid myopathy. After that, I need to check the differential diagnosis and how to distinguish GVHD-related weakness from other causes. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and outline diagnostic and management implications with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: diaphragmatic paralysis is a neuromuscular problem of the respiratory pump, so I should focus on whether GVHD produces immune-mediated myositis or neuropathies that could impair diaphragmatic function, and whether there is any direct evidence in the literature provided.

> I will now examine the neuromuscular spectrum of GVHD. Wait, let me verify the most common immune-mediated neuromuscular complication: myositis is repeatedly described as the predominant manifestation, typically with axial and proximal weakness, and muscle biopsy showing macrophage-predominant perimysial infiltration; this pattern is biologically compatible with diaphragmatic involvement because the diaphragm is a skeletal muscle, though diaphragm-specific data are sparse in these series [^112DXqmc] [^114Ljhw6].

> Next, I should review direct evidence for diaphragmatic involvement. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to check for case-level signals. A case report explicitly describes respiratory muscle weakness with tachypnea, abdominal paradox, and orthopnea, with reduced vital capacity and markedly decreased maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures, consistent with diaphragmatic and accessory respiratory muscle weakness; muscle biopsy supported GVHD myositis and the patient improved with immunosuppression, which provides direct clinical evidence that GVHD can impair the respiratory pump, including diaphragmatic function [^117KD5iB].

> But wait, what if the weakness is not primary myositis of the diaphragm but secondary to phrenic nerve injury or steroid myopathy? I should double-check those alternatives. Phrenic nerve injury can cause diaphragmatic paralysis after thoracic procedures or trauma, and while not specific to GVHD, it is a recognized cause of diaphragmatic dysfunction and should be excluded when paralysis is focal or follows procedural trauma; similarly, chronic glucocorticoid therapy for GVHD can cause steroid myopathy with proximal weakness, and although this is a non-GVHD iatrogenic cause, it can compound respiratory muscle weakness in GVHD patients, so I need to keep both in mind during evaluation [^116v9CSV] [^111HxQ8E].

> I need to ensure the differential is broad and evidence-based. Persistent or progressive myalgia or weakness after HCT warrants evaluation for cGVHD-associated polymyositis, statin toxicity, and myasthenia gravis; initial workup with CPK, aldolase, and anti–acetylcholine receptor antibodies is reasonable, with muscle MRI, EMG, or biopsy considered if serologies are unrevealing, which helps distinguish immune-mediated myositis from toxic or autoimmune mimics that could also impair diaphragmatic function [^113sfiEQ] [^111HxQ8E].

> Let me consider pathophysiology to see if the mechanism is plausible. Chronic GVHD exhibits alloimmune and autoimmune features with donor T and B cell dysregulation and autoantibody production; muscle can be a target organ, and macrophage-rich perimysial inflammation has been documented, which provides a mechanistic basis for diaphragmatic involvement as part of a systemic myositis syndrome in cGVHD [^1126e4YU] [^112DXqmc].

> I should confirm the clinical implications for diagnosis and management. If diaphragmatic weakness is suspected, pulmonary function testing with measurement of maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures helps quantify respiratory muscle strength; in parallel, evaluate for broader cGVHD activity and consider muscle biopsy if the diagnosis remains uncertain, because confirming immune-mediated myositis supports escalation of immunosuppression rather than attributing symptoms solely to steroid toxicity or infection [^117KD5iB] [^113sfiEQ].

> Hold on, I should verify treatment principles. When cGVHD-related myositis is confirmed or strongly suspected, augmenting systemic immunosuppression is appropriate; case series and reports show responses to calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids, and contemporary guidance supports multidisciplinary management with consideration of steroid-sparing agents in refractory cases, while also screening for and treating infections and monitoring for steroid-induced myopathy that could worsen respiratory function [^116QfNDR] [^112WNBdU] [^114YM87X].

> In summary, I need to be precise: yes, GVHD can cause diaphragmatic paralysis, most plausibly via immune-mediated myositis affecting the diaphragm, with supportive direct evidence from a case report of respiratory muscle weakness attributable to GVHD myositis, and strong indirect evidence that myositis is a recognized cGVHD manifestation; however, I should emphasize that diaphragmatic paralysis is rare and that alternative etiologies such as phrenic nerve injury and steroid myopathy must be excluded through targeted testing and clinical correlation before concluding it is GVHD-related [^117KD5iB] [^112DXqmc] [^116v9CSV] [^111HxQ8E].

---

GVHD can cause diaphragmatic paralysis through **immune-mediated myositis** of the diaphragm and **phrenic nerve injury**, leading to respiratory failure [^117KD5iB] [^112DXqmc]. Diagnosis relies on **PFTs showing restrictive physiology**, EMG, and imaging to exclude other causes [^1154ote8] [^113sfiEQ]. Management includes **systemic immunosuppression** and supportive ventilation; prognosis depends on severity and response to therapy [^112WNBdU] [^116v9CSV].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

GVHD-related diaphragmatic paralysis arises from **two main mechanisms**:

- **Immune-mediated myositis**: Donor T cells attack diaphragmatic muscle, causing inflammation, necrosis, and weakness [^112DXqmc] [^112oMy8k].

- **Phrenic nerve injury**: Perineural inflammation or direct nerve damage impairs diaphragmatic innervation [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence

Several case reports and series document **GVHD-associated diaphragmatic paralysis**:

- **Case report**: A 51-year-old man developed respiratory muscle weakness 5 years after allo-HSCT, with reduced vital capacity and maximal inspiratory/expiratory pressures; muscle biopsy confirmed GVHD myositis and improved with immunosuppression [^117KD5iB].

- **Series**: Immune-mediated neuromuscular complications, including myositis, have been reported in 20 patients after allo-HSCT, with macrophage-predominant infiltration on biopsy and response to immunosuppression [^112DXqmc].

- **Additional cases**: Polymyositis with myonecrosis and respiratory muscle involvement have been described, supporting immune-mediated muscle injury as a mechanism [^112oMy8k].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosing GVHD-related diaphragmatic paralysis requires a **multimodal approach**:

| **Diagnostic modality** | **Role in evaluation** |
|-|-|
| Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) | Restrictive pattern with reduced vital capacity and maximal inspiratory/expiratory pressures [^117KD5iB] [^1154ote8] |
| Electromyography (EMG) | Confirms diaphragmatic denervation or myopathic changes [^notfound] |
| Imaging (chest X-ray, ultrasound, MRI) | Assesses diaphragmatic elevation, paradoxical motion, or muscle atrophy [^notfound] |
| Muscle biopsy | Confirms immune-mediated myositis (perimysial macrophage infiltration) [^112DXqmc] [^112oMy8k] |

---

## Differential diagnosis

Other causes of diaphragmatic paralysis must be excluded, including:

- **Phrenic nerve injury**: Surgical trauma, tumors, or compressive lesions [^notfound].

- **Neuromuscular disorders**: Myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, or steroid-induced myopathy [^113sfiEQ] [^111HxQ8E].

- **Infectious etiologies**: Viral or bacterial infections affecting the diaphragm or phrenic nerve [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management of GVHD-related diaphragmatic paralysis includes:

- **Systemic immunosuppression**: Corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone 1 mg/kg/day) are first-line; calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus) or mycophenolate mofetil are added for steroid-refractory cases [^112WNBdU] [^116QfNDR].

- **Supportive care**: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure; pulmonary rehabilitation to improve strength and function [^116v9CSV] [^111d1Bx4].

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Coordination with pulmonology, neurology, and transplant teams for comprehensive management [^114YM87X].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with severity, response to immunosuppression, and presence of irreversible fibrosis. Early recognition and treatment improve outcomes, but some patients have **persistent ventilatory dependence** or require long-term ventilation support [^117KD5iB] [^112QXEvX].

---

GVHD can cause diaphragmatic paralysis via immune-mediated myositis and phrenic nerve injury; **early diagnosis and immunosuppression** are critical, and supportive ventilation is often needed.

Myositis associated with graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) typically presents with proximal muscle weakness, myalgias, and a raised creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) level. We report a case of a 51 year old man who developed respiratory muscle weakness five years after an allogeneic bone marrow transplant for multiple myeloma. His symptoms included tachypnoea, abdominal paradox, and orthopnoea. Pulmonary function tests revealed diminished vital capacity and maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures. Serum CPK levels were raised and a peripheral muscle biopsy specimen was consistent with GVHD. He improved with immunosuppressive therapy.

Research Goals for Non-Organ-Specific Early Chronic GVHD Identification

Development of prospective observational studies that monitor patients closely for the earliest changes associated with subsequent development of chronic GVHD is needed. Studies should enroll patients at the time of transplant or shortly after and follow them closely in order to detect early signs of disease before meeting current NIH diagnostic criteria. Patients will need to be followed for at least 1 to 2 years post-transplant in order to best correlate early findings with important late outcomes (Figure 1, Table 3). At least 2 current trials are attempting to identify diagnostic and prognostic signs of chronic GVHD, including both clinical characteristics and biomarkers, one in pediatric patients and one in adult patients (and, respectively). More specifically, future research efforts should attempt to: Validate that patient-reported symptoms can predate the development of current NIH diagnostic criteria and determine whether some of these symptoms are closely associated with later development of moderate or severe chronic GVHD. Assessment tools that capture common symptoms (pruritus, muscle cramps, etc.), such as the Lee Chronic GVHD Symptom Scale, already exist and would be easy to study. Additional common symptoms not currently captured should be explored as well. Deploying these tools via telemedicine, diaries, or electronically (eg, wearable technology) should be studied to enable future dissemination to patients who are not actively followed at a transplant center on a regular basis. Describe the clinical evolution of chronic GVHD, including the emergence of diagnostic, distinctive, other or unclassified, and common features as previously published in the 2014 NIH Consensus Criteria on Diagnosis and Staging to understand their true prevalence and prognostic value. These studies could also better document and follow less common manifestations, such as serositis, nephrotic syndrome, immune-mediated cytopenias, polymyositis, and peripheral neuropathy, and provide a framework to study hypothesized chronic GVHD target tissues such as the central nervous system and the endothelium. Collect clinically characterized blood and tissue samples for both discovery and validation of risk assignment, predictive, prognostic, and diagnostic biomarkers.
Application of machine learning (ML) could help identify risk factors or features or biomarker profiles that are highly associated with the development of chronic GVHD requiring systemic treatment. ML techniques have the advantage of potentially identifying previously unknown associations that do not rely on a priori hypotheses based on currently known risk factors or patterns of disease. This approach has been applied to better identify survival patterns in patients with chronic GVHD based on multiple factors, including individual organ involvement and severity. Future efforts using ML should focus on combining known risk factors, provisional early signs and symptoms of disease, biomarkers, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and other data hypothesized to be associated with chronic GVHD or its outcome (eg, laboratory data, infectious history) to help identify patients at highest risk for morbidity and mortality (Table 3). It is important to note the limitations to ML such as lack of standard ML techniques for challenges such as data quality issues and methods for integration of high-dimensional data. A planned CIBMTR study will investigate patient-, disease-, and transplant-specific factors available within the CIBMTR database with predictive ML models to develop a prototype clinical decision support tool to help identify patients at high risk for developing acute and chronic GVHD (GV20–01).

### Current issues in chronic graft-versus-host disease [^112gWmSb]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a frequent and potentially life-threatening complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Increased transplantation of older patients and the more frequent use of unrelated donors has led to increased numbers of patients with this painful complication. Recent advances have been made in understanding the pathophysiology of chronic GVHD and in establishing precise criteria for diagnosis and classification of disease manifestations. These advances will hopefully pave the way for improving both the prophylaxis and treatment of chronic GVHD.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome as leading manifestation of graft-versus-host disease in an allogeneic bone marrow transplanted patient [^115QQA5A]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2010). Low credibility.

Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is the most frequent cause of neuromuscular paralysis in industrialized countries and usually occurs after respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. However, in rare cases GBS is associated with Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD). In the present case we report on a female allogeneic bone marrow transplanted patient who developed GBS as a leading manifestation of GvHD subsequent to discontinuation of her immunosuppressive medication with cyclosporine. In contrast to former case reports both IVIg and plasma exchange failed while resumption of immunosuppressive medication improved the condition of the patient clearly.

Issue 3: A standardized GvHD terminology

In clinical practice, GvHD presentations can range from a rapidly progressive extensive inflammatory syndrome requiring immediate and aggressive systemic immune suppression, to purely fibrotic, cicatricial manifestations with fixed deficits that are unlikely to respond quickly or completely resolve with therapy. Between these extremes, the large spectrum of presentations, occurring in the context of a wide variety in GvHD prevention and treatment regimens, is more challenging to describe. Many of the terms frequently used to communicate with patients and colleagues lack clear, broadly accepted definitions. We propose here several definitions for a standardized GvHD terminology in order to facilitate future research and allow more accurate comparisons among studies (Table 4).

### National Institutes of Health consensus development project on criteria for clinical trials in chronic graft-versus-host disease: I. the 2020 etiology and prevention working group report [^1157r1LA]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Preventing chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains challenging because the unique cellular and molecular pathways that incite chronic GVHD are poorly understood. One major point of intervention for potential prevention of chronic GVHD occurs at the time of transplantation when acute donor anti-recipient immune responses first set the events in motion that result in chronic GVHD. After transplantation, additional insults causing tissue injury can incite aberrant immune responses and loss of tolerance, further contributing to chronic GVHD. Points of intervention are actively being identified so that chronic GVHD initiation pathways can be targeted without affecting immune function. The major objective in the field is to continue basic studies and to translate what is learned about etiopathology to develop targeted prevention strategies that decrease the risk of morbid chronic GVHD without increasing the risks of cancer relapse or infection. Development of strategies to predict the risk of developing debilitating or deadly chronic GVHD is a high research priority. This working group recommends further interrogation into the mechanisms underpinning chronic GVHD development, and we highlight considerations for future trial design in prevention trials.

Introduction

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is an intensive and curative treatment for various hematologic malignancies and hematopoietic dysfunctions. Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is 1 of the major complications after allo-HCT. In previous studies, the incidence of chronic GVHD has been reported to be 15% to 50%, and chronic GVHD has been shown to have a detrimental effect on the quality of life, functional status, and survival outcomes.,

Previous studies have reported that recipient age, donor age, peripheral blood grafts, unrelated donor, female donor–male recipient combination, HLA disparity, in vivo T-cell depletion, and posttransplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy), were associated with the risk for chronic GVHD. Several studies have also reported that antecedent acute GVHD was an independent risk factor for chronic GVHD. For example, 1 of the largest studies conducted by the Seattle group that analyzed only patients who underwent myeloablative conditioning regimens showed that only grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, but not mild acute GVHD, increased the subsequent risk for chronic GVHD. However, several characteristics of acute GVHD, including the severity and involvement of specific organs, could potentially affect the subsequent risk for chronic GVHD differently in modern GVHD prophylaxis.

In this nationwide, retrospective study, we examined the influence of acute GVHD on chronic GVHD according to the acute GVHD profile. An increased understanding of the association between clinical acute and chronic GVHD would contribute to elucidating the underlying pathophysiology of chronic GVHD and help to identify potential candidates for early intervention for chronic GVHD.

Discussion

BOS is a severe fatal complication of allo-HSCT, characterized by airflow obstruction on spirometry. It is associated with a significantly increasing NRM for HSCT recipients. The generally poor response to therapy has led to efforts for early identification of high risk patients in whom earlier intervention may prevent irreversible structural damage and ameliorate pulmonary symptoms. Published studies have reported a series of risk factors for pulmonary cGVHD including impaired lung function before and early after HSCT, a myeloablative/busulfan-containing conditioning regimen, cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositivity, pre-transplant history of pulmonary disease, female donor, unrelated donor and prior acute GVHD. However, it remains challenging since most of them are shared with cGVHD involving other organs, and routine medication for allo-HSCT.

Pulmonary function test can not only reflect the respiratory system, but also identify disorders outside the respiratory system, including neuromuscular weakness and cardiovascular processes. The abnormality recognized by spirometry could be separated into obstructive and/or restrictive disorders. Based on the current NIH consensus criteria for cGVHD diagnosis, BOS is a diagnostic and distinct manifestation of cGVHD in the lungs. In the patients who are diagnosed as confirmed BOS, remarkable obstructive dysfunction can be observed, including decreased FEV1/FVC (less than 0.7 or the fifth percentile of predicted), decreased FEV1/pred (less than 75% with more than 10% decline over less than 2 years). Since PFT is considered to be a non-invasive and attractive strategy to evaluate pulmonary conditions, it is recommended to be taken before and after HSCT dynamically.

PFT before transplantation might be a nonspecific but sensitive indicator of a patient's general physiological condition, toxicity arising from prior treatment and/or a comorbid illness. Nonetheless, allo-HSCT recipients are generally of good performance status without significant comorbidities, to guarantee the tolerance to the very intensive conditioning chemotherapies and following immunosuppressive periods. Previously reports have shown a significant relationship between PFT prior to allo-HSCT and infectious or noninfectious pulmonary complications post-HSCT, such as respiratory failure. However, there is few study concerning the effect of PFT prior to allo-HSCT on the morbidity of BOS. In fact, due to the cautious exclusive criteria for HSCT candidates, it is infrequent for patients eligible for allo-HSCT had significant abnormalities in the PFT before allo-HSCT. Thus, more sensitive parameters and cut-off value should be determined for identifying high risk patients and predicting survival.

Organ-specific issues

Acute GvHD typically only involves three organs: the skin, the liver, and the GI tract. Alloimmune manifestations in other organs are to be linked to chronic GvHD (Fig. 1a). For instance, oral GvHD with lichen planus-like changes is always considered to be a chronic manifestation even if it appears in the early post-transplantation phase (where it needs to be differentiated from alternative etiologies). Obstructive lung manifestations are also always considered to be chronic features, provided they are either confirmed by biopsy or meet strict diagnostic criteria and are accompanied by at least one diagnostic or distinctive manifestation of cGvHD elsewhere.

Some patients have atypical signs and symptoms that might be considered cGvHD but fall outside of the current diagnostic, staging and response criteria. Such manifestations of potential alloreactivity (e.g. ascites, serositis, nephrotic syndrome, membranous glomerulopathy, myasthenia gravis, peripheral neuropathy, polymyositis, weight loss in the absence of GI symptoms, Raynaud's phenomenon, cardiac involvement, eosinophilia, decreased platelet counts, thyroid disorders, etc…) can occur at any time after transplantation. If attributed by the treating physician to cGvHD, they should be categorized as "undefined other cGvHD" (Fig. 1a). This category may represent 10–15% of patients (Kirk Shultz, personal communication). Capturing these data in prospective cohorts is recommended to understand the full spectrum and true incidence of immunological complications after HCT, especially when such manifestations drive management decisions (e.g. the treating physician alters immunosuppression suspecting a link with cGvHD). All manifestations treated as cGvHD should thus be documented, irrespective of whether they meet NIH diagnostic criteria, provided that their "undefined other" nature is clearly noted.

Similarly, isolated increase of transaminases is relatively common during the taper of immunosuppression or after donor lymphocyte infusions. This increase should also be assigned to the "undefined other cGvHD" group, provided it is treated as GvHD in the absence of meeting NIH diagnostic criteria and no histopathological confirmation of liver GvHD has been obtained. Because of their invasive character, liver biopsies are rarely performed and the nature of hepatic enzyme disturbances remains therefore uncertain. This further emphasizes the need for prospective recording of such abnormalities.

Overlap chronic GvHD

Overlap cGvHD is a subtype of cGvHD which has been associated with a poor prognosis. It is characterized by the simultaneous presence of acute and chronic GvHD features (Fig. 1a). Chronic GvHD that is accompanied by acute GI manifestations (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, GI bleeding, and/or ileus) is categorized as overlap cGvHD. However, skin manifestations of aGvHD (maculopapular erythematous rash) can be difficult to differentiate from those of cGvHD. Similarly, the elevation of bilirubin (often accompanied by elevated hepatic enzymes) suggests involvement of the liver, but cannot be unequivocally attributable to either an acute or a chronic process. Given these uncertainties, we currently recommend systematic documentation of aGvHD manifestations (in any organ) and subclassification of such cases as overlap cGvHD, while awaiting future "biology-based" classifications.

Specific guidance for the assessment of chronic GvHD

Skin, muscle, and fascia involvement

In cGvHD, MRI can sometimes be a useful tool to detect fascia involvement, yet distinguishing between skin and muscle/fascia fibrosis as the cause of functional impairment is frequently challenging. Once movement is impaired, muscles and fascia are generally involved and are almost always associated with sclerotic skin GvHD. Therefore, skin and fascia involvement should then be documented, even if skin involvement is the primary manifestation. Furthermore, although photographic-range of motion (P-ROM) ratings have been recognized as a sensitive way to capture fascia involvement and response to treatment, they cannot be directly translated into severity scores of joints-fascia involvement. Finally, muscle cramps are frequently reported by GvHD patients but are not specific and are not included in the severity score.

### Graft-versus-host disease may cause pulmonary restriction, but not all restriction is graft-versus-host disease [^111mM7YX]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

The work by Pang et alimproves our recognition of the impact of post-HCT pulmonary impairment; indeed, the finding that restrictive and undefined phenotypes had higher mortality highlights the importance of monitoring this vulnerable population. However, the finding that obstruction and mixed phenotypes did not increase mortality contradicts earlier pivotal studiesand may be a result of a smaller sample or an artificial split between undefined impairment and other obstruction. Taken as a whole, the notion that this adapted approach to diagnosing pcGVHD would improve our care of post-HCT recipients requires further proof. First, the lack of clarity for what disease processes constitute these patterns of impairment is a weakness; pulmonary function alone can rarely diagnose specific diseases. Second, although mechanistic studies of post-HCT BOS are difficult to conduct and are generally lacking, we argue that this necessitates multicenter collaboration to create well-characterized cohorts with BOS rather than to broaden criteria to include restrictive disorders, which would lead to heterogenous study populations. Similarly, therapeutic trials for pcGVHD will benefit from more careful patient selection and not broader inclusion criteria; the rewards of careful phenotyping have been reaped in diseases like severe asthma. Third, post-HCT restrictive disorders are understudied, and they clearly harm HCT recipients. These NIPCs should be studied separately from BOS, because efforts to mitigate these disorders may require unique strategies. Finally, the lack of a control group without severe cGVHD limits the generalizability to more typical HCT populations.

Pang et alhave shown the value of PFTs to identify patients at high risk for mortality after HCT. We would argue that pulmonary impairment, particularly in the case of lung restriction, is not always cGVHD. The National Institutes of Health criteria may miss certain patients who have pcGVHD, but it would be unwise to conflate patients with myriad non-cGVHD pulmonary diseases to those with BOS simply based upon the presence of any pulmonary impairment. Rather, we would argue that pulmonary function should be a common screening platform for NIPCs and BOS (and rarely PPFE), and that further work is needed to address the dearth of biomarkers to diagnose BOS and other NIPCs early in their course. We would urge the community to focus their efforts on improving diagnostic criteria for individual disease processes rather than advocating for those that are simply easier to apply.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease is a potentially debilitating complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Due to the direct inflammatory effects of the disease on tissue, and the impact on muscle and bone of the high-dose glucocorticoid immunosuppression used to treat the disease, patients are at risk of developing multifactorial functional impairment. This review outlines the clinical assessment and rehabilitation interventions to manage aspects of the disease that cause the most impairment: involvement of the skin/fascial and cardiopulmonary organ systems, as well as steroid-induced myopathy and bone and joint destruction.

Introduction

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a multisystem disorder occurring when immunologically competent cells are grafted into a recipient whose cells express tissue antigens that are absent in the transplant donor and the recipient is incapable of mounting an effective response against the donor cells.

GVHD is a major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant; however, it is uncommonly associated with solid organ transplant and is rarely associated with lung transplantation. We report a case of acute GVHD presenting with cutaneous manifestations following double lung transplantation.

Pulmonary Disease

Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is the primary diagnostic manifestation of pulmonary chronic GVHD. The 2014 NIH chronic GVHD diagnostic criteria for BOS emphasize the presence of new-onset airflow obstruction on PFTs, plus supportive clinical and radiographic features. When the NIH criteria are strictly applied, many patients already have severe obstructive lung disease, missing an opportunity for early recognition of the disorder. At present, the diagnostic workup for BOS is often initiated based on symptoms, at which time, the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) may already be 30% to 50% of predicted normal values. A randomized double-blind study of patients with newly diagnosed BOS (respiratory symptoms for < 6 months) showed that patients receiving inhaled budesonide/formoterol had a statistically significant increase in FEV 1 after 1 month of therapy, and the improvement was maintained after 6 months of therapy, supporting the concept that earlier recognition of disease and intervention may improve outcomes.

Earlier recognition of BOS requires routine screening of asymptomatic patients to detect a decline in lung function. The threshold of FEV 1 < 75% predicted as a criterion for significant airflow decline misleadingly implies that BOS is a binary condition present only when lung function is clearly below normal limits. The requirement for an FEV 1 /forced vital capacity (FVC) (or slow vital capacity if it is greater) ratio less than 0.70 or the fifth percentile of predicted (the lower limit of the 90% confidence interval) in children could also result in missed diagnoses. In patients with BOS, it is not uncommon for the FVC to decline concurrently with a decline in FEV 1, resulting in an FEV 1 /FVC ratio greater than 0.7. This would imply that a mixed restrictive/obstructive lung process may be present. The criteria for BOS in the 2014 NIH guidelines provide other diagnostic challenges. The diagnostic requirement for "absence of infection in the respiratory tract" does not account for the clear association between respiratory viral infections and chronic GVHD of the lung and can falsely reassure clinicians that declines in lung function are reversible and solely linked to an infectious event. Newer molecular methods of testing for viruses may detect nucleic acid remnants for months after initial infection, further complicating the application of current NIH-defined criteria. In addition, spirometric-based criteria cannot be used in children less than 6 to 8 years of age due to the inherent difficulties of performing PFTs in this age group.

Issue 2: Application to clinical practice

Because the above-mentioned guidelines were developed for research purposes, their application to "real-life" scenarios can be quite challenging for healthcare professionals. This section offers guidance for the application of these international standards in clinical practice.

Assessment of the global severity of GvHD

The patient's global severity assessment (overall grade) evaluates exclusively three organs for aGvHD (skin, liver, and GI tract) and eight organs for cGvHD (skin, mouth, eyes, GI tract, liver, lungs, muscles/joints/fascia and genitals), based on the highest score of organ involvement as described above (Tables 2 and 3). No other abnormalities have an impact on the global severity scoring. The patient's functional status is documented by Karnofsky−Lansky scores, but it does not contribute to the overall score of either acute or chronic GvHD. Similarly, "undefined other" cGvHD manifestations or the "opinion of the evaluator" should be recorded but should not have an impact on the final global score.

Multiple causes of organ impairment

For both acute and chronic GvHD, a given organ is not considered in the overall GvHD grade if the manifestation is solely due to a non-GvHD cause (e.g. zoster skin infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, steroid myopathy, etc…). In the case of both GvHD and concomitant non-GvHD etiologies, it is useful to document the non-GvHD causes but there is currently no justification to downgrade an organ score due to concurrent additional causes (e.g. simultaneous liver GvHD and veno-occlusive disease).

CONCLUSIONS

Redefining how we recognize chronic GVHD earlier in its clinical evolution will be a major undertaking but has the potential to improve outcomes for patients given the limitations of our current diagnostic criteria, particularly the concern of irreversible organ damage prior to meeting the current criteria. Validation of earlier prediagnostic signs and symptoms should enable the development of pre-emptive intervention strategies with the goal of preventing much of the morbidity and mortality that patients with moderate to severe chronic GVHD currently face. Discovery and validation of early features of chronic GVHD will involve patients and caregivers, transplant providers, and our subspecialty colleagues. Longitudinal studies should enroll patients before chronic GVHD has developed. These observational studies should include serial sample collections, including blood and tissue, for biomarker assessments, patient involvement to assess symptom burden, the use of handheld spirometry, and standardized documentation of physical exam findings, recognizing that screening tests may have variable performance in different populations. These studies should begin during the next 3 years because they will take years to yield definitive data. Diagnosis of ocular and genital involvement is a particular challenge because current diagnostic criteria require assessment by a subspecialist. Engagement with these subspecialists will be essential to help develop early assessment tools and patient symptom measures that could be used to prompt early referral for specialty evaluation. In the next 3 to 7 years, the ability to recognize subclinical chronic GVHD will allow studies of interventions targeted to underlying pathophysiology and delivered preemptively to test whether this approach leads to better transplant outcomes with less chronic GVHD morbidity and no increase in underlying risks of disease relapse or infectious complications. These approaches would be greatly facilitated by development of validated biomarker-based risk assignment strategies.

### Long-term follow-up and complications after cardiac transplantation [^112wwaQT]. NMDP (1993). Medium credibility.

Screening for chronic graft–versus–host disease (GVHD) in allogeneic transplant recipients — chronic GVHD occurs in approximately 30–70% of patients receiving an allogeneic transplant and is a serious, potentially life-threatening post–transplant complication associated with increased non–relapse mortality, significant morbidity and lower health–related quality of life; with ongoing surveillance, judicious management and multidisciplinary care, most cases resolve within 5 years and the median duration of treatment is 2–3 years. Acute GVHD, characterized by red rash, diarrhea and elevated liver tests, usually starts before day 100, whereas chronic GVHD is when people develop GVHD symptoms in their mouth, eyes, skin or other organs. When symptoms appear, the treatment recommendation is: Collaborate with the transplant center to confirm the diagnosis and develop a treatment plan. Early detection of chronic graft–versus–host disease (GVHD) can help prevent irreversible organ damage and increase the quality of life of your transplant recipient.

Association of the severity between acute and chronic GVHD

Associations between the severity of acute and chronic GVHD were examined only in the BM/PB cohort because of a limited number of events in the UCB cohort. Lung chronic GVHD, manifesting as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, is considered a high-risk manifestation that is associated with poor outcomes. We first evaluated the impact of the grade of acute GVHD on the risk for lung chronic GVHD. The 4-year cumulative incidence of lung chronic GVHD was 6.7% in grade 0, 8.8% in grade 1, 9.6% in grade 2, and 10.1% in grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD (Figure 3 A). In a multivariate analysis, the eventual HR for the risk for lung chronic GVHD increased with each increase in the grade of acute GVHD (grade 1: HR, 1.34; grade 2: HR, 1.48; grade 3–4: HR, 1.72), but the differences among grade 1 to 4 were not statistically significant (grade 1 vs 2 [HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.94–1.29; P = 0.468]; grade 2 vs 3–4 [HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.96–1.41; P = 0.252]; Figure 2 C; supplemental Table 2).

### Chronic graft-versus-host disease manifesting as polymyositis: an uncommon presentation [^116QfNDR]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Polymyositis can occur in association with chronic GVHD and mimics the idiopathic form of the disease. We report two cases of chronic GVHD-associated polymyositis and review the published literature. The two patients presented 13 and 19 months after allogeneic transplantation with characteristic features of muscular hypotrophy, proximal muscle weakness, pain, elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), aldolase and SGPT. Interestingly, both patients had HLA DR52 genes, which is frequently reported in association with idiopathic polymyositis. Electromyogram (EMG) and muscle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. Treatment with cyclosporine or tacrolimus resulted in complete and sustained remission of polymyositis in both cases. A review of the literature shows cyclosporine and steroids are well-described treatment options for patients with myositis in post transplant, as well as idiopathic cases. The duration of immunosuppressive treatment has varied in different reports, and there is a risk of recurrence when immunosuppression is tapered.

Muscular — assess range of motion at each clinic visit for patients with chronic GVHD; ideally with medical photos for subsequent comparison, and encourage patients to also perform self-assessment. Routinely evaluate patients on glucocorticoid treatment for glucocorticoid-induced myopathies; observe patient rising from a squatting position. Patients with/at risk for steroid myopathy should engage in physical activity and physical therapy; physiatry referral may be beneficial, low resistance exercise to prevent/slow loss of muscle mass. For persistent or progressive myalgia/weakness, chronic GVHD–associated polymyositis, statin toxicity or myasthenia gravis should be included in differential diagnosis, and CPK (creatine phosphokinase), aldolase, anti-acetylcholine antibodies are a reasonable next step; if negative, muscle MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), EMG (electromyography) or muscle biopsy may be considered.

### Chronic graft-versus-host disease: clinical manifestation and therapy [^116Ys2PP]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in long-term survivors of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The immunopathogenesis of chronic GVHD is, in part, TH-2 mediated, resulting in a syndrome of immunodeficiency and an autoimmune disorder. The most important risk factor for chronic GVHD is prior history of acute GVHD and strategies that prevent acute GVHD also decrease the risk of chronic GVHD. Other important risk factors are the use of a non-T cell-depleted graft, and older age of donor and recipient. Whether recipients of peripheral blood stem cells are at increased risk of chronic GVHD remains unsettled. There are no known pharmacologic agents which can specifically prevent development of chronic GVHD. Agents which have efficacy in the treatment of autoimmune disorders have been utilized as therapy for established chronic GVHD and are associated with response rates of 20% to 80%. Most responses are confined to skin, soft tissue, oral mucosa and occasionally liver. Bronchiolitis obliterans responds infrequently to therapy and is associated with a dismal prognosis. Newer, promising therapeutic strategies under investigation include thalidomide, photopheresis therapy, anti-tumor necrosis factor and B cell depletion with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody.

Essential Chronic GVHD Evaluations Needed in Clinical Practice

Early recognition of chronic GVHD may offer an opportunity to prevent evolution to more severe disease with irreversible damage, although this hypothesis should be formally tested. The 2014 NIH recommendations for clinical trials advocate use of a form that captures diagnostic signs and organ severity scoring. Such evaluations were developed for use in clinical trials and likely lack the granularity required to adjust treatments for individual patients. However, completion of the form does ensure that the main organs involved with chronic GVHD are assessed at each visit. The form is brief and available online at, appendix 1. One recommended modification to the 2014 form is the addition of a checkbox for "Abnormality thought to represent chronic GVHD plus other causes (specify)", since organ dysfunction can have multiple contributing causes, thereby allowing capture of both chronic GVHD and known non-GVHD causes.

Members of this working group unanimously agreed that it is crucial to properly document the pretransplant baseline status of multiple organ systems in patients in order to correctly identify new abnormalities developing after HCT. With the input of disease and organ experts, we propose the use of a checklist to be completed before HCT to document the presence of signs and symptoms (e.g. dry eyes, restrictions to joint range of motion, lung function tests) that could be subsequently confused with chronic GVHD if not documented before HCT (Table 1). Post-transplant evaluation for possible chronic GVHD is standard of care in many centers starting around 100 days after HCT, recognizing that chronic GVHD is diagnosed earlier in 5% to 10% of patients. Thereafter, clinical evaluation is required every 1 to 3 months to screen for signs and symptoms of active chronic GVHD until the patient has discontinued immunosuppressive therapy for at least 6 months. If abnormalities are detected, prompt referral to a specialized transplantation team for a detailed evaluation and therapy should be considered if the primary provider lacks expertise in diagnosing and managing chronic GVHD (Table 2).

### National Institutes of Health consensus development project on criteria for clinical trials in chronic graft-versus-host disease: IV. the 2020 highly morbid forms report [^112QXEvX]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) can be associated with significant morbidity, in part because of nonreversible fibrosis, which impacts physical functioning (eye, skin, lung manifestations) and mortality (lung, gastrointestinal manifestations). Progress in preventing severe morbidity and mortality associated with chronic GVHD is limited by a complex and incompletely understood disease biology and a lack of prognostic biomarkers. Likewise, treatment advances for highly morbid manifestations remain hindered by the absence of effective organ-specific approaches targeting "irreversible" fibrotic sequelae and difficulties in conducting clinical trials in a heterogeneous disease with small patient numbers. The purpose of this document is to identify current gaps, to outline a roadmap of research goals for highly morbid forms of chronic GVHD including advanced skin sclerosis, fasciitis, lung, ocular and gastrointestinal involvement, and to propose strategies for effective trial design. The working group made the following recommendations: (1) Phenotype chronic GVHD clinically and biologically in future cohorts, to describe the incidence, prognostic factors, mechanisms of organ damage, and clinical evolution of highly morbid conditions including long-term effects in children; (2) Conduct longitudinal multicenter studies with common definitions and research sample collections; (3) Develop new approaches for early identification and treatment of highly morbid forms of chronic GVHD, especially biologically targeted treatments, with a special focus on fibrotic changes; and (4) Establish primary endpoints for clinical trials addressing each highly morbid manifestation in relationship to the time point of intervention (early versus late). Alternative endpoints, such as lack of progression and improvement in physical functioning or quality of life, may be suitable for clinical trials in patients with highly morbid manifestations. Finally, new approaches for objective response assessment and exploration of novel trial designs for small populations are required.

Introduction

Chronic graft- versus -host disease (GvHD) is the most common cause of late morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Prior to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Conferences, there was limited standardization of chronic GvHD severity scoring and treatment response assessment. In 2005, the NIH Consensus Conference on Clinical Trials for Treatment of Chronic GVHD provided standardized criteria to assess organs involved in chronic GvHD and to determine response to therapies for use in clinical trials; consensus criteria were updated in 2014 based on data that had accumulated since the original guide-lines. These criteria have elevated the scientific rigor of current clinical trials in chronic GvHD therapy. However, substantial improvements in affected organs may be required to achieve response by these criteria, and clinician- or patient-reported response metrics may capture lesser but still important degrees of clinical benefit. For example, while NIH response criteria have been correlated with outcomes, other studies reported limited correlation between NIH response and clinician-reported response, and certain quality of life measures.

### Toward a better understanding of the atypical features of chronic graft-versus-host disease: a report from the 2020 National Institutes of Health consensus project task force [^116PXGyT]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Alloreactive and autoimmune responses after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation can occur in nonclassical chronic graft-versus-host disease (chronic GVHD) tissues and organ systems or manifest in atypical ways in classical organs commonly affected by chronic GVHD. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus projects were developed to improve understanding and classification of the clinical features and diagnostic criteria for chronic GVHD. Although still speculative whether atypical manifestations are entirely due to chronic GVHD, these manifestations remain poorly captured by the current NIH consensus project criteria. Examples include chronic GVHD impacting the hematopoietic system as immune mediated cytopenias, endothelial dysfunction, or as atypical features in the musculoskeletal system, central and peripheral nervous system, kidneys, and serous membranes. These purported chronic GVHD features may contribute significantly to patient morbidity and mortality. Most of the atypical chronic GVHD features have received little study, particularly within multi-institutional and prospective studies, limiting our understanding of their frequency, pathogenesis, and relation to chronic GVHD. This NIH consensus project task force report provides an update on what is known and not known about the atypical manifestations of chronic GVHD while outlining a research framework for future studies to be undertaken within the next 3 to 7 years. We also provide provisional diagnostic criteria for each atypical manifestation, along with practical investigation strategies for clinicians managing patients with atypical chronic GVHD features.

Allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) and lung transplantation are both established life-saving treatment options for carefully selected patients with various haematological disorders or end-stage lung diseases, respectively. However, long-term survival after allogeneic HSCT is severely limited by chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD)-of which pulmonary cGVHD in particular has a very poor prognosis-and long-term survival after lung transplantation is hampered by chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). Both pulmonary cGVHD and CLAD are characterised by similar underlying immunopathology, which results in transplant-related pulmonary fibrosis and structural lung remodelling, leading to respiratory dysfunction. Accurate clinical identification and appropriate management is of utmost importance to allow for timely diagnosis, to further optimise current preventive and treatment strategies of pulmonary cGVHD and CLAD, and to ameliorate quality of life and long-term outcomes after allogeneic HSCT and lung transplantation. In this Review, we provide a unique state-of-the-art perspective of both entities for respiratory care practitioners.

Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) — muscle and connective tissue complications are often cGVHD-related and include steroid myopathy, fasciitis/deep sclerosis, polymyositis, and myasthenia gravis. Steroid myopathy presents with proximal weakness and "an improvement in strength may occur by 2 to 3 weeks after steroid reduction", with dose effects such that " < 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent is unlikely to result in myopathy, but ≥ 40 mg/day for ≥ 1 month usually causes weakness". For cGVHD-associated fasciitis, "patients with fasciitis may benefit from a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program to control edema and preserve range of motion", and polymyositis "usually presents with moderate to severe proximal muscle weakness and myalgia". Myasthenia gravis linked to cGVHD tends to be delayed, with "most cases occurring > 2 years post-HCT".

### Graft-versus-host disease may cause pulmonary restriction, but not all restriction is graft-versus-host disease [^113Ga6jy]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Finally, we challenge the assumption that all restrictive lung disease necessarily denotes pcGVHD. First, Pang et alnote that nearly half of pulmonary restriction was a result of truncal sclerosis, a severe cGVHD syndrome. Here, it is expected that a severe cGVHD syndrome will increase mortality, but this does not necessarily imply alloimmune inflammation of the lung. Second, it is not clear how the investigators evaluated infections, particularly in patients evaluated early in the study period. Given the long duration of the study and the evolution of diagnostic algorithms for infection, undiagnosed viral infections may cause pulmonary impairment and increase mortality after HCT, but most patients never develop BOS. Finally, the abnormalities shown on computed tomography (CT) scan, which the authors consider to be consistent with pulmonary restrictive disorders, are nonspecific. For example, pleural abnormalities are common, but these rarely constitute cGVHD. Others, such as ground-glass opacities, are notoriously nonspecific and may reflect injuries that predated the initial study evaluation. Given that these imaging abnormalities are not definitively linked to pcGVHD, we would not advocate for nonspecific CT findings to be part of the post-HCT diagnostic criteria.

### Clinical importance of confirming or excluding the diagnosis of chronic graft-versus-host disease [^1143VJwN]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. The presentation of this disease is varied, and it requires histological confirmation for diagnosis. In addition, cGVHD can often mimic other diseases, and vice versa. We have conducted a retrospective analysis of 123 patients referred to the GVHD clinic at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center from 1994 to 1998 with a diagnosis of active cGVHD. Of these, nine patients (7%) had no evidence of cGVHD, and 25 patients (20%) had inactive cGVHD. Many of these patients were found to have other processes accounting for their ongoing symptoms. We conclude that since the therapy for this disease has significant toxicities and since what appears to represent cGVHD may actually be another disease, correct diagnosis of cGVHD or exclusion of this diagnosis is essential.

RESULTS

Diagnosis

BOS can develop at any time after allo‐HSCT, including as late as several decades post‐transplant, although it most commonly occurs within the first 2 years, with a median time to diagnosis between 9 and 18 months. Symptoms arise due to progressive airway obstruction, and by the time symptoms are noticeable, the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) is often less than 50% of the predicted value. However, when new respiratory symptoms occur after transplantation, infection should be considered first, with bronchoalveolar lavage recommended to rule out microbial infection before the diagnosis of BOS.

The diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) typically hinges on pathological findings, characterized by bronchial wall thickening, lumen narrowing and fibrosis. However, due to the high risk associated with biopsies in patients with suspected BO, the diagnosis often shifts towards BOS, which is based on clinical criteria, including lung function assessments and radiologic findings. The current diagnostic standards for BOS still adhere to the NIH consensus established in 2014 and 2020, and are summarized in Figure 2.

AIP, acute interstitial pneumonitis; ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; DAH, diffuse alveolar haemorrhage; HRCT, high‐resolution computed tomography; PERDS, peri‐engraftment respiratory distress syndrome; PFT, pulmonary function test.

For patients already diagnosed with cGVHD in other organs, the criteria for diagnosis are based on an obstructive lung function pattern and a persistent decrease in FEV1 within 2 years. The specific criteria are as follows:
FEV1/vital capacity (VC) < 0.7 or the lower limit of normal.
FEV1 < 75% of the predicted value with a ≥ 10% decline over < 2 years and does not correct to > 75% with a bronchodilator.

In addition to the obstructive pattern observed in BOS, restrictive, or mixedventilatory defects are also frequently encountered after allo‐HSCT. These may arise from interstitial lung disease or extra‐pulmonary causes, such as chest wall abnormalities or neuromuscular dysfunction. Due to the diagnostic complexity, especially in mixed patterns, referral for multidisciplinary discussion is recommended.

### Polymyositis as a manifestation of chronic graft-versus-host disease [^114Ljhw6]. Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has similarities to some idiopathic autoimmune diseases, including polymyositis. To investigate the relationship between chronic GVHD and idiopathic myositis we conducted a detailed analysis of all cases of myositis occurring in a large series of HSCT patients.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective chart review of all cases of myositis that developed in 7161 patients who underwent HSCT at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center between 1969 and 1999.

Results

Among 1859 individuals who developed chronic GVHD, 12 developed myositis. No patients developed myositis without chronic GVHD. Myositis was first identified between 7 and 55 months after transplantation. In histopathology, electromyography, laboratory values and response to immunosuppressive therapy, the cases resembled idiopathic polymyositis. Autoantibodies were found in eight cases.

Conclusions

Myositis in the chronic GVHD population occurred with an incidence higher than expected by chance, suggesting that muscle may be a target tissue for chronic GVHD. Recent studies have implicated allogeneic cells persisting after maternal-fetal cell transfer in selected autoimmune diseases, including myositis. This report lends support to the possibility that both idiopathic myositis and chronic GVHD-related myositis could involve allo-autoimmune responses.

### Acute graft-versus-host disease of the lung after liver transplantation [^1122rTQo]. Liver Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

We describe the first case of a man who developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), isolated to the lung, after an orthotopic liver transplant from a female donor. Our patient experienced dyspnea, worsening hypoxemia, and a progressive obstructive ventilatory defect 12 days after liver transplantation. Open-lung biopsy revealed grade 2 lymphocytic bronchiolitis, the pathologic and immunologic correlate of acute pulmonary GVHD. Fluorescent in situ hybridization confirmed donor cells at sites of peribronchiolar inflammation. High-dose corticosteroids were given with a return to baseline pulmonary function. The current case should alert clinicians to investigate pulmonary GVHD as a potential cause of postoperative dyspnea in liver transplant recipients.

### Current approaches to prevent and treat GVHD after allogeneic stem cell transplantation [^114DbN2i]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is a potentially curative therapy for many malignant and nonmalignant hematologic diseases. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a common complication after transplantation and remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality, limiting the success of a potentially curative transplant. This paper reviews the current and emerging strategies in GVHD prevention and treatment. New insights are leading the way to the development of novel targeted approaches to minimize the risk of disease relapse and infection. Continued collaborative efforts to conduct high-quality, multicenter clinical trials with standard end points and risk stratification are needed to determine the optimal approach to minimize GVHD and limit toxicities.

### Restrictive ventilatory defects following hematopoietic stem cell transplant are associated with increased mortality [^117BnZA2]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can potentially cure hematologic malignancies, but despite advancements in HCT regimens and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) management, post-HCT complications, remain a major challenge. The epidemiology of post-HCT pulmonary impairment causing restrictive ventilatory defect (RVD) has not been examined. This study investigates the incidence, etiology, and impact of new-onset RVD following HCT on overall survival (OS) and non-relapse mortality (NRM).

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of adult patients who underwent their first allogeneic HCT for primary hematologic malignancies at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center between February 1999 and March 2018. RVD was defined by a total lung capacity (TLC) < 5th percentile of the lower limit of normal. Patient data were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank tests, and Cox regression models.

Results

Among 3030 patients, 50 had pre-HCT RVD and 1275 developed new pulmonary impairment post-HCT, of which, we found 270 cases of new-onset RVD. The most common causes of post-HCT RVD were respiratory tract infections (23%), interstitial lung disease (15%) and truncal sclerosis (11%). Multivariate analysis indicated increased age (HR 1.03 per year, 95% CI 1.03–1.04, P < .001), matched unrelated donor transplant (HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.04–1.60, P = 0.02), mismatched related transplant (HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.33–3.14, P = 0.001), cord blood stem cell source (HR 3.02, 95% CI 2.26–4.05, P < .001), RVD (HR 2.27, 95% CI 1.77–2.90, P < .001) and cGVHD (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.44–2.05, P < .001) were associated with higher mortality. More severe restriction (HR 4.04, 95% CI 2.83–5.77, P < .001), progressive RVD (5.04, 95% CI 1.88–13.52, P = 0.001), and RVD onset within 1 year of HCT (HR 2.61, 95% CI 1.72–3.98, P < .001) were associated with higher mortality.

Conclusion

New-onset RVD post-HCT is associated with increased mortality. These findings emphasize the importance of identifying RVD through proactive pulmonary function monitoring to improve post-HCT outcomes.

Chronic GvHD definition

Chronic GvHD was originally defined in the early 1980s in a cohort of 20 Seattle patients, as any GvHD present beyond day 100. cGvHD severity was categorized as "limited" (localized skin lesions with or without limited hepatic involvement) or "extensive" (generalized skin involvement, major hepatic complications, or involvement of any other organ). 20 years later, a survey of transplant professionals' responses to clinical cGvHD vignettes demonstrated wide variations in scoring practices and led to a refinement of the original Seattle criteria (Table 3).

In 2005, the first NIH "expert-opinion" consensus conference for cGvHD defined precise criteria for the diagnosis and staging of individual organ severity, based on functional disability, and eliminated the requirement that all GvHD occurring after day 100 be considered cGvHD. The conference proposed that the diagnosis of cGvHD rely on either specific diagnostic signs or other distinctive signs accompanied by additional confirmation (e.g. biopsy or other objective diagnostic test) in at least one target organ (skin and appendages, mouth, eyes, genitalia, esophagus, lungs and muscles and fascia). The "overlap cGvHD sub-type" was defined by the diagnosis of cGvHD together with acute GvHD manifestations of the skin, liver or gut (Fig. 1a). The severity of cGvHD (either classic or overlap) was scored by patient symptoms as well as functional organ impairment, ranging from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) for each involved organ. A final global severity score for cGvHD is "mild" when a maximum of two organs are scored 1, "severe" if any organ is scored 3, and "moderate" for all other combinations. Lungs provide the single exception to this rule, where a lung score of 1 results in a global score of "moderate", and a lung score of 2 results in an overall "severe" score because of the potential irreversibility of pulmonary lesions and the poor prognosis for patients so affected.

In 2014, a second NIH consensus conference revisited and updated these criteria based on the evidence generated during the intervening decade. One major recommendation was to eliminate from the severity score any dysfunction unequivocally caused by an alternative etiology. Several further refinements to single organ staging were also recommended. In the opinion of this task force, the NIH 2014 criteria are the most accurate and widely accepted standard for the diagnosis and scoring of cGvHD.

Recently, there have been more reports of a GVHD-like syndrome in syngeneic bone marrow transplant patients (SGVHD) that may result in significant clinical morbidity. A total of 17 cases of SGVHD in syngeneic bone marrow transplant patients have been reported to date in the medical literature. The current report reviews these cases and presents two additional cases of severe SGVHD that have occurred at our institution.

### EBMT-NIH-CIBMTR task force position statement on standardized terminology&guidance for graft-versus-host disease assessment [^117LAz9u]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

GvHD onset

GvHD onset refers to the presentation of the first episode of clinically evident alloreactivity of the donor against the recipient host (Fig. 1b, c).

"Classic acute GvHD" refers to the initial diagnosis of acute GvHD within the first 100 days following transplantation or DLI infusion (whichever happened last). "Late acute GvHD" occurs beyond day 100 and can be: "late onset" (new onset of aGvHD with no prior history of classic aGvHD), "recurrent onset" (recurrence of aGvHD in a patient with prior history of classic aGvHD whose symptoms became controlled, inactive or resolved); or "persistent" if active aGvHD signs persist beyond day 100 in the absence of cGvHD manifestations.

Chronic GvHD is referred to as having "de novo onset" if cGvHD is diagnosed for the first time in a patient who did not previously experience acute GvHD. "Quiescent onset" is defined as cGvHD that appears for the first time after all acute GvHD manifestations have become controlled, inactive or resolved. "Progressive onset" refers exclusively to the initial presentation of cGvHD manifestations while acute GvHD symptoms are still active. It is therefore always a form of overlap cGvHD (Fig. 1a), although not all overlap cGvHD syndromes present with a progressive onset. "Progressive onset" is also distinct from "progression", which is a response criterion that refers to an increase in severity of acute or chronic GvHD symptoms over time. "Progressive onset" cGvHD has been associated for over 30 years with inferior prognosis and poor response to treatment. Yet, it should be noted that because these studies used a variety of definitions, some patients, who did not present with new cGvHD manifestations, would now be reclassified as "persistent late acute GvHD". Interestingly, Stewart et al. showed that after the dose of prednisone was taken into account, "progressive onset" no longer predicted long-term survival, suggesting that the level of chronic immunosuppression at diagnosis influences the prognosis for cGvHD with this type of onset.

There is currently no formal nomenclature to refer to the pattern of GvHD recurrence after an initial diagnosis. The term "flare" is sometimes used to define the reappearance or worsening of any signs of GvHD. Although this might reflect the natural course of the disease, this term currently lacks a validated definition. For written scientific communications, we recommend instead the precise terminology that refers to disease onset or the classical clinical trial response criteria, as appropriate.

### The association of performance status and disease severity in patients with chronic graft-vs-host disease [^111e4V3A]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Determine the relationship between functional status and degree of specific organ involvement, physical performance, and subjective well-being chronic graft-vs-host disease (cGVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Design

Observational cohort.

Setting

Outpatient clinic.

Participants

Adult patients (N = 121) with cGVHD with 634 assessments.

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). Skin, fascia/joints, lungs, upper and lower extremity range of motion, liver, eye, mucosal, and gastrointestinal involvement were measured using the National Institutes of Health GVHD scale. Physical performance was assessed with the 2-minute walk test (2MWT) and hand grip strength. Subjective measures were the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) and Lee Symptom Burden (LSB) scale.

Results

Myofascial (P < .001) and lung (P = 0.001) involvement, 2MWT (P < .001), LSB (P < .001), and PHQ-9 (P = 0.03) had the largest associations with KPS with liver (P = 0.05) and hand grip strength (P < .001) more modest associations with KPS.

Conclusions

Patients with cGVHD experience multifactorial impairment in function associated with potentially modifiable symptoms physiatrists have the expertise to address to enhance function. More research is needed to determine rehabilitation interventions to mitigate the impact of cGVHD on function.

### Chronic graft-versus-host disease. part I: epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations [^1126e4YU]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic graft-versus-host disease:

- **Definition**: Chronic GvHD is a serious complication that occurs after allo-SCT, leading to significant morbidity and mortality.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of chronic GvHD involves a coordinated response from donor T-cells. The donor T-cells recognize the host tissues as foreign, initiating an immune response. B cells also play a significant role in chronic GvHD, as evidenced by the presence of autoantibodies and alloantibodies contributing to immune dysregulation.
- **Epidemiology**: Chronic GvHD is reported to occur in approximately 50% of all patients following allo-SCT and is increased with the use of unrelated and/or mismatched donors, reduced intensity conditioning regimens, and peripheral blood stem cells. The incidence of chronic GvHD in children is estimated at 20–40%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for chronic GvHD include the degree of donor-recipient HLA mismatch, history of acute GvHD, and the use of peripheral blood stem cells as the source of the graft. Other factors such as recipient age, disease type, and conditioning regimen can also influence the risk.
- **Disease course**: Chronic GvHD can affect multiple organ systems, including the skin and nails, liver, lungs (bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome), gastrointestinal tract, oral cavity, muscle and fascia, and eyes. It often resembles an autoimmune disorder, with manifestations such as lichenoid lesions, hyperkeratotic plaques, and limited oral aperture secondary to sclerosis.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Chronic GvHD is associated with a high risk of morbidity and mortality. The prognosis varies based on the extent of organ involvement and response to treatment, with a reported cure rate of 50% and a mortality rate of 40% at 7 years.

### Reply to watanabe: pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis induced by liver transplantation? [^117Uje3S]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Third, did the patient have evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans as evidence of chronic allograft dysfunction? The autopsy (performed by A.F.) specifically noted that there was no evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans in the lungs.

Fourth, may the abnormalities have arisen asymmetrically as a consequence of liver transplantation? We cannot exclude that other triggers prompted the development of PPFE in this particular individual, which underlies the suggestion for focused follow-up after liver transplant. Although atelectasis, diaphragmatic injury, or pneumonia complicate the course of many patients, PPFE remains rare. Thus, we propose the potential relationship between these complications of liver failure and liver transplant and the development of PPFE with the publication of this case.

We agree with Watanabe and colleagues that the entity of PPFE, whether idiopathic or secondary to bone marrow, lung, or potentially liver transplant, warrants further study to characterize potential predisposing factors such as graft failure, transplant-related complications, or telomere dysfunction. We hope that this patient's unique case contributes additional impetus for such important work.

### Reactivated chronic graft-versus-host disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection [^1115m9ok]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) continues to be a common complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplants (SCTs), affecting up to 40% to 60% of patients. While acute GVHD has largely been associated with aberrant donor T-cell response, chronic GVHD (cGVHD) is thought to be a more complex reaction involving multiple immune cell lineages. Cutaneous GVHD is known to sometimes flare following modulations in treatment or recent infection. However, to our knowledge, no cases of cGVHD reactivation secondary to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have yet been reported in the literature. We present here a case of cutaneous cGVHD flaring in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Interstitial lung diseases after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: new pattern of lung chronic graft-versus-host disease? [^117Bkyk5]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative treatment for several hematological malignancies as well as immune deficiencies and hemoglobinopathies. Despite the major progress made since the emergence of HSCT, specific complications can occur and impair the prognosis of patients. Among them, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a leading cause of death and impaired quality of life. Chronic GVHD resembles a connective tissue disease with multiple organ involvement. The National Institute of Health in its latest consensus conference suggests criteria for diagnosing and scoring the severity of chronic GVHD. "Diagnostic signs" described for each organ are considered sufficient for the clinician to make the diagnosis of chronic GVHD. The pulmonary manifestations of chronic GVHD are considered highly morbid forms by the 2020 consensus of the NIH due to their associated morbidity and mortality. Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is the only formally recognized manifestation of lung chronic GVHD and refers to a functional respiratory profile, namely, a new-onset obstructive lung disease (OLD) with air trapping. The most common histological counterpart of BOS is obliterative bronchiolitis. In a prospective cohort, we found a cumulative incidence of BOS at 3 years after HSCT of 10%. We also identified early risk factors for BOS, which were the use of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs), the occurrence of a lower respiratory tract infection before day 100, and a 10% decline in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) between the allograft and day 100. Many other risk factors have been reported in retrospective studies. In addition to BOS, other noninfectious late-onset pulmonary complications after HSCT (LONIPCs) have been described, including diffuse interstitial lung disease (ILD), whose 3-year cumulative incidence was found to be 5%. Post-HSCT ILD has been described more recently than BOS and it was associated with restrictive lung disease (RLD). Initially identified only as organizing pneumonia, ILDs have been shown by more-recent studies to be possibly due to other histological patterns. In a retrospective histological study, we found that post-HSCT ILDs may correspond to several histological patterns, such as organizing pneumonia (OP) and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), predominantly, as well as diffuse alveolar damage, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, and pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE). Strikingly, in almost all cases, interstitial pathology coexisted with histological lesions of obliterative bronchiolitis. This association was found in other studies of postallogeneic HSCT PPFE or NSIP in which, when histological data were available, lesions of obliterative bronchiolitis were present in 70–100% of cases. It was previously suggested that the chronic inflammation and fibrosis characteristic of both OLD and RLD were associated with GVHD and the intensity of HCT conditioning. Indeed, the few studies dedicated to post-HSCT overall ILD or, more specifically, to post-HSCT-OP found a strong association with acute and/or chronic GVHD. Conditioning regimens, including total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide, were also associated with post-HSCT-OP. Although ILD is not currently consensually considered a manifestation of chronic pulmonary GVHD, both the frequent histologic association with obliterative bronchiolitis and clinical association with other manifestations of GVHD raise the question of whether ILDs could be part of a spectrum of lung cGVHD.

### Durable discontinuation of systemic therapy for chronic graft – host disease: myth or reality? [^1168Kmhw]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 1.
Studies evaluating time to permanent discontinuation of systemic therapy.

The applicability of the results of this study is limited by the population studied. Patients at low risk of developing chronic GvHD, such as young children or those who received post-transplant cyclophosphamide, antithymocyte globulin, or in vivo/ex vivo T-cell depletion for GvHD prophylaxis were not well represented. Previous studies of the discontinuation of systemic therapy reported rates as low as 27.7% and as high as 68% depending on the population under study and the rigor of the definition (Table 1). With newer GvHD prophylaxis regimens, a lower burden of systemic immunosuppression can be achieved, although the question of overall outcome superiority remains unanswered and drugs to provide a better balance of GvHD and graft- versus -leukemia effects are still needed.

Systemic immunosuppressive therapy used to treat chronic GvHD can impair immunity, adding to the inherent immune dysfunction associated with active chronic GvHD, and therefore increase the risk of opportunistic infections and expose patients to the toxicity associated with the side effects of many medications. These side effects are of particular concern in the context of chronic glucocorticoid use, which has multiple systemic effects some of which can be irreversible, such as osteonecrosis, myopathy, growth failure in children, and osteopenia. There are three immunological scenarios that can unfold after infusion of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells: (i) normal immunological reconstitution with the achievement of protective immunity and no GvHD – a state of genuine immunological tolerance in which the risk of leukemia relapse is also highest; (ii) so-called functional tolerance in which regulatory mechanisms are in effect resulting in no clinical GvHD, with good protection against relapse of the malignancy; and (iii) concurrent alloreactive proliferation and immune dysregulation, which are clinically reflected as acute and chronic GvHD and provide protection against malignancy relapse but at the expense of increased mortality, morbidity and long-term disability. This third scenario could be the most desirable one for cure of the malignancy if a way to mitigate GvHD along with eliminating other non-relapse related risks and side effects of therapy could be achieved. The latest 2020 National Institutes of Health chronic GvHD consensus proposed new strategies to achieve that goal.

### Graft-versus-host disease may cause pulmonary restriction, but not all restriction is graft-versus-host disease [^115cQ2nG]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Noninfectious pulmonary complications (NIPCs), including BOS, occur in about 20% of HCT recipients and are well known to increase mortality, but these do not necessarily constitute pcGVHD. Pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE), a hallmark of RAS, is extremely rare after HCT.PPFE may represent cGVHD, but other NIPCs may not. For example, idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, occurring in 1% to 3% of HCT recipients, often occurs before cGVHD manifests and is often unresponsive to immunosuppressive therapy. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, occurring in 1% to 2% of HCT recipients, may occur in the absence of cGVHD and is generally responsive to corticosteroid therapy, unlike severe cGVHD syndromes. Histopathologic studies of NIPCs occasionally show nonspecific bronchiolar pathologies, but constrictive bronchiolitis is seen in most patients with RAS. This implies that post-HCT restrictive lung disorders cannot be definitively linked to cGVHD in the same way that RAS is linked to CLAD. Therefore, assuming that post-HCT pulmonary restriction constitutes cGVHD may hinder the understanding of post-HCT BOS by conflating dissimilar disease processes.

### How I diagnose and treat acute graft-versus-host disease after solid organ transplantation [^114bp8SH]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a rare complication after solid organ transplantation (SOT) that carries high mortality. Caused by immunocompetent donor leukocytes within the transplanted organ, which become activated against recipient tissues, GVHD typically develops 2 to 12 weeks after SOT and can affect the skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and bone marrow. Signs and symptoms are nonspecific and include a rash, nausea, appetite loss, diarrhea, and cytopenias. Pancytopenia from marrow-directed GVHD is the primary driver of mortality. The diagnosis of GVHD is often delayed but should be confirmed by biopsy of an affected organ. Evidence of donor chimerism in blood or marrow supports the diagnosis. When GVHD is diagnosed we initiate treatment with systemic corticosteroids. At that time, if GVHD only involves skin or oral mucosa we also decrease maintenance immunosuppression levels to allow the recipient to reject the donor immune cells. For GVHD involving the marrow we initiate an allogeneic hematopoietic cell donor search early. In this article, we describe 3 cases of GVHD after SOT, outline our approach to diagnosis and management, and then provide analysis of the 3 instructive cases.

Organ-Specific Early Chronic GVHD Identification

Another strategy to facilitate earlier diagnosis of chronic GVHD focuses on specific organs associated with high morbidity or mortality: skin and fascia, eyes, and lungs. Our working group included disease experts in each of these areas to help develop both screening recommendations and potential research approaches. These experts have provided a recommended schedule for screening that at times would involve examinations by a subspecialist or specialized testing, such as pulmonary function tests (PFTs). It is acknowledged that these recommendations might not always be feasible outside of a clinical trial due to need for insurance coverage or proximity to appropriate providers and facilities. Additionally, these experts have also provided alternative screening recommendations with triggers signaling the need to involve subspecialists (Table 2).

Skin and Fascial Disease

Skin fibrosis and fasciitis affect up to 20% of patients with chronic GVHD and are associated with high morbidity, disability, and prolonged immunosuppression. New assessment techniques, including imaging and other biomarkers to diagnose prodromal or early sclerotic disease and reliably assess disease activity, are needed. Biomarkers based on skin biopsy materials could also be explored for their potential early diagnostic value for prodromal chronic GVHD in other organs.

Recommended Clinical Assessments

A comprehensive skin evaluation at every clinic visit is essential, with special attention to palpation of anatomic sites with propensity for the development of sclerotic features, particularly the lower legs and sites of repetitive skin friction and injury such as the waist. The measurement of sclerotic skin and fascial disease is challenging, and no validated methods are available for precise quantification; thus, semiquantitative markers of severity, including skin pliability, adherence to underlying tissue, and joint range of motion, are used to describe the extent of sclerosis.
Photographic range of motion (P-ROM) has been refined for response assessment of fasciitis and should be assessed at each clinic visit. Decreased range of motion in patients with chronic GVHD is usually related to deep sclerosis affecting the fasciae and may not be detectable by palpation. Arthralgias, arthritis, and prior injury can cause anatomic distortion, making the pre-HCT evaluation critical.

### Overlap subtype of chronic graft-versus-host disease is associated with an adverse prognosis, functional impairment, and inferior patient-reported outcomes: a chronic graft-versus-host disease consortium study [^116TytCk]. Haematologica (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference proposed the term "overlap" graft-versus-host disease to describe the situation when both acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease are present.

Design and Methods

We examined whether the overlap subtype of graft-versus-host disease was associated with a different prognosis, functional limitations, or patient-reported outcomes compared to "classic" chronic graft-versus-host disease without any acute features.

Results

Prospective data were collected from 427 patients from nine centers. Patients were classified as having overlap (n = 352) or classic chronic (n = 75) graft-versus-host disease based on reported organ involvement. Overlap cases had a significantly shorter median time from transplantation to cohort enrollment (P = 0.01), were more likely to be incident cases (P < 0.001), and had a lower platelet count at onset of the graft-versus-host disease (P < 0.001). Patients with overlap graft-versus-host disease had significantly greater functional impairment measured by a 2-minute walk test, higher symptom burden and lower Human Activity Profile scores. Quality of life was similar, except patients with overlap graft-versus-host disease had worse social functioning, assessed by the Short Form-36. Multivariable analysis utilizing time-varying covariates demonstrated that the overlap subtype of graft-versus-host disease was associated with worse overall survival (HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1–4.7; P = 0.03) and higher non-relapse mortality (HR 2.8, 95% CI 1.2–8.3; P = 0.02) than classic chronic graft-versus-host disease.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that the presence of acute features in patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease is a marker of adverse prognosis, greater functional impairment, and higher symptom burden.

### Immune-mediated neuromuscular complications of graft-versus-host disease [^112DXqmc]. Muscle & Nerve (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Aims

We aimed to describe the clinical phenotype, histopathological findings and overall survival (OS) of the immune-mediated neuromuscular complications of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

Methods

We conducted a retrospective chart review of adult patients presenting with immune-mediated neuromuscular complications of GVHD to Mayo Clinic, between April 2013 and July 2018. We collected clinical and laboratory characteristics, histopathological findings, response to treatment and survival data.

Results

We identified 20 patients with a mean age at presentation of 55y. Mean time from transplant to neurological presentation was 14mo. Myositis was the most common complication seen in 17 patients, manifesting with predominantly axial and/or proximal weakness. Eleven patients had a muscle biopsy showing diffuse perimysial, predominantly macrophagic infiltration in 10, 3 of them with perimysial perivascular lymphocytic collections, and endomysial and perimysial lymphocytic infiltration in 1. Only two patients had a neuropathic complication: one each with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy and neuralgic amyotrophy. A single patient had a myasthenic syndrome presenting with fluctuating foot drop. Nineteen patients were treated and all responded to immunosuppressive agents; however, 11 had further GVHD flares requiring escalation of therapy. After a median follow-up of 83mo, seven (35%) patients died: five from progressive GVHD and two from infections. The 5-y OS from time of transplant was 68%.

Discussion

Myositis is the most common immune-mediated neuromuscular complication of GVHD while peripheral neuropathy and myasthenic syndromes appear less common. The macrophage-predominant infiltration on muscle biopsy deserves further study to better clarify the role of macrophages in GVHD pathogenesis.

### Interstitial lung diseases after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: new pattern of lung chronic graft-versus-host disease? [^112bzwRe]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This large retrospective study allowed us to compare the characteristics of postallogeneic HSCT ILD to BOS. We found similarities, such as a similar median time from HSCT, up to 85% of patients who had received peripheral blood stem cells as a stem cell source in both groups of patients, a high proportion of patients who developed GVHD, although this was more striking for patients with BOS who also developed more severe acute GVHD. We also found discrepancies between the two groups, with the BOS group showing a higher proportion of males, HLA mismatch, and sex disparities between donor and recipient; patients with ILD received less steroids for GVHD from HSCT than BOS patients, thoracic irradiation prior to HSCT was found to be associated with the development of post-HSCT-ILD. The treatment given for the lung dysfunction differed between the BOS and the ILD group, with a majority of patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids in the BOS group and with systemic corticosteroids in the ILD group. Although OS did not differ between groups, the causes of death varied, with more cases of respiratory failure in the ILD group and more cases of infection in the BOS group.

ILD is now a recognized post-HSCT pulmonary complication. However, it is unclear whether ILD is part of the spectrum of chronic pulmonary GVHD. Our study reinforces this hypothesis. Indeed, in addition to the previous demonstration of concomitant histological lesions of ILD and BOS in the lungs of allogeneic HSCT recipients, the clinical association with chronic GVHD in 70–87% of cases has already been described in smaller series. Furthermore, some of our patients developed a mixed clinical and functional phenotype associating both BOS and ILD. A number of factors associated with ILD in other settings are known, such as environmental, drug-related or genetic factors. Allogeneic HSCT recipients are administered many drugs that can induce ILD. We did not find an association between the type of conditioning regimen, including total body irradiation, and the occurrence of an ILD. However, we found a strong association between pretransplant thoracic irradiation and ILD. Although based on small sample of patients, this finding is consistent with the results of our prospective study focused on early risk factors for LONIPCs. It could be postulated that lung injury secondary to this irradiation could promote the subsequent occurrence of ILD in a similar way to the phenomenon described for the occurrence of OP after irradiation for breast cancer.

### Autologous blood pleurodesis for pneumothorax complicating graft-versus-host disease-related bronchiolitis obliterans [^115UwTx3]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is a manifestation of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation. Complications associated with this include persistent air-leak syndromes such as pneumothorax. Many methods have been described for treating this condition, both surgical and nonsurgical. We describe an 8-year-old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia complicated by chronic GVHD-related BO, and subsequent pneumothorax with persistent air leak, who was treated successfully with autologous blood pleurodesis.

### Addressing knowledge gaps in the early detection of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after hematopoietic cell transplantation: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^114jX2Tm]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Hematopoietic cell transplantation bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (HCT-BOS) — extrapulmonary chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) risk and incidence: approximately 5–10% of all allogeneic HCT recipients will develop BOS, but the incidence increases to nearly 15% among those with extrapulmonary cGVHD; after the occurrence of chronic GVHD, the cause-specific hazard of BOS is increased 2.90-fold (95% confidence interval, 0.98–8.60) in a prospective cohort.

### Recent FDA approvals in the treatment of graft-versus-host disease [^114YBn39]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

While acute GVHD classically presents earlier after HCT than chronic GVHD, the distinction is defined by the symptoms at clinical presentation, rather than time of onset. The cardinal organ manifestations of acute GVHD are the skin (maculopapular rash), liver (hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice), and the gut (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Although chronic GVHD may involve any organ system, the most common organs involved are the skin, eyes, and mouth. One feature unique to chronic GVHD is the development of fibrotic changes, most notably sclerodermatous GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome.

Proven clinical risk factors for acute GVHD include degree of recipient human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatching, use of total body irradiation, and increased intensity of the conditioning regimen while risk factors more associated with chronic GVHD include older age, female donors to male recipients, prior history of acute GVHD, and peripheral blood stem cells as a graft source. Grading of disease severity remains clinically based with clear consensus criteria published for use in practice as well as in clinical trials for eligibility and response assessment. While noninvasive biomarkers are commercially available for acute GVHD risk stratification, no clinical trials have proven that these biomarkers should dictate choice of therapy. Chronic GVHD biomarkers are being actively investigated; however, none have yet emerged as being able to accurately risk stratify patients.

Regarding medical management for chronic graft-versus-host disease, more specifically with respect to management of pulmonary chronic GvHD, pharmacotherapy, EBMT/ERS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating imatinib, ruxolitinib, or belumosudil in addition to conventional immunosuppressive therapy or continuing conventional immunosuppressive therapy alone in adult patients with pulmonary chronic GvHD phenotype bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome.

### Airflow obstruction after myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^115LSgBm]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Despite advances in the management of myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants, airflow obstruction (AFO) remains a significant complication. We conducted a 12-year study to examine the recent epidemiology of AFO and its associated mortality. Using the rate of percent predicted FEV1 decline after transplant, we defined AFO as a more than 5% per year decline in percent predicted FEV1 with the lowest post-transplant FEV1/FVC ratio less than 0.8. New obstruction was more frequent than previous estimates (26% overall, 32% among patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease [GVHD]) and was significantly associated with older age at transplant, lower pretransplant FEV1/FVC ratio, history of both acute and chronic GVHD, and respiratory viral infection within the first 100 days after transplant. AFO was associated with significant attributable mortality rates of 9% at 3 years, 12% at 5 years, and 18% at 10 years after transplant, which were much higher for the subpopulation of patients with chronic GVHD (22% at 3 years, 27% at 5 years, and 40% at 10 years). These results suggest that the incidence of AFO may have been underestimated previously, and its presence significantly increases the mortality of long-term survivors of myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients.

### Long-term follow-up and complications after cardiac transplantation [^113Zqji2]. NMDP (1993). Medium credibility.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) — hematopoietic/immune evaluation and laboratory manifestations include that patient-reported symptoms and signs are noted as none and clinical examination is noted as none, while diagnostic testing lists complete blood count and differential, test for presence of autoantibodies, and quantitative immunoglobulin levels. Clinical manifestations with explicit thresholds are thrombocytopenia with a persistent decrease in platelets; < 100,000/μL, eosinophilia with an abnormal increase; > 500/μL, and lymphopenia with a reduction; < 500/μL; additional features include hypo- or hyper-gammaglobulinemia and autoantibodies with examples of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Footnotes define that items marked ** are "Rare, controversial, or non–specific features of chronic GVHD", items marked * are "Distinctive but insufficient alone to establish an unequivocal diagnosis of chronic GVHD without further testing or additional organ involvement", and items marked ** are "Common in both acute and chronic GVHD".

### The global severity of chronic graft-versus-host disease, determined by National Institutes of Health consensus criteria, is associated with overall survival and non-relapse mortality [^117QLXfX]. Haematologica (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The 2005 National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on chronic graft-versus-host disease proposed major changes in the classification and grading of severity of chronic graft-versus-host disease.

Design and Methods

We aimed to study the association of the proposed chronic graft-versus-host disease classification and global severity with transplantation outcomes among a consecutive series of patients who received pharmacokinetically-targeted doses of intravenous busulfan and fludarabine conditioning followed by transplantation of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells.

Results

From a total cohort (n = 242) of patients surviving more than 100 days after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, 181 (75% of those at risk) had some manifestations of graft-versus-host disease after day 100. Of these, at onset 13 (7%) had late acute graft-versus-host disease, 62 (34%) had classic chronic graft-versus-host disease, and 106 (59%) had the overlap subtype of chronic graft-versus-host disease. The global severity of the chronic graft-versus-host disease was mild in 25% of cases, moderate in 46%, and severe in 29%. Multivariable modeling demonstrated the independent association of global severity of chronic graft-versus-host disease with overall survival (moderate/severe versus mild; HR 2.9, 95% CI 1.8–4.7, P < 0.0001) and non-relapse mortality (moderate versus mild; HR 3.86, 95% CI 1.17–12.73, P = 0.03, and severe versus mild (HR 10.06, 95% CI 3.07–32.97, P < 0.001). The type of onset of progressive chronic graft-versus-host disease and the platelet count at the time of diagnosis of the disease were significantly associated with overall survival. The occurrence and severity of chronic graft-versus-host disease was also significantly associated with primary disease relapse.

Conclusions

Patients with moderate to severe chronic graft-versus-host disease, as determined by National Institutes of Health Consensus criteria, have an inferior overall survival and worse non-relapse mortality. Clinical and research advances are needed to improve the outcomes of affected patients.

### Addressing knowledge gaps in the early detection of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after hematopoietic cell transplantation: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^113t2E4s]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Hematopoietic cell transplant–associated bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome risk identification states that patients at high risk for HCT-BOS should be identified for more intensive monitoring or preemptive therapies and organizes risk factors temporally into pre-HCT (comorbidities present > 1 mo before HCT), peri-HCT (within 1 mo before, during, and after HCT, encompassing factors related to the transplant), and post-HCT (clinical events and measurements > 1 mo post-HCT); pretransplant risk includes preexisting airflow limitation or obstructive lung disease, and older recipient age is a risk factor for BOS but it is uncertain if this risk exceeds the risk of increased age for GVHD in general, while a lower pretransplant FEV1 and/or FEV1/FVC ratio (even if in the normal range) can make it more likely that diagnostic criteria for BOS are reached, essentially creating a form of verification bias ("diagnostic criteria bias") without the necessity of a causal relationship.

### Pleuropericarditis, obliterative bronchiolitis and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^116nKfoJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a common complication of allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation, with pulmonary involvement occurring in 5–10% of cases. Obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) is recognised as a diagnostic manifestation of chronic GVHD, whereas lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (LIP) has been reported but is not considered diagnostic, and pleuritis is not clearly associated. The authors describe a transplant patient who simultaneously manifested three distinct pulmonary processes: OB, patchy LIP and pleuropericarditis. The onset of these entities along with other manifestations of chronic GVHD, their resolution with increased immunosuppression and their recurrence upon tapering support all three entities as manifestations of GVHD in the lungs.

### International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation consensus statement on the referral and selection of pediatric lung transplant candidates [^1174sKry]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

Restrictive diseases — post-transplant contexts and center expertise: "After BMT/HSCT, pediatric patients can develop restrictive lung diseases such as chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), pulmonary fibrosis, ILD, and PPFE, among others". "These conditions often result in significant lung dysfunction, potentially leading to the need for LTx", and LTx "can be associated with significant postoperative morbidity and mortality in some scenarios, particularly in cases of advanced disease or malnutrition". Autoimmune and hematologic disorders also contribute, as "STING)-associated vasculopathy of infancy (SAVI) and STAT3 GOF mutations can develop ILD either as cause of the disease or due to their treatment". "Given that these entities are unique to the pediatric population, childhood ILD specialist involvement is important in these cases", and "Panelists strongly agreed that infants and young children with ILDs and restrictive lung diseases should undergo evaluation and transplantation exclusively at centers with expertise in the comprehensive care of these patients".

### Long-term complications and side effects after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: an update [^115BvSQu]. Blood Cancer Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an effective therapy for various malignant and non-malignant diseases. Many patients have now been followed for two or three decades post-transplant and are presumed to be cured. At present, the allo-HSCT transplant activity is steadily increasing worldwide. This increase is mainly driven by the use of the so-called reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens, and because of access to alternative stem cell sources from human leukocyte antigen-matched or mismatched unrelated adult donors and from cord blood. A recent analysis, published from the Seattle Group, found a substantial reduction in the hazard of death over the past decade when comparing the period from 1993–1997 to 2003–2007. Improved outcomes appear to be related to reductions in organ damage, infection and severe acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). With the tremendous advances achieved in terms of supportive care, it is reasonable to expect outcomes to improve substantially, and consequently increasing numbers of transplant survivors will be facing life after the initial transplant experience. Although long-term allo-HSCT survivors generally enjoy good health, for many others cure or control of the underlying disease is not accompanied by full restoration of health. When looking to all-cause mortality in a cohort of almost 1500 patients who survived 2 or more years after allo-HSCT, mortality rates remain twice as high as that of the general population among 15-year survivors of allo-HSCT, and that the survivors face challenges affecting their health and well-being. Relapse of primary disease (29%) and chronic GVHD (cGVHD; 22%) were the leading causes of premature death. Moreover, in patients who have survived for at least 5 years after allo-HSCT without recurrence of the original disease, life expectancy is still not fully restored. Mortality rates remained four- to ninefold higher than those expected in the general population for at least 30 years after transplantation, providing an estimated 30% lower life expectancy, regardless of current age. In rank order, the leading causes of excess deaths were second malignancies and recurrent disease, followed by infections, cGVHD, respiratory diseases and cardiovascular diseases. The burden of long-term morbidity borne by allo-HSCT survivors is substantial, and long-term follow-up of patients who received allo-HSCT is now widely recommended. Allo-HSCT survivors were twice as likely as siblings to develop a chronic condition, and 3.5 times to develop severe/life-threatening conditions, whereas allo-HSCT survivors with cGVHD were 4.7 times as likely to develop severe/life-threatening conditions. In terms of health-care utilization by long-term survivors after allo-HSCT, more than 95% of the patients reported medical contact and the prevalence of general physical examination increased with time, highlighting the need for increased awareness of long-term side effects after allo-HSCT.

### Graft-vs-host disease as a complication of lung transplantation [^117RjzFe]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

We report a rare case of acute graft-vs-host disease (aGVHD) after a lung transplant. The patient presented with advanced disease manifested by skin rash, fever, diarrhea, liver dysfunction and severe pancytopenia. He went on to die of sepsis and multi-organ failure. aGVHD is a disease often confused with drug reactions or viral infection; therefore, it is important to have a high index of suspicion and to confirm the diagnosis early with tests for donor cell chimerism. Effective treatment is elusive but we are learning a great deal about the underlying mechanisms of this disease and hope to develop better treatment.
