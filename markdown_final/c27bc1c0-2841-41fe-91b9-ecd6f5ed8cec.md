## Question

How should a Bosniak 2 renal cyst on MRI be managed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a Bosniak category II renal cyst identified on MRI, including whether surveillance is needed, what exceptions apply, and how MRI versus CT factors into decisions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise Bosniak v2019 MRI criteria that define a class II cyst. Then, I should verify current guideline recommendations for follow-up or no follow-up. Next, I will review malignancy risk data to contextualize counseling. After that, I need to outline the exceptions where intervention or multidisciplinary review is warranted. I should also carefully distinguish class II from class IIF, because management diverges. Finally, I will consider imaging modality issues and synthesize a practical, reference-based plan with counseling and documentation points.

> Let me first confirm the classification details so I don't mislabel the lesion. On MRI using Bosniak v2019, a Bosniak II cyst is well defined with a thin (≤ 2 mm) smooth wall and may have 1–3 thin septa, with septa and wall that can enhance and can contain calcification of any type; homogeneous marked T2 or T1 hyperintensity without concerning enhancement is also consistent with class II, whereas thicker walls/septa or numerous septa would push toward IIF rather than II, so I need to ensure enhancement and thickness criteria are not being overcalled on MRI before I conclude it's truly II [^114zmX5d].

> Now, I should verify management guidance and not jump to conclusions. The 2023 Canadian Urological Association (CUA) guideline explicitly recommends not obtaining follow‑up imaging for Bosniak I or II cysts, favoring expectant management without routine surveillance, so if this MRI is confidently Bosniak II, no scheduled imaging follow‑up is advised [^112c7NHZ]. Wait, let me verify whether any sources still argue for follow‑up in II lesions; some meta-analytic summaries historically suggested considering follow‑up in Bosniak II and IIF, but that approach has been superseded by contemporary guideline consensus for class II specifically, so I will align with the CUA 2023 recommendation here [^113cWq86] [^112c7NHZ].

> I need to check the malignancy risk to frame patient counseling. Pooled analyses indicate an approximate malignancy rate around 6% for Bosniak II lesions, much lower than categories III–IV, and the overall diagnostic performance suggests a high negative likelihood for malignancy when the category is below III, supporting discharge without routine surveillance when confidently classified as II; I should still emphasize that the classification's strength lies in ruling out clinically significant disease for categories I–II, and that upgrading should be rare if the imaging assignment is accurate [^1123qoax] [^1169G3zn].

> Hold on, let's not miss exceptions. I should confirm two caveats: first, if the cyst is symptomatic (e.g., pain, infection, hemorrhage), intervention such as drainage or surgery may be considered even for Bosniak I or II; second, if there is diagnostic uncertainty or disagreement about the category that could change management, a multidisciplinary review is warranted; on exceedingly rare occasions, unexpected pathology may occur in an apparent class II cyst, so I need to keep clinical context in view and not dismiss red flags like systemic symptoms or discordant growth patterns if they ever arise [^1174Gxeo] [^1126USNZ] [^113p6KVu].

> Let me explicitly distinguish this from Bosniak IIF, because that drives surveillance. If the wall or septa are smoothly minimally thickened to 3 mm, or there are many (≥ 4) thin enhancing septa, that is IIF and not II; IIF generally warrants active surveillance with imaging at 6–12 months and then yearly up to about 5 years if stable, so I should double‑check the MRI descriptors to be sure we are not undercalling an IIF as a II before advising no follow‑up [^114zmX5d] [^113sBRUA].

> Next, I should review imaging modality considerations. Let me think about whether MRI is an acceptable basis for classification here; prospective data using Bosniak v2019 show MRI and CT have comparable diagnostic performance with substantial inter‑reader agreement and moderate inter‑modality agreement, so MRI is appropriate for classification; if iodinated contrast is contraindicated, MRI or contrast‑enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can be considered per ACR and CEUS position statements, with documentation of the modality used for categorization to preserve clarity in follow‑up communication [^114aLSjJ] [^115fEHdb] [^1111fp1i].

> Synthesis time: I should confirm that this MRI lesion truly meets Bosniak II criteria, document that classification in the report, and counsel the patient that no routine surveillance imaging is recommended, given the very low malignancy risk and high reassurance provided by a class II designation; I will advise symptom‑triggered re‑evaluation for new flank pain, hematuria, fever, or atypical changes, and reserve intervention only for symptomatic cases or if future imaging ever raises the category; if any intervention is contemplated for other reasons, I should also consider the patient's CKD risk and engage shared decision‑making about potential renal functional impacts and competing risks during counseling [^112c7NHZ] [^1174Gxeo] [^1141wv3A] [^116tYyQD].

Bosniak II renal cysts on MRI [^114zmX5d] are benign and require **no follow-up** [^112c7NHZ] or **intervention** unless symptomatic; in that case, **symptom-driven management** is appropriate [^1174Gxeo]. If classification is uncertain, obtain a **second radiology review** or **multidisciplinary discussion** to confirm the Bosniak II designation [^1126USNZ] [^1126USNZ]. No **biopsy or surgery** is indicated for asymptomatic Bosniak II cysts [^112c7NHZ] [^1174Gxeo].

---

## Definition and imaging characteristics

Bosniak II cysts are **defined** by the following MRI characteristics [^114zmX5d]:

- **Wall/septa**: Thin (≤ 2 mm), smooth walls; 1–3 thin septa allowed.
- **Enhancement**: Minimal or no enhancement of wall or septa.
- **Calcification**: Fine or thin calcification may be present.
- **Content**: Homogeneous fluid signal similar to CSF on T2-weighted imaging.
- **Solid components**: No solid enhancing components.

These features indicate a benign lesion with **negligible malignancy risk** [^1123qoax] [^1177z2BT].

---

## Malignancy risk

The malignancy risk for Bosniak II cysts is **extremely low** — pooled estimates are around 6% (95% CI 2.7–9.3%) [^1123qoax] [^115vEa7c]. Accordingly, most Bosniak II cysts are benign and **do not require intervention** [^112c7NHZ].

---

## Recommended management

### Asymptomatic patients

In asymptomatic patients, **no routine imaging follow-up** is required for Bosniak II cysts [^112c7NHZ], and **no intervention** is indicated [^1174Gxeo].

---

### Symptomatic patients

In symptomatic patients, **symptom-driven care** is appropriate (e.g. pain, hematuria, infection) [^1174Gxeo]; consider **intervention** only if symptoms persist or worsen despite conservative management.

---

## Follow-up imaging

Routine follow-up imaging is **not recommended** for Bosniak II cysts [^112c7NHZ]. If classification is uncertain, a **second radiology review** or **multidisciplinary discussion** is advised [^1126USNZ] [^112YPmZN].

---

## Patient counseling

Counsel patients on the **benign nature** of Bosniak II cysts and their **negligible risk of malignancy** [^1123qoax]. Reassure them that **no further follow-up or intervention is necessary** unless symptoms develop.

---

## Summary table: management of Bosniak II renal cysts

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| Asymptomatic Bosniak II cyst | No follow-up or intervention [^112c7NHZ] |
| Symptomatic Bosniak II cyst | Symptom-driven management; intervention only if symptoms persist [^1174Gxeo] |
| Uncertainty in classification | Second radiology review or multidisciplinary discussion [^1126USNZ] |

---

Bosniak II renal cysts on MRI are benign lesions with a **negligible risk of malignancy** [^114zmX5d] [^1123qoax]. No **routine follow-up or intervention** is required unless symptoms develop [^112c7NHZ] [^1174Gxeo]. If classification is uncertain, a **second radiology review** or **multidisciplinary discussion** is recommended [^1126USNZ] [^112YPmZN].

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: AUA guideline [^112jUxmh]. The Journal of Urology (2017). High credibility.

This AUA Guideline focuses on the evaluation, counseling, and management of adult patients with clinically localized renal masses suspicious for cancer, including solid-enhancing tumors and Bosniak 3/4 complex-cystic lesions.

- **Materials and methods**: A systematic review was utilized, drawing research from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, supplemented by the authors and consultant methodologists. Evidence-based statements were categorized by the strength of the evidence into Grade A (strong), Grade B (moderate), and Grade C (conditional recommendations). Additional statements were presented as clinical principles or expert opinions.

- **Results**: Significant progress has been made since the earlier guidelines for the management of localized renal masses were released in 2009. The guidelines provide updated, evidence-based recommendations regarding the evaluation and counseling of patients with clinically localized renal masses, highlighting the evolving role of renal mass biopsy. Due to the great variability of clinical, oncologic, and functional characteristics, the guidelines do not utilize index patients, and instead advocate for individualized counseling and management. Management options such as partial nephrectomy, radical nephrectomy, thermal ablation, and active surveillance are reviewed, with recent data on their comparative effectiveness and potential morbidities included. Oncologic issues are prioritized, while also recognizing that functional outcomes are crucial for the survivorship of most patients with localized kidney cancer. A more restricted role for radical nephrectomy is recommended, following well-defined selection criteria.

### Active surveillance of small renal masses [^115WdRXm]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

However, Bosniak IV renal cysts can also be highly necrotic and aggressive solid renal neoplasms. There is limited experience with imaging surveillance of Bosniak IV renal lesions. In cases of active surveillance (AS) of Bosniak IV tumors, if a solid nodular septum or nodular wall cannot consistently be found in order to correctly follow up in terms of progression, we suggest managing it as a small renal mass (Fig. 7) and not as a cystic Bosniak IV in terms of progression. This means that in these cases, the correct follow-up procedure to assess progression is by checking the increase in diameter of the lesions.

Recent studies have demonstrated the high accuracy of CEUS in the characterization of baseline complex cysts. In the study of Quaia et al, CEUS performed better than CT in the diagnosis of malignancy in complex cystic renal masses, with a similar diagnostic reliability between CEUS and CT. CEUS can also be used instead of CT in the follow-up of Bosniak IIF cysts to detect any morphologic changes considered as progressions, such as septa thickening, the appearance of a solid nodule, or contrast-enhanced modifications indicative of disease progression, with the additional benefits of reduction in costs and radiation exposure. CEUS helps to demonstrate the enhancement of hypovascular nodularities of cysts, which are not well demonstrated by CT or US (Fig. 18). CEUS is also useful in hemorrhagic cysts diagnosed by CT or MR, classified as Bosniak IIF if bigger than 3 cm; if CEUS reclassifies these cases as Bosniak I–II.

### Complex renal cysts (Bosniak ≥ IIF): Interobserver agreement, progression and malignancy rates [^113UoGgt]. European Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with Bosniak IIF cysts were followed up according to the local protocol, utilizing serial imaging at intervals of 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months, preferably with the same imaging modality. In cases with a high likelihood of contrast nephropathy, MRI was used for surveillance. The follow-up period was adjusted based on the patient's comorbidities and suitability for surgical intervention. If follow-up imaging indicated increased cyst complexity, the case was referred to a multidisciplinary meeting and reviewed by the uroradiologist. Cyst progression was defined by increased complexity resulting in an upgrade in Bosniak category, with radiological findings of progressing nodule enhancement, septal thickening, and wall thickening.

Patients with Bosniak III and IV cysts were discussed in clinic, where surgical intervention was recommended. The intervention options included partial or total nephrectomy, radiofrequency ablation, or cryoablation, depending on the cyst characteristics and patient-specific factors. Patients who were poor surgical candidates or who opted for conservative management were followed up with serial imaging or discharged based on their preferences.

- **Interobserver variability**: The interobserver agreement was evaluated by comparing the Bosniak category reported on the initial scan at the time of detection with the category reported at the multidisciplinary meeting by the specialist uroradiologist. All cysts discussed at the multidisciplinary meeting (Bosniak ≥ II) were reported using this method.

### Active surveillance of small renal masses [^117EwN4p]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

- **Cystic Bosniak IIF renal mass**: Cystic Bosniak IIF renal mass (arrows) presents growth over time and shows malignant features with an occurrence rate of 5%. An unenhanced ultrasound (US) initially shows a cystic renal lesion with thickened septa. One year later, the unenhanced US of the same lesion demonstrates increasing nodularity in the previously thickened septa, consistent with progression.

- **Contrast-enhanced US**: Contrast-enhanced US images reveal a cystic renal lesion in the wall of the left kidney that is suspected to be solid. A coronal contrast-enhanced CT shows a cystic renal mass with a hard-to-define image in its wall (arrow). Unenhanced and contrast-enhanced US clearly depict enhancement on this solid nodule (arrows) in the cyst wall, leading to the lesion being defined and classified as a Bosniak II lesion.

Historically, a percutaneous biopsy was not recommended in complex renal cysts due to high rates of false-negative results, attributed to cyst septations. However, recent studies have described better diagnostic yields. Nodular areas found inside the cysts should always be included in the renal tumor biopsy (RTB) (Fig. 20).

- **Complex hemorrhagic cyst**: An image suspected to be a complex hemorrhagic cyst larger than 3 cm, initially classified as Bosniak IIF, is later reclassified as a Bosniak II cyst by contrast-enhanced US. An axial T2 magnetic resonance (MR) image shows a complex renal cyst with thick septa (arrow). Unenhanced US of the same lesion shows cystic components and echogenic material within the cyst (arrow). Contrast-enhanced US indicates the absence of enhancement of septa (arrow). The lesion is reclassified as a Bosniak I simple cyst.

### Bosniak classification version 2019: Validation and comparison to original classification in pathologically confirmed cystic masses [^114ABPD5]. European Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

To evaluate the Bosniak Classification v2019 definitions in pathologically confirmed cystic renal masses, seventy-three cystic (≤ 25% solid) masses with histological confirmation (57 malignant, 16 benign) were imaged by CT (N = 28) or CT+MRI (N = 56) between 2009 and 2019. The imaging was independently evaluated by three blinded radiologists using both the Bosniak v2019 and original classifications. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus with a fourth blinded radiologist. Overall class and v2019 features were then compared to pathological outcomes.

Inter-observer agreement showed slight improvement when comparing v2019 to the original Bosniak Classification (kappa = 0.26–0.47 versus 0.24–0.34, respectively). The v2019 showed different proportions for IIF and III masses (20.5% [15/73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 12.0–31.6%], 38.6% [28/73, 95% CI 27.2–50.5%]) compared to the original classification (6.8% [5/73, 95% CI 2.3–15.3%], 61.6% [45/73, 95% CI 49.5–72.8%]), with overlapping proportions of malignancy in each class. Mean septa number (7 ± 4 [range 1–10]) was not associated with malignancy (p = 0.89). Mean wall and septa thicknesses were 3 ± 3 (1–14) and 3 ± 2 (1–10) mm, which were higher in malignancies (p = 0.03 and 0.20, respectively). The areas under the receiver-operator-characteristic curve for wall and septa thickness were 0.66 (95% CI 0.54–0.79) and 0.61 (95% CI 0.45–0.78), with an optimal cut point of ≥ 3 mm (sensitivity 33.3%, specificity 86.7%) and sensitivity 53%, specificity 73%, respectively. The proportion of malignancy occurring in masses with the v2019 feature "irregularity" was 76.9% [10/13, 95% CI 46.2–94.9%].

### Complex renal cysts (Bosniak ≥ IIF): Interobserver agreement, progression and malignancy rates [^112kd3fA]. European Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Bosniak IV cysts were studied in 77 patients with a mean size of 4.01 cm (range, 1.0–9.9 cm). Out of these, 43 cysts (55.8%) were resected immediately after multidisciplinary team (MDT) discussions, three cysts (3.9%) were resected following a period of surveillance, and four cysts (5.2%) were treated with radiofrequency ablation without a pre-operative biopsy. The malignancy rate in the surgically resected group was 84.8% (39/46), while the malignancy rate for cysts that underwent delayed resection was 66.7% (2/3).

Thirty cysts (39.0%) were managed conservatively, with 18 (60%) under follow-up. Of these, 10 cysts (55.6%) did not progress in complexity or size following a median follow-up time of 25.3 months (range, 11.6–84.2), five cysts (27.8%) increased in size following a median follow-up period of 35.2 months, and three cysts (16.7%) regressed following a median follow-up time of 18.6 months. Three of the five cysts increasing in size underwent delayed resection, one was successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation without a biopsy, and one remained under surveillance. Common reasons for conservative management included 11 cysts suitable for surveillance, 13 patients being poor surgical candidates (accounting for 13 cysts), and four cysts lost to follow-up.

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: Evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: Part II [^111DbKd1]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for renal cell carcinoma, particularly for patients with Bosniak III-IV cysts, watchful waiting is addressed. The AUA 2021 guidelines recommend offering interventional treatment to patients with a Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal mass if the anticipated oncologic benefits of intervention outweigh the risks of treatment and competing risks of death. Active surveillance with the potential for delayed intervention should be considered only if the patient understands and is willing to accept the associated oncologic risks. A renal mass biopsy should be performed for additional risk stratification. It is advised to obtain close clinical and cross-sectional imaging surveillance with periodic reassessment and counseling if the patient continues to prefer active surveillance.

### Complex renal cysts (Bosniak ≥ IIF): Interobserver agreement, progression and malignancy rates [^115WyVgT]. European radiology (2021). Low credibility.

There is an established protocol to characterize cysts at our institution, as described before. The CT renal characterization scan is triphasic with precontrast, arterial (40 seconds post-contrast), and nephrographic phases (100 seconds post-contrast), following the IV administration of 100 mL of an iodine-based contrast agent (Omnipaque). This is acquired as a volume using a 64-slice thickness CT scanner (Fig. 2). The 100-second delay helps to visualize the kidneys in their nephrographic phase, which is the optimal phase to characterize renal cysts. The nephrographic phase was also obtained using MRI with gadolinium contrast. T2 HASTE (6-mm slice thickness, 1.8-mm gap), T1 VIBE pre- and post-contrast (3.5-mm slice thickness, 0.7-mm gap), STIR (8-mm slice thickness, 2.4-mm gap), and diffusion-weighted (4-mm slice thickness, 1.2-mm gap; b values 50, 400, 1000 s/mm²) images were obtained. The change in cyst enhancement was measured by calculating the difference in pre- and post-contrast enhancement.

### Complex renal cysts (Bosniak ≥ IIF): Interobserver agreement, progression and malignancy rates [^1121s8xo]. European Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

The Bosniak classification stratifies renal cysts using radiological appearances to determine malignancy risk. Radiological features indicative of malignancy include irregular septa, nodular changes, wall thickening, and significant enhancement. Categorizing renal cysts accurately using the Bosniak classification can be challenging due to its subjective criteria and variations in observer experience. Within the literature, there remains a large degree of variation in the reported interobserver agreement rate between radiologists. Consequently, the risk of cyst misclassification and inappropriate surgical or conservative management is unclear and warrants further investigation.

The management of Bosniak cysts is dependent on cyst category. Grounded by malignancy rates, the literature supports the discharge of Bosniak I and II cysts, imaging follow-up of Bosniak IIF cysts, and surgical intervention for Bosniak III and IV cysts. Interval imaging follow-up of Bosniak IIF cysts is necessary because of the risk of cyst progression and malignancy. Although the rate of progression is variable, a high malignancy rate of progressed Bosniak IIF cysts has been reported, necessitating follow-up. The likelihood and time to progression are undetermined in the literature, though a minimum of 1 year for uncomplicated and up to 4 years for more complex Bosniak IIF cysts has been suggested. Further studies are required to establish the rate of progression, rate of malignancy, and appropriate length of follow-up.

The malignancy risk of resected Bosniak III cysts is highly variable in the available research, indicating the need for more comprehensive data.

### Ct and MR imaging of cystic renal lesions [^111Tp8Pj]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Cystic renal lesions are commonly encountered on radiologic examinations. Complex and multifocal cystic renal lesions are often a diagnostic challenge, since they can represent both neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions. The Bosniak classification system is a well-established imaging method that aids radiologists and surgeons in daily practice by differentiating nonsurgical from surgical lesions. Radiologists should also recognize the imaging appearances of specific types of cystic lesions to better characterize them.

### Evaluation of Bosniak category IIF complex renal cysts [^114nnZs3]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

- **Imaging findings and follow-up**: Transversal CT images in different phases (a non-contrast, b corticomedullary phase, and c nephrographic phase) of a 70-year-old female revealed an indeterminate complex renal cystic mass (arrow) with multiple septa, calcification, and a suspicious nodular area without measurable contrast enhancement. The arrowheads indicate one example of such a suspicious area. The lesion was classified as BIIF but was very close to BIII and remained stable for the first 2 years of follow-up.

- **Case study comparison**: Transversal CT images (a non-contrast, b corticomedullary phase, and c coronal nephrographic phase) of a 69-year-old female showed a moderately complex renal cystic mass (arrow) with thick and nodular calcification in the wall and septa (arrowhead). This was also interpreted as BIIF, with no progression after 4 years of follow-up.

- **Baseline assessment**: Baseline transversal CT images (a non-contrast, b corticomedullary phase, and c nephrographic phase) of a 64-year-old female displayed an indeterminate complex renal cystic mass (arrow) with multiple septa, calcification, and slightly thickened septa showing perceived enhancement (arrowhead). The lesion remained stable for the first 3 years with MRI follow-up (not shown).

- **Differential diagnosis**: Transversal CT images (a non-contrast, b corticomedullary phase, and c nephrographic phase) of an 85-year-old male demonstrated a typical benign BII exophytic hyperdense cyst (arrow) measuring 35 HU in all phases.

- **Additional case note**: CT images of an 85-year-old male revealed a large renal cell tumor on the right side (not shown) and a left-sided indeterminate complex renal cyst with thickened features (incomplete data available).

### Management of complex renal cysts in Canada: Results of a survey study [^117Hfxb7]. BMC Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Up to one-third of individuals over 60 years of age will be diagnosed with a renal cyst following abdominal imaging. Renal cysts are classified according to the Bosniak classification, which categorizes the cysts based on their degree of complexity and risk of malignancy. Cystic renal cell carcinoma represents approximately 5–10% of all renal malignancies. Bosniak III and IV cysts have a high risk of malignancy (40–60% and 80–90%, respectively) and have traditionally been managed with surgical excision. However, similar to small non-cystic renal masses, there is growing evidence suggesting that most of these cysts are indolent and unlikely to metastasize. Thus, active surveillance has been proposed as an alternative to surgery.

Recent observational data has provided support for the use of active surveillance among patients with complex renal cysts. However, the adoption of this treatment strategy for the management of complex cysts in Canada and the criteria used by urologists as triggers for discontinuation of surveillance and intervention have yet to be defined.

The objectives of this survey study were to characterize the use of active surveillance in the management of complex renal cysts in Canada and to elicit the perceived barriers to adoption. We also aimed to characterize patient and disease factors associated with the use of active surveillance and triggers used as criteria for intervention.

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: Evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: Part II [^111VcH95]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for renal cysts, particularly in the context of expectant management, the AUA 2021 guidelines recommend considering a renal mass biopsy for further oncologic risk stratification. This applies to patients with a Bosniak III or IV complex cystic renal mass when the risk/benefit ratio for treatment and active surveillance is equivocal. Repeat cross-sectional imaging should be obtained approximately 3–6 months later to assess for interval growth. Decisions on continued clinical or imaging surveillance should be based on the observed growth rate and shared decision-making. If substantial interval growth is observed, or if other clinical or imaging findings indicate that the risk/benefit analysis is no longer equivocal or favorable for continued active surveillance, intervention should be considered.

Regarding the medical management of renal cysts, specifically with respect to expectant management of Bosniak III-IV cysts, the AUA 2021 guidelines recommend offering interventional treatment to patients with a Bosniak III or IV complex cystic renal mass if the anticipated oncologic benefits of intervention outweigh the risks of treatment and competing risks of death. Consider offering active surveillance with the potential for delayed intervention only if the patient understands and is willing to accept the associated oncologic risks. Perform a renal mass biopsy for additional risk stratification. Obtain close clinical and cross-sectional imaging surveillance with periodic reassessment and counseling if the patient continues to prefer active surveillance.

### Management of complex renal cysts in Canada: Results of a survey study [^113hNWKA]. BMC Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Bosniak III and IV cysts have a high risk of malignancy and have traditionally been managed surgically. However, growing evidence suggests that many can be managed by active surveillance. The main objective of this study was to characterize the use of surveillance in the management of complex renal cysts.

- **Methods**: A web-based survey was sent to all registered, active members of the Canadian Urological Association (N = 583) in October 2018.

- **Results**: The survey response rate was 24.7%. Management of Bosniak III cysts varied considerably. A significant proportion of respondents (33.1%) offered active surveillance in more than 50% of cases. Only 13.7% of respondents reported never or rarely offering active surveillance. Surveillance for Bosniak IV cysts was possible in more than 50% of cases. A significantly greater proportion of academic urologists, compared to non-academic urologists, viewed surveillance as a management option for patients with a Bosniak III or IV cyst. The most commonly reported barriers to a greater adoption of surveillance were concerns regarding its oncologic safety, the lack of data to support surveillance in this population, and the lack of triggers for discontinuation of active surveillance and intervention.

- **Conclusions**: Despite active surveillance being included as a management option in guidelines, many Canadian urologists are reluctant to offer surveillance to patients with Bosniak III or IV cysts. Practice patterns are heterogeneous among those offering surveillance.

### Management of complex renal cysts in Canada: results of a survey study [^114v9prP]. BMC Urology (2020). Low credibility.

This study supports that, despite the lack of high-quality evidence, many Canadian urologists offer active surveillance as an option to patients with complex renal cysts, especially if they have a Bosniak III cyst. However, the lack of sufficient data or guidelines on safety seems to prevent widespread adoption of active surveillance. Prospective studies should be conducted to provide evidence on the oncologic safety, benefits, harms, cost, eligibility criteria, and guidelines for the discontinuation of active surveillance in the management of Bosniak III and IV cysts.

### Evaluation of Bosniak category IIF complex renal cysts [^111t47Ea]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

The regional ethics committee approved the study with project ID: S-20090137. Over a 7-year period (January 2003-December 2009), radiological reports from 8,402 CT examinations of the kidney were retrospectively analyzed by a radiologist with 5 years of experience. Patients with complex renal cysts and normal renal function (estimated creatinine clearance > 60 ml/min/1.74 m²) diagnosed on multiphase contrast-enhanced CT and with a follow-up of ≥ 2 years were included in the study (n = 550). The lesions on the CT examinations were reclassified according to the Bosniak classification by two experienced uroradiologists with 5 and 20 years of experience, respectively, achieving consensus on image analysis.

All patients were recruited from one institution and examined using the same follow-up protocol, CT scanner, and CT protocol. The complexity of each lesion was assessed based on the Bosniak classification, considering factors such as the number and appearance of septa, wall thickness, hyperdense cystic content, interface with the kidney parenchyma, presence and amount of calcification, and contrast enhancement characteristics. Lesion size was measured in two dimensions on the axial image, and follow-up examinations were evaluated for any interval change. Estimated radiation exposure for each CT scan was calculated in mSv using the conversion factor 0.017 mSv/mGy × cm × the dose length product (DLP).

In this study, only Bosniak category IIF cysts were included. From the total number of BIIF lesions, we selected patients with ≥ 2 years of follow-up to ensure robust data analysis.

### Bosniak classification version 2019: A prospective comparison of CT and MRI [^114aLSjJ]. European Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

To assess the diagnostic accuracy and agreement of CT and MRI in terms of the Bosniak classification version 2019 (BCv2019), a prospective multi-institutional study was conducted. The study enrolled 63 patients with 67 complicated cystic renal masses (CRMs) discovered during ultrasound examinations. All patients underwent CT and MRI scans along with histopathology. Three radiologists independently assessed CRMs using BCv2019 and assigned a Bosniak class to each CRM using CT and MRI. The final analysis included 60 histopathologically confirmed CRMs, of which 41 were malignant and 19 were benign.

Discordance between CT and MRI findings was observed in 50% (30/60) of the CRMs when analyzed in terms of the Bosniak classes, with 16 (53.3%) being malignant. Consensus reviewing revealed no difference in the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of BCv2019 with MRI compared to BCv2019 with CT. Sensitivity was 87.8% (95% CI = 73.8–95.9%) versus 75.6% (95% CI = 59.7–87.6%; p = 0.09), specificity was 84.2% (95% CI = 60.4–96.6%) versus 78.9% (95% CI = 54.4–93.9%; p = 0.5), and accuracy was 86.7% (95% CI = 64.0–86.6%) versus 76.7% (95% CI = 75.4–94.1%; p = 0.1). The number and thickness of septa and the presence of enhanced nodules accounted for the majority of variations in Bosniak classes between CT and MRI. The inter-reader agreement (IRA) was substantial for determining the Bosniak class in CT and MRI, with kappa values of k = 0.66 (95% CI = 0.54–0.76) and k = 0.62 (95% CI = 0.50–0.73), respectively. The inter-modality agreement of the BCv2019 between CT and MRI was moderate (κ = 0.58).

In conclusion, in terms of BCv2019, CT and MRI demonstrate comparable diagnostic performance.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for renal cysts, specifically with respect to the Bosniak classification, the 2019 guidelines recommend using the Bosniak classification (2019 version) to classify cystic renal masses on MRI.

- **Class I**: Well-defined, thin (≤ 2 mm) smooth wall. Homogeneous simple fluid (signal intensity similar to CSF). No septa or calcifications. The wall may enhance.

- **Class II**:
	- Well-defined with thin (≤ 2 mm) smooth walls.
	- Cystic masses with thin (≤ 2 mm) and few (1–3) septa. Septa and wall may enhance and may have calcification of any type.
	- Homogeneous masses markedly hyperintense at T2-weighted imaging (similar to CSF) at non-contrast MRI.
	- Homogeneous masses markedly hyperintense at T1-weighted imaging (approximately ×2.5 normal parenchymal signal intensity) at non-contrast MRI.

- **Class IIF**:
	- Cystic masses with a smooth minimally thickened (3 mm) enhancing wall or smooth minimal thickening (3 mm) of ≥ 1 enhancing septa, or many (≥ 4) smooth thin (≤ 2 mm) enhancing septa.
	- Cystic masses that are heterogeneously hyperintense at unenhanced fat-saturated T1-weighted imaging.

- **Class III**: ≥ 1 enhancing thick (≥ 4 mm width) or enhancing irregular (displaying ≤ 3 mm obtusely margined convex protrusions) wall or septa.

- **Class IV**: ≥ 1 enhancing nodules (≥ 4 mm convex protrusion with obtuse margins, or a convex protrusion of any size that has acute margins).

Regarding specific circumstances for renal cell carcinoma, particularly in patients with Bosniak III-IV cysts, the AUA 2021 guidelines recommend considering renal mass biopsy for further oncologic risk stratification in patients with a Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal mass, especially when the risk/benefit ratio for treatment is equivocal, and they elect active surveillance. Obtain repeat cross-sectional imaging approximately 3–6 months later to assess for interval growth. Consider periodic clinical or imaging surveillance based on the growth rate and shared decision-making. Offer intervention if substantial interval growth is observed or if other clinical or imaging findings suggest that the risk/benefit analysis is no longer equivocal or favorable for continued active surveillance.

### Malignancy rates and diagnostic performance of the Bosniak classification for the diagnosis of cystic renal lesions in computed tomography - a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1177z2BT]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature on the Bosniak classification system in CT to determine its diagnostic performance in diagnosing malignant cystic lesions and the prevalence of malignancy in Bosniak categories.

- **Methods**: A predefined database search was performed from 1 January 1986 to 18 January 2016. Two independent reviewers extracted data on malignancy rates in Bosniak categories and several covariates using predefined criteria. Study quality was assessed using QUADAS-2. Meta-analysis included data pooling, subgroup analyses, meta-regression, and investigation of publication bias.

- **Results**: A total of 35 studies, which included 2,578 lesions, were investigated. Data on observer experience, inter-observer variation, and technical CT standards were insufficiently reported. The pooled rate of malignancy increased from Bosniak I (3.2%, 95% CI 0–6.8, I² = 5%) to Bosniak II (6%, 95% CI 2.7–9.3, I² = 32%), IIF (6.7%, 95% CI 5–8.4, I² = 0%), III (55.1%, 95% CI 45.7–64.5, I² = 89%), and IV (91%, 95% CI 87.7–94.2, I² = 36). Several study design-related influences on malignancy rates and subsequent diagnostic performance indices were identified.

- **Conclusion**: The Bosniak classification is an accurate tool to stratify the risk of malignancy in renal cystic lesions.

- **Key Points**
- The Bosniak classification can accurately rule out malignancy.
- Specificity remains moderate at 74% (95% CI 64–82).
- Follow-up examinations should be considered in Bosniak IIF and Bosniak II cysts.

**Rate of malignancy in Bosniak categories**: The rate of malignancy increased from Bosniak I to IV. Pooled estimates were 3.2% (95% CI 0–6.8) in 89 Bosniak I, 6% (95% CI 2.7–9.3) in 261 Bosniak II, 6.7% (95% CI 5–8.4) in 818 Bosniak IIF, 55.1% (95% CI 45.7–64.5) in 887 Bosniak III, and 91% (95% CI 87.7–94.2) in 449 Bosniak IV lesions. Malignancy rates did not differ between Bosniak I, II, and IIF (P-values I vs. II: 0.309, II vs. IIF: 0.690, I vs. IIF: 0.199) and were higher in Bosniak III (P-values vs. IIF < 0.0001) but lower than in Bosniak IV (P < 0.0001).

Regarding specific circumstances for renal cell carcinoma, particularly in patients with Bosniak III-IV cysts, the AUA 2021 guidelines recommend considering radical nephrectomy for patients with a Bosniak III/IV complex cystic renal mass whenever increased oncologic potential is suggested by tumor size, renal mass biopsy, and/or imaging.

Prefer radical nephrectomy in this setting if all of the following criteria are met:

- **High tumor complexity**: Partial nephrectomy would be challenging even in experienced hands.

- **No preexisting CKD or proteinuria**.

- **Normal contralateral kidney**: The new baseline eGFR will likely be > 45 mL/min/1.73 m² even if radical nephrectomy is performed.

### Evaluation of Bosniak category IIF complex renal cysts [^112ds3y7]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Biopsy and minimally invasive intervention

Biopsy of moderately complex cystic masses in the kidney has recently come into focus, with a trend towards a more aggressive approach. This shift is presumably to avoid follow-up imaging of those BIIF lesions that are close to BIII and is undoubtedly due to the possibility of using local nephron-sparing treatment, such as ablation with cryo/radiofrequency therapy and/or laparoscopic resection. Whether biopsy and aspiration of the cyst fluid should be routinely used is controversial, as it may be problematic to accept a negative biopsy result given the typical inhomogeneity of renal cysts. Generally, it is recommended that Bosniak category III and IV lesions be treated surgically or with minimally invasive ablation. The treatment strategy should consider the size and location of the lesion, as well as the patient's general condition. It should be noted, however, that the indication for minimally invasive treatment in cases of suspected malignancy is still in the exploratory phase. Thus, the routine use of these minimally invasive methods should be protocolized, and results should be published.

Although our sample size is small, the data appear consistent in suggesting that if progression is observed radiologically, it corresponds to pathological results. However, the corresponding aggressiveness of the lesions requires further evaluation in prospective studies. Our cases were analyzed in consensus, so interobserver variability could not be assessed. Like M. A. Bosniak, we believe that if the complexity of a category II lesion is in ques…

### Malignancy rates and diagnostic performance of the Bosniak classification for the diagnosis of cystic renal lesions in computed tomography - a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116o6xWe]. European Radiology (2017). High credibility.

Our results demonstrate an increasing malignancy rate from Bosniak I to IV categories. Between-study heterogeneity ranged from low to high, with the highest value observed in Bosniak III lesions. Bosniak III cysts are defined as complex cysts and must be differentiated from minimally complex cysts (IIF) that can be managed with only follow-up. We did not identify any explanatory variable for the observed heterogeneity in Bosniak III lesions. However, two factors very likely contributing to this heterogeneity — namely, reader experience and spatial resolution — were insufficiently reported in the majority of included studies.

Bosniak IIF cysts were more likely to be malignant if the study considered only histopathology as the standard of reference. As the rate of true-negative findings, and subsequently, the malignancy rate, depends on whether clinically benign findings that are not subject to histopathological sampling are considered, a study design-related selection bias did appear to be present. The low to medium heterogeneity in Bosniak I, II, and IV categories that was accompanied by a low (Bosniak I, II) or high (Bosniak IV) malignancy rate strongly suggests that the limitations of the Bosniak classification lie in a less-than-optimal grading of lesion complexity using the Bosniak IIF and III categories. This is underlined by the fact that the introduction of the Bosniak IIF category did not significantly affect the overall diagnostic performance of the Bosniak classification.

### Bosniak category IIF designation and surgery for complex renal cysts [^113MMWfd]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

We investigated whether adding the IIF categorization improved the accuracy of Bosniak renal cyst classification, as evidenced by a low rate of progression in IIF lesions and a high rate of malignancy in category III lesions.

- **Materials and methods**: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with complex renal cysts categorized as Bosniak IIF or III. Surveillance imaging and pathological outcomes of category IIF cysts were recorded to determine radiological predictors of progression. Pathological outcomes of category III cysts were recorded to determine the malignancy rate.

- **Results**: A total of 112 patients met study inclusion criteria, of whom 81 were initially diagnosed with a category IIF cyst and 31 had a Bosniak category III cyst. At a median follow-up of 15 months, 14.8% of Bosniak IIF lesions progressed in complexity with a median time to progression of 11 months (maximum greater than 4 years). There were no differences in tumor or patient characteristics between cysts that progressed and those that remained stable. In the 33 patients with Bosniak III lesions who underwent surgical extirpation, the malignancy rate was 81.8%. Most patients had low stage, low-grade disease and remained recurrence-free at a median follow-up of 6 months.

- **Conclusions**: Adding the IIF category has increased the accuracy and clinical impact of the Bosniak categorization system, as evidenced by a low rate of progression in category IIF cysts and an increased rate of malignancy in surgically treated category III lesions compared to those in historical controls.

### Malignancy rates and diagnostic performance of the Bosniak classification for the diagnosis of cystic renal lesions in computed tomography - a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1169G3zn]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Overall, the Bosniak classification demonstrated a sensitivity of 89.6% and a specificity of 65.1%. Meta-regression identified a lower sensitivity in studies that included only Bosniak IIF lesions as benign. This finding was attributed to a higher prevalence of malignancy in Bosniak IIF compared to Bosniak II and I categories. Consequently, the rate of false-negative findings was higher per study design than in the case of a non-selected inclusion of all non-surgical Bosniak categories (I, II, and IIF).

In addition, study design-related specificity was lower in studies that used surgical verification only as the standard of reference. A higher rate of true-negative findings is expected when follow-up is used as the reference standard, since true-negative findings without subsequent surgery are not considered in studies focusing only on histopathologically verified lesions. In the latter case, specificity is expected to be lower.

Consequently, the best diagnostic performance for the Bosniak classification system was identified in studies most representative of the clinical setting: non-selected lesion inclusion and considering follow-up examination results in addition to histopathological work-up. Here, sensitivity was very high; conversely, the negative likelihood ratio was very low. This leads us to conclude that a negative Bosniak finding (Bosniak category < III) will sufficiently exclude malignancy. However, pooled specificity and positive likelihood ratios were rather mediocre. As false-positive findings regularly result in unnecessary treatment…

This study further confirms that a good degree of agreement exists between radiologists in classifying complex renal masses using the Bosniak classification. The progression rate of Bosniak IIF cysts is low, but the malignancy rates of progressed Bosniak IIF cysts and Bosniak III and IV cysts are high. A very high proportion of histopathologically confirmed cancers in complex renal cysts are of low grade and stage.

### Evaluation of Bosniak category IIF complex renal cysts [^115byY8N]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Many lesions in the kidney are discovered by coincidence due to the increased use of modern imaging modalities such as ultrasonography (US), computerized tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Renal cysts are rare in children (0.1%–0.45%) and common in adults, with approximately 50% of individuals over 50 years of age having renal cysts. Renal cysts are most often simple and asymptomatic. Distinguishing simple renal cysts from solid tumors in the kidney does not represent a diagnostic challenge. Complex renal cysts, on the other hand, remain a clinical problem. The most critical element in the diagnostic categorization of complex renal cysts is differentiating between benign and potentially malignant lesions. This differentiation is essential to identify (1) which lesions require surgical intervention, (2) which can be safely followed by imaging, and (3) which are unequivocally benign and need no surgical intervention or imaging follow-up.

The Bosniak classification is a diagnostic system for differentiating cystic renal lesions in the kidney using CT. It was introduced in 1986 and has been updated several times, most recently in 2005. This classification system is based on several morphological changes in renal cysts: septa formation, wall thickening including nodal components, calcification in the wall and/or septa, hyperdense cystic content, and contrast enhancement after intravenous contrast injection. Cystic lesions in the kidney are divided into four categories using CT, where Bosniak category I and II lesions are predicted to be benign.

### Evaluation of Bosniak category IIF complex renal cysts [^113vRhmh]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate moderately complex renal cysts of Bosniak category IIF.

The regional ethics committee approved the study. Between 2003 and 2009, CT reports of 8,402 kidney examinations were retrospectively analyzed by a radiologist. All complex cystic lesions in the kidney (n = 550, matching the number of patients) were reclassified according to the Bosniak classification through a consensus between two radiologists. If a patient had multiple lesions, only the highest Bosniak category was recorded. The study included all Bosniak IIF lesions with a follow-up of at least two years.

Thirty-two Bosniak IIF lesions were identified. During follow-up, five lesions (16%) were upgraded, and patients were offered surgery. Pathological examination revealed papillary carcinoma, clear cell renal carcinoma, and chronic inflammation, respectively, in three lesions. Due to comorbidity, the remaining two patients continued to be monitored with CT without intervention. Ten lesions (31%) with follow-up periods greater than five years showed no further radiological changes, and clinical follow-up ceased.

The study concludes that using Bosniak category IIF is clinically applicable and leads to a nephron-sparing surgical approach for complex renal cysts.

- **Teaching points**:
	- The Bosniak classification is used to categorize complex renal cystic masses.
	- BIIF cysts mostly behave as benign lesions.
	- Radiological progression in complexity occurs in only 16% of cases.
	- The BIIF category seems promising for clinical application, potentially avoiding unnecessary surgery.

### Evaluation of Bosniak category IIF complex renal cysts [^113Rs5bc]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

- **Follow-up imaging for BIIF lesions**: Recommended follow-up protocols for BIIF cystic lesions vary in the literature. To detect potential progression, a multiphase contrast CT is needed. M. A. Bosniak proposed the first control CT to be done after half a year, and if the lesion was unchanged, a control CT should be repeated annually for a minimum of 5 years. Other authors recommend close monitoring in the first year with CT scans after 3, 6, and 12 months. At our institution, patients with complex Bosniak IIF cysts used to be followed according to the latter protocol and, in cases without progression, annually for 5 years. It should, however, be noted that very narrow follow-up periods may reduce detection rates if the changes in the cysts from examination to examination are very small. As a consequence of these considerations and the results of this study, we have dropped the early 3-month follow-up. However, due to the lack of prospective series, the most appropriate follow-up regimen in these patients is still debatable.

- **Bosniak IIF lesions vary in appearance**: (1) BIIF lesions with minimal findings close to category II in complexity and (2) BIIF lesions that are closer to category III in complexity. M. A. Bosniak has recently suggested that BIIF cysts with minimal findings only need follow-up for 1–2 years, whereas more complex BIIF cysts should be followed for a longer period (e.g. 3–4 years or longer). This seems to be a reasonable compromise, taking into consideration the high, cumulated radiation dose of repeated examinations. CT is still considered the gold standard.

### Bosniak classification of cystic renal masses: Looking back, looking forward [^112xzjuX]. Academic Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

According to the 2019 update of the Bosniak classification, the main imaging features that need to be evaluated to achieve a correct characterization of renal cystic masses include the thickness of walls and septa, the number of septa, the appearance of walls and septa, the attenuation/intensity on non-contrast CT/MRI, and the presence of unequivocally perceived or measurable enhancement of walls and septa. Despite the improvements deriving from a quantitative evaluation of imaging features, certain limitations persist, and possible scenarios encountered in clinical practice are still missing.

A deep analysis of the 2019 update of the Bosniak classification was performed. The most notable potential flaws concern: (1) the quantitative measurement of the walls and septa; (2) the fact that walls and septa greater than 2 mm are always referred to as "enhancing", without considering alternative scenarios; (3) the description of some class II masses partially overlaps with each other and with the definition of class I masses; and (4) the morphological variations of cystic masses over time are not considered.

The present paper analyzes in detail the limitations of the 2019 Bosniak classification to improve this important tool and facilitate its use in daily radiological practice.

### Evaluation of Bosniak category IIF complex renal cysts [^111bVRsF]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

By critically evaluating the outcome of complex renal cysts using the Bosniak classification, we found that out of 32 Bosniak category IIF lesions, only 5 (16%) were upgraded during follow-up. Malignant progression did occur in two of these lesions, and follow-up examinations are considered necessary. The introduction of Bosniak category IIF seems promising, potentially resulting in a rational and overall nephron-sparing approach to complex renal cysts.

### Malignancy rates and diagnostic performance of the Bosniak classification for the diagnosis of cystic renal lesions in computed tomography - a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114SRKiG]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Overall, 35 eligible studies were selected. In our meta-analysis, a total of 2,557 patients with 2,578 lesions (862 malignant lesions, 33.4%) were included. The QUADAS 2 assessment revealed a mixed risk of bias regarding patient selection. A number of studies used only histopathology as the sole reference standard, and patient recruitment was non-consecutive or lacked sufficient details.

Notably, benign lesions often included only Bosniak IIF or Bosniak II and IIF cysts but did not include Bosniak I lesions. Despite these issues, no further risk of bias concerns were raised, and all included studies were considered applicable to answer the research question. The study designs were described as prospective in one study and retrospective in 33 studies. In one instance, the retrospective or prospective nature of the study was indeterminate.

- **Patient recruitment**:
	- Consecutive in seven studies.
	- Non-consecutive case-control patient recruitment described in seven reports.
	- In 21 studies, the consecutive or non-consecutive nature of patient recruitment was not clearly stated.

Histopathology as a reference standard was utilized in 13 studies, while a combination of follow-up and histopathology was used in another 21 studies. In one study, only follow-up was employed as the reference standard. Moreover, 25 out of the 35 (71.4%) eligible studies provided technical information on computed tomography; however, this information was incomplete in the majority of cases.

### Active surveillance of small renal masses [^113SJRm9]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Bosniak IIIs (a, b) and IIIn (c) lesions are discussed with imaging examples. (a) Axial T2-weighted MR shows a multiseptated cystic renal lesion (arrow), and (b) axial T1 post-contrast MR of the same lesion shows septal enhancement (arrow) consistent with a Bosniak IIIs cyst. (c) Axial contrast-enhanced CT of a cystic renal mass with septae nodularity (arrow) is considered a Bosniak IIIn cyst.

Active surveillance (AS) of complex renal cysts differs from that of solid masses. Figure 17 illustrates a potential follow-up algorithm for these lesions. The size of complex renal cysts does not correlate with the incidence of RCC or tumor aggressiveness. A recent study reports that malignant cysts are smaller than benign cysts. During follow-up, changes in the internal architecture, such as septa and wall thickening or nodularity, are considered to demonstrate progression. The indolent behavior of cystic malignancies suggests that delayed intervention should be strongly considered when treating patients with cystic renal masses, even Bosniak IIIn and IV cysts, in similar scenarios recommended in small renal masses (SRM) guidelines.

### New modalities for evaluation and surveillance of complex renal cysts [^113aWMtz]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

The increased use of abdominal imaging has led to more frequent detection of incidental renal cysts. Since the inception of the Bosniak classification system, management of Bosniak I, III, and IV cysts has been clearly defined, while evaluation and management of Bosniak II and IIF cysts have remained a clinical dilemma. Discussions of new imaging modalities are becoming increasingly prevalent in the radiological literature. In this context, we performed a comprehensive review of the recent literature on complex renal cysts, focusing on new imaging modalities, surveillance strategies, and biopsy.

We performed a comprehensive literature review of articles published from January 1, 1998, through December 31, 2013, via MEDLINE®, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Collection using a predetermined search strategy. All studies included were performed in humans older than 18 years, were written in English, and had an abstract available for review. We grouped studies into one of five categories: computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, biopsy, and surveillance.

While computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging with and without contrast enhancement remain the gold standard to evaluate cystic lesions of the kidney, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and contrast-enhanced ultrasound have surfaced as new tools for the assessment of complex cysts. Comparative effectiveness studies on these new imaging modalities are limited. Image-guided biopsy has increasingly been shown to be useful for the evaluation of intermediate (Bosniak II and IIF) cysts.

### Long-term surveillance of complex cystic renal masses and heterogeneity of Bosniak 3 lesions [^115TQT5d]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

We sought to better characterize the frequency of Bosniak cyst class changes, identify predictors of change and progression, determine the average growth rate of cysts, and validate the safety of active surveillance.

- **Materials and methods**: Consecutive patients referred for the management of complex cysts (Bosniak 2F or greater) were included in the analysis. All imaging studies were reevaluated, and any stage change was reviewed with a blinded genitourinary radiologist. Bosniak 3 cysts were subclassified as 3s-septated enhancing Bosniak cysts and 3n-cysts with wall or septation-only nodularity. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify predictors of the Bosniak classification change. Kaplan-Meier curves were applied to analyze Bosniak cyst progression and regression.

- **Results**: A total of 140 lesions were included in the study, necessitating review of a total of 1,011 abdominal scans in 111 patients. Median follow-up was 46 months (IQR 23–65.5), and patients underwent a mean of 6.8 diagnostic scans. On multivariate analysis, nodular cysts progressed (HR 6.16, 95% CI 2.58–14.72, p < 0.00004) while entirely endophytic cysts were less likely to progress (HR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05–0.85, p = 0.028). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed Bosniak 3s cysts were more likely to regress while Bosniak 3n cysts were more likely to progress than 3s cysts (p = 0.0178 and 0.0002, respectively). The growth rate of 3n and 2F cysts was 0.19 and 0.11 cm per year (p = 0.0493 and 0.0327, respectively). Locally advanced or metastatic disease did not develop in any patient.

### The modified Bosniak classification for intermediate-risk renal cysts in children [^113t8Kxt]. Urology (2021). Low credibility.

To examine correlations of the modified Bosniak categories assigned by radiologists to histological results and inter-rater reliability, this study focused on intermediate-risk lesions. The data of pediatric patients who underwent surgery for intermediate-risk complex renal cysts at a tertiary medical center between 2006 and 2019 were collected retrospectively. Four pediatric radiologists from two different medical centers reviewed the available imaging scans and assigned each to one of the four modified Bosniak classification categories. Binary cohorts of the Bosniak categories (I-II vs. III-IV) were compared to the histological results. Diagnostic accuracy (benign vs. intermediate-risk lesion) was calculated for each radiologist and for each imaging modality. Krippendorff's α test was used to measure inter-rater reliability.

The cohort included seven children, each with one complex cyst that was rated as intermediate-risk on pathological study. The median age was 1.5 years (IQR 1, 11.9). A correct classification was made in 41 out of 56 imaging readings (sensitivity 73.2%). Applying Krippendorff's test to the binary Bosniak cohorts yielded poor inter-rater agreement (α = 0.08).

The implementation of the modified Bosniak classification in children caused a disconcerting underestimation of intermediate risk. There was a low inter-rater consistency for the categories intended to guide decisions regarding surgery or conservative management. The findings suggest that clinicians should be cautious using the modified Bosniak system for children.

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: Evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: Part I [^112P3fJ1]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

The AUA 2021 guidelines for the management of renal cell carcinoma, particularly in patients with Bosniak III-IV cysts, recommend considering nephron-sparing approaches for patients with a Bosniak III/IV complex cystic renal mass under certain conditions:

- **Young age**: Patients who are younger and may benefit from preserving renal function.

- **Multifocal masses**: In cases where patients present with multiple renal masses.

- **Comorbidities likely to impact renal function in the future**: This includes conditions such as moderate-to-severe hypertension, diabetes mellitus, recurrent urolithiasis, or morbid obesity.

These guidelines prioritize preserving renal function while effectively managing the cancer.

### Can a modified Bosniak classification system risk stratify pediatric cystic renal masses [^114SwcZX]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

We characterized and applied the modified Bosniak classification system to a cohort of children with cystic renal lesions and known surgical pathology.

- **Materials and methods**: We identified all patients at our institution with cystic renal masses who also underwent surgery for these lesions. Patients without available preoperative imaging or pathology were excluded. All radiological imaging was independently reviewed by a pediatric radiologist blinded to pathological findings. Imaging characteristics (size, border, septations, calcifications, solid components, vascularity) were recorded from the most recent preoperative ultrasounds and computerized tomograms. The modified Bosniak classification system was applied to these scans and then correlated with final pathology.

- **Results**: A total of 22 patients met the study criteria. The median age at surgery was 6.1 years (range 11 months to 16.8 years). Of the patients, 12 (54.5%) underwent open nephrectomy, 6 (27.3%) open partial nephrectomy, 2 (9.1%) laparoscopic cyst decortication, 1 (4.5%) open renal biopsy, and 1 (4.5%) laparoscopic partial nephrectomy. Final pathology was benign in 9 cases (41%), intermediate in 6 (27%), and malignant in 7 (32%). All malignant lesions were modified Bosniak class 4, all intermediate lesions were modified class 3 or 4, and 8 of 9 benign lesions (89%) were modified class 1 or 2.

- **Conclusions**: Cystic renal lesions in children with a modified Bosniak class of 1 or 2 were most often benign, while class 3 or 4 lesions warranted surgical excision since more than 90% of masses harbored intermediate or malignant pathology.

### Malignant B-cell lymphoma in renal cyst wall [^113p6KVu]. Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Renal cysts are frequently found in adults older than 50 years of age. Bosniak type III and IV cysts are commonly associated with malignancy, but most Bosniak I and II lesions are benign, and the optimal management has not been clearly defined. Although computed tomography and ultrasound examinations have improved diagnostic accuracy, some masses will remain indeterminate and require more invasive evaluation. We report a patient with a Bosniak type II renal cyst associated with malignant B-cell lymphoma in the cyst wall diagnosed after laparoscopic renal exploration.

### Validation of the modified Bosniak classification system to risk stratify pediatric cystic renal masses: An international, multi-site study from the Pediatric Urologic Oncology Working Group of the Societies for Pediatric Urology [^113wqF5a]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2022). Low credibility.

Pediatric cystic renal lesions are challenging to manage, as little is known about their natural course. A modified Bosniak (mBosniak) classification system has been proposed for risk stratification in pediatric patients, taking ultrasound (US) and/or computed tomography (CT) characteristics into account. However, literature validating this system remains limited.

- **Objective**: To determine if the mBosniak classification system correlates with pathologic diagnoses. The hypothesis is that the mBosniak classification can stratify the risk of malignancy in children with renal cysts.

- **Study design**: Patients treated for cystic renal masses with available imaging and pathology between 2000 and 2019 from five institutions were identified. Clinical characteristics and pathology were obtained retrospectively. Characteristics from the most recent US, CT, and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were recorded. Reviewers assigned an mBosniak classification to each scan. mBosniak scores 1/2 were considered low-risk, and 3/4 were considered high-risk. These groups were compared with pathology (classified as benign, intermediate, or malignant). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), positive likelihood ratio (+LR), and negative likelihood ratio (-LR) were calculated to assess this categorization as a screening tool to guide surgical intervention. Agreement between imaging modalities was also explored.

- **Results**: Ninety-nine patients were identified. High-risk imaging findings were correlated with malignant or intermediate pathology with a sensitivity of 88.3%, [content continues].

### Bosniak classification for complex renal cysts reevaluated: A systematic review [^115vEa7c]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Low credibility.

We systematically evaluated the Bosniak classification system with malignancy rates for each Bosniak category and assessed the effectiveness related to surgical treatment and oncologic outcomes based on recurrence and/or metastasis.

- **Materials and methods**: In a systematic review following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement and the QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) criteria, 39 publications were selected for inclusion. The studies were categorized into surgical cohorts, where all cysts were treated surgically, and radiological cohorts, which involved cysts with surgical treatment or radiological follow-up.

- **Results**: A total of 3,036 complex renal cysts were categorized into Bosniak II, IIF, III, and IV. In surgical and radiological cohorts, pooled estimates showed a malignancy prevalence of 0.51 (95% CI: 0.44, 0.58) in Bosniak III and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.83, 0.92) in Bosniak IV cysts. Stable Bosniak IIF cysts demonstrated a malignancy rate of less than 1% during radiological follow-up. Bosniak IIF cysts reclassified to the Bosniak III/IV category during follow-up (12%) showed malignancy in 85%, comparable to Bosniak IV cysts. The estimated surgical number needed to treat (NNT) to avoid metastatic disease for Bosniak III and IV cysts was 140 and 40, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: The effectiveness of the Bosniak classification system for complex renal cysts was found to be high in categories II, IIF, and IV, but low in category III. Notably, 49% of Bosniak III cysts were overtreated due to benign outcomes.

### Is it safe and effective to treat complex renal cysts by the laparoscopic approach [^114vLSKT]. Journal of Endourology (2011). Low credibility.

Bosniak III and IV renal cysts have low mortality potential, and little is reported regarding the feasibility and safety of managing such tumors by laparoscopy and its comparison with open surgery. We report on the experience with 37 complex renal cysts managed in the era of laparoscopy.

A retrospective analysis of a prospective database from all patients with renal tumors who were operated on at our institution was evaluated after Institutional Review Board approval. The database comprises information for demographic, clinical, imaging, preoperative, intraoperative, histologic, and follow-up data. A comparison among all performed approaches was conducted for demographic, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, operative time, estimated blood loss, ischemia time, hospital stay, oncologic, and survival rate. The cysts removed by laparoscopic partial nephrectomy were compared with the solid tumors removed by the same approach during the same period.

The database included 407 patients with renal tumors operated on from 2000 to 2009 at our institution. In 36 patients of the total cohort, there were 37 complex renal cysts. No patients with preoperative Bosniak type I or II underwent surgery. Of the cysts, 60% were Bosniak IV, and 86% were confirmed as malignant; 40% were Bosniak III, and 44% were confirmed as malignant. Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy was performed in 67.5%. The tumor size and hospital stay were significantly different in the laparoscopic group. No cyst spillage occurred either by laparoscopy.
