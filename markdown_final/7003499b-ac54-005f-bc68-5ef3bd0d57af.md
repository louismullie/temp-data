## Question

Treatment of high LDL on max statin dose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage high LDL cholesterol when already on maximal statin therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and verifying that the patient is truly on a maximally tolerated statin. Then, I should verify the ASCVD risk category and the LDL-C goal or threshold that applies. Next, I will review first-line add-on therapy, followed by second-line options if needed. After that, I need to consider special populations and statin intolerance. Finally, I should outline monitoring, adherence strategies, and when to refer, while double-checking for any contraindications or drug interactions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and current therapy. I need to check that the patient is indeed on a high-intensity statin at a maximally tolerated dose, which for atorvastatin is 40–80 mg daily or for rosuvastatin is 20–40 mg daily, and I should confirm that adherence and lifestyle measures have been optimized before labeling this as refractory hypercholesterolemia [^d4ed0ce5] [^03f70667]. Wait, let me verify the intensity definitions and ensure I'm not overstating the dose ranges; yes, those are correct for high-intensity regimens and the expected LDL-C reduction is at least 50% on average, though individual responses vary [^d4ed0ce5] [^03f70667].

> Next, I should review ASCVD risk category and the applicable LDL-C target or threshold. For very high-risk patients, such as those with clinical ASCVD, recent ACS, or multiple high-risk features, the European guidance supports an LDL-C goal of less than 55 mg/dL and at least a 50% reduction from baseline, whereas U.S. guidance uses a threshold of 70 mg/dL to trigger add-on therapy after maximally tolerated statin, with some pathways recommending intensification even at 55–70 mg/dL in very high-risk patients [^44f73ad5] [^e756136f] [^68fd6549]. Hold on, I should verify the diabetes-specific targets; for adults with diabetes at higher risk, aiming for LDL-C less than 70 mg/dL and at least a 50% reduction is reasonable, aligning with ADA Standards [^0cd0b73d].

> I will now examine first-line add-on therapy. Ezetimibe 10 mg daily is the preferred first add-on because it provides an additional roughly 20–25% LDL-C reduction and has randomized outcome data showing event reduction when added to statin therapy, and it is generic and orally administered, which supports adherence and cost-effectiveness [^b9bbc0a2] [^385980b8]. Wait, let me verify the strength of recommendation; yes, multiple guidelines endorse ezetimibe as the initial nonstatin add-on after maximally tolerated statin when LDL-C remains above threshold or goal, including ACC/AHA and ESC/EAS positions [^e756136f] [^aca664ae].

> If LDL-C remains above threshold or goal after statin plus ezetimibe, I should consider second-line therapy. PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies (alirocumab or evolocumab) reduce LDL-C by about 50–60% and reduce cardiovascular events in high- and very high-risk patients, so they are reasonable next when LDL-C is still 70 mg/dL or higher on maximally tolerated statin plus ezetimibe, with shared decision-making given cost and injection burden [^e756136f] [^385980b8]. Hold on, I should verify the timing; in ACS, European guidance supports early addition of ezetimibe and then PCSK9 inhibitor if needed, and contemporary U.S. guidance allows concurrent ezetimibe initiation in ACS, reflecting urgency in this population [^fc50f553] [^46108940].

> But wait, what if PCSK9 inhibitors are not accessible or not preferred? I need to check alternatives. Bempedoic acid offers an additional roughly 18% LDL-C reduction and can be considered in very high-risk patients who cannot achieve goals or are statin-intolerant, and inclisiran, a siRNA targeting PCSK9 with twice-yearly dosing, is FDA-approved for additional LDL-C lowering but lacks definitive outcomes data and requires healthcare administration, so cost and logistics matter [^a341dbdd] [^23459a6e]. I should confirm that these are appropriate only after statin and ezetimibe have been optimized, which aligns with current pathways [^a341dbdd].

> I need to ensure I address statin intolerance. If the patient cannot tolerate any statin, ezetimibe monotherapy is reasonable, and if additional lowering is needed, PCSK9 inhibitors or bempedoic acid can be used as monotherapy or in combination, with shared decision-making about injections, cost, and expected absolute risk reduction [^055589d4] [^385980b8]. Hold on, I should verify that this approach is consistent with guidelines; yes, both ACC/AHA and ESC/EAS endorse nonstatin strategies in statin-intolerant patients, tailored to risk and preferences [^e756136f] [^385980b8].

> Next, I should review special populations. In older adults, I should confirm that high-intensity statins are appropriate; if not, moderate-intensity statins with ezetimibe can be effective, and the absolute benefit of further LDL-C lowering still accrues in high-risk elders, so I should individualize based on frailty, polypharmacy, and patient preference [^a02c1e1a] [^2e22668c]. For primary prevention with very high LDL-C, such as LDL-C 190 mg/dL or higher, maximally tolerated statin is indicated, and if goals are not met, ezetimibe and then PCSK9 inhibitors are reasonable given lifetime risk and genetic risk [^0817b1ad] [^e756136f].

> I should double-check monitoring and follow-up. Lipids should be rechecked 4–12 weeks after initiating or changing therapy and then every 3–12 months to assess adherence and response, and I should also monitor liver enzymes if clinically indicated and consider glucose or A1c in patients with diabetes risk factors after statin initiation [^c90b6c43] [^11f1e4a6]. Wait, let me verify the threshold for action; if LDL-C remains 70 mg/dL or higher in very high-risk patients on maximally tolerated statin, adding ezetimibe is reasonable, and if still 70 mg/dL or higher on statin plus ezetimibe, adding a PCSK9 inhibitor is reasonable, with the same 4–12 week reassessment cadence [^e756136f] [^c90b6c43].

> I will now examine adherence and lifestyle optimization, because nonadherence is a major cause of apparent treatment failure. I need to check for pill burden, cost, side effects, and use simplified regimens when possible; ezetimibe once daily and PCSK9 inhibitors every 2–4 weeks can help, and dietary patterns, weight management, and physical activity should be reinforced at each visit to maximize LDL-C lowering and event reduction [^fae8367a] [^c90b6c43]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines emphasize adherence monitoring; yes, both ACC/AHA and ESC/EAS stress periodic lipid checks to detect nonadherence and to guide intensification when appropriate [^c90b6c43] [^aca664ae].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have a plan for referral and escalation. If LDL-C remains above goal despite statin, ezetimibe, and a PCSK9 inhibitor, or if there is suspected familial hypercholesterolemia or complex polypharmacy, referral to a lipid specialist is appropriate, and in severe refractory cases, options such as LDL apheresis or investigational therapies may be considered, particularly for homozygous FH or exceptional high-risk phenotypes [^f811c805] [^11f1e4a6]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should confirm that this aligns with consensus statements; yes, the NLA and ESC/EAS endorse specialist referral and advanced therapies in refractory or genetically mediated dyslipidemias [^f811c805] [^22c4b8ae].

For patients with persistently high LDL-C despite maximal statin therapy, **add ezetimibe** [^b9bbc0a2] as first-line therapy to achieve an additional ~20–25% LDL-C reduction [^79997b9a] and improve cardiovascular outcomes [^385980b8]. If LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL (or ≥ 55 mg/dL in very high-risk patients) [^e756136f], **add a PCSK9 inhibitor** [^385980b8] for an additional ~50–60% reduction [^79997b9a] and further event reduction [^8002e8fe]. For statin-intolerant patients, use ezetimibe alone or with PCSK9 inhibitors [^055589d4] [^385980b8]. Bempedoic acid or inclisiran are alternatives if PCSK9 inhibitors are unavailable or contraindicated [^a341dbdd] [^23459a6e]. Monitor lipids 4–12 weeks after changes and titrate to risk-based LDL-C goals [^c90b6c43] [^44f73ad5].

---

## Stepwise pharmacologic management

### Step 1: confirm maximal statin therapy and adherence

Before adding therapy, **confirm adherence** and that the patient is on a high-intensity statin (atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg) [^d4ed0ce5] unless contraindicated [^03f70667]. If not tolerated, use the maximally tolerated dose [^9d0e7fc1].

---

### Step 2: add ezetimibe

- **First-line add-on**: Ezetimibe 10 mg daily is recommended as the first add-on to statins [^b9bbc0a2] [^385980b8].
- **LDL-C reduction**: Adds ~20–25% LDL-C reduction [^c9431065].
- **Outcome benefit**: Reduces cardiovascular events when added to statins [^385980b8] [^bf6de20a].

---

### Step 3: add PCSK9 inhibitor if LDL-C remains elevated

- **Indication**: Add a PCSK9 inhibitor (alirocumab or evolocumab) if LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) on maximally tolerated statin plus ezetimibe [^e756136f] [^385980b8].
- **LDL-C reduction**: Additional ~50–60% reduction [^79997b9a].
- **Outcome benefit**: Further reduces cardiovascular events [^8002e8fe] [^385980b8].
- **Very high-risk patients**: Consider at LDL-C ≥ 55 mg/dL (≥ 1.4 mmol/L) [^c90b6c43] [^68fd6549].

---

### Step 4: consider additional therapies if LDL-C remains elevated

If LDL-C remains above goal despite statin, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitor, consider **bempedoic acid** or **inclisiran** [^a341dbdd] [^23459a6e]. Bempedoic acid provides an additional ~18% LDL-C reduction and is reasonable when PCSK9 inhibitors are unavailable or contraindicated [^a341dbdd]. Inclisiran, a PCSK9-targeting siRNA, is administered every 6 months and is an alternative when PCSK9 inhibitors are unsuitable [^23459a6e].

---

## Management of statin-intolerant patients

For statin-intolerant patients, **ezetimibe monotherapy** is recommended as first-line nonstatin therapy [^055589d4] [^385980b8]. If additional LDL-C lowering is needed, add a PCSK9 inhibitor [^385980b8]. Bempedoic acid or inclisiran are alternatives for patients who cannot use PCSK9 inhibitors [^a341dbdd] [^23459a6e].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Check a **fasting lipid panel** 4–12 weeks after initiating or changing therapy, then every 3–12 months to assess adherence and response [^c90b6c43] [^a341dbdd]. Titrate therapy to achieve risk-based LDL-C goals: < 70 mg/dL for high risk and < 55 mg/dL for very high risk [^e756136f] [^44f73ad5].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Step** | **Therapy** | **LDL-C reduction** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Maximal statin therapy | 30–50% | First-line |
| 2 | Add ezetimibe | 20–25% | If LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL on statin |
| 3 | Add PCSK9 inhibitor | 50–60% | If LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL on statin + ezetimibe |
| 4 | Bempedoic acid or inclisiran | 18% or siRNA | If LDL-C remains elevated above goal |

---

For patients with high LDL-C despite maximal statins, **add ezetimibe first**, then a PCSK9 inhibitor if needed, and consider bempedoic acid or inclisiran for refractory cases or statin intolerance, with monitoring to risk-based LDL-C goals [^e756136f] [^385980b8] [^a341dbdd].

Add-on lipid-lowering therapy with statins — evidence context and panel consensus indicates that lowering atherogenic cholesterol to levels below 70 mg/dL is beneficial, yet major randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of add-on therapy enrolled patients with already low LDL-C before intensification (AIM-HIGH mean LDL-C level < 70 mg/dL; HPS2-THRIVE approximately 64 mg/dL; ACCORD ∼100 mg/dL). The NLA Expert Panel consensus view was that, until RCT data better define benefits and risks in patients whose atherogenic cholesterol remains elevated on the highest tolerated statin dose, consideration may be given to use of combination therapy with agents that further lower non–HDL-C and LDL-C to achieve goal levels, and the recommendation also extends to use of nonstatin drug therapies, alone or in combination, for patients with contraindications or intolerance to statins.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^1d011761]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first-line therapy for LDL-C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL-C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL-C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL-C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid-lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL-C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL-C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL-C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL-C, both now and in the future, is provided.

### Pharmacological strategies for lowering LDL cholesterol: statins and beyond [^91ef2942]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2011). Medium credibility.

A continuous, graded relationship exists between LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This finding has been confirmed at progressively lower levels of LDL-C by results from clinical trials of therapies, particularly high-potency statins, which provide increasingly greater reductions in LDL-C levels. On the basis of this clinical trial evidence, progressively lower LDL-C goals for increasing numbers of patients, stratified by absolute CVD risk, have been recommended in guidelines for cholesterol management and CVD prevention. Some notable exceptions have been made, however, such as patients with end-stage renal disease or heart failure. To achieve low LDL-C goals, statins are first-line pharmacological therapy and can be combined with other agents to provide additional reductions in LDL-C levels as well as improvements in other lipoprotein fractions. Investigational agents that reduce LDL-C levels by other mechanisms are under development and could provide additional therapeutic strategies to achieve optimal LDL-C levels. These agents could be particularly appropriate for patients with severely elevated LDL-C levels, such as those with genetic dyslipidemia, for whom maximal drug therapy is insufficient to reduce LDL-C concentrations to recommended levels.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^fae8367a]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

LDL-C pharmacological treatment in adults — statin-first approach with evidence-based add-ons. Patients at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) may benefit from pharmacotherapy, including those with very high baseline LDL-C levels suggestive of a genetic cause such as familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), individuals with multiple risk factors for ASCVD, or those already diagnosed with ASCVD. Statin therapy, which is the cornerstone of pharmacotherapy for LDL-C reduction, reduces ASCVD risk in most individuals, and based on meta-analysis of 27 statin RCTs, for every 1 mmol/L (∼39 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C there is a corresponding 22% reduction in ASCVD event risk. It should be noted that statin therapy does not seem to reduce ASCVD in adults receiving hemodialysis or those who have significant heart failure, and stopping statin therapy in these individuals is not advised if it is well tolerated. Given variability in individual response even at full therapeutic doses, routine monitoring for both efficacy and tolerability is essential to guide ongoing management. Based upon contemporary clinical trial evidence, LDL-C lowering therapy should start with statins, then if response is incomplete or a tolerated statin regimen cannot be found, nonstatin LDL-C lowering pharmacotherapy should be considered, with medicine selection based on factors including safety, tolerability, LDL-C lowering efficacy, RCT evidence supporting use, desirable LDL-C and expectations of treatment, patient preference, convenience and cost of therapy, and availability. Nonstatin pharmacotherapy also reduces ASCVD risk, with randomized trials showing risk reduction when ezetimibe is added to moderate intensity statin and when proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 monoclonal antibody inhibition (PCSK9i) is added to high-intensity statin therapy. Additional options include bempedoic acid, which has demonstrated ASCVD risk reduction in high-risk adults (especially those with diabetes mellitus) on low dose or no statin because of intolerance, and high dose icosapent ethyl, which has minimal impact on LDL-C but demonstrated ASCVD risk reduction in adults with established ASCVD or high-risk patients with diabetes with hypertriglyceridemia. While niacin is no longer recommended as a routine therapy for LDL-C lowering or ASCVD risk reduction due to lack of incremental benefit when added to statins in contemporary trials, it may have a limited role and may be considered in rare cases of multidrug intolerance or if cost or access constraints limit other options. Bile acid sequestrants can be used but have a high degree of limiting side effects and have been mostly abandoned because of their side effects and modest potency.

Combination drug therapy in dyslipidemia management — Therapy with a statin plus a second (or third) agent may be considered for patients who have not reached their treatment goals for atherogenic cholesterol levels, particularly in patients with very high or high risk, and the maximum tolerated statin dosage should generally be used before add-on therapy is considered. Among those treated with high-dose statin therapy, more than 40% did not reach their LDL-C target of < 70 mg/dL, demonstrating that statin therapy alone may be insufficient for some individuals to reach goal.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^79cf8b96]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Management of elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first‐line therapy for LDL‐C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL‐C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL‐C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL‐C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL‐C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL‐C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL‐C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL‐C, both now and in the future, is provided.

### Statins for all? [^e360cd1a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for cholesterol management proposed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommended statin therapy for most men in their 60s and most women in their 70s. If these guidelines are followed in the United States, most adults will eventually take statins. A companion article in this journal goes a step further by proposing statin initiation for mostly everyone about 10 years earlier. Treatment in ACC/AHA guidelines does not depend on cholesterol levels, for either statin initiation or treatment goals. Selection of patients for statin therapy depends instead on multifactorial risk assessment derived from prospective studies in subgroups of the US population. Because of expansion of statin therapy, the issue of the reliability of risk assessment has come to the fore. Some evidence suggests that the ACC/AHA risk algorithm overestimates risk in many persons; if so, this would lead to statin therapy beyond what was intended. Some investigators favor assessment of risk based on presence or absence of categorical risk factors or higher risk conditions. Others propose selection of individuals for statin therapy grounded in measurement of atherosclerosis burden. Finally, an alternate approach to cholesterol management is to establish cholesterol goals for secondary and primary prevention. Cholesterol levels, and not global risk assessment, here define the intensity of therapy. The use of cholesterol goals allows more flexibility in treatment by taking advantage of lifestyle therapies and various drugs and their doses to attain defined goals.

4.3 European perspectives

In patients after ACS, the guideline recommends starting high‐intensity statin or the maximum tolerated dose as early as possible, and regardless of initial LDL‐C values, to reach the goals for the very high‐risk group of ≥ 50% reduction from baseline and a goal of < 55 mg/dL (class I, level A). 16 Lipid levels should be evaluated 4 to 6 weeks after ACS to determine whether a reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and an LDL‐C goal < 55 mg/dL have been achieved. If the goal of < 55 mg/dL is not achieved with the maximum tolerated dose of statin, combination with ezetimibe is recommended (class I, level B). 8 If the goal < 55 mg/dL is still not achieved on a maximum tolerated dose of a statin and ezetimibe after 4 to 6 weeks, a combination with a PCSK9 inhibitor is recommended (class I, level A). 9, 15 For patients who present with an ACS and whose LDL‐C levels are not at goal, despite already taking a maximally tolerated statin dose and ezetimibe, the addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor early after the event (including prior to discharge) should be considered (class II, level C). 2, 17

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^9f2693bc]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Initiation of drug therapy — statin intensity and targets: Unless contraindicated, first-line drug therapy for treatment of elevated atherogenic cholesterol levels is a moderate- or high-intensity statin, and a moderate-intensity statin will generally lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 30% to < 50% and a high-intensity statin by ≥ 50%, although individual patient responses should be expected to vary considerably. Some clinicians prefer to start with a high-intensity statin and reduce the dosage if the patient experiences intolerance, while others prefer to start with a moderate-intensity statin and titrate upward if additional lowering of atherogenic cholesterol is desired; if drug therapy is used, the panel consensus view was that at least a 30% reduction in atherogenic cholesterol should be targeted. Some patients have contraindications for, or intolerance to, statin therapy, and for such patients, nonstatin drug therapy may be considered.

National Lipid Association Chart 4 — first-line and combination pharmacotherapy: First-line cholesterol-lowering drug therapy, unless contraindicated, is moderate- to high-intensity statin, and the statin dosage may be increased or the patient switched to a more efficacious agent, if goal levels of atherogenic cholesterol are not achieved. Nonstatin drug therapy (cholesterol absorption inhibitors, bile acid sequestrants, fibric acids, long-chain omega-3 fatty acid concentrates, and nicotinic acid) may be considered for patients with contraindications for, or intolerance to, statin therapy. Combination drug therapy with a statin plus a second (or third) agent that further lowers non–HDL-C and LDL-C may be considered for patients who have not attained their atherogenic cholesterol levels after the maximum tolerated statin dosage has been reached and for those who have contraindications or are intolerant to statin therapy. If drug therapy is used, at least a 30% reduction in atherogenic cholesterol should be targeted, and after atherogenic cholesterol–lowering targets are achieved with drug therapy, response to therapy should be monitored within 4–12 mo.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^55bb5505]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment "targets" vs "thresholds".

Cholesterol recommendations from major guideline organizations differ in several aspects, despite each committee being composed of lipid experts, and evaluating essentially the same evidence. A major difference is the LDL-C level at which treatment intensification is recommended. Some guideline organizations (ie, European Atherosclerosis Society/European Society of Cardiology) have opted for a treatment "target", which varies based on guideline organization, and some for a treatment "intensification threshold" (ie, Canadian Cardiovascular Society). The difference is subtle but important. A target level implies that maximal benefit is obtained once the target is attained and may lead to providers possibly back-titrating the dose or even deprescribing medication if the attained level is far below the target. However, most clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering agents were performed by selecting patients with LDL-C exceeding a threshold value, and did not aim for a specific target level: some on-treatment patients attained extremely low LDL-C levels and yet continued to show benefit with respect to ASCVD risk reduction. Advocates for thresholds suggest that these closely approximate the approach used in the clinical trials, and are thus consistent with "evidence-based medicine".

### PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe for the reduction of cardiovascular events: a clinical practice guideline with risk-stratified recommendations [^385980b8]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

In adults with low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels > 1.8mmol/L (> 70mg/dL) who are already taking the maximum dose of statins or are intolerant to statins, should another lipid-lowering drug be added, either a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor or ezetimibe, to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events? If so, which drug is preferred? Having decided to use one, should we add the other lipid-lowering drug?

Current Practice

Most guidelines emphasise LDL cholesterol targets in their recommendations for prescribing PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe in adults at high risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event. However, to achieve these goals in very high risk patients with statins alone is almost impossible, so physicians are increasingly considering other lipid-lowering drugs solely for achieving LDL cholesterol treatment goals rather than for achieving important absolute cardiovascular risk reduction. Most guidelines do not systematically assess the cardiovascular benefits of adding PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe for all risk groups across primary and secondary prevention, nor do they report, in accordance with explicit judgments of assumed patients' values and preferences, absolute benefits and harms and potential treatment burdens.

Recommendations

The guideline panel provided mostly weak recommendations, which means we rely on shared decision making when applying these recommendations. For adults already using statins, the panel suggests adding a second lipid-lowering drug in people at very high and high cardiovascular risk but recommends against adding it in people at low cardiovascular risk. For adults who are intolerant to statins, the panel recommends using a lipid-lowering drug in people at very high and high cardiovascular risk but against adding it in those at low cardiovascular risk. When choosing to add another lipid-lowering drug, the panel suggests ezetimibe in preference to PCSK9 inhibitors. The panel suggests further adding a PCSK9 inhibitor to ezetimibe for adults already taking statins at very high risk and those at very high and high risk who are intolerant to statins.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel identified four risk groups of patients (low, moderate, high, and very high cardiovascular risk) and primarily applied an individual patient perspective in moving from evidence to recommendations, though societal issues were a secondary consideration. The panel considered the balance of benefits and harms and burdens of starting a PCSK9 inhibitor and/or ezetimibe, making assumptions of adults' average values and preferences. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids accompany multi-layered recommendations, developed in an online authoring and publication platform (www.magicapp.org) that also allows re-use and adaptation.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (14 trials including 83660 participants) of benefits found that PCSK9 inhibitors or ezetimibe probably reduce myocardial infarctions and stroke in patients with very high and high cardiovascular risk, with no impact on mortality (moderate to high certainty evidence), but not in those with moderate and low cardiovascular risk. PCSK9 inhibitors may have similar effects to ezetimibe on reducing non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke (low certainty evidence). These relative benefits were consistent, but their absolute magnitude varied based on cardiovascular risk in individual patients (for example, for 1000 people treated with PCSK9 inhibitors in addition to statins over five years, benefits ranged from 2 fewer strokes in the lowest risk to 21 fewer in the highest risk). Two systematic reviews on harms found no important adverse events for these drugs (moderate to high certainty evidence). PCSK9 inhibitors require injections that sometimes result in injection site reactions (best estimate 15 more per 1000 in a 5 year timeframe), representing a burden and harm that may matter to patients. The MATCH-IT decision support tool allows you to interact with the evidence and your patients across the alternative options: https://magicevidence.org/match-it/220504dist-lipid-lowering-drugs/.

Understanding The Recommendations

The stratification into four cardiovascular risk groups means that, to use the recommendations, physicians need to identify their patient's risk first. We therefore suggest, specific to various geographical regions, using some reliable risk calculators that estimate patients' cardiovascular risk based on a mix of known risk factors. The largely weak recommendations concerning the addition of ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors reflect what the panel considered to be a close balance between small reductions in stroke and myocardial infarctions weighed against the burdens and limited harms. Because of the anticipated large variability of patients' values and preferences, well informed choices warrant shared decision making. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids linked to the recommendations can facilitate such shared decisions. The strong recommendations against adding another drug in people at low cardiovascular risk reflect what the panel considered to be a burden without important benefits. The strong recommendation for adding either ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors in people at high and very high cardiovascular risk reflect a clear benefit. The panel recognised the key uncertainty in the evidence concerning patient values and preferences, namely that what most people consider important reductions in cardiovascular risks, weighed against burdens and harms, remains unclear. Finally, availability and costs will influence decisions when healthcare systems, clinicians, or people consider adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors.

3 GOALS VS THRESHOLD FOR TREATMENT

3.1 General comments

For patients with ACS, the European guideline recommends a LDL‐C goal of < 55 mg/dL and a LDL‐C reduction by 50% (class I) to guide therapy, whereas the American guideline recommends a high‐intensity statin to achieve a 50% reduction in LDL‐C and a threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL for treatment intensification (Table 1). 1 The approach with goals aims to reduce risks by lowering LDL‐C to levels achieved in large clinical trials, whereas the approach with threshold aims to reduce risks by lowering further LDL‐C when the LDL‐C values are above criteria used in nonstatin trials. 1, 2 Threshold has been evaluated in many randomized clinical trials, with the baseline LDL‐C level predefined by the protocol inclusion criterion. Treatment goals have rarely been studied in randomized trials; therefore, the evidence is weaker and mostly based on postrandomization data (inference based on achieved LDL‐C levels by assigned treatment). The hazards of drawing medical decision from postrandomization data are still a matter of debate, although the data show consistent benefits of reducing LDL‐C below guideline recommendations. 13, 15

3.2 American perspectives

In secondary prevention of patients at very high‐risk for ASCVD, the initiation or continuation of high‐intensity statin is recommended to achieve an LDL‐C reduction of ≥ 50%. 1 If LDL‐C levels remain above the threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL despite maximally tolerated therapy, the guideline recommends adding a nonstatin agent. If the LDL‐C is already < 70 mg/dL, the continuation of the maximally tolerated therapy is recommended with monitoring of LDL‐C. The concept of threshold utilizes an adaptive strategy (ie, addition of nonstatin agent) only if the treatment effect observed with a standard therapy is not satisfactory (eg, LDL‐C levels on maximally tolerated statin still above the threshold). Therefore, once the LDL‐C is below the threshold of 70 mg/dL, the exact value of LDL‐C does not influence further modification of LDL‐lowering therapy (eg, having a value of 30 mg/dL is managed the same as a value of 68 mg/dL).

### Dyslipidemia: management using optimal lipid-lowering therapy [^3863e47a]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate current approaches and explore emerging research related to dyslipidemia management.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (2004-April 2012) was searched for randomized controlled trials using the terms dyslipidemia and lipid-lowering therapy or statin (> 1000 hits). Separate searches (MEDLINE, Google) identified meta-analyses (2010–2011), disease prevalence statistics, and current consensus guidelines (2004-July 2011). Additional references were identified from the publications reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language articles on large multicenter trials were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines for the reduction of cardiovascular risk recommend the attainment of specific low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) target values, based on an individual's 10-year risk of coronary heart disease or global risk. For most patients unable to achieve recommended lipid level goals with therapeutic lifestyle changes, statins are the first option for treatment. Results of large, well-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that statins are effective in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in diverse populations, including patients with diabetes and the elderly, and that intensive statin therapy provides more effective lipid goal attainment and significantly greater risk reduction in patients with coronary artery disease. Statin therapy is generally well tolerated but may increase the risk of myopathy. Statin use has been associated with increases in hepatic transaminases and an increased risk of diabetes, although the absolute risk of diabetes is low compared with the risk reduction benefit. Combination therapy including a statin may be appropriate for certain populations, but the risk reduction benefits of combination therapy remain unclear. Ezetimibe is an important treatment option for patients with hypercholesterolemia who do not tolerate intensive statin therapy. Although fibrates or niacin improves overall lipid profiles in patients with hypertriglyceridemia or dyslipidemia who are receiving statin therapy, their efficacy in reducing cardiovascular risk remains questionable and their use raises safety and tolerability concerns.

Conclusions

Intensifying lifestyle changes and statin dose should be utilized first in patients not achieving their LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals.

Very low LDL-C on high-intensity statins — in patients whose atherogenic cholesterol falls to very low levels (eg, LDL-C, < 40 mg/dL), at present, no evidence suggests harm, and therapy may be continued, particularly in those at very high ASCVD event risk, in the absence of signs or symptoms of intolerance; the limited amount of data available at these low levels is acknowledged.

### Effect of 2013 ACC / AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^e740b975]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

High levels of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) are associated with greater risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). 1 Approximately 85.6 million people in the United States have at least 1 type of cardiovascular disease (CVD). 2 An additional 45 million people in the United States have either a ≥ 7.5% 10‐year risk of a cardiovascular event (33 million) or a > 5% to 7.4% 10‐year risk of a cardiovascular event (12.8 million). 2 For patients at high risk for cardiovascular events or with ASCVD, statins are considered standard first‐line therapy to lower LDL‐C. The appropriate statin dose is important to effectively lower LDL‐C and therefore reduce the risk of ASCVD and cardiovascular events; however, not all patients are able to sufficiently lower their LDL‐C levels, even at the maximally tolerated statin dose. 1 Approximately 40% of patients are unable to adequately lower their LDL‐C levels despite high‐intensity statin therapy. 3 For these patients, treatment regimens may be modified to include a higher statin dose, a switch to a different statin, or combination therapy with other lipid‐lowering agents such as ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, niacin, or, when appropriate, an inhibitor of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9).

### Network meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the comparative efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies added to maximally tolerated statins for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^44f73ad5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is an important causal, modifiable risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Evidence from multiple prospective, randomized studies has substantiated that patients achieving the lowest LDL‐C levels have the lowest risk of future major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), without associated safety concerns/adverse events, even when LDL‐C is reduced to very low levels (< 40 mg/dL [< 1 mmol/L]). Managing LDL‐C in a risk‐stratified manner is particularly important in patients at high or very‐high risk of MACEs.

European guidelines now recommend even lower LDL‐C levels in groups at very‐high risk of ASCVD. The 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines and the more recent 2021 ESC guidelines recommend an LDL‐C goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L) and ≥ 50% LDL‐C reduction from baseline for very high‐risk patients, whereas US guidelines suggest high‐intensity or maximal statin therapy, with addition of ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor if LDL‐C remains above the threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L).

Intolerance to statin therapy — management steps include switching to a different high-intensity statin if indicated, switching to moderate- or low-intensity therapy, lowering the statin dose, or using nondaily dosing; in addition, the addition of nonstatin treatment plans to maximum tolerated statin therapy should be considered, as these are frequently associated with improved medication-taking behavior and achievement of LDL cholesterol goals.

Follow-up visits for atherogenic cholesterol management — if goal levels have not been achieved, the statin dosage may be increased or the patient might be switched to a more efficacious agent; after an adequate trial of the highest intensity statin therapy tolerated, the clinician may consider referral to a lipid specialist or addition of a second cholesterol-lowering agent. Once goals have been achieved, response to therapy should be monitored periodically, and within 4 to 12 months, to confirm maintenance of goal levels and adherence.

Key Points for Practice
- In primary prevention, moderate-dose statins are recommended when treatment is indicated.
- In secondary prevention, moderate-dose statins are recommended with intensification by increasing statin dose, adding ezetimibe, or adding a PCSK9 inhibitor in higher-risk patients.
- Because cholesterol values are stable over 10 years, new measurements are not needed for each risk assessment. Moderate-dose statins are the sole medication recommended for primary prevention. The group recommends against high-dose statins, citing lack of additional benefit and an increase in risks. The guideline does not suggest one statin over another. Because moderate dosing is recommended for all patients, the guideline does not recommend titrating dosage to a specific cholesterol level.

There is no evidence that ezetimibe, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, icosapent ethyl, fibrates, bempedoic acid, or niacin is beneficial in primary prevention. Secondary Prevention Patients with known coronary artery disease are at high enough risk to require treatment. Moderate-dose statins are the baseline in this group because no other treatment has a greater impact on mortality. The guideline recommends considering more intense treatment, especially in higher-risk patients. High-dose statin therapy reduced major cardiovascular events in the higher-risk patients studied. Adding ezetimibe to moderate- or high-dose statins reduces non-fatal cardiovascular events to a similar extent as high-dose statins. PCSK9 inhibitors also decrease nonfatal cardiovascular events in high-risk individuals on maximal tolerated therapy to a similar extent.

Because of high cost and uncertain long-term safety, PCSK9 inhibitors are recommended only after increasing statin dose and adding ezetimibe. Icosapent ethyl appears to reduce cardiovascular events and mortality with elevated triglyceride levels, although the single trial results are controversial because of high rates of cardiovascular events in the control group. Target cholesterol levels are not recommended to guide these decisions. For patients taking statins, monitoring response by measuring lipid levels is generally unnecessary because titration to a specific cholesterol level is of uncertain benefit. Cholesterol measurement for patients receiving secondary prevention should be limited to only those high-risk patients in whom icosapent ethyl or PCSK9 inhibitors are being considered. Editor's Note: Drs. Arnold and Buelt are members of the 2020 VA/DoD Dyslipidemia Guideline Working Group.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^5c960d1c]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients considered at high enough risk to warrant treating to a goal of LDL-C < 1.8 mmol/L and a greater than 50% decrease from baseline levels include, as in case 1 (figure 3), those who are asymptomatic but have a cardiometabolic disorder or high LDL-C due to inherited conditions such as FH. On combination therapy, case 1 should achieve both goals. Patients at very high risk, such as case 2, are recommended to reach an LDL-C < 1.4 mmol/L and a greater than 50% decrease from baseline levels. In this example, statin-associated muscle symptoms limited the dose of statin used, and while the patient should be maintained on the maximum tolerated dose, the LDL-C goal will likely only be achieved with combination therapy. A clinical judgement has to be made whether to (1) accept the slightly higher than optimal predicted LDL-C of 1.8 mmol/L on statin plus ezetimibe, while achieving a greater than 50% decrease from the notional baseline of 4.0 mmol/L (estimated from the measured LDL-C on statin monotherapy and the average LDL-C decrease on that statin dose), or (2) prescribe a PCSK9 inhibitor to achieve the more aggressive goal. The additional 0.9 mmol/L drop is predicted to deliver a further 20% reduction in riskand the cost–benefit decision will be dependent on the perceived ongoing ASCVD risk for this patient. Case 3 is an example of ASCVD that follows an aggressive course with a major coronary event occurring a relatively short time after the initial clinical presentation. Despite recommendations to use the maximum dose of a statin, the patient (as is common) was on a less than optimal dose of atorvastatin after angioplasty, which was only increased in steps to 80 mg after the second event. While the new guidelines set experiencing a second vascular event 'within 2 years' as the benchmark for defining this highest risk category, application of clinical judgement would again lead to the adoption of the most aggressive goal of LDL-C < 1.0 mmol/L.

Progressive atherosclerosis or recurrent events despite evidence-based therapy — NLA Expert Panel consensus emphasizes that "little evidence is available from RCTs" to guide such patients on high-intensity statins; "very aggressive therapy to lower atherogenic cholesterol levels to values well below goal thresholds may be considered", although "this approach is not clearly supported by clinical trial evidence". Additional evaluation "such as an elevated level of Lp(a) or other additional risk indicators may be warranted", and "nonlipid risk factors should be well controlled in such patients".

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: algorithm for management of adults with dyslipidemia-2025 update [^b811739f]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

LDL-C pharmacologic therapy for ASCVD prevention — When managing dyslipidemia with pharmacotherapy to lower atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, it is important to determine whether the approach involves primary or secondary prevention; the latter involves individuals with known clinical ASCVD. Moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy is recommended for individuals without known ASCVD who are considered to be at high risk. The addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy should be considered if the LDL-C target is not met, and there may be a need for treatment intensification using proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or other therapies based on individualized response if the LDL-C target is not met after initial treatment. AACE suggests targeting LDL-C levels below 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L), and there is limited evidence to support treatment goals of < 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) for most individuals.

National Lipid Association Chart 4 — statin intolerance, monitoring, and advanced measures: In patients with statin intolerance, strategies such as limiting the daily dosage and modified regimens may be considered, and if the patient still cannot tolerate the statin, a nonstatin drug alone or in combination with another cholesterol-lowering agent may be considered. Glucose or glycated hemoglobin should be checked before initiation of statin therapy and within 1 y afterward in those with diabetes risk factors. For selected patients with severe hypercholesterolemia, an alternative goal is to lower atherogenic cholesterol levels by at least 50%, and LDL apheresis may be considered for selected patients. Very aggressive therapy to lower atherogenic cholesterol levels to values well below goal thresholds may be considered for patients with progressive atherosclerosis or recurrent events, despite receiving high-intensity statin therapy, and other potential causes should also be investigated and nonlipid risk factors should be well controlled.

### Practical guidance for combination lipid-modifying therapy in high-and very-high-risk patients: a statement from a European Atherosclerosis Society task force [^c81ba940]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

This European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) Task Force provides practical guidance for combination therapy for elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and/or triglycerides (TG) in high-risk and very-high-risk patients.

Methods

Evidence-based review.

Results

Statin-ezetimibe combination treatment is the first choice for managing elevated LDL-C and should be given upfront in very-high-risk patients with high LDL-C unlikely to reach goal with a statin, and in primary prevention familial hypercholesterolaemia patients. A proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor may be added if LDL-C levels remain high. In high and very-high-risk patients with mild to moderately elevated TG levels (> 2.3 and < 5.6 mmol/L [> 200 and < 500 mg/dL) on a statin, treatment with either a fibrate or high-dose omega-3 fatty acids (icosapent ethyl) may be considered, weighing the benefit versus risks. Combination with fenofibrate may be considered for both macro- and microvascular benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Conclusions

This guidance aims to improve real-world use of guideline-recommended combination lipid modifying treatment.

### Recent national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel III update: adjustments and options [^dfe91f98]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

In the summer of 2004, an evidence-based update of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines for management of hypercholesterolemia was published. This detailed assessment of 5 major clinical trials, published since the ATP III report in 2001, was designed to provide guidance for physicians in decision making for patients at high risk and very high risk. We have tried to summarize this assessment by suggesting the following to clinicians: (1) Calculate global risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) to determine an overall strategy for cholesterol management. (2) Emphasize the benefits of diet, exercise, and weight control or therapeutic lifestyle change, especially in those with lifestyle risk factors. (3) Use 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) as first-line drugs to reduce risk of CAD and stroke in those at moderate to high risk. (4) If statins are prescribed, use moderate doses that reduce plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by ≥ 30% to 40%. (5) Strongly consider statin therapy in those with diabetes (with the exception of severe hypertriglyceridemia). (6) Consider LDL cholesterol-lowering drug therapy for lipids in older patients at risk. (7) Consider adding either a fibrate or nicotinic acid in high-risk patients with elevated plasma triglyceride values or low levels of plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol after statin therapy has achieved the LDL cholesterol goal. (8) Continue to treat those at low risk in similar fashion as before. This update is to inform current physician judgment in this area. Further clinical trial data that may modify or extend these recommendations are eagerly awaited.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^36dffbdb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The 2019 ESC/EAS guideline recommends using the Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation system, based on large, European cohort data sets, for estimating the 10‐year risk of fatal ASCVD events in adults > 40 years of age. The Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation tool has since been updated as Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation 2, which predicts 10‐year risk for both fatal and nonfatal ASCVD events. Also, CAC scoring is recommended in asymptomatic individuals classified as low or intermediate risk for whom statin therapy is being considered. A summary of the risk categories and recommendations for LDL‐C lowering in both the ACC/AHA/Multisociety and ESC/EAS guidelines is provided in Table 1.

Table 1
Classification of ASCVD Risk and LDL‐C Thresholds Defined by US and European Guidelines

Both the US and European guidelines recommend consideration of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy in addition to statins for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events; however, the guidelines differ in their respective definitions of patients at "very high risk". In the ACC/AHA/Multisociety guidelines, patients with a history of multiple major ASCVD events or those who have had one major ASCVD event plus multiple high‐risk conditions are considered very high risk. Recommendation for add‐on nonstatin therapy is therefore restricted to secondary prevention for patients at an LDL‐C threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL. The ESC/EAS guideline adopts a broader definition of very high risk, encompassing those with documented ASCVD, either clinical or unequivocal on imaging or various other higher‐risk conditions in the absence of ASCVD. A more aggressive approach to lipid lowering is advocated. Add‐on nonstatin therapies are recommended if a target reduction of ≥ 50% in LDL‐C values from baseline and a treatment goal of < 55 mg/dL are not achieved.

Evidence for the Underuse of Lipid‐Lowering Therapies in Clinical Practice

Despite guideline recommendations and compelling clinical trial evidence, recent population studies conducted in the United States and Europe have revealed that pharmacotherapy with a primary mechanism of LDL‐C lowering is underused. Gu and colleagues reported an increase in the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD within the United States between 2014 and 2019; however, overall use remained low, with most patients not at guideline‐recommended LDL‐C thresholds. The persistent underuse of statins in contemporary practice is highlighted by a recently published retrospective study of > 600 000 US patients with established ASCVD; during the study period of 2018 to 2019, half of the included patients were not on any statin.

Among patients who receive lipid‐lowering therapies, evidence suggests that management of lipid levels remains suboptimal, with many not receiving appropriate treatment intensity or available combination therapies needed to achieve LDL‐C goals. A retrospective cohort study of ≈1.5 million patients with a history of ≥ 1 major ASCVD event reported that > 50% of patients meeting the 2018 AHA/ACC/Multisociety guideline very high‐risk criteria had LDL‐C levels ≥ 70 mg/dL, despite receiving statins and/or ezetimibe. Similarly, data from the GOULD (Getting to an Improved Understanding of Low‐Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Dyslipidemia Management) registry showed that over a 2‐year period, two‐thirds of patients with ASCVD remained with LDL‐C levels > 70 mg/dL and only 17% received treatment intensification. Recently, an interim report of the European SANTORINI (Treatment of High and Very High Risk Dyslipidemic Patients for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Europe: A Multinational Observational Study) to assess the management of high‐risk and very high‐risk patients after publication of the ESC/EAS 2019 guidelines showed that combination therapy was used in just 27.3% of patients, of whom 17.1% received statin plus ezetimibe, and 4.1% received an anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibody plus oral lipid‐lowering therapy.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^4a4e6a58]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite guideline recommendations and evidence supporting the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, recent population studies indicate that their current use for preventing ASCVD events is insufficient. Most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL‐C thresholds. Long‐term adherence and persistence with statin therapy are poor, even following a catastrophic event, such as acute myocardial infarction. Consequently, in patients who fall within established benefit groups according to current guidelines, there is a significant need to increase the use of available lipid‐lowering therapies, especially statins, at the recommended intensity.

Current guidelines categorize recommendations for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL‐C by primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD events; however, as demonstrated by tools for imaging coronary atherosclerosis (including coronary artery calcium [CAC] scoring, coronary computed tomographic angiography, intravascular ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography), a continuum of ASCVD and associated risk exists. Patients are at increased risk as both plaque burden and high‐risk plaque features accumulate before their first ASCVD event. Intensive LDL‐C lowering is therefore critical to halt plaque progression, with the potential to induce regression and prevent outcomes, such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or the need for coronary revascularization. This concept is recognized in the 2019 ESC/EAS guideline, which considers unequivocal evidence of ASCVD on imaging as very high risk, the same category as those with documented ASCVD events.

Multiple challenges exist to effective LDL‐C management in patients with, and at risk for, ASCVD (Figure 1). This review presents a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from primary versus secondary prevention to a continuum of risk. Such an approach acknowledges the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment to prevent first cardiovascular events (ie, "high‐risk primary prevention").

### The 2013 ACC / AHA guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a new paradigm supported by more evidence [^5532cf70]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guideline was a major paradigm shift and heavily criticized by some experts. A better understanding of the methodology used to develop the guideline, the guideline recommendations, and the evidence supporting them addresses many of criticisms.

Methods and Results

An extensive body of evidence from randomized clinical trials supports the new risk-based approach. The emphasis is on the appropriate intensity of statin therapy in patients most likely to benefit. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines have taken a similar approach. Recent studies have found the 2013 guideline outperforms earlier cholesterol guidelines recommending low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) treatment thresholds and targets. The 2013 cholesterol guideline better identifies high-risk patients with a greater burden of atherosclerosis and avoids treating those at lower risk with little atherosclerosis; its application would prevent up to 450 000 more atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events over 10 years. The 2013 cholesterol guideline also recommends regularly monitoring LDL-C levels to assess adherence to lifestyle and drug therapy, and adjusting treatment based on response to therapy and adverse events. Non-statins shown to reduce ASCVD events when added to statin therapy, and that have an acceptable margin of safety in randomized, controlled clinical trials, are preferred. Ezetimibe has now been shown to meet this standard.

Conclusions

The concept of net benefit introduced in the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline identifies patients most likely to benefit from statin therapy to reduce ASCVD risk. Net benefit, incorporating the absolute ASCVD risk of a patient and the relative reduction in ASCVD risk based on the magnitude of LDL-C reduction from the addition of a non-statin, can be used when considering whether to add ezetimibe or another LDL-C lowering drug.

### Effect of 2013 ACC / AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^b5725569]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Preceding the release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) blood cholesterol guidelines (hereafter referred to as the "2013 guidelines" or simply "guidelines"), LDL‐C goals were < 4.1 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) for patients with a single CVD risk factor, < 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) for patients with 2 or more risk factors, and < 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) for patients with known CVD or risk factor equivalent. 4 The guidelines were revised in 2013 to recommend moving away from a "treating to goal" approach with respect to LDL‐C 1 and instead focus on treating with the most appropriate statin intensity based on the patient's risk. The 4 statin benefit groups described in the guidelines are (1) patients with clinical ASCVD, (2) adult patients with LDL‐C ≥ 4.9 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), (3) patients aged 40 to 75 years with diabetes mellitus and LDL‐C levels 1.8 to 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL), and (4) patients with an estimated 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% and LDL‐C levels 1.8 to less than 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL; primary prevention). 1 With some exceptions for age and risk, in general, high‐intensity statin therapy is recommended for those in statin benefit groups 1 and 2, whereas moderate‐ or high‐intensity statin therapy is recommended for most patients in statin benefit group 3. For statin benefit group 4, the recommendation is to estimate 10‐year ASCVD risk and engage in patient‐clinician discussions to determine an appropriate course of action. 5 In addition, the 2013 guidelines no longer recommend monitoring LDL‐C to assess achievement of a particular LDL‐C goal, but instead recommend monitoring LDL‐C to determine adherence and anticipated therapeutic response.

### Harder-to-treat patients: recognizing them and adapting treatment strategies [^0791e886]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Despite significant progress in pharmacologic treatment aimed at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, a number of patient groups that often prove difficult to treat remain. Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia may go undiagnosed and untreated or, despite treatment, have persistently elevated lipid levels that confer a high cardiovascular disease risk. Although the true prevalence is unknown, statin intolerance is a common clinical presentation that is difficult to assess and frequently leads to suboptimal lipid treatment. Additionally, some patients may not achieve the expected response to guideline-based therapy. For all 3 groups, a standardized approach offers the best chance for effective diagnosis and optimal treatment.

Recommendations for adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy are as follows: "In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), statin therapy reduces risk of ASCVD, and in the context of a risk discussion, if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended". Targets are specified: "In intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more", and "in patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more". Diabetes-specific guidance states: "In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, regardless of estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated", and "In adults with diabetes mellitus who have multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more". For very high LDL-C, "In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended".

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Secondary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevention — statin therapy recommendations: In patients who are 75 years of age or younger with clinical ASCVD, high-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 50% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels. In patients with clinical ASCVD in whom high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or who experience statin-associated side effects, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are judged to be very high risk and considered for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, maximally tolerated LDL-C lowering therapy should include maximally tolerated statin therapy and ezetimibe. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are judged to be very high risk and who are on maximally tolerated LDL-C– lowering therapy with LDL-C 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) or a non–HDL-C level of 100 mg/dL or higher (≥ 2.6 mmol/L), it is reasonable to add a PCSK9 inhibitor following a clinician– patient discussion about the net benefit, safety, and cost. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are on maximally tolerated statin therapy and are judged to be at very high risk and have an LDL-C level of 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L), it is reasonable to add ezetimibe therapy.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^b9bbc0a2]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

National Lipid Association statin combination therapy recommendations — For at-risk patients not at non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and/or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals while receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy, statin combination therapies should be considered in the indicated order. Ezetimibe 10 mg every day is recommended as a first-line statin combination therapy since it has been shown to reduce ASCVD events when added to a statin in a controlled clinical trial and because it has an important atherogenic cholesterol-lowering efficacy. Colesevelam 625 mg 3 tablets twice a day (or 3.75 g powder form every day or in divided doses) is recommended as a second-line statin combination therapy because the drug class has been shown to reduce ASCVD events when used alone, it is better tolerated than the other resins, and it has an important atherogenic cholesterol-lowering efficacy. Extended release niacin titrated to a maximum of 2000 mg, daily is recommended as a third-line statin combination therapy for atherogenic cholesterol lowering because it has demonstrated lower ASCVD events when used alone, and may have benefit when given with a statin to patients with LDL-C or non-HDL-C not at goal.

### A look to the future: new treatment guidelines and a perspective on statins [^a65966f8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

New National Cholesterol Education Program treatment guidelines incorporate a global measure of coronary heart disease (CHD) that alters risk categorization in primary prevention by identifying individuals with CHD risk equivalence on the basis of estimated absolute CHD risk. Increasing recognition of the association of on-treatment non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels with risk of CHD events is also reflected in the new guidelines by incorporation of secondary non-HDL cholesterol goals. The increased complexity of the guidelines and the likelihood of more individuals being assigned to higher risk groups with lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals is of some concern, because most patients receiving lipid-lowering therapy do not achieve current guideline LDL cholesterol goals. Increased potency of LDL cholesterol-lowering drugs would be of value in enabling more patients to achieve goals.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^3cde9467]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Chart 13 — residual risk management after statin and lifestyle therapy outlines that fibrates and prescription omega-3 fatty acids are first-line drug choices for patients with TG ≥ 500 mg/dL, and consideration may be given to using statin therapy as a first-line drug in patients with TG 500–999 without a history of pancreatitis (E Moderate). In patients with elevated TG (200 to 499 mg/dL) on maximum tolerated statin therapy who are at their LDL-C goal but not their non-HDL-C goal, the addition of therapies that primarily lower TG and VLDL-C (fibrates, high-dose omega-3 fatty acids) may be considered to help achieve atherogenic cholesterol goals, particularly when elevated TG coexists with low HDL-C (B Moderate). For patients not at goal levels for atherogenic cholesterol on maximally tolerated statin therapy, consideration should be given to adding non-statin lipid-altering therapy to ongoing statin therapy when ASCVD risk and benefit justify it (B Moderate). Recommended combination options, in order, are ezetimibe 10 mg every day; colesevelam 625 mg 3 tablets twice a day (or 3.75 g powder form every day or in divided doses); and extended release niacin titrated to a maximum of 2000 mg, daily (B Moderate). Until cardiovascular outcomes trials are completed with PCSK9 inhibitors, these drugs should be considered primarily in 1) patients with ASCVD who have LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (non-HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL) on maximally-tolerated statin (± ezetimibe) therapy; and 2) heterozygous FH patients without ASCVD who have LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL (non-HDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL) on maximally-tolerated statin (± ezetimibe) therapy (B Moderate). PCSK9 inhibitor use may be considered for selected high risk patients with ASCVD who have levels below those specified but above goals (i.e. LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL [non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL]) based on clinical judgment (C Low), and may also be considered in selected high or very high risk patients with statin intolerance who require substantial additional atherogenic cholesterol lowering despite other therapies (C Low).

Desirable LDL-C targets for adults: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) management should be individualized, and evidence supports an LDL-C target of < 100 mg/dL for healthy adults in the general population; individuals at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), including those with very high baseline LDL-C suggestive of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), multiple risk factors, or established ASCVD, may require lower LDL-C levels, and higher plaque burden or progression are situations where more intensive LDL-C lowering therapy should be considered.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^1f8e2207]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

National Lipid Association recommendations — patient-centered dyslipidemia management: An Expert Panel developed a consensus set of recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia in clinical medicine. Major conclusions include that an elevated level of cholesterol carried by circulating apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], termed atherogenic cholesterol) is a root cause of atherosclerosis contributing to most clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events, and that reducing elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol will lower ASCVD risk in proportion to the extent that atherogenic cholesterol is reduced. This benefit is presumed to result from atherogenic cholesterol lowering through multiple modalities, including lifestyle and drug therapies. The intensity of risk-reduction therapy should generally be adjusted to the patient's absolute risk for an ASCVD event, and because atherosclerosis is a process that often begins early in life and progresses for decades before resulting in a clinical ASCVD event, both intermediate-term and long-term or lifetime risk should be considered when assessing the potential benefits and hazards of risk-reduction therapies. For patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD.

4 PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPIES

4.1 General comments

For patients with ACS, the European guideline recommends the addition of nonstatin agents to high‐intensity maximal statin in a sequential approach (first ezetimibe, then PCSK9 inhibitors; both are class I recommendations) if the LDL‐C is above the target of > 55 mg/L (Table 1) at each step. Whereas, the American guideline recommends the addition of ezetimibe (class I) to high‐intensity statin (sequential approach not specified) if the addition of PCSK9 inhibitors is considered. This is not deemed mandatory, but instead considered reasonable if the LDL‐C is above the threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL (class IIa).

4.2 American perspectives

In secondary prevention of patients at very high‐risk, the use of ezetimibe is recommended if the LDL levels remain ≥ 70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated statin (class IIa). 8 However, the addition of ezetimibe is recommended to maximally tolerated statin therapy as the first step in lowering LDL‐C (class I) if a combination with PCSK9 inhibitor as a third agent is being considered. The strategy of ezetimibe before PCSK9 inhibitor is recommended because generic ezetimibe is available, simple to administer (oral, once daily), and has proven safety and tolerability with long‐term data. 8 Adherence to changes in lifestyle and effects of LDL‐C‐lowering medication should be assessed 4 to 12 weeks after statin initiation or dose adjustment and every 3 to 12 months thereafter for adherence and safety. 1 If tolerated maximal LDL‐C lowering therapy, the LDL‐C ≥ 70 mg/dL or non‐HDL‐C is ≥ 100 mg/dL, the addition of PCSK9 is considered reasonable (class IIa). 9, 15 The rationale regarding the recommendation for PCSK9 inhibitors in the US guidelines included cost considerations and a dedicated cost‐effectiveness analysis for the US population 1 in addition to the scientific evidence from the large clinical trials. 9, 10

### Pharmacologic options for aggressive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering: benefits versus risks [^c9431065]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Lessons from recent end point trials of lipid-lowering drugs indicate that patients at very high risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) benefit from treatment that lowers low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol plasma levels to ≤ 1.81 mmol/L (≤ 70 mg/dL), that patients with ≥ 2 risk factors benefit from treatment that lowers plasma LDL cholesterol to < 2.59 mmol/L (< 100 mg/dL), and that a significant reduction in CAD event rates is most often associated with a minimum plasma LDL cholesterol reduction of 30%. Recently, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III) recommendations were amended to incorporate these lessons. To reach these more aggressive goals and plasma LDL cholesterol reductions, more aggressive therapies will be required. The best way to implement more aggressive therapy is to start with one of the more potent statins, especially atorvastatin or rosuvastatin, or higher doses of other statins. This approach alone is likely to achieve treatment goals in 50% to 80% of patients. For patients needing additional plasma LDL cholesterol lowering, combination therapies will be required. Adding colesevelam, ezetimibe, or niacin to a stable statin regimen will generally provide an additional 10% to 15% lowering of plasma LDL cholesterol. These more potent statins, even when used in higher doses, appear to be safe. The incidence of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, as documented in long-term clinical trials, is < 0.1% and < 0.01%, respectively, except for simvastatin, which has a higher incidence of these problems. Less information is available about the safety of lowering levels of plasma LDL cholesterol to ≤ 1.81 mmol/L (≤ 70 mg/dL), but an analysis of a recent 2-year-long clinical trial, in which patients had on-treatment plasma LDL cholesterol levels as low as 0.67 mmol/L (26 mg/dL), reported no signals of untoward effects in patients with progressively lower levels.

### To what extent do high-intensity statins reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in each of the four statin benefit groups identified by the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines? A VOYAGER meta-analysis [^ee9cc814]. Atherosclerosis (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The 2013 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines identify four patient groups who benefit from moderate- or high-intensity statin treatment; those with: 1) atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD); 2) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 190 mg/dl; 3) diabetes; or 4) a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%. High-intensity statins, anticipated to reduce LDL-C by ≥ 50%, were identified as rosuvastatin 20–40 mg and atorvastatin 40–80 mg.

Methods and Results

Individual patient data (32,258) from the VOYAGER database of 37 studies were used to calculate least-squares mean (LSM) percentage change in LDL-C during 8496 patient exposures to rosuvastatin 20–40 mg, and atorvastatin 40–80 mg in the four patient benefit groups. LSM percentage reductions in LDL-C with rosuvastatin 20 and 40 mg were greater than with atorvastatin 40 mg, overall and in each statin benefit group, and with rosuvastatin 40 mg were greater than with atorvastatin 80 mg overall and in three of the four benefit groups (all p < 0.05). For example, in the ASCVD group, 40%, 59%, 57% and 71% of patients treated with atorvastatin 40 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, rosuvastatin 20 mg and rosuvastatin 40 mg, respectively, had a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C.

Conclusions

The choice and dose of statin have an impact both on the percentage LDL-C reduction and achievement of ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C, overall and within each of the four statin benefit groups outlined by the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines. This may be of importance for clinicians in their choice of treatment for individual patients.

### Managing dyslipidemia in the high-risk patient [^a45e0620]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Lipid-lowering agents have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) in all patients. However, these agents are more cost-effective in high-risk patients whose absolute risk of CAD is greater than that of low-risk patients. Furthermore, from preliminary data, it appears that there is greater risk reduction in those subjects achieving lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (ie, lower is better). The identification and aggressive treatment of these patients should therefore be a high priority for clinicians. Guidelines from medical organizations, such as the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III of the US National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), emphasize that patients with CAD, diabetes, or global risk of CAD > 20% over 10 years and LDL-C levels > 130 mg/dL should receive drug therapy with a goal of reducing LDL-C levels to < 100 mg/dL. The recent results of the United Kingdom's Heart Protection Study (HPS) strongly suggest that even those with CAD or who are at high risk and LDL-C levels > 100 mg/dL would benefit from drug therapy. Although optimal LDL-C levels have been set at < 100 mg/dL for high-risk patients, recent studies show only about 20% of such patients meet these goals. Thus, a large treatment gap remains that needs to be overcome if we are to continue to make significant inroads into preventing further morbidity and mortality in these high-risk subjects. Of therapeutic options available currently and for the near future, statins remain the most effective and well-tolerated form of lipid-lowering therapy. Other therapies include bile acid sequestrants, niacin, and plant stanols. However, none of these is, in general, sufficiently effective as an initial agent to achieve these more aggressive LDL-C goals in the high-risk patient. However, combination therapy with a statin and 1 of these other lipid-lowering agents is useful in patients who are unable to achieve lipid goals on monotherapy. A number of agents for reducing LDL-C levels currently in development may be available in the near future, including 2 new statins: pitavastatin and rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin, which is in the later stages of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process, has been shown to produce significantly greater reductions in LDL-C levels compared with atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin, and allows more patients to meet lipid goals. Ezetimibe, the first of an entirely new class of LDL-C-lowering agents that inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption, also appears to offer significant therapeutic value. It is anticipated that these new options will allow clinicians to optimize the management of dyslipidemia in high-risk patients, thereby further reducing the morbidity and mortality of CAD.

### Statins effective for LDL 190 mg per dL or higher,… [^1084c3f3]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Question In men with a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 190 mg per dL or higher, are statins effective as primary prevention. Bottom Line These results confirm that the use of statins for men with an LDL cholesterol level of at least 190 mg per dL, regardless of calculated risk, is associated with a clinically and statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular events and probably cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Synopsis The most recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association lipid guidelines recommend a statin for any patient with an LDL cholesterol level of 190 mg per dL or higher. However, the evidence supporting this recommendation is limited. The West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study, originally published in 1995, was one of the first studies of statins for primary prevention.

It enrolled men 45 to 64 years of age with an LDL level of at least 155 mg per dL and randomized them to receive pravastatin, 40 mg, or placebo. The mean age of the study population was 55 years, the mean body mass index was 26 kg per m. LDL level of less than 190 mg per dL. The researchers found a fairly consistent relative reduction in cardiac events with the use of statins, regardless of the initial LDL level. For the combined outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke, the relative risk reduction was 25% for those with an initial LDL level of at least 190 mg per dL. There were favorable trends regarding all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death with the use of statins. For the combined outcome of nonfatal myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease death, there was a significant benefit for those with an initial LDL level of less than 190 mg per dL, but not for those with an initial LDL level of 190 mg per dL or higher.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^543eb724]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

NLA recommendations — older adults with dyslipidemia: In primary prevention, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals of < 130 mg/dL and < 100 mg/dL are appropriate targets, and after a minimum 3–6 month trial on lifestyle modification moderate intensity statin therapy is recommended whenever feasible; the NLA high-risk thresholds are ≥ 15% 10-year risk for a hard ASCVD event using the Pooled Cohort Equations and ≥ 10% 10-year risk for a hard CHD event using the ATP III Framingham Risk Calculator, and in patients ≥ 65 years of age with uncertainty about drug therapy it is reasonable to recommend moderate intensity statin therapy when there is 1 or more major ASCVD risk factor or when risk exceeds 15% or 10% by the respective calculators; in situations requiring additional objective information, coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring may be considered and a score of zero in asymptomatic patients may suggest that non-pharmacologic approaches are reasonable; for those ≥ 80 years of age with atherogenic lipoproteins above goals, a provider-patient discussion should be undertaken and if statin intolerance is the primary issue, consideration should be given to alternate statin regimens including low intensity or non-daily moderate intensity statin therapy, low dose statin combination therapy with ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, or niacin, or non-statin monotherapy, and in general, we recommend that providers try to achieve at least a 30% LDL-C reduction.

### Cholesterol, not just cardiovascular risk, is important in deciding who should receive statin treatment [^83b8a894]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

Guidelines for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with statins, including the most recent, fail to make the best use of the evidence from clinical trials by concentrating on absolute CVD risk as a statin indication and not also considering that a major determinant of therapeutic benefit is the magnitude of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (or non-HDL) cholesterol reduction achieved. This decrease is proportional to the pretreatment concentration. We set out to apply this knowledge to the calculation of the number needed to treat to prevent one event (NNT) and to assess critically how current guidelines performed at different degrees of CVD risk across a range of LDL (or non-HDL) cholesterol concentrations.

Methods and Results

Number needed to treat to prevent one event revealed exclusion from the treatment of some people with higher cholesterol levels, who may benefit more than others needlessly exposed to statins with no realistic prospect of benefit. Furthermore, abandonment of cholesterol therapeutic goals disadvantaged people with higher levels.

Conclusion

These problems can be overcome by basing the decision to treat on the NNT calculated both from absolute CVD risk and also on the LDL (or non-HDL) cholesterol reduction achievable with statin treatment. This need not adds an additional layer of complexity for the clinician, because computer programmes already used to estimate CVD risk could be easily amended, thus permitting more effective deployment of statins in the population.

### The evolution of European guidelines: changing the management of cholesterol levels [^c6e1a4cf]. Atherosclerosis (2006). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in Europe and the US. This paper reviews the evolution of the Joint European Societies' guidelines with respect to their lipid recommendations. We stress the importance of lowering lipid levels to, or below, the currently recommended goals and argue that patients' global risk for CVD, rather than baseline lipid levels, should direct the intensity of lipid-lowering treatment. However, the emphasis on near-term (i.e., in the next 10 years) global risk estimation may under-emphasize the importance of considering lifetime cardiovascular risk in treatment decisions. Although various guidelines' thresholds for treatment initiation and recommended goals differ, they are similar in the theme of treating global risk. Most clinical trials have not identified a threshold of cholesterol level beyond which lowering cholesterol levels no longer provides cardiovascular benefit. An urgent call for action is needed to improve goal attainment in patients with or at risk for CVD. Improving access to risk-reducing treatments should be a priority.

### Upfront combination of statin and ezetimibe for patients with acute coronary syndrome: time for a new approach? [^e6f8ce11]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2018 guidelines for management of blood cholesterol recommend starting high‐intensity or maximally tolerated statin therapy in patients with ACS (Class I‐A recommendation) and adding ezetimibe if LDL‐C level is > 70 mg/dL despite maximally tolerated statin dose or when statins are not tolerated (Class IIa‐BR recommendation). Despite these recommendations, a significant proportion of these high‐risk patients do not achieve the recommended target LDL‐C levels in clinical practice. In the DA VINCI study, which included 5888 patients (2888 patients for secondary prevention) from 18 countries in Europe, high‐intensity statin monotherapy was used in 20% and 38% of very high‐risk primary and secondary prevention patients, respectively. Corresponding LDL‐C goal was achieved in only 22% and 45% for very high‐risk primary and secondary prevention patients, respectively. Importantly, combination of moderate to high‐intensity statins with ezetimibe was used only in 9%. In the GOULD (Getting to an Improved Understanding of Low‐Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Dyslipidemia Management) registry, which was a prospective study of 5006 patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the United States, 67% who were on maximally tolerated statins had elevated LDL‐C levels. Ezetimibe was added in only 6.8% of patients with LDL‐C ≥ 100 mg/dL and in 4.5% of patients with LDL‐C 70 to 99 mg/dL. The low uptake of ezetimibe in these real‐world studies might be a reflection of the evidence base during that time, because the IMPROVE‐IT trial tested ezetimibe in combination with high‐dose simvastatin (40 mg); thus, a knowledge gap had existed on the potential benefit of ezetimibe in combination with lower doses of statins.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Secondary ASCVD prevention — In patients who are 75 years of age or younger with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), high-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 50% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels; if high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or leads to statin-associated side effects, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are judged to be very high risk and considered for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, maximally tolerated LDL-C lowering therapy should include maximally tolerated statin therapy and ezetimibe. For very high risk patients on maximally tolerated LDL-C lowering therapy with LDL-C 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) or a non-HDL-C level of 100 mg/dL or higher (≥ 2.6 mmol/L), it is reasonable to add a PCSK9 inhibitor following a clinician-patient discussion about the net benefit, safety, and cost, and in those on maximally tolerated statin therapy who are judged to be at very high risk and have an LDL-C level of 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) it is reasonable to add ezetimibe therapy. At mid-2018 list prices, PCSK9 inhibitors have a low cost value (> $150,000 per QALY) compared to good cost value (< $50,000 per QALY). In patients older than 75 years of age with clinical ASCVD, it is reasonable to initiate moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy after evaluation of the potential for ASCVD risk reduction, adverse effects, and drug-drug interactions, as well as patient frailty and preferences, and in those older than 75 years who are tolerating high-intensity statin therapy, it is reasonable to continue high-intensity statin therapy after similar evaluation. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy and whose LDL-C level remains 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe therapy, and in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction attributable to ischemic heart disease who have a reasonable life expectancy (3 to 5 years) and are not already on a statin because of ASCVD, clinicians may consider initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy to reduce the occurrence of ASCVD events.

### Low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiovascular disease: risk reduction with statin therapy [^8075232e]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

A low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease; however, patients with low levels of HDL-C without raised low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are not currently eligible for lipid-lowering therapy. Many individuals with low levels of HDL-C have a combination of cardiovascular risk factors that include high LDL particle concentrations. Lowering LDL particle concentration and its surrogate measure, LDL-C, is an important approach to reducing cardiovascular risk. Statins are the most effective agents for lowering levels of LDL and can significantly increase levels of HDL-C. Extending statin therapy to patients with low levels of HDL-C but with LDL-C levels below target may have benefits for cardiovascular disease reduction in these patients.

1 Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of global mortality and disability, with elevated serum lipid levels, particularly low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) as one of its major risk factors. Lowering LDL‐C is crucial in mitigating the negative outcomes of CVD, especially in patients with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Statins are the first‐line therapy for patients with ASCVD for LDL‐C elevations, but many patients on low/moderate‐intensity statin regimens fail to attain target LDL‐C levels. Contemporary guidelines recommend high‐intensity statins for hyperlipidemia treatment, but they come with challenges such as drug interactions and dose‐dependent adverse events. An alternative approach is combining ezetimibe, a non‐statin drug, with tolerated stain dosage. Ezetimibe has shown efficacy in lowering LDL‐C alongside a more favorable safety profile. However, previous meta‐analyses have shown conflicting information regarding the superiority in efficacy or safety profile of high‐intensity statin monotherapy compared to low/moderate‐intensity statin combined with ezetimibe therapy. Given the recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we aimed to conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta‐analysis comparing the efficacy and safety of these two lipid‐lowering strategies in ASCVD patients.

AACE suggests treating individuals with ASCVD or increased risk of ASCVD to an LDL-C target of < 70 mg/dL, and notes that not all add-on agents have evidence for reducing ASCVD risk; use shared decision-making to discuss benefits and harms of the individual therapies.

Chronic coronary disease (CCD) lipid management — In patients with CCD, high-intensity statin therapy is recommended with the aim of achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels to reduce the risk of MACE; in patients in whom high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated, moderate-intensity statin therapy is recommended with the aim of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels. Adherence and response should be assessed by measurement of fasting lipids in 4 to 12 weeks after statin initiation or dose adjustment and then every 3 to 12 months thereafter. In very high-risk patients on maximally tolerated statin therapy with an LDL-C level ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L), ezetimibe can be beneficial to further reduce the risk of MACE; in those who have an LDL-C level ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L), or a non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level ≥ 100 mg/dL (≥ 2.6 mmol/L), on maximally tolerated statin and ezetimibe, a PCSK9 monoclonal antibody can be beneficial. In patients on maximally tolerated statin therapy with an LDL-C level < 100 mg/dL (< 2.6 mmol/L) and a persistent fasting triglyceride level 150 to 499 mg/dL (1.7–5.6 mmol/L) after addressing secondary causes, icosapent ethyl may be considered to further reduce the risk of MACE and cardiovascular death. In patients who are not at very high risk and on maximally tolerated statin therapy with an LDL-C level ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L), it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe; in patients with CCD on maximally tolerated statin therapy who have an LDL-C level ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L), and in whom ezetimibe and PCSK9 monoclonal antibody are deemed insufficient or not tolerated, it may be reasonable to add bempedoic acid or inclisiran (in place of PCSK9 monoclonal antibody) to further reduce LDL-C levels. In patients with CCD receiving statin therapy, adding niacin or fenofibrate or dietary supplements containing omega-3 fatty acids, are not beneficial in reducing cardiovascular risk. Cost value statements note that the use of generic formulations of maximally tolerated statin therapy is projected to be cost saving; addition of generic ezetimibe to maximally tolerated statin therapy is projected to be of high economic value at US prices; and the use of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies is projected to be of uncertain economic value at US prices.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease: evidence and guidance for management [^1e4e656e]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

In summary, statins firmly remain the first line treatment of choice for attainment of LDL-C goal in patients at high risk of CVD. After LDL-C goal attainment however, and if triglyceride levels remain elevated (≥ 1.7 mmol/L or 150 mg/dL, as defined by recent European guidelines) and HDL-C low (< 1.0 mmol/L or 40 mg/dL) despite intensive lifestyle intervention, then addition of a fibrate or niacin may be considered (Figure 6).

Proposed algorithm for the management of high-risk individuals with elevated triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol at LDL cholesterol goal. a LDL-C at goal as recommended by the most recent European guidelines (2007); < 2.5 mmol/L in high-risk patients, decreasing to < 2.0 mmol/L in very high risk patients. High-dose omega-3 fatty acids, fibrate, or niacin may be considered if the patient has very high TG (> 5.0 mmol/L) to prevent pancreatitis. b If the patient still has elevated TG (≥ 1.7 mmol/L, as recommended by the most recent European guidelines) and/or low HDL-C (< 1.0 mmol/L) despite intensive lifestyle intervention, and addressing compliance with pharmacotherapy and secondary causes of dyslipidaemia, additional lipid-modifying therapy may be considered. c Based on clinical outcome data and safety considerations for combination statin–fibrate therapy, fenofibrate is the preferred fibrate. This fibrate may have particular value in patients with T2DM and mild-to-moderate retinopathy. d Greater LDL-C lowering may be achieved by the addition of ezetimibe to a statin. Ezetimibe has a dose-sparing advantage in patients intolerant of higher dose statins, although outcome evidence to support its use is awaited.

### Management of LDL-cholesterol after an acute coronary syndrome: key comparisons of the American and European clinical guidelines to the attention of the healthcare providers [^aad50cb0]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for the management of blood cholesterol were updated in the past year in the United States and Europe, reflecting a more intensive approach to lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association task force on practice guideline released the 2018 guideline on the management of blood cholesterol on behalf of several American societies. Approximately 9 months later, the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society published their 2019 guideline for the management of dyslipidemias. Both guidelines have similarities for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes. Both emphasize risk assessment of patients as a main approach to guide therapy; those at higher risk of cardiovascular disease have a greater clinical benefit of LDL-C reduction by at least 50%. Both guidelines reinforce the indication to lower LDL-C as an important modifiable risk factor and consider the addition of nonstatin agents, such as ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, in addition to lifestyle counseling and high-intensity statin for further reduction of LDL-C levels. However, the guidelines have differences in the concepts of treatment thresholds (≥ 70mg/dL in the United States) vs treatment goals (< 55mg/dL in Europe), in the definition of very high-risk category and in the classes for recommendation for the use of PCSK9 inhibitors.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^3979554a]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Candidates for statin combination therapy — indications and decision factors: More intensive atherogenic cholesterol lowering may be indicated in high or very high risk patients with a less-than-desirable response to moderate or high intensity statin therapy; in patients who have recurrent ASCVD events or progressive atherosclerotic vascular symptoms in spite of high intensity statin therapy; in patients with FH, especially with ASCVD or poorly controlled non-lipid risk factors and less than optimal non-HDL-C or LDL-C levels; and in patients after acute coronary syndromes on at least moderate intensity statin therapy. Generally, if a patient in the categories above at high or very high ASCVD risk is not at non-HDL-C and LDL-C goals, strong consideration should be given to statin combination therapy (i.e., a statin with an additional lipid-altering agent). Clinical ASCVD event benefits of combination therapy were demonstrated in a recent clinical trial of ezetimibe added to statin therapy and with investigational PCSK9 inhibitors added to statin therapy. The clinician should determine whether statin combination therapies are indicated based on re-evaluation of the patient's risk factor status and quantitative risk scoring, reconsideration of the nature of the patient's history of vascular events, reconsideration of possible genetic dyslipidemias, examination of affordability and polypharmacy risks, and consideration of the patient's preferences.

Limitations and knowledge gaps — randomized controlled trials (RCTs) priorities: The guideline notes that it is based largely on RCT outcomes and that most RCT data are from statin therapy, with limited nonstatin add-on data; more data are needed and several questions remain for additional RCTs, including in secondary prevention whether a lower limit for LDL-C attainment exists beyond which incremental benefit is not worth risks or cost; what indications justify adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy; in patients with ASCVD who have statin-associated side effects whether PCSK9 inhibitors are an effective and safe substitute for high-intensity statins; in primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age with LDL-C < 90 mg/dL [< 2.3 mmol/L] with or without diabetes mellitus what incremental risk reduction high-intensity statins provide versus moderate-intensity statins; and in primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age with LDL-C < 190 mg/dL [< 4.9 mmol/L] with or without diabetes mellitus what the value is of ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors as an adjunct to maximally tolerated statin therapy.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease: evidence and guidance for management [^4e37c6a8]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The Panel believes there is insufficient evidence to permit definition of targets for triglycerides or HDL-C for these high-risk patients. Instead, the Panel proposes that treatment should be tailored to the individual to achieve desirable levels below (for triglycerides or non-HDL-C) or above (for HDL-C) the recommended cut-offs (Box 6). The Panel acknowledges that other expert bodies recommend apo B as a secondary therapeutic target in hypertriglyceridaemic patients. but considers that the precise clinical yield of this approach has yet to be demonstrated. The Panel also recognizes the limitations of the current evidence base for fibrates, niacin, and omega-3 fatty acids, including the lack of hard outcome data for statin–niacin and statin–omega-3 fatty acid combination therapies. Clearly, there is a need for well-defined trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these therapeutic combinations in high-risk patients at LDL-C goal with elevated triglycerides and/or low HDL-C.

Inclisiran clinical considerations describe a mechanism of action targeting PCSK9 production and LDL receptor upregulation to reduce LDL-C, an approved role as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for adults with primary hyperlipidemia (including HeFH or ASCVD) who require additional LDL-C lowering, a recommended dose of 284 mg administered by a health care professional as a single subcutaneous injection initially, again at 3 months, and then every 6 months thereafter, and twice a year dosing viewed as attractive for adherence but associated with large costs and additional administrative burdens with potential negative equity impacts; despite LDL-C reduction and FDA approval for lowering LDL-C, limited evidence prevented determining the balance of cardiovascular and mortality benefits versus harms, and longer-term cardiovascular outcomes trials are needed.

### Achievement of 2011 European low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals of either [^0f4b65de]. Atherosclerosis (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Guidelines published in 2011 by the European Atherosclerosis Society and the European Society of Cardiology recommend a goal of either low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 70 mg/dl (~1.8 mmol/l) or ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C for patients at very high cardiovascular risk. The aim of this study was to determine the percentage of high-risk patients from the VOYAGER individual patient data meta-analysis treated with rosuvastatin 10–40 mg, atorvastatin 10–80 mg or simvastatin 10–80 mg who achieved this goal.

Methods

We analysed 25,075 patient exposures from high-risk patients. Paired comparisons were made between each rosuvastatin dose and an equal or higher dose of either atorvastatin or simvastatin, with a series of meta-analyses that included only randomised studies that directly compared rosuvastatin and its comparator treatments.

Results

As statin dose increased, higher percentages of patients achieved LDL-C < 70 mg/dl or ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction. A greater percentage achieved this goal with rosuvastatin 10–40 mg (43.8–79.0%) than with equal or double milligram doses of atorvastatin (16.1–65.2%) or simvastatin (0–39.7%). Paired comparisons showed statistically significant differences for: rosuvastatin 10 mg vs. atorvastatin 10–20 mg and simvastatin 10–20 mg; rosuvastatin 20 mg vs. atorvastatin 20–40 mg and simvastatin 20–80 mg; and rosuvastatin 40 mg vs. atorvastatin 40–80 mg and simvastatin 40–80 mg (all p < 0.001).

Conclusion

These data from VOYAGER highlight the importance of an effective statin at an appropriate dose to achieve treatment goals for LDL-C in patients with very high cardiovascular risk.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^0cd0b73d]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease risk management in diabetes — risk‑based statin therapy and LDL targets state that the evidence is strong for people with diabetes aged 40–75 years, and current guidelines recommend that in people with diabetes who are at higher cardiovascular risk, especially those with one or more ASCVD risk factors, high-intensity statin therapy should be prescribed to reduce LDL cholesterol by ≥ 50% from baseline and to achieve the recommended LDL cholesterol goal of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L). Since baseline LDL cholesterol may be difficult to ascertain in practice, a focus on an LDL cholesterol goal of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L) rather than percent reduction in LDL cholesterol is recommended, and it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitor to maximum tolerated statin therapy if LDL goal is not achieved; while there are no randomized controlled trials specifically assessing cardiovascular outcomes of adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to statin therapy in primary prevention, a meta-analysis suggests that there is a cardiovascular benefit of adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to treatment for people at high risk.

- Moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated without calculating a 10-year ASCVD risk for patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus.
- Patients without diabetes at intermediate risk of ASCVD with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin for a goal of 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels. SECONDARY PREVENTION Based on high-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials, high-intensity statin therapy should be instituted with a goal of lowering LDL-C levels by 50% or more in patients with ASCVD up to 75 years of age. If treatment is not tolerated, then moderate-intensity therapy should be used with a goal of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels.

Based on nonrandomized trials, patients at very high risk should be considered for treatment with maximally tolerated statin doses and ezetimibe before considering the addition of a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor. SEVERE HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA Based on moderate-quality evidence from RCTs, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended for patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg per dL or greater. High-quality evidence from RCTs recommends that patients 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes who are at intermediate risk with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin. A 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels is recommended, and in high-risk patients a 50% or greater reduction is recommended.

Selected Moderate-Strength Recommendations Based on moderate-quality evidence from RCTs, the addition of nonstatin drug therapy should be considered at a threshold LDL-C level of at least 70 mg per dL on maximal statin therapy in patients with ASCVD at very high risk. Moderate-quality evidence from RCTs recommends that patients 40 to 75 years without diabetes who have a 10-year risk of 7. 5% to
19. 9% and risk-enhancing factors start or intensify statin therapy.

### Percent reduction in LDL cholesterol following high-intensity statin therapy: potential implications for guidelines and for the prescription of emerging lipid-lowering agents [^b6e6b17d]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

Current statin guidelines in Europe and Canada advocate achieving a fixed LDL target or the attainment of a ≥ 50% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), while current US guidelines advocate the use of statin therapies that reduce LDLC by < 50% (moderate intensity) or ≥ 50% (high intensity). Data are limited, however, linking the achievement of these % reduction thresholds to subsequent cardiovascular outcomes particularly for contemporary high-intensity regimens.

Methods and Results

In a randomized trial of 17 082 initially healthy men and women with median baseline LDLC of 108 mg/dL (interquartile range 94–119), we (i) used waterfall plots to assess the variability in LDLC response to rosuvastatin 20 mg daily and (ii) evaluated the impact of reaching ≥ 50% reductions in LDLC on risk of developing the first cardiovascular events. Among rosuvastatin allocated participants, 3640 individuals (46.3%) experienced an LDLC reduction ≥ 50%; 3365 individuals (42.8%) experienced an LDLC reduction > 0 but < 50%; and 851 individuals (10.8%) experienced no reduction or an increase in LDLC compared with baseline. These % LDLC reductions directly related to the risks of first cardiovascular events; at trial completion, incidence rates for the primary endpoint were 11.2, 9.2, 6.7, and 4.8 per 1000 person-years for those in the placebo, no LDLC reduction, LDLC reduction < 50%, and LDLC reduction ≥ 50% groups, respectively. Compared with placebo, the multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for sequentially greater on-treatment per cent reductions in LDLC were 0.91 (95%CI 0.54–1.53), 0.61 (95%CI 0.44–0.83), and 0.43 (95%CI 0.30–0.60) (P < 0.00001). Similar relationships between % reduction and clinical outcomes were observed in analyses focusing on non-HDLC or apolipoprotein B.

Conclusions

As documented for low- and moderate-intensity regimens, variability in % LDLC reduction following high-intensity statin therapy is wide yet the magnitude of this % reduction directly relates to efficacy. These data support guideline approaches that incorporate % reduction targets for statin therapy as well as absolute targets, and might provide a structure for the allocation of emerging adjunctive lipid-lowering therapies such as PCSK9 inhibitors should these agents prove broadly effective for cardiovascular event reduction.

Other major guideline documents — older patients: The 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline includes different treatment regimens for individuals > 75 years of age compared to younger persons, recommending moderate intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in those > 75 years versus high intensity in younger individuals, using the Pooled Cohort Risk Equations and provider–patient discussion for primary prevention without a specific intensity recommendation for those > 75 years. The International Atherosclerosis Society recommends for persons > 65 years the use of short-term (10-year) Framingham risk scoring (recalibrated for country) to estimate CHD risk and elevation of the estimated value by 1/3 to estimate total ASCVD risk, suggesting statins for moderately-high or high estimated risk while considering polypharmacy, drug–drug interactions, and cost. The European Atherosclerosis Society/European Society of Cardiology advocate secondary prevention in the same manner as in younger patients (class I, level of evidence B), starting at low dosage and titrating to the same targets (class I, level of evidence C), and recommend primary prevention for those with 1 or more additional risk factors aside from age (class IIb, level of evidence B). The Canadian Cardiovascular Society recommends statins without specific upper age cutoffs for secondary prevention and, for primary prevention, 10-year Framingham scoring for men ages 40–75 years and for women ages 50–75 years.

Figure 2A — adults with clinical ASCVD at very high risk on statin therapy for secondary prevention — outlines a stepwise algorithm: verify achievement of ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction and LDL-C < 55 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C < 85 mg/dL) on maximally-tolerated statin therapy; if achieved, make a decision for no additional medication and monitor adherence to lifestyle modifications, medications, and LDL-C response to therapy, with referral to the 2021 ACC ECDP on Management of Hypertriglyceridemia if persistent hypertriglyceridemia. If not achieved, evaluate and optimize lifestyle modifications, adherence to guideline-recommended statin therapy, risk factor control, and SASEs, and increase to high-intensity statin therapy if not already taking, then reassess the same LDL-C threshold. If still not at goal, consider the following initial nonstatin agents and add others as needed to achieve desired reduction of LDL-C: consider ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 mAb; may consider bempedoic acid or inclisiran. If goals remain unmet after nonstatin therapy, referral to lipid specialist and referral to RD/RDN are directed, with continued monitoring thereafter.

Impact of LLT type on the proportion of patients with ASCVD per LDL‐C range. For each treatment, the percentages of patients per LDL‐C range type are provided, based on their latest LDL‐C levels. The latest LLT is displayed, including from left to right: statin (monotherapy and combination therapy), statin alone (monotherapy), ezetimibe (monotherapy and combination therapy), a combination of ezetimibe and statins (possibly with other LLTs), and high‐intensity statin plus ezetimibe (possibly with other LLTs).

As per recommended guidelines for patients with ASCVD, LDL‐C goals should be reached with a maximum tolerated dose of statin and ezetimibe and intensified with a PCSK9 inhibitor when required. In Belgium, certain PCSK9 inhibitors are reimbursed for patients with established ASCVD and with LDL‐C ≥ 100 mg/dL despite being treated with a maximally tolerated dose of statin and ezetimibe. As described in Table 1, there was only a minority of patients with reported use of PCSK9 inhibitors in this cohort (49 patients only). Yet, the LDL‐C reduction observed with PCSK9 inhibitors was qualitatively similar to that achieved with high‐intensity statin plus ezetimibe, demonstrating the benefit of this therapy (not shown).

The guidelines have many similarities. Both emphasize cardiovascular (CVD) risk assessment of patients as a main approach to guide therapy (Figures 1, 2). Both guidelines reinforce the indication to lower LDL‐C as an important modifiable risk factor and consider the addition of nonstatin agents, such as ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, in addition to lifestyle counseling and high‐intensity statin for further reduction of LDL‐C levels. 1, 2 Both guidelines have the potential to change the current practice, as the use of moderate dose of statin is still frequent in a large number of patients after ACS and unlikely to be sufficient to reduce efficiently the cardiovascular risk. 11, 12

The Role of Other Atherogenic Lipids

Beyond LDL‐C, elevated levels of other atherogenic lipids contribute to an individual's ASCVD risk. For example, elevated lipoprotein(a) is a genetically determined, independent, causal risk factor for ASCVD. Current AHA/ACC/Multisociety guidelines recommend consideration of a lipoprotein(a) level ≥ 50 mg/dL (or ≥ 125 nmol/L) if measured as a risk‐enhancing factor to guide statin initiation in those at borderline or intermediate risk of ASCVD events. Guidance on how to incorporate lipoprotein(a) concentration into a person's 10‐year ASCVD risk has also recently been provided within a statement from the AHA. Statins do not lower lipoprotein(a) and, in some studies, have been associated with increased lipoprotein(a) levels among recipients. Consequently, clinicians should be aware that elevated lipoprotein(a) remains an important contributor to ASCVD risk in the setting of LDL‐C lowering with statins.

In addition to lipoprotein(a), triglyceride‐rich lipoproteins (which are reflected in measures such as non–high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol and remnant cholesterol) contribute to lipid‐related risk for ASCVD. Persistent elevations of triglycerides ≥ 175 mg/dL are recognized as a risk‐enhancing factor in the AHA/ACC/Multisociety guidelines.

### Intensive LDL cholesterol-lowering treatment beyond current recommendations for the prevention of major vascular events: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials including 327 037 participants [^cb9016f0]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Background

The benefits of LDL cholesterol-lowering treatment for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease are well established. However, the extent to which these effects differ by baseline LDL cholesterol, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, and the presence of comorbidities remains uncertain.

Methods

We did a systematic literature search (MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, from inception up to June 15, 2019) for randomised controlled trials of statins, ezetimibe, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors with at least 1000 patient-years of follow-up. Random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regressions were done to assess for risk of major vascular events (a composite of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal ischaemic stroke, or coronary revascularisation) per 1 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) reduction in LDL cholesterol concentrations.

Findings

327037 patients from 52 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Each 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol was associated with a 19% relative risk (RR) reduction for major vascular events (RR 0.81 [95% CI 0.78–0.84]; p < 0.0001). Similar reductions (per 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol) were found in trials with participants with LDL cholesterol 2.60 mmol/L or lower, 2.61–3.40 mmol/L, 3.41–4.10 mmol/L, and more than 4.1 mmol/L (p = 0.232 for interaction); and in a subgroup of patients who all had a baseline LDL cholesterol less than 2.07 mmol/L (80 mg/dL; RR 0.83 [95% CI 0.75–0.92]; p = 0.001). We found greater RR reductions in patients at lower 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk (change in RR per 10% lower 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 0.97 [95% CI 0.95–0.98]; p < 0.0001) and in patients at younger age across a mean age of 50–75 years (change in RR per 10 years younger age 0.92 [0.83–0.97]; p = 0.015). We found no difference in RR reduction for participants with or without diabetes (p = 0.878 for interaction) and chronic kidney disease (p = 0.934 for interaction).

Interpretation

For each 1 mmol/L LDL cholesterol lowering, the risk reduction of major vascular events is independent of the starting LDL cholesterol or the presence of diabetes or chronic kidney disease. Patients at lower cardiovascular risk and younger age might have a similar relative reduction in risk with LDL-cholesterol lowering therapies and future studies should investigate the potential benefits of earlier intervention.

Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

Statin effects on LDL-C and events in older adults are summarized from observational and trial data: LDL-C response to low to moderate-intensity statins was slightly greater (2–5% depending on statin and dose) among adults without ASCVD older than 75 years compared to those aged ≤ 50, and differences with high-intensity therapy were minimal. Over a median follow-up of 2.5 years, major vascular event reduction per 1 mmol/L LDL-C reduction showed adjusted HR 0.76, 0.73, 0.81, 0.81, and 0.77 across age groups with no differences by age. Among individuals without ASCVD up to age 75 in randomized statin trials, the average time to benefit was 2.5 years. Across 28 major statin trials (n = 186,854), only 8% were over age 75 and only 2% of primary prevention participants were over age 75.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Important research questions in cholesterol-lowering therapy — spanning secondary prevention, primary prevention, and statin/PCSK9/ezetimibe roles — are enumerated, including whether "a lower limit for LDL-C attainment" exists in secondary prevention and the "indications for adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy". The questions also ask if, in ASCVD with "statin-associated side effects", PCSK9 inhibitors are "an effective and safe substitute for high-intensity statins", and, in primary prevention for adults "45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 90 mg/dL [< 2.3 mmol/L])" with or without diabetes, what "incremental risk reduction" is imparted by "high-intensity statins as compared with moderate-intensity statins". Further items address adults "45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 190 mg/dL [< 4.9 mmol/L])" comparing "moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe" versus "moderate-intensity statins alone", the efficacy and safety of statins in "older patients (> 75 years of age)", the "efficacy and net benefit of PCSK9 inhibitors as add-on treatment to maximal statin therapy" in severe hypercholesterolemia, and the efficacy of "moderate-intensity and high-intensity statin therapy in patients with risk-enhancing factors (eg, chronic inflammatory disease, CKD, metabolic syndrome)".

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Randomized controlled trials — limitations and knowledge gaps: The guideline notes that greater reductions of LDL-C are accompanied by greater reductions in risk of ASCVD and that most RCT data are with statin therapy, with limited add-on nonstatin data, leading to several priority questions including thresholds and indications for PCSK9 inhibitor use and statin intensity comparisons in primary prevention. Key statements include: "They have established that greater reductions of LDL-C are accompanied by greater reductions in risk of ASCVD"; "Most of the data from RCTs have been obtained with statin therapy"; and questions such as "In secondary prevention, does a lower limit for LDL-C attainment exist, beyond which the incremental benefit attained is worth neither the risks nor the cost of additional therapy?", "In secondary prevention, what are the indications for adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy?", "In primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 90 mg/dL [< 2.3 mmol/L]) with or without diabetes mellitus, what is the incremental risk reduction imparted by high-intensity statins as compared with moderate-intensity statins?", "In primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 190 mg/dL [< 4.9 mmol/L]) with or without diabetes mellitus, what is the incremental risk reduction imparted by moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe as compared with moderate-intensity statins alone?", and "Is statin therapy efficacious and safe in older patients (> 75 years of age)?".

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^79997b9a]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

When deciding how aggressive an LDL-C-lowering regimen to prescribe, clinicians should be mindful that the absolute risk reduction is a function of both the absolute decrease in LDL-C concentration and the estimated ongoing ASCVD risk. The smaller the absolute drop in LDL-C, the less the relative risk reduction, and so the benefit gained from intervention depends on the risk status of the patient. At low LDL-C levels (eg, patients on statin) further lowering is recommended primarily for those in the highest risk categories. This approach is explored in figure 3 where we present typical patients with ASCVD at high/very high risk, who would fall into three of the categories of LDL-C goals set out in the guidelines.

Figure 3
Patient scenarios. Cases of patients at high ASCVD risk being ascribed to regimens of increasingly intensive LDL-C lowering. LDL-C and triglyceride levels are given in mmol/L (see online supplemental figure 1 for the mg/dL version). The predicted LDL-C reductions of 20% for ezetimibe and 60% for PCSK9i are based on average published responses. Case 1 is a patient with probable FH on the basis of his high LDL-C and sibling with diagnosed FH. Note, the additional 6% reduction on 40 mg rosuvastatin is based on the untreated LDL-C of 5.1 mmol/L; the 20% drop on ezetimibe is calculated from the LDL-C on 20 mg rosuvastatin. Case 2 is a woman with obesity, type 2 diabetes plus other risk factors (hypertension) with symptomatic ASCVD. Case 3 is a man with hypertension with repeat ASCVD events within a short time period (26 months). Note, when LDL-C levels are low — typically < 1.8 mmol/L — laboratory measurement can be problematic especially if lipoprotein(a) or plasma triglyceride levels are high. The guidelines recommend the use of non-HDL-C or apolipoprotein B as secondary measures to assess the need for further lipid-lowering action when LDL-C is low, as discussed in more detail.

1.6 Cholesterol/Lipid management

Aggressive lowering of LDL‐C remains a pillar of CCD management. The 2018 AHA/ACC/Multisociety Guideline emphasized an LDL‐C threshold of ≤ 70 mg/dL or lower in individuals at high risk of ASCVD and to consider the use of non‐statin LDL‐C lowering medications. The 2019 ESC/EAS Dyslipidemia Guideline advocated for an even lower threshold LDL‐C of < 55 mg/dL or an LDL‐C lowering > 50%, whichever is lower. In 2022, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) Expert Consensus Decision Pathway (ECDP) on the role of non‐statin therapies for LDL‐C lowering in the management of ASCVD risk discussed three Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐approved non‐statin therapies (bempedoic acid, evinacumab, inclisiran, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies), which were not previously recommended in the 2018 American Heart Association (AHA)/ACC cholesterol guideline.

The ECDP also recommends that for patients at very high risk of ASCVD, or those with ASCVD confirmed to have familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), adding nonstatin therapies if their LDL‐C levels are 55 mg/dL or higher, on a background of high‐intensity statin treatments is recommended. For those with ASCVD who are not considered at very high risk or who have LDL‐C levels over 190 mg/dL without confirmed FH, a higher threshold — over 70 mg/dL for LDL — triggers the addition of nonstatin therapies alongside the maximum tolerated statin treatments. Ezetimibe with or without PCSK9 inhibitor monoclonal antibodies is the recommended first choice for a nonstatin agent if the desired LDL‐C reduction is < 25%; otherwise a monoclonal antibody PCSK9 inhibitor may be preferred.

### Network meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the comparative efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies added to maximally tolerated statins for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^746d28ef]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Although treatment with statins is the predominant treatment for elevated LDL‐C, statin therapy does not allow some patients to achieve LDL‐C values of < 55 mg/dL, some patients may not tolerate statins at higher intensities, and there are a minority of others who are reportedly intolerant entirely, although recent data have highlighted an important role for the nocebo effect in patients with perceived adverse effects following statin therapy. In some patients, even high‐intensity statins alone may not be enough. Where required, statins can be supplemented by nonstatin agents, such as ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 inhibitors, to further optimize LDL‐C reduction. Recent real‐world European data suggest that LDL‐C goals are rarely met among very high‐risk patients; only 18% (≈1 of 6) of very high‐risk patients achieved the 2019 European guideline LDL‐C goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L), whereas 39% met the 2016 goal of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L). A prospective observational study in the United States looking at treatment patterns over 2 years in patients with ASCVD identified that at 2 years of follow‐up 31.7% of patients overall had LDL‐C levels < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L). The increased use of nonstatin agents in combination with statins may help higher‐risk patients meet the LDL‐C levels recommended by current guidelines.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) not at very high risk on statin therapy for secondary prevention — treatment targets and next steps: The writing committee considered a desirable response to therapy as having achieved ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL). Meta-analysis in this patient population has shown a 22% proportional risk reduction for major vascular events for each 38-mg/dL (1-mmol/L) reduction in LDL-C, and this is true even if baseline LDL is < 77 mg/dL (2 mmol/L). After achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline, further reductions in LDL-C should be discussed with the patient if LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL. If patients who are not at very high risk have a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and achieve LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue statin therapy and continue to monitor adherence to medications and lifestyle modifications and ongoing LDL-C response to therapy. If a patient has a less-than-anticipated response (< 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL or non–HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL), routine clinical assessment and interventions are warranted; if LDL-C lowering remains inadequate, the patient and clinician should enter a discussion focused on shared decision-making regarding the addition of a nonstatin medication to the current regimen, and if no additional medication is chosen, it is reasonable to continue current therapy with ongoing monitoring. Although there is a gap in RCT evidence in this group, the writing committee supports consideration of adding ezetimibe 10 mg daily as the initial nonstatin agent, given the benefits on ASCVD outcomes and demonstrated safety of ezetimibe in patients with ACS treated with ezetimibe plus simvastatin versus simvastatin monotherapy.

### Key recommendations on managing dyslipidemia for… [^e21c004d]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Secondary Prevention For secondary prevention, we recommend moderate-dose statins as the mainstay of treatment. This is consistent with trial evidence, and evidence is insufficient to show improved cardiovascular and all-cause mortality with higher-intensity treatment over moderate-dose statins. 11 Moderate-dose statins have fewer adverse effects than high-dose statins; therefore, we strongly recommend them as the first step in therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk. 1, 6 The ACC/AHA recommends intensive therapy in secondary prevention unless medications cannot be tolerated.
2. We recommend offering more intensive therapy to patients who wish to further reduce their risk. 1 Switching to high-dose statins and adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to statins reduces nonfatal cardiovascular events more than moderate-dose statins alone, each to a similar extent.

11 All were studied primarily in higher-risk populations, such as those with acute coronary syndrome, recurrent cardiac events, or tobacco use. Because of the uncertain long-term effects and high cost of PCSK9 inhibitors, we recommend increasing the statin dose and adding ezetimibe before considering the use of PCSK9 inhibitors.

1. Icosapent ethyl reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a single randomized trial among secondary prevention patients with elevated triglyceride levels. 2 The high rates of events in the control group and lack of corroborating studies limit our confidence in recommending this medication. Lipid Testing Although the ACC/AHA recommends treating to LDL-C targets, this paradigm has not been prospectively studied. 1, 2 All primary and secondary prevention trials compared medication doses, most often a medication compared with placebo.

Although post-hoc meta-analyses show that higher-intensity medications correlate with lower LDL-C levels and lower event rates, these secondary analyses do not add any specificity to existing trial results. 12 We recommend treatment based on medication intensity to match the evidence, which also simplifies monitoring. After starting medication based on treatment intensity, further measurement of cholesterol is unnecessary. 13 There is no need to repeatedly measure cholesterol more than once a decade for risk calculations. Using previous cholesterol values to calculate risk every two to five years offers the opportunity to decrease unnecessary testing. When cholesterol levels are measured, nonfasting samples have equivalent accuracy and should be used routinely. Indications for fasting samples are limited, such as verifying hypertriglyceridemia if considering icosapent ethyl.

Special cases for statin combination and other combination therapies — among patients who require multiple LDL-C–lowering therapies (e.g., intolerant to statins or familial hypercholesterolemia) combining statin and therapies with different mechanisms of action and in the order above is recommended, with careful consideration of cost and polypharmacy risks. In atherogenic dyslipidemia with elevated triglycerides (TG) and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) plus low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), options include therapies that mainly lower TG and VLDL-C such as fibrates and omega-3 fatty acids; prescription omega-3 fatty acids are currently only indicated for patients with TG ≥ 500 mg/dL. Colesevelam may worsen TG, especially in those with levels ≥ 200 mg/dL at baseline, and niacin may be used in patients with stable type 2 diabetes for lipid management with monitoring of glucose control.

Importance

Current guidelines for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease focus on high-intensity statins and targeting or using a threshold low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level of less than 70 mg/dL for the highest-risk patients. Whether further reduction of LDL-C beyond these boundaries would be beneficial is unknown.

Objective

To compare outcomes of evolocumab vs placebo in patients with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and a baseline LDL-C of less than 70 mg/dL and in those receiving background treatment with a maximal-potency statin.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This secondary ad hoc analysis of the Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk (FOURIER) trial compared randomized treatments in 2 subgroups of patients with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease currently receiving statin. Patients were classified by a baseline LDL-C of less than 70 or at least 70 mg/dL and by statin intensity (maximal: atorvastatin calcium, 80 mg/d, or rosuvastatin, 40 mg/d; submaximal: all other dosages). Patients with baseline LDL of less than 70 mg/dL either had a final screening LDL-C of at least 70 mg/dL or a final screening non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of at least 100 mg/dL. Data were retrieved from 2013 to 2016 and analyzed in 2017 based on intention to treat.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization. The secondary efficacy endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Safety outcomes included adverse events and events of interest identified in the FOURIER trial. Interaction testing was used to assess the consistency of results in patients who did vs did not satisfy the above criteria.

Results

A total of 27 564 patients (75.4% men and 24.6% women; mean [SD] age, 62.5 [9.0] years) were included in the analysis. Of 2034 patients (7.4%) who had a baseline LDL-C of less than 70 mg/dL, evolocumab reduced the risk for the primary endpoint (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.60–1.07) to a similar degree as in the 25 529 patients who had baseline LDL-C of at least 70 mg/dL (HR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79–0.92; P = 0.65 for interaction; 1 patient was missing baseline LDL-C data). Of 7533 patients (27.3%) receiving maximal-potency statins, evolocumab significantly reduced the primary endpoint (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75–0.98) to a similar degree as in the 20 031 patients not receiving a maximal-potency statin (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78–0.93; P = 0.88 for interaction). The key secondary endpoint was reduced to a similar degree in both analyses. No major safety concerns were identified.

Conclusions and Relevance

Evolocumab was equally effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease regardless of whether the baseline LDL-C was less than 70 or at least 70 mg/dL and whether the background statin was of maximal or submaximal potency.

Acute coronary syndromes lipid-lowering therapy — High-intensity statin therapy is recommended for all patients with ACS, with the option to initiate concurrent ezetimibe. A nonstatin lipid-lowering agent is recommended for patients already on maximally tolerated statin who have a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of ≥ 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L). It is reasonable in this high-risk population to further intensify lipid-lowering therapy if the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level is 55 to < 70 mg/dL (1.4 to < 1.8 mmol/L) and the patient is already on a maximally tolerated statin.

2018 AHA/ACC/Multisociety update and 2022 pathway — The 2018 guideline incorporated RCT evidence that nonstatin therapies including ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies (alirocumab and evolocumab) significantly lowered LDL-C and non-HDL-C and ASCVD events when added to statins. It continued to recommend measurement of lipids as a Class IA recommendation 4–12 weeks after LDL-C–lowering medication or dose adjustment and every 3–12 months thereafter to monitor adherence. It introduced an LDL-C value of ≥ 70 mg/dL and a non-HDL-C value of ≥ 100 mg/dL in patients with ASCVD as a threshold for intensification of lipid treatment with initiation of nonstatin therapy if needed, necessitating LDL-C measurement to determine whether LDL-C remains above 70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated statin. Further, the 2022 Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on nonstatin therapies made a recommendation to consider additional lipid-lowering agents for an LDL-C threshold of ≥ 55 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 85 mg/dL) in ASCVD patients at very high risk (about 50% of ASCVD patients).
