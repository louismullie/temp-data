## Question

How do I cancel this

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to cancel a healthcare appointment and what the best steps are to do it effectively and with minimal harm to care access and clinic operations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the appointment details and the clinic's cancellation policy. Then, I should verify the preferred cancellation channels and whether they differ by clinic. Next, I will consider timing to avoid "short-notice" penalties and to maximize slot reuse. After that, I need to communicate clearly and document the cancellation. Finally, I should plan for rescheduling and follow-up, and I will tailor advice for special populations or constraints like rurality, transportation, or language barriers.

> Let me first confirm the basics: I need to check the appointment date, time, location, and provider, and I should verify the clinic's cancellation policy, including any minimum notice period and whether there are fees for late cancellation or no-show, because policies vary and short-notice cancellations can still impact clinic flow even if they are not counted as no-shows [^113V6Moo] [^114qN6mj].

> Next, I should review the clinic's preferred cancellation channels. Most practices accept phone calls to the main number, many offer patient portal cancellation, some allow email, and a few still require in-person notification, so I need to match the method to what the clinic actually supports to avoid miscommunication or delays in processing [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify timing before I act: canceling as early as possible — ideally at least 24–48 hours in advance — reduces the chance of being labeled a short-notice cancellation and gives the clinic time to fill the slot, which helps other patients and can reduce system-level delays. If I must cancel within 24 hours, I should still notify promptly and ask about same-day rescheduling options [^113V6Moo] [^111uf6N3].

> I will now examine how to communicate the cancellation: I need to provide my name, date of birth, and the original appointment details; state the reason concisely (for example, conflict, illness, transportation issue); and request confirmation that the cancellation has been processed and whether any fees apply. If I use a portal, I should screenshot or save the confirmation, and if I call, I should ask for the staff member's name and a reference number [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify whether I should reschedule now or later. Many clinics prefer to reschedule during the same contact to preserve continuity and minimize rebooking delays, so I should ask for the next available slot that fits my schedule, and if I am unsure about timing, I should request to be placed on a cancellation list or ask for a follow-up call within a defined window [^notfound].

> But wait, what if I face barriers like unreliable transportation or long travel distances? In that case, I should explicitly ask about telehealth options or local alternatives, because telehealth can reduce no-shows and cancellations and is often acceptable for follow-ups or stable chronic conditions, and for rural patients, tele-consults with urban specialists are frequently used to mitigate travel burdens [^116kgSPC] [^113nMEoJ] [^112EHfET].

> I need to ensure I address language and communication needs. If English is not my primary language, I should request interpreter services or bilingual staff for the call or portal interaction, and I should confirm that my message has been understood and recorded correctly to prevent errors that could lead to missed documentation or billing issues [^116xRq8g] [^111wkuTG].

> Hold on, I should verify whether I am in a high-risk group for frequent short-notice cancellations. Patients with multiple comorbidities, anxiety or depression, younger age, or those using certain direct-scheduling portals may have higher cancellation rates, so I should proactively ask for reminder systems or flexible scheduling to reduce future short-notice cancellations and their impact on care [^113uFVU5] [^113isdhR] [^113V6Moo].

> Let me consider the downstream consequences so I can counsel myself accurately. Cancellations, especially when frequent or late, can delay needed care and may be associated with worse downstream utilization patterns, so I should confirm a clear plan to return to care and, if appropriate, ask the clinic to flag me for outreach if I do not rebook within a specified interval [^1148uBE3] [^116xRq8g].

> I should double-check whether the clinic uses behavioral nudges or reminder systems that could help me keep future appointments. Reminders by text or phone reduce no-shows and can increase timely cancellations, and some systems also specify social norms or costs, which further improve adherence, so I should opt into these if offered [^1145vFQK] [^117XFv9T] [^115WJTsh].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation is complete: I should save the cancellation confirmation, note the date, time, and method of cancellation, and keep any rescheduling details. If I do not receive a confirmation within 24 hours, I should follow up to ensure the slot was properly released and that I will not be charged a no-show fee [^notfound].

To cancel a medical appointment, **call the clinic as soon as possible** [^114GCJFo] and provide your name, date of birth, and appointment details. If you cannot reach them by phone, use the patient portal or send an email, and request written confirmation. Canceling early allows the clinic to offer your slot to another patient and may help you avoid no-show fees [^notfound]. If you must cancel late, still notify the clinic to minimize disruption and facilitate rescheduling [^notfound].

---

## Recommended methods for cancellation

### Phone call

- **Preferred method**: Call the clinic directly and speak with reception or scheduling staff [^notfound].
- **Information needed**: Provide your name, date of birth, and appointment details (date, time, provider).
- **Confirmation**: Ask for verbal confirmation and request a confirmation email or text if available.

---

### Patient portal or email

If phone access is limited, **use the clinic's patient portal** or send an email to the designated scheduling address. Include your name, date of birth, appointment details, and a brief reason for cancellation, and request written confirmation of the cancellation.

---

## Timing considerations

- **Early cancellation**: Cancel as soon as you know you cannot attend, ideally at least 24–48 hours in advance [^111uf6N3].
- **Late cancellation**: If you must cancel within 24 hours, still notify the clinic to minimize disruption and allow rescheduling [^113V6Moo].
- **Same-day cancellation**: Call the clinic directly if you must cancel on the day of the appointment [^114GCJFo].

---

## Information required for cancellation

When canceling, **provide the following**:

| **Information** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| Patient name | Full name as registered with the clinic |
| Date of birth | For patient identification |
| Appointment details | Date, time, and provider name |
| Reason for cancellation | Brief explanation (optional but helpful) |
| Contact information | Phone number or email for confirmation |

---

## Consequences of not canceling appointments

Failing to cancel or no-showing can have **negative consequences**:

- **Impact on clinic operations**: No-shows disrupt scheduling and reduce clinic efficiency [^114qN6mj].
- **Financial implications**: Clinics may charge no-show fees or impose penalties.
- **Patient care**: Missed appointments can delay care and worsen health outcomes [^1148uBE3].

---

## Policies regarding late cancellations and no-shows

Clinics typically have **policies for late cancellations and no-shows**, including fees for cancellations within 24 hours or repeated no-shows, potential restrictions on future scheduling, and documentation of no-shows in the patient's record. Policies vary, so confirm with your clinic.

---

## Alternative options if unable to attend scheduled appointments

If you cannot attend, **consider these alternatives**:

- **Rescheduling**: Request a new appointment date and time [^117TyhsW].
- **Telemedicine**: Ask if a virtual visit is available [^113nMEoJ].
- **Urgent care**: Use urgent care or walk-in clinics for immediate needs.

---

## Documentation and confirmation of cancellation

Always **request written confirmation** of your cancellation via email or text, and keep a record of the cancellation, including the date, time, and method used. Follow up if you do not receive confirmation within 24 hours.

---

## Tips for effective communication with healthcare providers

- **Be clear and concise**: Clearly state your intention to cancel and provide necessary details [^notfound].
- **Be polite and respectful**: Maintain a professional tone in all communications.
- **Provide advance notice**: Notify the clinic as early as possible [^114yr622].
- **Ask for confirmation**: Ensure you receive confirmation of the cancellation [^notfound].

---

Canceling a medical appointment is straightforward: **call the clinic or use the portal/email**, give your details, and request confirmation. Early notice helps the clinic and may avoid fees; if you're late, still notify them to enable rescheduling.

### Outpatient otolaryngology in the era of COVID-19: a data-driven analysis of practice patterns [^114Ds9BE]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Variables

The data consisted of the following variables: date of scheduled appointment, completion status of that appointment, reason for cancellation (if it was canceled), type of appointment (in person or telehealth), provider name, and patient age.

Dates were grouped into weeks 1 to 4 for each period. Appointment completion status was grouped into completed, cancelled, no-show, or left without being seen. If the appointment was cancelled, cancellation reasons were grouped into COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 administrative-directed cancellations or patient-directed cancellations. To qualify as a COVID-19 administrative-directed cancellation, the appointment must have been in 2020 and must have a cancellation reason of "crisis planning" or "bump". No instances of the former reason existed in 2019, though 12 of 108 (11.1%) bumps occurred in 2019 (which were categorized as non–COVID-19 administrative-directed cancellations). "Video" or "telephone" visits were determined to be telehealth visits, and all other visit types were grouped as in person.

Provider name was utilized to categorize appointments by subspecialty: pediatric otolaryngology, head and neck oncology, general/specialty otolaryngology (which included general otolaryngology, otologists, laryngologists, rhinologists, and facial plastic surgeons), speech and language pathology (SLP), audiology, and advanced practice providers (nurse practitioners and physician assistants). Physician categorization was determined a priori and based on hospital service workflow and institutional clinic distribution at our academic center. Patients were grouped into functional age cohorts: ≤ 2, 3–10, 11–17, 18–44, 45–64, 65–79, and ≥ 80 years.

### Ensuring the continuation of routine primary care during the COVID-19 pandemic: a review of the international literature [^113nMEoJ]. Family Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Telehealth was provided through a variety of ways including telephone, video consultations, email, text messaging, online patient portals, and smart phone apps. Telephone was the primary means of care delivery in many practices and reportedly constituted the majority of remote consultations.,

Telehealth was adapted to support the provision of a range of routine care functions including disease management, and coordination of care. Telephone and video consultations were commonly used for triaging patients and treating acute and chronic conditions that did not require in-person management including nonurgent presentations and stable chronic conditions. Two studies described the use of medical home monitoring devices such as Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure monitors, pulse oximeters, and glucose meters to support chronic disease management. Telehealth enabled care coordination between PCPs and other health care providers including allied health and hospital-based specialists.,

Telehealth facilitated the screening, triage, and management of suspected cases of COVID-19, and in certain contexts such as in Belgium, this was done in collaboration with designated COVID centers or triage posts so as to maintain safe access to routine primary care. Other reported uses of telehealth included aiding the provision of essential services (e.g. immunization and abortion services), assessing and addressing patient needs, electronic prescribing, and issuance of medical certificates or laboratory and imaging requests.

Limiting in-person care

Practices balanced remote and in-person care in response to the pandemic, limiting the latter to help contain the spread of COVID-19. Nine studies from Canada, United States, New Zealand, South Africa, and Belgiumreported measures taken (other than telehealth) to limit direct patient care. These included canceling or deferring appointments, suspending intake of new patients, advising patients against in-person care when possible, and avoiding in-person group activities including social support programs. In-person consultations were undertaken either onsite, or through home visits, or both, and were usually reserved for acute and urgent presentations, and management of at-risk patients.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for termination of pregnancy, more specifically with respect to follow-up assessment, ACOG 2020 guidelines recommend to do not obtain routine in-person follow-up after uncomplicated medication abortion. Offer the choice of self-assessment or clinical follow-up evaluation to assess medication abortion success. Consider obtaining follow-up evaluation by medical history, clinical examination, serum hCG testing, or ultrasound when medically indicated or preferred by the patient.

### Machine learning approaches to predicting no-shows in pediatric medical appointment [^111wkuTG]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The first question that we explored is which factors are associated with no-shows. By using a logistic regression model on all available features as input to classify show versus no-show, we are able to estimate effect sizes (i.e. relative odds ratios (ORs)) of each factor. In this analysis, the factor with the highest effective size is "visit type:newborn", with an odd ratio of 9.8 ± 0.3 (see Fig. 6a, b). However, many of the factors such as "visit type", "healthcare plan", and "race" are not actionable or changeable. We thus adopt "appointment day of the week", "appointment time of the day", and "language" to be potential actionable items as appointment time often has some flexibility and an interpreter/interpreting system can be provided to people speaking different languages. Among these potentially actionable items, "appointment hours 20:00" (1.67 ± 0.13) and "language: Japanese" (2.34 ± 0.19) have a high OR, towards show-up at appointments. No potential actionable factors show low ORs.

We conduct the same analysis for cancellation versus no-show. "Language_Chinese Cantonese" (1.21 ± 0.06) has a high OR, towards cancellation of appointments; and "appointment day of week 7 (Sunday)" (10.61 ± 0.03) and "Appointment hours: 8:00" (0.83 ± 0.07) show low ORs (see Fig. 6c, d).

### Post-acute health care needs of people with head and neck cancer: mapping health care services, experiences, and the impact of rurality [^1165KfnW]. Head & Neck (2022). Medium credibility.

3.1.1 Appointments attended and canceled

Number of appointments, professionals, and sites attended are shown in Table 2. Compared with the metropolitan cohort, rural participants attended significantly (z = 2.487, p = 0.012) more health care appointments (Mdn = 44, range 32–96) and experienced significantly (z = 2.12, p = 0.03) more missed or canceled appointments (Mdn = 5, range 2–12). The combined cohort percentage of missed or canceled appointments for all bookings was 10.6%. Missed or canceled HNC specialists' appointments between rural and metropolitan participants were not significant (z = 0.409, p = 0.68) although it was statistically significant for appointments with other professionals (z = 2.031, p = 0.042). The number of HNC specialists' appointments accessed by the rural and metropolitan groups was not significant (z = 0.8292, p = 0.407). Two rural participants experienced conflicting or overlapping bookings at the local, regional, or metropolitan hospitals which resulted in missed appointments. Rural participants were required to travel to 2–3 hospital facilities to attend appointments, while the metropolitan participants only accessed care at the treating cancer facility.

### Using nudges to reduce missed appointments in primary care and mental health: a pragmatic trial [^113wFfwx]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Additional Analyses

In primary care, modality of appointment (OR = 0.74, 95%CI = 0.57–0.98, p = 0.03) and gender (OR = 0.71, 95%CI = 0.53–0.95, p = 0.02) both moderated the missed appointment rate, such that missed visits were more likely in the intervention group compared to the control group for virtual appointments and men, while less likely for in-person appointments and women. For the cancelation rate in primary care, only modality of appointment was a significant moderator (OR = 1.34, 95%CI = 1.06–1.69, p = 0.02), where virtual appointments in the nudge arms were less likely to be canceled than in the control group, and more likely for in-person appointments. In mental health, the only significant moderator was gender for canceled appointment rate (OR = 0.73, 95%CI = 0.53–0.99, p = 0.04), where both men and women in the intervention group were less likely to cancel appointments than in the control group, but men more so than women.

For sensitivity analyses, results were generally very similar with two minor exceptions. First, in primary care, when restricting to the patients' first appointment, the canceled appointment rate was lower for the intervention arms compared to the control arm (OR = 0.88, 95%CI = 0.78–1.00, p = 0.04) in the adjusted model. Second, in mental health, when restricting to the patients' first appointment, the missed appointment rate for arm C (Consequences for Others) was lower compared to that of the control arm (OR = 0.67, 95%CI = 0.45–0.98, p = 0.04).

### Cancel, deactivate, or reactivate a facility registration… [^112cSJBk]. access.fda.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

May, 2025 The process of cancelling or deactivating a registration takes less than five minutes. The process of reactivating a registration takes approximately 20 minutes and is very similar to registering a facility for the first time. Be sure that you allow enough time to complete the process in one sitting, as partially completed reactivation cannot be saved for a future session. If you need to leave your computer briefly during the reactivation process, the system will time-out after 30 minutes and all partially completed steps will be lost. Only pending registrations not yet assigned a registration number can be cancelled. Select a pending registration from the display of all registrations with "registration number not yet assigned" under your account and click "Cancel Selected Registration. " Pending Registration Selection Screen Carefully review the details listed for the facility you have chosen to ensure that this is the facility you truly want to cancel.

Click the box by the certification statement and select "Cancel Registration". The cancellation of this facility is confirmed in the next screen. All facility listings under your account will appear.

### American Society of Echocardiography COVID-19 statement update: lessons learned and preparation for future pandemics [^115HtCiv]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2023). High credibility.

Standards of care — definitions and operational examples distinguish Conventional, Contingency, and Crisis modes: conventional care standards are the "business as usual" high standards when resources are not limited; contingency care standards anticipate shortages, conserve resources, or substitute with alternative techniques without relaxing usual standards, for example, not placing ECG electrodes and using timed acquisitions when scanning patients with COVID-19 to reduce transmission risk; crisis standards accept that resources are insufficient to maintain usual standards and may necessitate difficult choices, including denying scarce resources to patients unlikely to survive, with many laboratories deferring or canceling nonurgent studies due to transmission risk and staff shortages; most guidance in this statement applies to contingency standards, and recommendations may be applicable broadly in future situations with threats from highly contagious pathogens.

### The impact of COVID-19 on routine medical care and cancer screening [^115tofkq]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Routine Care: Plans to Cancel

Factors associated with cancelling future physical and mental health care were similar to those associated with past cancelled visits, with college graduates more likely to plan to cancel appointments and a minimal relationship with race/ethnicity and household income except that Hispanic ethnicity was associated with an increased likelihood of cancellation during early survey waves, but not in December. Number of medical conditions was statistically significantly related to future cancellation in the latter two survey waves. Personal or family member infection with COVID-19 was strongly related to cancelling future appointments; otherwise, perceived COVID-19 risk played a minimal role in planned cancellation. Anxiety and depressive symptoms played a much larger role: depressive symptoms were strongly associated with cancelling future appointments, particularly in December; the relationship with anxiety seemed to peak in October. Coping and uncertainty tolerance were largely unrelated to future cancellation plans (Fig. 2).

Cancer Screening: Past Cancellations

Cancer screening was cancelled more often by women and college graduates. As seen for general medical care, people 65 years and older were more likely to cancel in early survey waves and less likely in October and December. Race/ethnicity, income, and perceived risk of COVID-19 had minimal relationships with cancelled cancer screening although respondents who identified as Asian or as a Pacific Islander were less likely to cancel screening than those identifying as white during survey waves 2 and 3. Much like general medical care cancellations, people with greater anxiety and depressive symptoms were more likely to cancel cancer screening. Approach-oriented coping was strongly related to cancelled cancer screening during early waves but not in October or December, and avoidant coping was not associated significantly with cancellations (Fig. 2).

Cancer Screening: Plans to Cancel

Cancelling/postponing future cancer screening was related to factors similar to cancelling/postponing future physical and mental health appointments with older people and women less likely, college graduates more likely and minimal relationships with race/ethnicity and income. Severe anxiety was associated with planning to cancel cancer screening, and the relationship with level of depressive symptoms was large, particularly in latter survey waves.

### Mobile telephone short message service reminders can reduce nonattendance in physical therapy outpatient clinics: a randomized controlled trial [^1125Pju8]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether short message service (SMS) reminders reduce nonattendance in physical therapy outpatient clinics.

Design

Prospective single-blinded randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Two physical therapy outpatient departments in metropolitan acute public hospitals.

Participants

Participants with an appointment in a physical therapy outpatient clinic and who provided a contact mobile telephone number were included. Participants were excluded if their appointment was scheduled for the same day on which they made the appointment.

Intervention

Participants allocated to the intervention group received an SMS reminder before their next appointment; participants allocated to the control group did not receive a reminder.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was rate of nonattendance without cancellation. Secondary outcomes were cancellation and attendance rates and exploration of other factors associated with nonattendance.

Results

Patients (N = 679) were allocated to receive either an SMS reminder (n = 342) or no reminder (n = 337). The nonattendance rate for patients who did not receive a reminder (16%) was more than nonattendance for patients receiving the SMS reminder (11%; odds ratio, 1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03–2.51; number needed to treat, 19; 95% CI, 9–275). There were no differences in cancellation or attendance rates between groups. Exploration of other factors found that patients who were younger with a neck and trunk musculoskeletal or a neuromuscular disorder and who were scheduled to have an initial appointment or an appointment on a Monday or Friday were significantly predictive of increased nonattendance.

Conclusions

SMS reminders can reduce nonattendance in physical therapy outpatient clinics.

### Demographic and clinical factors are associated with frequent short-notice cancellations in veterans with multiple sclerosis on disease modifying therapies [^113V6Moo]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

(1) To identify the rate of short-notice canceled appointments in a large national sample of persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) and (2) examine the demographic and clinical factors associated with frequent cancellations.

Design

Retrospective cross-sectional cohort using electronic health records.

Setting

Veterans Health Administration.

Participants

Veterans with MS (N = 3742) who were part of the Veterans Health Administraiton's MS Center of Excellence Data Repository and (1) had at least one outpatient appointment at the VA in 2013, (2) were alive in 2015, and (3) were prescribed a disease modifying therapy (DMT).

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

Frequent short-notice cancellations, defined as > 20% of scheduled appointments canceled with less than 24-hour notification over a 24-month period. This threshold was based on the definition of ≤ 80% for suboptimal treatment adherence. Several demographics and clinical variables were examined as potential explanatory factors.

Results

Approximately 75% (n = 2827) had at least 1 short-notice cancellation, with more than 3% (n = 117) categorized as frequent cancelers. The odds of frequent cancellations were greater in women (odds ratio [OR], 1.81; p = 0.004) and among 18- to 44-year-olds (OR, 2.77; p = 0.004) and 45- to 64-year-olds (OR, 2.49; p = 0.003) compared to those over 65. The odds were lower among persons who lived < 25 miles away (OR, 0.58; p = 0.043) compared with persons who lived ≥ 75 miles away and those who had at least 1 emergency department visit (OR, 0.55; p = 0.012).

Conclusions

Short-notice cancellations are common in persons with MS, although few have more than 20%. These findings highlight who is at greater risk for frequent cancellation and disruptions in their care. Although additional research is needed, the results provide insights into how clinics may approach handling frequent short-notice cancellations among persons with MS.

### Sociodemographic factors associated with outpatient radiology No-shows versus Cancellations [^115QVQb7]. Academic Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

To assess prevalence of missed outpatient radiology appointments and sociodemographic factors associated with no-shows vs. cancellations.

Methods

Adults with outpatient radiology appointments in 2022 and January 2023 at a single tertiary academic health center were included. Generalized estimating equation regression was used to evaluate sociodemographic factors associated with missed vs. completed appointments, no-shows vs. cancellations and time interval between cancellations and appointments.

Results

19,262 (24.3%) examinations were either a cancellation (22.3%) or no-show (2.0%) among 9713 patients (mean age 60.8 ± 15.5; 67.1% female, 63.9% White, 20.0% Asian, 22.0% Hispanics). Among cancellations, 70.19% were patient-initiated. Age ≥ 65 significantly decreased the probability of missed appointments by 5.4% point (pp) (95% CI: 3.7–7.2) or no-shows (4.2 pp; 95% CI, 1.4–6.9), while being single increased probability of missed appointments (2.2 pp; 95% CI, 1.2–3.1) or no-shows (2.6 pp; 95% CI, 1.2–4.1). Those uninsured or with public insurance were 1.3–4.9 pp more likely to miss appointments than commercial insurance, and 2.2–7.6 pp more likely to have no-shows than cancellations. Living in disadvantaged neighborhoods 4.9 pp (95% CI, 3.9–6.0) increased likelihood of missing appointment and was associated with shorter time interval between cancellation and appointment. English speakers were 2.2 pp (95% CI, 1.1–3.3) more likely to miss their exam, while 2.7 pp (95% CI, 1.1–0.4.3) less likely to be a no-show than cancellation.

Conclusion

Cancellations represented a significant portion of missed appointments. Specific sociodemographic subgroups exhibited higher tendencies for having missed appointments and no-shows.

### Patient and visit characteristics associated with use of direct scheduling in primary care practices [^113cMbXk]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What characteristics are associated with the online portal–based scheduling of medical visits?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 62 080 patients and 134 225 completed visits at 17 primary care practices within a large academic medical center, early adopters of direct scheduling were more often young, White, and commercially insured. Compared with visits scheduled by speaking with clinic staff in person or by telephone, directly scheduled visits were more likely to be with one's own primary care physician.

Meaning

These findings suggest that direct scheduling may contribute to primary care continuity and that if greater adoption by younger, White, commercially insured patients persists, this service may widen socioeconomic disparities in primary care access.

### Understanding the causes of missingness in primary care: a realist review [^116xRq8g]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Permeability and appointment-making

Primary care in the UK is a gatekeeper-led system, with a specific structure and certain cultural and behavioural expectations that must be met to navigate it successfully. Patients experiencing missingness may struggle with these aspects of permeability. Registration and appointment systems in general have been described as a "threat" (, p.6) to some patients and a contributor to health inequalities. By not attending in the past, patients are positioned as deviant or troublesome in the eyes of staff, creating "friction" (, p.642) and many of the relational challenges above. Appointment-making requirements might be narrow and hard for patients to fulfil — calling at certain times, with telephone-only systems, to monolingual staff — and the personal resources (knowledge, skills, confidence, language) needed to fulfil these expectations or to negotiate and persist in pursuit of the right appointment are unequally distributed or depleted by negative experiences with services. If services do not offer a timely appointment, patient circumstances change — they may forget, symptoms resolve, motivations change or other demands emerge, accounting for the almost universal finding that delays lead to missed appointments. If services do not offer a convenient time, patients may not be able to reconcile attendance with competing demands or with the rhythms and patterns of their lives. If the system does not permit or support patient choice in whom they see, in where or how they attend (in-person/virtually/at home/in practice), in communication support or in how much time is afforded to them, candidacies might be disrupted. Errors, miscommunications or misunderstandings may be caused by service factors: failures to notify patients of appointments; providing incorrect details; booking appointments or notifying patients at short notice; using inaccessible or unsuitable forms of communication; and not providing ways for patients to easily amend or cancel their appointments. Sections 7.3.5, 7.3.7 and 7.3.3 of Additional file 1 provide the evidence synthesis for these findings.

Post-vasectomy semen analysis (PVSA) follow-up — physicians should consider giving men a specific appointment for the first PVSA to improve compliance with follow-up. Across studies, a median of 78% (range 33–100%) of men return for a single PVSA and a median of 73% (range 21–100%) are fully compliant with PVSA study protocols; in large cohorts typical of North American practice, between 55% and 71% return for at least one PVSA. One randomized controlled trial including 228 men found 84% returned for semen analysis with an appointment versus 65% without, and the Panel suggests that the practice of scheduling a follow-up PVSA appointment should be left to the judgment of the individual clinician. The number of tests requested and the timing of samples do not appear to make a significant difference in compliance rates.

It takes a lot of weight off your shoulders and worry if you've got somewhere like that to go to… it's really, really good. (Participant 13, male, outer regional).

Carers emphasized that they appreciated the provision of rurally based treatment options, specialist equipment, and tele-consultations with urban-based specialists. The inevitability of needing to travel for some medical purposes was, nonetheless, acknowledged.
2 Frustration with systems that do not demonstrate understanding of the rural context

While rural cancer carers were appreciative of the financial assistance provided through the Patient Assisted Transport Schemes (PATS), navigating the system (e.g. meeting requirements, justifying the need for an escort) was often described as both frustrating and distressing.

When people say to me 'how are you going?' or 'how's [first name]?' and all of that sort of stuff and we talk about breast cancer… I say to them that the single most horrendous day I've ever had was a day I had at the PATS office. (Participant 6, male, remote)

Participants also expressed frustration with the limited extent to which urban-based medical specialists understood the constraints associated with rural residency. Instances of travel arrangements being compromised by specialists running very late, cancelling or changing appointments at short notice were described.a couple of times we've been up to Adelaide and they've been ringing to cancel [first name]'s appointment and I said 'we're nearly there'… see they didn't think Mount Gambier was too far away.

### Association of use of electronic appointment reminders with waiting times in the veterans affairs health system [^1122yVf6]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Electronic appointment reminder systems are increasingly being used across health systems in the US and around the world. Their prominence may be associated with their modest (and decreasing) costs of implementation, as well as their association with improvement in patient no-show rates.,

Although there has been much investigation into associations between such reminder systems and patients' appointment-keeping behavior, research into use of these systems and patient waiting times (the number of days from when an appointment is booked to when the patient completes the appointment) is limited. Waiting times capture patients' delay in receiving care and are an important measure of a health care delivery system's responsiveness. They also indirectly measure patient access, an indicator that is known to be associated with clinical outcomes.

It is worth noting that the positive findings of appointment reminder systems regarding no-show rates do not immediately translate into improved waiting times. On the one hand, a lower no-show rate means that fewer patients miss their appointments and more patients receive care expediently. On the other hand, a higher influx of patients stemming from lower no-show rates could be a factor in more congested appointment schedules, which could inadvertently increase the length of time between when patients book their appointments and when they eventually receive care. In addition, some studies have found that reminder systems, implemented either through telephone calls or cellphone text messages, may be associated with higher rates of appointment cancellation. Increased rates of cancellation mean that patients (intentionally or otherwise) may experience delay in receipt of their care, and that congestion of clinic waiting lists and patient waiting times may increase.

### Incidence and risk factors for patient-related short-term cancellation of elective arthroscopic surgery: a case-matched study [^111aewAz]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the patient care issues surrounding surgical cancellation, there remains a dearth of existing literature elucidating the risk factors for short-term surgical cancellation of elective ambulatory orthopaedic procedures in the United States. The existing data regarding the incidence of and factors associated with day-of-surgery cancellations have been predominately derived from health systems structurally different from those in the United States; have combined the results across multiple subspecialties, including orthopaedics; and have included both inpatient-stay and ambulatory procedures, potentially limiting the generalizability of the reported findings. Regardless of a history of heart failure or advanced renal disease, a history of multiple prior canceled surgeries and surgery scheduled for later in the day were found to be independently associated with 24-hour cancellation among same-day admission and ambulatory elective surgery cases. Knowledge of potentially modifiable risk factors contributing to cancellation can serve as a basis for preoperative interventions aimed at minimizing this risk. Petrone et alfound that age older than 46.5 years, non-English speaking, current smoking status, and lack of a history of surgery requiring anesthesia were independently associated with cancellation of elective sports medicine procedures. A recent study has demonstrated an increase in ambulatory surgical center utilization and average Medicare reimbursements from 2012 to 2017. Therefore, a more complete understanding of the factors driving cancellations, particularly within 24 hours of surgery, can serve to support interventions aimed at eliminating these costly and avoidable situations.

The primary purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of patient-related short-term cancellation of elective arthroscopic surgery and the risk factors predictive of these cancellations. Furthermore, we sought to determine whether surgical type was associated with cancellation risk. We hypothesized that patients with lower socioeconomic status, those with a history of prior cancellations, and those who missed prior outpatient evaluations would likely cancel at a higher rate within 24 hours of surgery.

### Patient and visit characteristics associated with use of direct scheduling in primary care practices [^113j7WLk]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Medical practices increasingly allow patients to schedule their own office visits through online patient portals, otherwise known as direct scheduling. This option is offered by the largest electronic health record (EHR) vendors and via external health care applications in the United States and internationally, which is consistent with trends toward self-service in most other industries. In a 2013 survey,77% of US respondents said it was important to them that their medical provider offered online appointment booking; however, only 43% of respondents said that direct scheduling was offered in some form at the time.

Direct scheduling is intended to improve patient convenience while reducing administrative burden for practices. This offering may have additional benefits, especially in the primary care setting, such as promoting continuity with one's usual primary care physician (PCP). Conversely, direct scheduling might worsen disparities in access to care via the so-called digital divide. Small studies of individual clinics and hospitals in the US, United Kingdom, Australia, and China provide early evidence that this approach may be associated with lower no-show rates, and the ability to schedule visits outside of usual business hours. Yet there is little rigorous research on who uses direct scheduling, how it is used, or any unintended consequences.

By January 2018, a large academic medical center in the Boston, Massachusetts, area had introduced direct scheduling across 17 adult primary care practices, providing an opportunity to study early adoption and consequences associated with this approach. We used EHR data to identify patient characteristics associated with direct scheduling adoption, how direct scheduling was used, and potential implications for primary care access and continuity.

### Electronic health record algorithm development for research subject recruitment using colonoscopy appointment scheduling [^113D8qq7]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Electronic health records (EHRs) are often leveraged in medical research to recruit study participants efficiently. The purpose of this study was to validate and refine the logic of an EHR algorithm for identifying potentially eligible participants for a comparative effectiveness study of fecal immunochemical tests (FITs), using colonoscopy as the standard.

Methods

An Epic report was built to identify patients who met the eligibility criteria to recruit patients having a screening or surveillance colonoscopy. With the goal of maximizing the number of potentially eligible patients that could be recruited, researchers, with the assistance of information technology and scheduling staff, developed the algorithm for identifying potential subjects in the EHR. Two validation methods, descriptive statistics and manual verification, were used.

Results

The algorithm was refined over 3 iterations leading to the following criteria being used for generating the report: Age, Appointment Made On/Cancel Date, Appointment Procedure, Contact Type, Date Range, Encounter Departments, ICD-10 codes, and Patient Type. Appointment Serial Number/Contact Serial Number were output fields that allowed the tracking of cancellations and reschedules.

Conclusion

Development of an EHR algorithm saved time in that most individuals ineligible for the study were excluded before patient medical record review. Running daily reports that included cancellations and rescheduled appointments allowed for maximum recruitment in a time frame appropriate for the use of the FITs. This algorithm demonstrates that refining the algorithm iteratively and adding cancellations and reschedules of colonoscopies increased the accuracy of reaching all potential patients for recruitment.

### Targeted reminder phone calls to patients at high risk of No-show for primary care appointment: a randomized trial [^114yr622]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

No-shows, or missed appointments, are a problem for many medical practices. They result in fragmented care and reduce access for all patients.

Objective

To determine whether telephone reminder calls targeted to patients at high risk of no-show can reduce no-show rates.

Design

Single-center randomized controlled trial.

Participants

A total of 2247 primary care patients in a hospital-based primary care clinic at high risk of no-show (> 15% risk) for their appointment in 7 days.

Intervention

Seven days prior to their appointment, intervention arm patients were placed in a calling queue to receive a reminder phone call from a patient service coordinator. Coordinators were trained to engage patients in concrete planning. All patients received an automated phone call (usual care).

Main Measures

Primary outcome was no-show rate. Secondary outcomes included arrival rate, cancellation rate, reschedule rate, time to cancellation, and change in revenue.

Key Results

The no-show rate in the intervention arm (22.8%) was significantly lower (absolute risk difference -6.4%, p < 0.01, 95% CI [-9.8 to -3.0%]) than that in the control arm (29.2%). Arrival, cancellation, and reschedule rates did not differ significantly. In the intervention arm, rescheduling and cancellations occurred further in advance of the appointment (mean difference, 0.35 days; 95% CI [0.07–0.64]; p = 0.01). Reimbursement did not differ significantly.

Conclusions

A phone call 7 days prior to an appointment led to a significant reduction in no-shows and increased reimbursement among patients at high risk of no-show. The use of targeted interventions may be of interest to practices taking on increased accountability for population health.

### Association of use of electronic appointment reminders with waiting times in the veterans affairs health system [^11695jSW]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Previous studies have demonstrated beneficial outcomes associated with electronic appointment reminder systems and individual patient appointment-keeping behavior. The present study investigates whether such reminder systems are associated with improved measures of health care delivery, focusing specifically on reductions in patient waiting times.

Using data from the VEText reminder system, we found an association between reminder systems and measures of health care delivery, both in aggregate and separately for each of the 4 clinical groups. We also found that each incomplete booking prior to the completed appointment was associated with a concomitant and substantial increase in mean waiting times. This result may be expected; a patient who does not complete their appointment booking either through a cancellation or no-show would have to make a booking for a new appointment, which should entail additional delay.

The results also revealed that the introduction of VEText was associated was an exacerbation of the delay from incomplete bookings. We found evidence of some degree of exacerbation in each of the clinical groups, although this exacerbation was more pronounced in the procedural and radiology groups compared with others.

The results of our post-hoc analyses present a possible explanation for this apparent exacerbation. VEText was associated with a reduction in the number of patient cancellations and short-notice cancellations. When clinics receive such cancellations, they may not be able to find other patients to fill these newly open slots. Therefore, without VEText, higher levels of cancellations could mean that clinic appointment schedules may be more loosely filled. Conversely, because VEText was associated with fewer cancellations, under VEText, clinics may have appointment schedules with fewer gaps. In this case, a patient who had just missed their booking and was attempting to rebook an appointment must now face a more heavily filled appointment schedule. They may find it more difficult to book an appointment, which may help explain why waiting times are longer for such patients. This proposed mechanism is illustrated in the Figure.

### Telephone reminders reduce no-shows: a quality initiative at a breast imaging center [^114GCJFo]. Clinical Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To improve the workflow and productivity at a Breast Imaging Center, primarily by decreasing the no-show rate.

Materials and Methods

Mammography clinic data were recorded and analyzed for a 6-month period prior to our intervention. Personal pre-appointment phone calls were then instituted for all patients, following which data was recorded and analyzed for a 2-month period. Analyses compared pre- and post-intervention data.

Results

No-shows were significantly reduced (p < 0.001) from 20.99% (907/3775) pre-intervention to 7.07% (69/976) post-intervention. Calling ahead to cancel an appointment from those who either were no-shows or canceled their appointment significantly improved (p < 0.001) from only 2.81% (22/784) calling to cancel pre-intervention to 25.00% (23/92) calling to cancel post-intervention.

Conclusions

Through systematic pre-appointment phone calls and documentation, we were able to achieve a very significant decrease in the no-show rate at our Breast Imaging Center. We believe that our intervention can be useful for other radiology groups to implement in their practices to reduce no-show rates.

### Comparison of predictive models for prevention of missed endoscopy appointments-failure of a predictive model to outperform overbooking model [^111uf6N3]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Patient late cancelation and nonattendance for endoscopy appointments is an ongoing problem affecting the productivity and wait times of endoscopy units. Previous research evaluated a model for predictive overbooking and had promising results.

Study

All endoscopy visits at an outpatient endoscopy unit during 4 nonconsecutive months were included in the data analysis. Patients who did not attend their appointment, or canceled with 48 hours of their appointment were considered nonattendees. Demographic, health, and prior visit behavior data was collected and the groups compared.

Results

1780 patients attended 2331 visits in the study period. Comparing the attendee versus non-attendees, there were significant differences in mean age, prior absenteeism, prior cancelations, and total number of hospital visits. No significant differences were seen between groups in winter versus non-winter months, the day of the week, sex distribution, type of procedure booked, or whether the referral was from specialist clinic or direct to procedure. The visit cancelation proportion (calculated excluding current visit) was substantially higher in the absentee group (P < 0.0001). A predictive model was developed and compared to current booking as well as a straight overbooking of 7%. Both overbooking models performed better than the current practice, but the predictive overbooking model did not outperform straight overbooking.

Conclusions

Developing an endoscopy unit specific predictive model may not be more beneficial than straight overbooking as calculated by missed appointment percentage.

### Improve preventive care by reducing missed and canceled… [^117TyhsW]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

No-shows and canceled appointments represent not only lost revenue but also missed opportunities to help patients manage their health. No-shows are especially problematic for preventive care appointments, which are often scheduled weeks in advance as opposed to the same day. To improve the rate of successful appointments, practices should consider making four changes:

1. Let patients schedule a preventive visit when it works best for them, whether that is days or weeks into the future or the same day they call. Most practices don't allow for same-day preventive visits, and the longer the wait for an appointment, the greater the likelihood that patients will forget.
2. Send letters or emails to patients who miss their appointments asking them to reschedule at their convenience. Although this won't solve the problem of the already missed appointment, it can prevent future missed appointments.

Make sure your message features the practice's phone number or patient portal scheduling address prominently, and use language that isn't confrontational.
3. Instead of relying only on automated appointment confirmation phone calls, have front-office staff make live "warm calls" the day before the patient's appointment.
4. If a patient arrives more than 20 minutes late, don't turn the patient away, which may be the last time you see him or her. Instead, have the front office contact the patient's physician to determine whether he or she can still see the patient. Adapted from "Remove Roadblocks and Improve Access to Preventive Care".

### Quality metrics for single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging: an ASNC information statement [^116ztE7z]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

ASNC SPECT MPI access metric — Third next available appointment — addresses appointment wait times and defines a scheduling performance measure. Prolonged appointment wait times have been shown to negatively impact patients' perception of service quality and their overall satisfaction with nuclear medicine procedures and leave patients at increased risk for clinical deterioration and adverse health outcomes. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement defines "third next available" as the average length of time in days from request to the third available physician appointment; for stress SPECT MPI, the measure is the average length of time in calendar days between the day insurance pre-authorization has been obtained and the day of the third available testing slot, and it is used rather than "next available" because it more sensitively reflects true appointment availability and has been validated in multiple clinical arenas.

### The electronic health record inbox: recommendations for relief [^114Xyvuo]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Pre-pandemic the average family physician spent 1.5 hours per day on the inbox. At one large integrated healthcare delivery system, family physicians and general internists addressed an average of 100 inbox messages daily during working hours and another 50 each weekday evening. Analyzing 2019 data for the near complete Epic user base, Holmgren et al. found that US clinicians received nearly 3 times as many inbox messages as clinicians in non-US countries. Over 1/3 of these inbox messages are system-generated and include many low-value communications, such as automated notifications of tests ordered without results, routine reports of scheduled/canceled/no-show appointments and routine notifications of admission and discharge (without associated clinical information) when a patient has an outpatient procedure such as a colonoscopy.

When the pandemic hit, the model of care delivery was fundamentally altered, as physicians and patients rapidly switched to online care. While only 3% of inbox messages are from patients, such messages often require more physician time per message to safely manage and can be especially time-intensive. The number of patient messages increased by 157% at the onset of the pandemic and have remained at this "new normal" level since. Now, after two years, we observe that what patients desire and expect is different. Immediate access to one's physician for non-urgent questions in real time is highly valued and can be valuable; direct access to one's physician may even be advertised by institutions as a service differentiator in local competitive markets, and yet we have not yet developed the care teams and compensation models designed to deliver care in this way.

The pandemic accelerated a fundamental shift over 2–3 months without the workflows, teamwork, and payment models to make this rise in non-visit-based work manageable. The burden seems to have primarily fallen on physicians. Physicians may now spend hours on clinical e-correspondences which would have been billable time had these conversations occurred in the context of a visit. Meanwhile, the expectations for patient contact hours and RVU productivity have not decreased in response to this growth of between-visit work.

To create the time to address these patient concerns, it is imperative that the inbox be cleared of low value notifications. Healthcare delivery organizations and other stakeholders must design approaches to inbox management that include assessment of the workload and optimized workflows and team responsibilities, along with appropriate resources and staffing to deliver this new dimension of care.

### Association of rideshare-based transportation services and missed primary care appointments: a clinical trial [^116ceUY4]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Transportation barriers contribute to missed primary care appointments for patients with Medicaid. Rideshare services have been proposed as alternatives to nonemergency medical transportation programs because of convenience and lower costs.

Objective

To evaluate the association between rideshare-based medical transportation and missed primary care appointments among Medicaid patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In a prospective clinical trial, 786 Medicaid beneficiaries who resided in West Philadelphia and were established primary care patients at 1 of 2 academic internal medicine practices located within the same building were included. Participants were allocated to being offered complimentary ride-sharing services (intervention arm) or usual care (control arm) based on the prescheduled day of their primary care appointment reminder. Those scheduled on even-numbered weekdays were in the intervention arm and on odd-numbered weekdays, the control arm. The primary study outcome was the rate of missed appointments, estimated using an intent-to-treat approach. All individuals receiving a phone call reminder were included in the study sample, regardless of whether they answered their phone. The study was conducted between October 24, 2016, and April 20, 2017.

Interventions

A model of providing rideshare-based transportation was designed. As part of usual care, patients assigned to both arms received automated appointment phone call reminders. As part of the study protocol, patients assigned to both arms received up to 3 additional appointment reminder phone calls from research staff 2 days before their scheduled appointment. During these calls, patients in the intervention arm were offered a complimentary ridesharing service. Research staff prescheduled rides for those interested in the service. After their appointment, patients phoned research staff to initiate a return trip home.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Missed appointment rate (no shows and same-day cancellations) in the intervention compared with control arm.

Results

Of the 786 patients allocated to the intervention or control arm, 566 (72.0%) were women; mean (SD) age was 46.0. (12.5) years. Within the intervention arm, 85 among 288 (26.0%) participants who answered the phone call used ridesharing. The missed appointment rate was 36.5% (144 of 394) for the intervention arm and 36.7% (144 of 392) for the control arm (P = 0.96).

Conclusions and Relevance

The uptake of ridesharing was low and did not decrease missed primary care appointments. Future studies trying to reduce missed appointments should explore alternative delivery models or targeting populations with stronger transportation needs.

### Quality metrics for single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging: an ASNC information statement [^115pXtaR]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Stress single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT MPI) — same-day cancelations quality metric defines the measure numerator as "Number of patients who experienced a same-day cancelation" and the measure denominator as "All patients scheduled for stress SPECT MPI". Exclusions specify that cancelations due to "no-show" or excessively late patients and protocol changes that still allow same-day testing "should not be included in the numerator", the scheduling system "should have the capability of differentiating same-day cancelations from earlier cancelations" and ideally generate reports "for any specified time period, but at a minimum the last calendar year", and performance thresholds are "Standard of good quality: ≤ 5%" and "Standard of excellent quality: ≤ 2%".

### Access to primary care appointments following 2014 insurance expansions [^112LF1fD]. Annals of Family Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded coverage to roughly 12 million individuals by mid-2014 and 20 million by 2016, raising concern about the capacity of the primary care system to absorb these individuals. We set out to determine how justified the concern was.

Methods

We used an audit design in which simulated patients called primary care practices seeking new-patient appointments in 10 diverse states (Arkansas, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Texas) from November 2012 through March 2013 and from May 2014 through July 2014, before and after the major ACA insurance expansions. Callers were randomly assigned to scripts specifying either private or Medicaid insurance and called only offices identified as "in network" for each plan.

Results

We completed 5,385 private insurance and 4,352 Medicaid calls in 2012–2013 and 2,424 private insurance and 2,474 Medicaid calls in 2014. Overall appointment rates for private insurance remained stable from 2012 (84.7%) to 2014 (85.8%) with Massachusetts and Pennsylvania experiencing significant increases. Overall, Medicaid appointment rates increased 9.7 percentage points (57.9% to 67.6%) with substantial variation by state. Across all callers, median wait times for those obtaining an appointment were 7 days in 2012 and 5 days in 2014, but the difference was not statistically significant.

Conclusions

Contrary to widespread concern, we find no evidence that the millions of individuals newly insured through the ACA decreased new-patient appointment availability across 10 states as shown by stable wait times and appointment rates for private insurance as of mid-2014.

### COVID-19 vaccine wastage in the midst of vaccine inequity: causes, types and practical steps [^117Cpp6W]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Conclusion

COVID-19 has highlighted critical issues of vaccine wastage and the need for all countries to develop detailed plans to monitor and reduce vaccine wastage. Importantly, current plans should include well-organised donations to minimise closed vial wastage and the use of strategies such as overbooking or appointment-free vaccination to minimise open vial wastage. While supply constraints were initially due to the low number of vaccines being manufactured, this is no longer the case. Therefore, it is time for high-income countires to share their vaccine surpluses with low- and middle-income countries, where many vulnerable individuals, including frontline healthcare workers, are still awaiting their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.

### Non-attendance in primary care: the views of patients and practices on its causes, impact and solutions [^111nbpM5]. Family Practice (2005). Low credibility.

Background

More than 12 million appointments in primary care are not attended each year: this is about 6.5% of the appointments made. Missing appointments is widely perceived as a waste of resources and a potential barrier to the achievement of the 48-hour access target.

Objectives

To explore and compare the views of primary care team members and patients in relation to the causes, impacts and potential solutions to the issue of non-attendance.

Methods

A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 24 patients over the age of 18 years, 7 GPs, a GP Registrar, a Nurse Practitioner and 5 receptionists carried out in one health centre in urban South Essex with additional interviews in a practice in rural Essex and a practice in inner city London.

Results

The major themes were: competing priorities for patients; the efficiency of appointment booking systems; the significance of relationships on non-attendance; differing attitudes towards non-attendance between different groups; and interventions. Poor patient-staff relationships was given as a reason for non-attendance, while missing appointments was seen as making relationships worse. Inefficiencies in the appointment booking systems were perceived as key in this 'relationship' context.

Conclusions

Some non-attendance is inevitable with pre-booked appointments, as GP appointments must compete with patients' other priorities and the complexities of their day. Utilising modern communication technologies, such as SMS text messaging, may make cancellation simpler. A structured approach to matching supply and demand of appointments might reduce problems arising from non-attendance.

### Association of an active choice intervention in the electronic health record directed to medical assistants with clinician ordering and patient completion of breast and colorectal cancer screening tests [^114NmKfo]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Intervention

Prior to the intervention, PCPs had to remember to manually check the EHR to determine whether a patient was due for cancer screening, discuss it with the patient, and then place an order for it in the EHR. From September 1, 2016, to August 31, 2017, 3 University of Pennsylvania Health System primary care practices implemented an active choice intervention in the EHR using a best-practice alert in EPIC directed to medical assistants. Prior to meeting with the clinician, patients met with a medical assistant to check their vital signs and prepare for the visit. At that time, the EHR checked for patient eligibility for breast and colorectal cancer screening and prompted medical assistants to accept or cancel an order for it. If accepted, the order would be templated (a pending order is made for the clinician to review and sign during the patient visit). This intervention was similar in design to prior work for influenza vaccination.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was clinician ordering of the screening test during the primary care visit. The secondary outcome was patient completion of a screening test (not necessarily linked to the order from the visit) within 1 year of the primary care visit.

### Behavioural nudges increase COVID-19 vaccinations [^117RTYJm]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

The April 2021 experiment used identical procedures but adopted additional measures of vaccination intentions to test whether findings in our February 2021 studies are robust to different ways of soliciting intentions. For this purpose, we randomized whether participants answered questions in the same hypothetical manner as in the February studies, or responded to questions with a less hypothetical framing. Participants randomized to answer the hypothetical version were asked 'How likely would you be to schedule a vaccination appointment after receiving this message from your healthcare provider?' (1, not at all likely, to 7, very likely) and 'How much would you want the vaccine after receiving this message from your healthcare provider?' (1, not at all, to 7, very much). These two questions were highly correlated (r = 0.94, P < 0.001) and aggregated into a composite. Participants randomized to answer the less hypothetical version of the intention questions were asked 'How likely are you to schedule a vaccination appointment today after receiving this message from your healthcare provider?' (1, not at all likely, to 7, very likely) and 'How much do you want the vaccine now, after receiving this message from your healthcare provider?' (1, not at all, to 7, very much). These two measures were highly correlated (r = 0.93, P < 0.001) and averaged into a composite. All participants also rated the persuasiveness of the message they read, using the same measure used in the February studies (Supplementary Information section 3).

### Impact of health portal enrolment with email reminders at an academic rheumatology clinic [^1117wnKW]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This is the first reported electronic appointment reminder intervention to be tested in rheumatology outpatients. From our baseline measurement, we learned that forgetfulness and date mix-ups were the most common reasons for missed appointments. Our baseline NS rate was 6.8%, which is lower than reported in the literature, although we did not count patients who cancelled at the last minute. Despite this, the cost of NS was approximately $20,000 per year, in addition to the cost rebooking patients and added medical costs from urgent healthcare visits, making it a significant problem worth addressing.

Our aim was to decrease non-attendance by 50% by April 30 2015. A secondary aim was to increase health portal enrolment and improve patient satisfaction. Our interventions included a follow-up card, a number of small interventions to increase enrollment in the hospital's online patient portal, and finally e-mail reminders. We measured number of patients between NS, which is appropriate in the case of rare events, and conducted waiting room surveys. Our results show that the email reminder intervention was associated with improved attendance in April 2015, although this improvement was not sustained, which likely related to too few patients being exposed to the intervention.

Spread was achieved by sharing the results of the intervention with the rheumatology division, which led the email reminder strategy to be adopted by 3 other rheumatologists' clinics. The piloted project was also shared with other hospital divisions through a research day symposium and at a hospital-wide 'patient experience exposition'. The email reminders have been continued with minimal effort from administrative staff. New strategies will be needed to increase portal enrolment and effective email delivery.

Although previous studies showed improvement in attendance with phone reminders, this was not feasible for us as there was little buy-in from stakeholders, citing cost and lack of resources. There are two examples of successful email reminder interventions in the literature. One center had phone and mail reminders already in place and they monitored the intervention for a longer period of time. Another group sent the reminder 3 days before the appointment rather than the week prior. This has scheduling limitations if a patient calls to cancel at short notice, but may be more helpful for forgetful patients, making it a possible avenue to explore in the future.

### Factors associated with non-attendance at a hand surgery appointment [^112E8RkZ]. Hand (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Patients who miss scheduled appointments without notifying office staff — "no-shows" — disrupt practice workflow and decrease access for others, resulting in misuse of resources and lost revenue. The primary purpose of this study was to identify factors associated with no-shows in a hospital-based outpatient hand office. Secondarily, we studied factors associated with cancelations.

Methods

Of the 14,793 new adult patient appointments to our outpatient hand surgery office scheduled between January 2011 and December 2013, 880 (5.9%) were no-shows and 2715 (18%) were cancelations. Data on patient demographics and timing of the visit were collected to construct a multinomial logistic regression model of determinants of appointment no-shows and cancelations.

Results

Factors independently associated with no-shows included younger age, Hispanic or black race, unmarried status (single or divorced), appointment on a Monday or Tuesday, and residence near the office. Factors associated with cancelations were female sex, unmarried status (widowed or divorced), winter season, and appointment on a weekday other than Friday.

Conclusions

Non-attendees are more likely to be younger, unmarried, non-white, to have their appointments at the start of the week, and to live near the office. Knowledge of these factors might prove useful for implementation of tailored quality improvement initiatives to reduce non-attendance and maximize productivity in the hand surgery office setting.

### Incidence and risk factors for patient-related short-term cancellation of elective arthroscopic surgery: a case-matched study [^1123V3Nu]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main findings of this study are that those patients without active employment, current cigarette smokers, and those who have not undergone MRI of the involved joint within 6 months of the scheduled procedure were markedly more likely to cancel their surgery within 24 hours of the date of surgery. A history of having canceled the surgery previously was markedly associated with a current cancellation. Approximately 80% of the patient-related cancellations in this study were deemed to be avoidable.

We found that the overall incidence of short-term cancellations for elective arthroscopy over the 4-year period under study was 2.7%, with shoulder arthroscopy procedures experiencing a similar patient-related cancellation rate to both knee and other (hip/elbow) arthroscopies. Furthermore, the patient-related cancellations comprised more than 80% of the total cancellations. The risk of cancellation in our study was lower than that of Petrone et al, who reported a cancellation rate of 13.4% for primarily elective arthroscopic procedures. This discordance is likely the result of their inclusion of any surgical cancellation before and including the day of surgery. Our short-term cancellation rate was similar to that of Kaddoum et alwho reported a 4.4% cancellation rate of which 71.6% were considered avoidable, although this included elective surgical procedures in multiple subspecialties, including orthopaedic surgery. Laisi et alreported a cancellation rate of 5.4% for elective orthopaedic procedures, with 72% being patient-related. Furthermore, Caesar et alreported that 17% of the patients undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery self-canceled, similar to our finding of an approximately 15% self-cancellation rate. By contrast, however, our cancellation for issues related to not being NPO was higher than that of Caesar et al, who reported a rate of 12% lacking sufficient medical clearance and/or preoperative fasting. We did not correlate cancellations related to being NPO to whether the case was scheduled for the morning or the afternoon, although a previous study reported that afternoon-scheduled cases were markedly more likely to cancel than morning cases. Finally, our finding that shoulder arthroscopy canceled at a similar rate to other anatomic sites is consistent with that of Petrone et al, who reported no notable difference in cancellation between patients undergoing distal biceps repair, in addition to knee, hip, and shoulder arthroscopies. This finding suggests that interventions aimed at reducing short-term cancellation can focus on patient demographics as opposed to the surgical procedure being done.

### Audio or video? Access to pediatric neurology outpatient services varies by the type of telehealth, especially for black children [^1164xKVk]. Journal of Child Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Children of minority race/ethnicity face barriers to accessing specialty services. During the COVID pandemic, health insurance companies reimbursed telehealth services. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of audio versus video visits on children's access to outpatient neurology services, particularly for Black children.

Methods

Using Electronic Health Record data, we collected information about children who had outpatient neurology appointments in a tertiary care children's hospital in North Carolina from March 10, 2020, to March 9, 2021. We used multivariable models to compare appointment outcomes (canceled vs completed, and missed vs completed) by visit type. We then conducted similar evaluation for the subgroup of Black children.

Results

A total of 1250 children accounted for 3829 scheduled appointments. Audio users were more likely to be Black and Hispanic, and to have public health insurance than video users. Adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for appointments completed versus canceled was 10 for audio and 6 for video, compared to in-person appointments. Audio visits were twice as likely as in-person visits to be completed versus missed; video visits were not different. For the subgroup of Black children, aOR for appointments completed versus canceled for audio was 9 and video was 5, compared to in-person appointments. For Black children, audio visits were 3 times as likely as in-person visits to be completed versus missed; video visits were not different.

Conclusions

Audio visits improved access to pediatric neurology services, especially for Black children. Reversal of policies to reimburse audio visits could deepen the socioeconomic divide for children's access to neurology services.

### Essential not supplemental: Medicare advantage members' use of non-emergency medical transportation (NEMT) [^112x6V8V]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Reliability, Predictability, and Quality of NEMT Services

Participants expressed concern around timely and reliable NEMT services. Multiple participants missed appointments because their ride was late or never arrived. One participant who used a wheelchair for mobility shared her frustration at missing appointments.

I went outside and sat in my driveway, waiting for them to come. And they never came… and this was an appointment that I had to go to my dialysis center. And so, I called. And first the guy hung up on me and then I called again and I said, "I'm sitting here waiting for you". And he says, "Well, I was already there. I rang the doorbell and nobody was there". And I said, "No, you didn't". I said, "I have been sitting in the driveway for the last forty-five minutes, nobody was here". So, anyway, I ended up missing that appointment.

Participants expressed dismay around the lack of communication with schedule changes, especially given the advanced planning they were asked to provide when scheduling rides. As one participant expressed: "Just give somebody some notice, if you're not going to be able to do something or if something gets cancelled… That's kind of disheartening, too because a person can make other arrangements if they know. But if you don't know, there's nothing you can really do".

The biggest source of frustration for participants was the lack of ride reliability following medical appointments. One participant who lacked alternative means of transportation shared, "I sit in the hallway [of the clinic] and I call them and when they come, they come. See, sometimes it has been a long time, but sometimes it's not. You just have to wait until the cab come[s]… I usually get sick [and tired of] waiting like that, but I had to deal with it because that's the only way I can get home". Two participants stopped using NEMT after their ride never arrived to pick them up after an appointment. "I was done at the doctor, and ninety degrees out, and I was done at the doctor at 3:00. And the office is closed and everybody was leaving and it was 6:30 and I was still standing there".

### Association of use of electronic appointment reminders with waiting times in the veterans affairs health system [^1145vFQK]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Post hoc analysis results revealed that the introduction of VEText was associated with a reduction of 0.10 (95% CI, 0.10–0.10) cancelled bookings per completed appointment. Significant negative associations were also found within each of the 4 clinical groups, and for cancelled bookings at various definitions of short notice. For example, in the regular outpatient and procedural groups, the introduction of VEText was associated with a reduction of 0.11 (95% CI, 0.11–0.12) and 0.06 (95% CI, 0.05–0.07) cancelled bookings per completed appointment respectively (Table 4; eTables 7, 8, 9, 10 in the Supplement).

Table 4.

Abbreviation: VEText, electronic appointment reminder system via text messaging.

To better understand the possible mechanisms of these results, we conducted further analyses that compared the mean daily workload before and after VEText, measured by the mean number of completed appointments at each clinic per day. Before VEText, each clinic had a mean of 22.2 (95% CI, 22.1–22.3) completed appointments per day; after VEText, mean workload at each clinic was significantly higher at 30.5 (95% CI, 30.3–30.6) completed appointments per day. Although not fully conclusive, this is nonetheless consistent with the notion that appointment schedules after VEText tended to be more tightly packed than before.

### Predicting missed appointments in primary care: a personalized machine learning approach [^111UUcFz]. Annals of Family Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Factors influencing missed appointments are complex and difficult to anticipate and intervene against. To optimize appointment adherence, we aimed to use personalized machine learning and big data analytics to predict the risk of and contributing factors for no-shows and late cancellations in primary care practices.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective longitudinal study leveraging geolinked clinical, care utilization, socioeconomic, and climate data from 15 family medicine clinics at a regional academic health center in Pennsylvania from January 2019 to June 2023. We developed multiclass machine learning models using gradient boost, random forest, neural network, and logistic regression to predict appointment outcomes, followed by feature importance analysis to identify contributing factors for no-shows or late cancellations at the population and patient levels. We performed stratified analysis to evaluate the prediction performance by sex and race/ethnicity to ensure the fairness of the final model among sensitive features.

Results

The analysis consisted of 109,328 patients and 1,118,236 appointments, including 77,322 (6.9%) no-shows and 75,545 (6.8%) late cancellations. The gradient boost model achieved the best performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.852 for predicting no-shows and 0.921 for late cancellations. No bias against patient characteristics was detected. Schedule lead time was identified as the most important predictor of missed appointments.

Conclusions

Missed appointments remain a challenge for primary care. This study provided a practical and robust framework to predict missed appointments, laying the foundation for developing personalized strategies to improve patients' adherence to primary care appointments.

### The impact of COVID-19 on routine medical care and cancer screening [^112n1XAE]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Concerning future medical care, 50% of respondents reported having an appointment scheduled in the 2 months after their survey (6% unsure). Of those with appointments, 15% planned to cancel or postpone. Similarly, concerning future cancer screening, 42% had screening scheduled (50% no appointment, 8% unsure) and 16% (8.5% of the total survey population) planned to cancel or postpone.

Comparing reports of past appointment cancellations or postponements across survey waves to plans to cancel or postpone future appointments shows that retrospective reports far exceed anticipated cancellations or postponements for general medical care, whereas the difference between past and future cancellations or postponements is smaller for cancer screening. While physical and mental health appointment cancellations or postponements decreased and then plateaued, cancer screening cancellations were stable. Anticipated cancellations or postponements were stable for physical and mental health appointments and also cancer screening (Table 2).

### Antimicrobial drug pricing [^1136VRTw]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

One challenge with implementing value-based subscription payments in this context is that the value of antimicrobials is difficult to estimate. Work undertaken by the Universities of York and Sheffield attempted to assess the health benefits and healthcare cost impacts of two new antimicrobial treatment combinations, cefiderocol and ceftazidime with avibactam, to support the development of National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance and subscription payment plans for these products. NICE provides evidence-based guidance to health care professionals, whilst ensuring the recommended treatments provide value for money. Our research involved extensive reviews of the literature and mathematical modelling to predict the health and cost impacts of introducing the new products. This revealed that there was limited data available about the number of patients who would be eligible to receive the products today and in the future, and their likely health benefits. Improved linked clinical, prescribing and laboratory data should offer the opportunity to better understand highly resistant infections, and therefore the value of new products. I hope that the UK experience can provide guidance to other health systems about how to move forward with value-based payments for new antimicrobials.

### Patient and visit characteristics associated with use of direct scheduling in primary care practices [^111iu29o]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Medical practices increasingly allow patients to schedule their own visits through online patient portals, yet little is known about who adopts direct scheduling or how this service is used.

Objective

To determine patient and visit characteristics associated with direct scheduling, visit patterns, and potential implications for access and continuity in the primary care setting.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study used electronic health record (EHR) data from 17 adult primary care practices in a large academic medical center in the Boston, Massachusetts, area. Participants included patients 18 years or older who were attributed in the EHR to an active primary care physician at 1 of the included primary care practices, were enrolled in the patient portal, and had at least 1 visit to 1 of these practices between March 1, 2018, and March 1, 2019, the period of analysis. Data were analyzed from October 25, 2019, to April 14, 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Adoption of direct scheduling, defined as at least 1 use during the study period. Usual scheduling was defined as scheduling with clinic staff by telephone or in person.

Results

We examined 134 225 completed visits by 62 080 patients (mean [SD] age, 51.1 [16.4] years, 37 793 [60.9%] women) attributed to 140 primary care physicians at 17 primary care practices. A total of 5020 patients (8.1% [95% CI, 7.9%-8.3%]) adopted direct scheduling, with an age range of 18 to 95 years. Compared with nonadopters in the same practices, adopters were younger (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] per additional year, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.98–0.99]) and were more likely to be White (AOR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.01–1.17]) and commercially insured (AOR vs uninsured, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.11–1.76]) and to have more comorbidities (AOR per additional comorbidity, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.04–1.11]). Compared with usually scheduled visits, directly scheduled visits were more likely to be for general medical examinations (1979 visits [36.7%] vs 26 519 visits [21.9%]; P < .001) and with one's own primary care physician (5267 visits [95.2%] vs 94 634 visits [73.5%]; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that direct scheduling was associated with greater primary care continuity. Early adopters were more likely to be young, White, and commercially insured, and to the extent these differences persist as direct scheduling is used more widely, this service may widen socioeconomic disparities in primary care access.

Medical Conditions and Missed Appointments

Overall, 45% of respondents reported having one or more of the serious medical conditions about which we asked: hypertension 27%, diabetes 15%, heart disease 7%, lung disease 6%, cancer 3%, and other 11%. Respondents with at least one medical condition (compared to those without any) were more likely to have a scheduled appointment within the 2 months prior to their interview (69% v 47%, p < 0.001). Those with an appointment and with medical conditions were more likely to experience a cancellation or postponement relative to those with appointments and no medical conditions (52% v 43%, 95% CI for difference 7.1–10.4%, p < 0.001). Patients with pre-existing heart and lung disease experienced the highest rates of cancelled or postponed appointments (Fig. 1).

### Healthcare use among cancer survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic: results from the SHARE COVID-19 survey [^114MTSap]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

A previous cancer diagnosis was associated with an increased use of healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as with a more frequent report of appointment cancelations, postponements, or denials, among older Europeans and Israeli individuals. The first months of the COVID-19 pandemic led to changes in healthcare provided to CS, including treatment and follow-up, which may have a deleterious impact on the care and prognosis of CS. Additionally, it is expected that these difficulties in oncological care worsen in the next few years due to the backlog of CS needing assessment along with the expected normal and routine volume of CS and the ongoing reallocation of resources. As such, the results of the present study highlight the importance of developing a strategic prioritization of care and closely monitoring the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the cancer care continuum.

### Behaviourally informed, patient-led interventions to reduce missed appointments in general practice: a 12-month implementation study [^113mgRJJ]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Scalable, positive, behaviourally informed interventions may help people remember to attend their primary care appointment or cancel in good time, but have not yet been implemented long term.

Aim

To examine effects of social norms and making active commitments on missed and cancelled appointments in primary care over 12 months and explore implementation factors.

Design and Setting

A mixed-methods design evaluation and implementation study led by a Patient Participation Group (PPG) member in a large GP practice in the West Midlands.

Methods

Following a 6-month baseline, waiting room notices were redesigned to emphasise positive social norms for desired behaviours. When booking appointments, receptionists were trained to invite patients to (i) verbally actively commit to cancelling if needed; (ii) write down their own appointment details. Monthly missed appointments (MAs) and cancellations were statistically compared with baseline averages and seasonally equivalent months. To explore implementation, reception staff completed a knowledge, attitude, and behaviour questionnaire at 9 months, analysed descriptively. Study team field notes were thematically analysed.

Results

Across 12 intervention months there was a mean of 37.67 fewer MAs per month (20% reduction) and 102.66 more cancellations (21.07% increase) compared with 6-month baseline means [MAs t(11) = -6.15, P < 0.001; cancellations t(11) = 3.637, P = 0.004] with statistically significant differences in seasonally equivalent months [MAs t(5) = -4.65, P = 0.006; cancellations t(5) = 3.263, P = 0.022]. Receptionists (n = 12) reported implementing the strategies except when facing pressures; knowledge and attitudes varied.

Conclusions

Behaviourally informed interventions reduced primary care MAs longer term; PPGs and practice teams can work together on quality improvement projects with support from leaders to prioritise and embed new practices.

### Do healthcare services behave as complex systems? Analysis of patterns of attendance and implications for service delivery [^115hYrYy]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Managing demand for healthcare is a global problem. The science of complex systems has been proposed as a way of understanding health services, but there has been little quantitative evidence to support this notion. The idea that healthcare services can be considered as complex systems is not new and remains current, but it has rarely been tested, particularly in ways that use large-scale data. Healthcare self-evidently possesses many of the characteristics of a complex system in that there are many component parts (patients, clinicians, services) with many interactions (consultations) which occur in the context of prevailing social attitudes and norms (e.g. ideas about when it is appropriate to seek healthcare). Because of the interactions and the way that characteristics of the system emerge from these interactions, complex systems are different from conventional systems in several ways. Some of these differences are listed in Table 1. Much current health services research and innovation addresses healthcare as a conventional system rather than as a complex one, with important implications for the development and implementation of complex interventions to change health and healthcare.

### Patient and visit characteristics associated with use of direct scheduling in primary care practices [^113isdhR]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

At the same time, our findings raise the possibility that direct scheduling might contribute to disparities in primary care access. As direct scheduling is more widely adopted, its disproportionate use among younger, White, commercially insured patients may crowd out visit access for older patients and patients in racial/ethnic minority groups with potentially greater need for, or historically decreased access to, primary care. These findings are particularly worrisome given that we restricted our sample to patients who had enrolled in the patient portal. Prior studies show that members of racial/ethnic minority groups and other historically underserved populations are less likely to enroll in patient portals in the first place. Even among patients with portal access, those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged are less likely to use the technology.

Furthermore, while practice leaders' concerns about patients directly scheduling too many visits were largely unfounded (99% of adopters scheduled just 1 or 2 visits in a year), our results leave open the possibility of more unnecessary visits. Directly scheduled visits were less likely than usually scheduled visits to be billed at the highest complexity level. They were also more likely to represent general medical examinations (partly a consequence of the design), which are of uncertain value among younger, healthy adults. More reassuringly, direct scheduling adopters had slightly more comorbidities and therefore, perhaps greater need for the service, consistent with prior work showing higher rates of comorbidities among portal adopters in general.

In addition to continuity and access considerations, direct scheduling theoretically offers a third benefit of practice efficiency. While we did not directly examine office staff workload or use of clinician schedules in this study, more recent (ie, July-September 2019) internal operational data of all visits from these 17 practices show that directly scheduled visits had higher cancellation rates than usually scheduled visits (4–57 percentage points higher than for usually scheduled visits across practices), consistent with the possibility that patients may work the schedule by canceling and rescheduling as new options arise or their personal schedules change. For all but 1 of 17 practices, these operational data show directly scheduled visits had the same or lower no-show rates (0–8 percentage points fewer no-show visits) (Mariela Arnal Istillarte, MSIE [Massachusetts General Hospital] email, December 2, 2019).

### The impact of COVID-19 on routine medical care and cancer screening [^111BvA11]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 restrictions and fear dramatically changed the use of medical care. Understanding the magnitude of cancelled and postponed appointments and associated factors can help identify approaches to mitigate unmet need.

Objective

To determine the proportion of medical visits cancelled or postponed and for whom. We hypothesized that adults with serious medical conditions and those with higher anxiety, depressive symptoms, and avoidance-oriented coping would have more cancellations/postponements.

Design

Four nationally representative cross-sectional surveys conducted online in May, July, October, and December 2020.

Participants

59,747 US adults who completed 15-min online surveys. 69% cooperation rate.

Measures

Physical and mental health visits and cancer screening cancelled or postponed over prior 2 months. Plan to cancel or postpone visits over the next 2 months. Relationship with demographics, medical conditions, local COVID-19 death rate, anxiety, depressive symptoms, coping, intolerance of uncertainty, and perceived COVID-19 risk.

Key Results

Of the 58% (N = 34,868) with a medical appointment during the 2 months before the survey, 64% had an appointment cancelled or postponed in May, decreasing to 37% in December. Of the 41% of respondents with scheduled cancer screening, 20% cancelled/postponed, which was stable May to December. People with more medical conditions were more likely to cancel or postpone medical visits (OR 1.19 per condition, 95% CI 1.16, 1.22) and cancer screening (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.15, 1.24). Race, ethnicity, and income had weak associations with cancelled/postponed visits, local death rate was unrelated, but anxiety and depressive symptoms were strongly related to cancellations, and this grew between May and December.

Conclusions

Cancelled medical care and cancer screening were more common among persons with medical conditions, anxiety and depression, even after accounting for COVID-19 deaths. Outreach and support to ensure that patients are not avoiding needed care due to anxiety, depression and inaccurate perceptions of risk will be important.

### Using nudges to reduce missed appointments in primary care and mental health: a pragmatic trial [^117XFv9T]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

One of the core ideas of behavioral economics is the idea of supporting behavior change through the use of nudges: small alterations in how options are presented that are designed to influence a person's decision making without restricting their choices. Several studies have found promising impacts on appointment attendance through application of nudges that leveraged principles such as people's general desire to avoid physical or emotional losses ("loss aversion") and adhere to prevalent social norms. – Specifically, a randomized controlled trial in outpatient specialty clinics in the UK's National Health Service found that specifying the cost of a missed appointment to the healthcare system significantly reduced the rate of missed appointments, and including the descriptive social norm that most patients attended their appointment significantly increased the rate of canceling appointments in advance, thus potentially averting missed appointments. An Israeli study found several messages effective at reducing missed appointments, the most effective being a text message appointment reminder designed to evoke emotional guilt ("Not showing up to your appointment without canceling in advance delays hospital treatment for those who need medical aid.) Finally, in the USA, a randomized trial of 360 veterans at a single VA medical center who were referred to specialty mental health for depression found that patients who received an appointment reminder letter containing a bolded, gain-framed message ("If you go to your appointment, you will learn ways to improve your mood and emotional well-being. Also, if you see your provider, he/she will be able to work with you to help you get the most out of your treatment".) were more likely to attend their appointments, compared to those who received a routine letter without the additional message.

To date, there have been no large-scale trials of behavioral economics-informed appointment reminders in the USA. Moreover, the effect of other types of nudges, or combining nudges, is not known. The aim of this study was to conduct a large-scale pragmatic trial within the VA to evaluate the effect of a series of nudges on missed and canceled appointments. We hypothesized that the intervention, as compared with usual care, would have a lower missed appointment rate and higher canceled appointment rate. We also hypothesized that effect size of nudges would vary by intervention arm such that some types of nudges would have a larger proportional effect than others.

### Time and money: effects of no-shows at a family practice residency clinic [^114qN6mj]. Family Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

When patients fail to appear for scheduled appointments, the flow of patient care is interrupted, and clinic productivity declines. This study investigated the impact of failed appointments on a clinic by measuring time and money lost after taking into account same-day treatment patients (walk-ins).

Methods

Schedule information was retrieved for 4,055 visits over 20 business days. Data were collected on appointment status (show, no-show, cancel, walk-in), time allocated for the appointment, charges for visit, date and time of the visit, and other appointment information.

Results

No-shows and cancellations represented 31.1% of scheduled appointments and 32.2% of scheduled time. Rates of failed appointments varied by type of provider, patient demographics, and patient status (new versus established). Walk-in patients replaced 61.0% of failed appointments but only 42.4% of the time blocked for those appointments. Walk-in visits generated 89.5% of the charges associated with scheduled visits. Over the course of a year, total revenue shortfalls could range from 3% to 14% of total clinic income.

Conclusions

Failed appointments pose financial as well as administrative problems for residency practices. Proactive reminder systems are needed to promote patient attendance.

### Canceled total joint arthroplasty: who, what, when, and why? [^115gy17A]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Unexpected cancelation of scheduled total joint arthroplasty (TJA) procedures creates patient distress and disruption for the clinical team. The purpose of this study is to identify the etiology and fate of cancelations for scheduled TJAs.

Methods

A consecutive series of 11,670 patients at a single institution from 2013 to 2017 was reviewed in March 2020. All patients who were scheduled for a primary total hip arthroplasty or total knee arthroplasty and subsequently canceled were identified. The etiology of cancelation and time to rescheduling were recorded.

Results

Of the 505 (4.3%) canceled patients, 209 (42%) were due to medical reasons. Three hundred ninety-one patients (77%) eventually underwent their procedure at a mean delay of 165 days (19–1908). Only 53 (25%) patients canceled for a medical reason underwent further diagnostic or therapeutic intervention for their medical condition. When compared to patient-driven cancelations, those canceled for medical reasons had a higher mean Charlson Comorbidity Index (0.82 vs 0.39, P < .001), were canceled closer to the scheduled surgery date (8.55 vs 18.1 days, P < .001), and were more likely to eventually undergo surgery (86% vs 73%, P = 0.004).

Conclusion

Canceled elective TJA surgeries are most often due to a medical concern, however only a minority of these patients undergo intervention for that medical condition. To minimize the risk of cancelation, healthcare providers may consider early referral of medically complex patients to the patient's primary care physician. After cancelation, patients should have a clearly defined path to return to the operative schedule to prevent further delays.

### Using nudges to reduce missed appointments in primary care and mental health: a pragmatic trial [^114cEyK8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Main Measures

We used the VA Corporate Data Warehouse to identify eligible appointments and coded as completed, canceled (by patient), or missed ("no-show"). Appointments that could not be classified due to incomplete data were excluded (0.05%). The primary outcome was whether a patient missed an appointment. In accordance with VA policy, an appointment was considered missed if marked by clinic staff as a "no-show" or if canceled by the patient or clinic after the appointment time. The missed appointment rate equals the number of missed appointments divided by the number of completed and missed appointments. Our secondary outcome was whether a patient canceled their appointment. As clinics sometimes cancel appointments for administrative reasons and the focus of our trial was patient behavior, we examined only appointments canceled by patients with a timestamp prior to the scheduled appointment time and calculated a cancelation rate accordingly. The canceled appointment rate equals the number of canceled appointments divided by the number of completed, canceled, and missed appointments.

### Paediatric primary care in Germany during the early COVID-19 pandemic: the calm before the storm [^112AqMkE]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

All practices reported that parents had cancelled scheduled appointments due to the pandemic. 50% of practices said that they had cancelled and rescheduled patient appointments, either of their own initiative (82%) or following external regulations (18%). 64% of the practices that had cancelled appointments and 50% of the ones that had not cancelled appointments used telephone appointments as an alternative.

The majority of surveyed primary care providers reported that in their practice, patients were neither treated worse nor better during the pandemic (64% reported no patients were treated worse, 82% reported none were treated better). During the semistructured interviews, five out of eight interviewees reported that they observed that some patient groups generally received worse care during the pandemic. Table 1 lists patient groups that were named during the interviews.

Table 1
Patient groups identified to be perceived as receiving better or worse care during the COVID-19 pandemic and respective reasons

The patient group most often named for receiving worse care was children in need of developmental and psychosocial support. In Germany, this group is cared for by social-paediatric centres that are commonly located at paediatric hospitals. Some interviewees highlighted that families with children with behavioural problems may be less likely to attend appointments anyway and may have been persuaded to miss appointments following public messages not to visit healthcare facilities if avoidable. However, there was broad agreement that appointments that were suspended from the side of care providers were a major problem (see box 1A for illustrative statements).

### The association between family medicine appointment cancellations and hospital utilization in 2019 and 2020 [^1148uBE3]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic caused a disruption in the usual primary care services offered and received by patients. The objective of this study was to compare the impact of family medicine appointment cancellations on hospital utilization metrics both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic within a family medicine residency clinic.

Methods

This study is a retrospective chart review of cohorts of patients with a family medicine clinic cancellation who presented to the emergency department during a similar time period before and during the pandemic (March-May of 2019 vs March-May 2020). The patient population studied has multiple chronic diagnoses and prescriptions. Hospital admission, hospital readmission, and length of stay for hospitalizations during these periods were compared. The impacts of appointment cancellations on the emergency department presentation with subsequent inpatient admission, readmission, and length of stay were examined using generalized estimating equation (GEE) logistic or Poisson regression models to account for the lack of independence between patient outcomes.

Results

A total of 1878 patients were included in the final cohorts. Of these patients, 101 (5.7%) presented to the emergency department and/or hospital in both 2019 and 2020. An increased odds of readmission was associated with family medicine appointment cancellation regardless of year. The effects of appointment cancellations were not associated with admissions or length of stay between 2019 and 2020.

Conclusion

Between the 2019 and 2020 cohorts, appointment cancellations were not associated with significant differences in likelihood of admission, readmission, or length of stay. A higher risk of readmission was associated with patients with a recent family medicine appointment cancellation.

### Early impact of VA MISSION act implementation on primary care appointment wait time [^111onGsA]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This study has some limitations. First, to isolate the impact of CCNs from other VA appointment–making processes that may contribute to wait times, we explored wait time as the difference between the date an appointment was scheduled and when it took place (Steps 4 through 5, Appendix 1). However, appointment scheduled dates were missing during certain periods of our study. Therefore, our measure of wait time includes both wait time attributable to CCN and other VA appointment–making factors, and does not include cancelled appointments. Although cancellations account for a small percentage of VA appointments (2.3%), once data are available, future research should explore the impact of CCNs on cancelled appointments. In addition, we did not have information on appointment desired dates, and as such, were unable to determine whether wait times were planned. By employing a DID approach, however, unless CCN and comparison appointments were systematically different in their scheduled or desired dates, potential bias should be minimal. Lastly, there were 5 months of post-CCN data before the COVID-19 pandemic began disrupting care. Therefore, we were unable to assess the longer-range impact of CCNs on wait times. After the pandemic subsides, it will be important to monitor community care wait times and the impact of additional experience with CCNs and new network adequacy standards.

### Primary care physicians' experiences with and strategies for managing electronic messages [^116FHGEF]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Regulating the Pace of Replies to Patients

Physicians described varying approaches to timing their replies to patient messages. A few felt that responding quickly averted additional work: "It saves time in the long run to answer an email right away, because if you don't they will call in. And if you don't answer that, they will schedule an appointment. The work's not gonna go away. So the sooner you do it, the sooner it gets done".

However, other participants reported regulating the pace of their replies to patients, to slow down communication cycles. One observed, "When you hear the feedback from patients, when they say, 'Wow, that was a fast response, thank you so much', you kind of think, 'You're doing a great service, but at the same time, are you setting up an unrealistic expectation?'"

Theme 4: Group-Level Strategies for Inbox Management

Panel Management Time

Some local practice groups earmarked dedicated workday time for inbox management and other panel management activities. The PCPs consistently described having this type of panel management time as desirable.

Coverage Systems

Most chiefs reported their facilities had developed a systematic approach to covering inboxes for physicians out of office for vacations, sick days, or other unplanned leaves, or scheduled days off when working part-time. All these inbox coverage systems covered vacation days; some also covered sick or unscheduled days off. These systems usually did not cover inboxes for part-time physicians on their days off.

The simplest coverage strategy was a buddy system in which physicians in a clinic module (typically a group of 5–15) who were working on a given day provided inbox coverage for out-of-office physicians. However, buddy systems could sometimes result in disproportionate burden. One physician described high stress from being the sole person covering the inbox of a partner who went on extended leave for several weeks.

More sophisticated inbox coverage systems were feasible at the level of medical centers, which could include more than 100 PCPs. Some chiefs reported creating a rotating physician role (which some termed the "inbasket ninja") to cover the inboxes of all physicians on vacation and/or sick days.

### The electronic health record inbox: recommendations for relief [^112W9vkA]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The inbox has become unbearable. A challenge before the pandemic, the electronic health record (EHR) inbox has become Sisyphean — an involuntary, never-ending, after-hours second job for physicians, contributing to burnoutand which may lead some physicians to reduce clinical work or leave medicine altogether (a particularly urgent issue given the predicted shortages of physicians which has been exacerbated by the pandemic). In this commentary, we identify the scope and origins of this new workstream, make recommendations to reduce the volume of low-value inbox messages, and suggest practice models and payment modifications to better manage those elements of inbox care that serve the patient.

While some administrative paperwork has long been an unwritten part of the social contract between physicians and regulators, payors and commercial vendors, the advent of the electronic inbox and its direct access to the physician, often unfiltered by staff, has enabled volume to grow dramatically and insidiously. Contributions to the growth in inbox volume arise from multiple sources, including:
Federal regulators: The Department of Health and Human Services' requirement for the immediate release of test results, without consideration for implications at the point of care, doubled patient portal inquiries regarding potentially sensitive results.
Public and commercial payors: Co-pays for in-person visits (and not for care provided via the patient portal) incentivizes patient use of the portal while requirements for prior authorizations, durable medical equipment renewal signatures, and other gate-keeper functions create work without commensurate compensation.
Delivery organizations: With implementation of EHRs, work previously performed by receptionists, transcriptionists, and others has been transferred to physicians, whose time can appear "free". Clinical workflows that deploy the physician as the inbox triage agent result in physicians responding to clerical and lower-level clinical inquiries, such as requests for appointment scheduling or dates of last immunization.
Commercial pharmacies: Perhaps less recognized are the contributions of automation by for-profit pharmacy chains, installed to reduce their operating costs, resulting in frequent, redundant auto-requests for prescriptions that have already been renewed.

### The impact of COVID-19 on routine medical care and cancer screening [^116bMEFN]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Routine Care: Past Cancellations

Adjusted analyses for the four cancellation/postponement variables are displayed by survey wave in Figure 2 (and with all survey waves combined in eTable 2 and eFigure 1). Concerning physical and mental health appointments, visits were more often cancelled or postponed for women and those in the highest tercile of income in the first survey wave, but in later waves, gender and income were less strongly related to cancellations. Race/ethnicity was not significantly related to cancellation in most survey waves. In early survey waves, appointments were more likely to be cancelled/postponed by or for respondents 65 years and older than people under 30, but cancellation/postponement was significantly less likely for this group in October and December. Compared to people with a high school education or less, college graduates were more likely to experience appointments cancelled/postponed. This was also the case for respondents who believed that they or someone in their household had COVID-19 and those with higher perceived risk of COVID-19. By December, only a very high level of perceived risk of COVID-19 was associated with cancelled/postponed appointments. Each medical condition was associated with 1.19 odds of cancelling/postponing an appointment (95% CI 1.16–1.22), and this association was consistent across survey waves. Higher levels of anxiety and symptoms of depression were associated with cancelled/postponed appointments, particularly during December. Low tolerance of uncertainty was associated with cancelled appointments during survey waves 3 and 4. Appointment cancellation/postponement was more common for respondents reporting avoidance-oriented coping and also for those with more approach-oriented coping strategies (Fig. 2).

Patient Factors Associated with Missed Visits

In the pre-COVID-19 time period, black race was associated with the highest frequency of missed appointments compared to other patient characteristics (26.0% of black patients had at least one missed appointment). However, during the COVID-19 time period, Asian patients had highest percentage of missed appointments (51.3% of Asian patients had at least one missed appointment). Among patients with reported race/ethnicity, Hispanic patients had the lowest frequency of missed appointments in both pre-COVID-19 (16.3%) and COVID-19 (34.8%) time periods. Asian, married, and Medicare-insured patients had the greatest increase in missed appointments between pre-COVID-19 to COVID-19 periods, as did patients who had lower-urgency ophthalmic comorbidities (eg, cataract, dry AMD, mild glaucoma or diabetic retinopathy). During the pre-COVID-19 period, different age groups had similar missed visit frequencies (12.92–23.65%); however, during COVID-19, the missed frequency varied dramatically between < 50-year-old patients (24.63%) and 85+ patients (54.3%) (Table 1).

### The effectiveness of outpatient appointment reminder systems in reducing no-show rates [^115WJTsh]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Patients who do not keep physician appointments (no-shows) represent a significant loss to healthcare providers. For patients, the cost includes their dissatisfaction and reduced quality of care. An automated telephone appointment reminder system may decrease the no-show rate. Understanding characteristics of patients who miss their appointments will aid in the formulation of interventions to reduce no-show rates.

Methods

In an academic outpatient practice, we studied patient acceptance and no-show rates among patients receiving a clinic staff reminder (STAFF), an automated appointment reminder (AUTO), and no reminder (NONE). Patients scheduled for appointments in the spring of 2007 were assigned randomly to 1 of 3 groups: STAFF (n = 3266), AUTO (n = 3219), or NONE (n = 3350). Patients in the STAFF group were called 3 days in advance by front desk personnel. Patients in the AUTO group were reminded of their appointments 3 days in advance by an automated, standardized message. To evaluate patient satisfaction with the STAFF and AUTO, we surveyed patients who arrived at the clinic (n = 10,546).

Results

The no-show rates for patients in the STAFF, AUTO, and NONE groups were 13.6%, 17.3%, and 23.1%, respectively (pairwise, P < .01 by analysis of variance for all comparisons). Cancellation rates in the AUTO and STAFF groups were significantly higher than in the NONE group (P < .004). Appointment reminder group, age, visit type, wait time, division specialty, and insurance type were significant predictors of no-show rates. Patients found appointment reminders helpful, but they could not accurately remember whether they received a clinic staff reminder or an automated appointment reminder.

Conclusions

A clinic staff reminder was significantly more effective in lowering the no-show rate compared with an automated appointment reminder system.

### Test cancellation: a college of American pathologists Q-probes study [^116VTWQ9]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Requests for laboratory testing are canceled after a specimen has already been collected from the patient for many reasons. Regardless of the cause, test cancellation represents a significant resource expenditure for laboratories, and many cancellation events impact patient care by delaying the reporting of test results.

Objective

To survey a wide variety of hospitals to determine the rate, causes, and circumstances surrounding laboratory test cancellation events.

Design

Institutions (N = 52) prospectively monitored their test cancellation events during a 6-week period or until 75 cancellation events occurred. Information regarding the test cancellation was recorded, including the primary reason for canceling the test. The rate of test cancellation was calculated based on laboratory specimen volume. Laboratory policies relevant to test cancellation were also surveyed.

Results

A total of 3471 canceled tests were recorded by participating laboratories of 1,118,845 specimens they accessioned, resulting in an aggregate test cancellation rate of 3.1 per 1000 accessions. The most frequently reported reason for test cancellation occurred in the preanalytical phase, and was a duplicate test request, followed by specimen quality reasons including hemolyzed/clotted specimens and insufficient sample quantity for testing. Very few cancellations occurred during the analytical phase of testing. Lower test cancellation rates were reported by larger institutions and by laboratories that received fewer specimens from inpatients.

Conclusions

Cancellation of patient tests after a specimen had been collected and received remains a significant issue for clinical laboratories. Laboratories should monitor causes of test cancellation to identify targets for process improvement efforts and to improve laboratory utilization. Cancellation events due to incomplete identification or poor specimen quality potentially delay patient care. Cancellations due to duplicate orders or excessive frequency of testing represent operational challenges for the laboratory and inefficiency in the health care system. Policies related to test cancellation should be clearly specified and communicated to users of laboratory services.

### Patient and visit characteristics associated with use of direct scheduling in primary care practices [^114ckbuD]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. It examines a single academic medical center, albeit a large center with 17 primary care sites covering more than 65 000 patients. We required study participants to be enrolled in the patient portal, since this is a prerequisite to using the direct scheduling application. Of note, internal, operational data show that 50% of primary care patients across the larger health system were active portal users as of December 2019 and that these users were more often women, English-speaking, and White compared with nonusers (Sarah Wilkie, MS [Mass General Brigham], email, January 6, 2020; eTable 3 in the Supplement). There was heterogeneity among practices, but we accounted for this using practice fixed effects. Additionally, any interpretation of statistical significance should be cautious of false-positive results due to multiple testing.

### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to and utilisation of services for sexual and reproductive health: a scoping review [^111UwaBb]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Contraception services

Nearly one-third of studies (24, 30%) provided evidence of a decrease in access or utilisation of contraceptive services, evenly distributed across various contexts and populations. Utilisation of short-acting reversible contraception (SARC) was analysed by four studies in total, all of which provided evidence of reduced utilisation. Of these studies, two conducted in sub-Saharan Africa showed mixed results with an increase in SARC utilisation in some clinical contexts. Nonetheless, a large majority of included studies showed a decline in access to and utilisation of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC). Included studies found substantial declines in the administration of injectables and placement of LARCs, a reduction in tubal ligation procedures, challenges with scheduling LARC removaland reduced provision of emergency contraception.

Many studies referenced access to contraceptive services more broadly — not specified by LARC/SARC — and 15 reported decreases in family planning attendance, appointment availability and declines in unspecified contraceptive method utilisation. For instance, Belay et al. noted a 27% reduction in clinic visits for contraception and a 67% reduction in postpartum visits in one tertiary hospital in Ethiopia, while 55% of clinics surveyed in a study in the USA had to cancel or postpone contraceptive visits due to the pandemic. More generally, among a survey of SRH clinicians and stakeholders in 29 countries, 86% perceived that access to contraceptive services was less or much less because of the pandemic. Only one study showed a slight increase in overall contraceptive utilisation in sub-Saharan Africa.
