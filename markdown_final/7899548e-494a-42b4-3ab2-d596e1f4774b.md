## Question

How to treat a fib in the hospital

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat atrial fibrillation in the hospital. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and hemodynamic assessment. Then, I should verify the duration of atrial fibrillation and its implications for thromboembolic risk and cardioversion strategy. Next, I will consider rate versus rhythm control, including pharmacologic and electrical options, and the anticoagulation plan around cardioversion. After that, I need to address special populations such as postoperative and critically ill patients. Finally, I should confirm discharge planning, follow-up, and quality metrics, and I will double-check any areas where my initial assumptions might be off before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities: assess hemodynamic stability, identify and treat reversible triggers, and determine symptom burden and comorbidities that will shape rate versus rhythm control decisions, because these steps anchor safe, guideline-concordant care in the acute setting [^98cd2f84] [^bc86f5ce].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about cardioversion. I need to check the duration of atrial fibrillation because if AF is clearly less than 48 hours, immediate cardioversion without prolonged anticoagulation is generally acceptable, whereas if it is 48 hours or longer, or unknown, I should either provide 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation or obtain imaging to exclude left atrial appendage thrombus before elective cardioversion, and then continue anticoagulation for 4 weeks afterward due to transient atrial mechanical stunning and elevated early thromboembolic risk [^026d338c] [^229585dc] [^1770059f].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging nuance. I initially thought pre-cardioversion imaging is only needed when AF is 48 hours or more, but I should correct that: in patients with AF duration less than 48 hours who are not anticoagulated and have elevated thromboembolic risk (CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2), pre-cardioversion imaging to exclude thrombus is reasonable, so I need to integrate both duration and risk rather than rely on duration alone [^72c3aa62].

> Next, I should review rate control options and targets. For acute rate control, intravenous beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are first-line in most patients, with digoxin considered when beta-blockers are contraindicated or in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and I should target a resting heart rate under 100 bpm in the acute phase while reassessing symptoms and hemodynamics, aligning with contemporary guidance to individualize rate targets and agent selection [^db7e2f85] [^59110392].

> I will now examine rhythm control indications. Rhythm control is appropriate when symptoms persist despite adequate rate control, when AF is contributing to acute decompensation such as heart failure or ischemia, or when early rhythm control may improve outcomes in recently diagnosed AF, and in hemodynamically unstable patients, immediate synchronized electrical cardioversion is indicated regardless of duration, with pharmacologic cardioversion considered in stable patients using agents matched to LV function and monitored for proarrhythmia [^1ee47072] [^1770059f] [^398ff827].

> Let me think about anticoagulation around cardioversion. I should confirm that for elective cardioversion with AF ≥ 48 hours or unknown duration, either 3 weeks of uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation or pre-procedural imaging to exclude thrombus is required, followed by 4 weeks of anticoagulation after cardioversion, and for urgent cardioversion in unstable patients, heparin should be given immediately if not already anticoagulated, with subsequent oral anticoagulation tailored to stroke risk and bleeding risk using CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED [^026d338c] [^229585dc] [^1770059f].

> But wait, what if the patient is postoperative or critically ill. I should double-check that postoperative AF after cardiac surgery warrants rate and/or rhythm control based on symptoms and hemodynamics, with rhythm assessment at 30–60 days and consideration of cardioversion if AF persists after adequate anticoagulation, and in noncardiac postoperative or critical illness settings, I need to aggressively treat precipitating factors like sepsis, anemia, hypoxia, and pain while managing rate and considering anticoagulation within a shared decision framework given uncertain benefit in some critically ill cohorts [^62d34c8a] [^bf9f8afb] [^5225257f] [^e453d0b3].

> Next, I should review discharge planning and follow-up. I need to ensure anticoagulation is continued or initiated when indicated, arrange close outpatient follow-up within 7–14 days, and provide education on symptom monitoring, medication adherence, and lifestyle modification, because structured, multidisciplinary follow-up and AF-specific programs reduce cardiovascular hospitalizations and may improve survival, and I should also consider rhythm monitoring to detect recurrence given the high risk of AF recurrence after acute episodes [^2a0a674f] [^815d40f6] [^bc86f5ce].

> Hold on, I should verify quality metrics and system-level care. Inpatients with AF and LVEF ≤ 40% should be discharged on a beta-blocker when not contraindicated, warfarin patients need a scheduled INR follow-up plan, and institutions benefit from AF care pathways and registry participation to close evidence-to-practice gaps in anticoagulation, rate/rhythm control, and follow-up, which consistently improves adherence and outcomes [^6e35474d] [^2d7b8823] [^fcab5f99].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency: stabilize and treat triggers, determine duration and thromboembolic risk, choose rate versus rhythm control based on symptoms and comorbidities, execute cardioversion safely with appropriate anticoagulation, tailor management for special populations like postoperative or critically ill patients, and implement structured discharge and follow-up with quality metrics, aligning with ACC/AHA/ACCP and ESC guidance and the AHA scientific statement on acute AF [^98cd2f84] [^db7e2f85] [^bc86f5ce].

---

In-hospital atrial fibrillation management centers on **three priorities**: stabilize hemodynamics, control rate or rhythm, and prevent thromboembolism [^bc86f5ce]. Immediate synchronized cardioversion is indicated for **hemodynamic instability** [^1770059f]; for stable patients, use IV beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers for rate control [^db7e2f85], and consider amiodarone or electrical cardioversion for rhythm control [^398ff827]. Anticoagulate based on CHA2DS2-VASc, and if AF is ≥ 48 hours or duration is unknown, provide 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation or perform TEE before cardioversion [^026d338c] [^229585dc]. Address reversible triggers, monitor closely, and coordinate discharge planning with outpatient follow-up and rhythm surveillance [^98cd2f84].

---

## Initial assessment and stabilization

- **Hemodynamic assessment**: Immediately assess for instability (hypotension, ischemia, heart failure, altered mentation) [^1770059f].

- **Immediate cardioversion**: Perform synchronized electrical cardioversion for unstable patients, regardless of anticoagulation status [^1770059f].

- **Stable patients**: Evaluate symptom burden, comorbidities, and AF duration to guide rate vs rhythm control and anticoagulation [^576f5b3e].

---

## Rate control strategy

Rate control is **first-line for most stable patients**, targeting a resting heart rate < 100 bpm [^db7e2f85].

| **Medication** | **Indication** | **Dose** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Beta-blockers (metoprolol, esmolol) | First-line | Metoprolol 2.5–5 mg IV q5min; esmolol 50–200 mcg/kg/min | Avoid in decompensated HF |
| Calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) | First-line | Diltiazem 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus, then 5–15 mg/hr; verapamil 0.075–0.15 mg/kg IV | Avoid in decompensated HF |
| Digoxin | Second-line, HF, or sedated patients | 0.25 mg IV q4–6h (max 1.5 mg) | Slow onset, less effective in hyperadrenergic states |
| Amiodarone | Refractory cases or HFrEF | 150 mg IV over 10 min, then 1 mg/min for 6 h, then 0.5 mg/min | Monitor for hypotension, bradycardia, hepatotoxicity |

---

## Rhythm control strategy

Consider rhythm control for **persistent symptoms despite rate control**, decompensated HF, ischemia, or young/active patients [^1ee47072].

- **Pharmacological cardioversion**: Amiodarone or ibutilide for stable patients; consider flecainide or propafenone if no structural heart disease [^398ff827].

- **Electrical cardioversion**: Preferred for unstable patients or when drugs fail; use sedation/anesthesia and pads/paddles [^1770059f].

- **Anticoagulation for cardioversion**: If AF ≥ 48 hours or unknown, give 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation or perform TEE before cardioversion; continue anticoagulation for 4 weeks after [^026d338c] [^229585dc].

---

## Anticoagulation management

Anticoagulation is guided by **CHA2DS2-VASc** [^notfound]; use DOACs or warfarin based on renal function, bleeding risk, and interactions [^notfound]. For peri-cardioversion, provide 3 weeks of anticoagulation or TEE before cardioversion if AF is ≥ 48 hours or unknown, and continue for 4 weeks after [^026d338c] [^229585dc]. In critically ill patients, evidence for acute anticoagulation is limited; individualize decisions and monitor closely [^e453d0b3].

---

## Special considerations

- **Postoperative AF**: Common after cardiac surgery; use rate/rhythm control and anticoagulation per risk [^62d34c8a].

- **Critical illness**: AF is common; prioritize correcting reversible causes and use rate control first-line [^0fdb97c6].

- **Elderly/frailty**: Tailor therapy, balance bleeding/stroke risks, and consider geriatric input [^0fbc354c].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Continuous telemetry is used initially, then stepped down as stability improves. Discharge planning should ensure anticoagulation, rate/rhythm control, and follow-up; arrange **early cardiology follow-up** and rhythm surveillance given high recurrence risk [^bc86f5ce]. Educate patients on symptoms, medication adherence, and when to seek care [^cb633602].

---

## Quality metrics and outcomes

Quality metrics include anticoagulation use in eligible patients, rate control in HFrEF, and INR monitoring for warfarin [^6e35474d] [^2d7b8823]. Outcomes of interest are stroke, bleeding, hospitalization, and quality of life [^60fa37b1].

---

In-hospital AF care requires a **structured approach**: stabilize, control rate or rhythm, anticoagulate appropriately, address triggers, and ensure close follow-up to reduce recurrence and complications [^98cd2f84].

### Atrial fibrillation occurring during acute hospitalization: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^bc86f5ce]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute atrial fibrillation is defined as atrial fibrillation detected in the setting of acute care or acute illness; atrial fibrillation may be detected or managed for the first time during acute hospitalization for another condition. Atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery is a distinct type of acute atrial fibrillation. Acute atrial fibrillation is associated with high risk of long-term atrial fibrillation recurrence, warranting clinical attention during acute hospitalization and over long-term follow-up. A framework of substrates and triggers can be useful for evaluating and managing acute atrial fibrillation. Acute management requires a multipronged approach with interdisciplinary care collaboration, tailoring treatments to the patient's underlying substrate and acute condition. Key components of acute management include identification and treatment of triggers, selection and implementation of rate/rhythm control, and management of anticoagulation. Acute rate or rhythm control strategy should be individualized with consideration of the patient's capacity to tolerate rapid rates or atrioventricular dyssynchrony, and the patient's ability to tolerate the risk of the therapeutic strategy. Given the high risks of atrial fibrillation recurrence in patients with acute atrial fibrillation, clinical follow-up and heart rhythm monitoring are warranted. Long-term management is guided by patient substrate, with implications for intensity of heart rhythm monitoring, anticoagulation, and considerations for rhythm management strategies. Overall management of acute atrial fibrillation addresses substrates and triggers. The 3As of acute management are acute triggers, atrial fibrillation rate/rhythm management, and anticoagulation. The 2As and 2Ms of long-term management include monitoring of heart rhythm and modification of lifestyle and risk factors, in addition to considerations for atrial fibrillation rate/rhythm management and anticoagulation. Several gaps in knowledge related to acute atrial fibrillation exist and warrant future research.

### Management of atrial fibrillation in the emergency department [^3758743c]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Although atrial fibrillation remains the most common cardiac arrhythmia, the treatment and disposition remain varied. An accept-able standard of practice requires an evidence-based approach. This approach has revealed that half of the patients who present with acute atrial fibrillation will convert to sinus rhythm without intervention. In the hemodynamically stable subset, ascertaining the on-set of atrial fibrillation within 48 hours is critical because this period dictates when and if anticoagulation should be instituted and if and where electrical or chemical cardioversion needs be performed. The hemodynamically unstable patient, however, requires emergent cardioversion, irrespective of the chronicity of atrial fibrillation. An evidence-based approach may serve to optimize treatment and obviate the need for unnecessary hospital admissions.

### Concise review of atrial fibrillation: treatment update considerations in light of AFFIRM and RACE [^bff07d32]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinically significant arrhythmia seen by clinicians. Prevalence is as high as 9.0% in patients aged ≥ 80 years, and incidence is projected to be more than 5.6 million patients in the U.S. by 2050. Recently, new trials have challenged the traditional belief that rhythm control is inherently superior to rate control in these patients. This article reviews the basic tenets of treatment for AF and discusses how new trial data integrate into these protocols. A concise treatment algorithm is provided and new and upcoming more aggressive interventional treatment options are discussed. This review is designed to help the general practitioner decide how to treat patients in the outpatient setting, evaluate which patients should be hospitalized for management, and which patients should be referred to a cardiologist.

Aim

The "2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation" provides recommendations to guide clinicians in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from May 12, 2022, to November 3, 2022, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline. Additional relevant studies, published through November 2022, during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee and added to the evidence tables, where appropriate.

Structure

Atrial fibrillation is the most sustained common arrhythmia, and its incidence and prevalence are increasing in the United States and globally. Recommendations from the "2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation" and the "2019 AHA/ACC/HRS Focused Update of the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation" have been updated with new evidence to guide clinicians. In addition, new recommendations addressing atrial fibrillation and thromboembolic risk assessment, anticoagulation, left atrial appendage occlusion, atrial fibrillation catheter or surgical ablation, and risk factor modification and atrial fibrillation prevention have been developed.

### The future of atrial fibrillation management: integrated care and stratified therapy [^2535a9f2]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is one of the major cardiovascular health problems: it is a common, chronic condition, affecting 2–3% of the population in Europe and the USA and requiring 1–3% of health-care expenditure as a result of stroke, sudden death, heart failure, unplanned hospital admissions, and other complications. Early diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, ideally before the first complication occurs, remains a challenge, as shown by patients who are only diagnosed with the condition when admitted to hospital for acute cardiac decompensation or stroke. Once diagnosed, atrial fibrillation requires chronic, multidimensional management in five domains (acute management, treatment of underlying and concomitant cardiovascular conditions, stroke prevention therapy, rate control, and rhythm control). The consistent provision of these treatment options to all patients with atrial fibrillation is difficult, despite recent improvements in organisation of care, knowledge about atrial fibrillation, and treatment options. Integrated care models that provide patient-centred care in, or close to, the patient's community while maintaining access to all specialist treatment options, emerge as the best approach to achieve consistent delivery of these chronic treatments to all patients with atrial fibrillation. Ongoing research efforts will establish when to initiate oral anticoagulation in patients with device-detected atrial high-rate episodes, quantify the prognostic effect of early and comprehensive rhythm control therapy, including atrial fibrillation ablation, and delineate optimum methods to reduce bleeding complications in patients treated with anticoagulation. Additionally, research efforts are needed to define different types of atrial fibrillation on the basis of the main causes of atrial fibrillation to pave the way for the clinical development of stratified atrial fibrillation therapy.

### Rationale, considerations, and goals for atrial fibrillation centers of excellence: a Heart Rhythm Society perspective [^37280f43]. Heart Rhythm (2020). High credibility.

Heart Rhythm Society atrial fibrillation centers of excellence — introduction and background emphasize that atrial fibrillation (AF) remains an important global problem and is the most common arrhythmia throughout the world. To improve care, health care organizations should move from a system of siloed outpatient and inpatient clinicians and health care facilities to a system of integrated, coordinated, and patient-centered AF centers. The goal of an AF center of excellence (CoE) is to improve outcomes by providing a better patient experience and delivering high-quality, guideline-recommended, state-of-the-art care, and there is a clear need for AF CoEs to improve AF care and its delivery. Despite evidence-based practice guidelines, underdiagnosis, inadequate treatment, and improper care variation are widely prevalent across all geographies, and the majority of patients with known AF who experience an acute ischemic stroke have not received adequate anticoagulation, leaving the public vulnerable to morbidity and mortality that could be avoided. The increased incidence and prevalence of AF also produce a significant economic burden for health care systems and for society as a whole, and HRS hopes to accelerate this evolution by reviewing the rationale for AF CoEs, the available evidence for integrated and multidisciplinary care, and future challenges and opportunities.

### Screening and management of atrial fibrillation in primary care [^a4a37476]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a common chronic disease seen in primary care offices, emergency departments, inpatient hospital services, and many subspecialty practices. Atrial fibrillation care is complicated and multifaceted, and, at various points, clinicians may see it as a consequence and cause of multi-morbidity, as a silent driver of stroke risk, as a bellwether of an acute medical illness, or as a primary rhythm disturbance that requires targeted treatment. Primary care physicians in particular must navigate these priorities, perspectives, and resources to meet the needs of individual patients. This includes judicious use of diagnostic testing, thoughtful use of novel therapeutic agents and procedures, and providing access to subspecialty expertise. This review explores the epidemiology, screening, and risk assessment of atrial fibrillation, as well as management of its symptoms (rate and various rhythm control options) and stroke risk (anticoagulation and other treatments), and offers a model for the integration of the components of atrial fibrillation care.

Atrial fibrillation during critical illness — after a prescription for OACs within 30 days of admission, over 3-year follow-up there was no significant association between anticoagulation and a lower incidence of ischemic stroke or bleeding, with reported values ischemic stroke (OR, 1.98 [95% CI, 0.29–13.47]) and bleeding (OR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.29–3.21]). Gaps in knowledge exist and further research is needed to understand the benefits and risks of acute and long-term anticoagulation in critically ill patients with acute atrial fibrillation.

### Care for atrial fibrillation and outcomes in rural versus urban communities in the United States: a systematic and narrative review [^57ce842b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Differences have been identified between medical care delivered in urban and rural settings, and rurality‐based disparities may exist in AF care. We performed a systematic review investigating the effect of rurality on AF care and outcomes in the United States. PubMed was queried for entries on AF and rurality: ("atrial fibrillation" OR "atrial flutter") AND ("rural" OR "urban" OR "rurality" OR "metro" OR "metropolitan") AND ("united states" OR "US" OR "U.S".) published up to September 24, 2023. Anticoagulation, rhythm control, settings of care, outcomes, and all‐cause mortality were reviewed in relevant studies. The search identified 395 total articles. After screening, 14 relevant articles were included in the review. These studies ranged from 1993 to 2020 and analyzed approximately 41.7 million AF patient encounters. The use of catheter ablation for AF per electrophysiologist was similar across the rural–urban spectrum. Patients with AF and rural residence were less likely to receive a direct oral anticoagulant and more likely to remain on warfarin (relative risk, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.88–0.92]). Patients in rural communities were less likely to receive non‐emergent AF care (odds ratio [OR], 0.96 [95% CI, 0.93–0.98]). In‐hospital mortality for patients with AF admitted to rural hospitals was higher than urban hospitals (OR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.01–1.39)]. Measurable differences exist in both treatments and outcomes of patients with AF between rural and urban settings in the United States. These differences should inform future investigations and strategies to improve health in people with AF.

### Case studies with the experts: management decisions in atrial fibrillation [^440d93a3]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2008). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common outpatient arrhythmia. The recent ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines outline a variety of approaches to the management of AF, but their implementation into clinical practice requires multi-faceted patient evaluations and assessments for optimizing patient care. Using a case-based approach, issues such as rate versus rhythm control, anticoagulation, cardioversion, pharmacological and catheter ablation for maintenance of sinus rhythm, and the pathophysiology of AF are discussed. These data were originally presented at a satellite symposium titled Case Studies with the Experts: Management Decisions in AF, held on May 10, 2007, during the annual Heart Rhythm Society meeting.

### Viewpoint: stroke prevention in recent guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation: an appraisal [^586bef0c]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Formal guidelines play an important role in disseminating the best available evidence knowledge and are expected to provide simple and practical recommendations for the most optimal management of patients with various conditions. Such guidelines have important implications for many disease states, which thereby could be more professionally managed in everyday clinical practice by clinicians with divergent educational backgrounds, and also more easily implemented in wards or outpatient clinics, eliminating inequalities in health care management. In this brief Viewpoint we provide an appraisal on the recommendations pertinent to the prevention of atrial fibrillation-related stroke or systemic thromboembolism, as provided in recently published guidelines for the management of this arrhythmia.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Out-of-hospital initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs in atrial fibrillation — A frequent issue is whether to initiate therapy in hospital or on an outpatient basis, with concern for serious adverse effects including torsades de pointes; virtually all pharmacological cardioversion studies (except those with low-dose oral amiodarone) have involved hospitalized patients, but one study provided a clinically useful approach with out-of-hospital patient-controlled conversion using class IC drugs. The pill-in-the-pocket strategy consists of self-administration of a single oral dose shortly after the onset of symptomatic AF to improve quality of life, decrease hospital admission, and reduce cost. Recommendations differ for paroxysmal versus persistent AF: for paroxysmal AF the aims are to terminate an episode or prevent recurrence, whereas for persistent AF the aims are to achieve pharmacological cardioversion, obviate direct-current cardioversion, or enhance its success by lowering the defibrillation threshold and prevent early recurrence. In patients with lone AF without structural heart disease, class IC drugs may be initiated on an outpatient basis, and for other selected patients without sinus or AV node dysfunction, bundle-branch block, QT-interval prolongation, the Brugada syndrome, or structural heart disease, pill-in-the-pocket administration of propafenone and flecainide outside the hospital becomes an option once treatment has proved safe in hospital.

Atrial fibrillation (AF)-related hospitalization has risen over the last 2 decades and is the most influential determinant of total disease-related expenditure. In this review article, we describe several identified drivers of hospitalization from several registries and large-scale clinical trials, including key cardiovascular and non-traditional risk factors. We also discuss available assessment tools for discerning overall risk of hospitalization, including AF symptom scores, thrombosis and bleeding disposition, and non-invasive cardiac structural assessment. Finally, we highlight the different treatment paradigms that have been proven to reduce AF burden, progression, and hospitalization in the literature.

### Care for atrial fibrillation and outcomes in rural versus urban communities in the United States: a systematic and narrative review [^bb5cda32]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Differences have been identified between medical care delivered in urban and rural settings, and rurality-based disparities may exist in AF care. We performed a systematic review investigating the effect of rurality on AF care and outcomes in the United States. PubMed was queried for entries on AF and rurality: ("atrial fibrillation" OR "atrial flutter") AND ("rural" OR "urban" OR "rurality" OR "metro" OR "metropolitan") AND ("united states" OR "US" OR "U.S".) published up to September 24, 2023. Anticoagulation, rhythm control, settings of care, outcomes, and all-cause mortality were reviewed in relevant studies. The search identified 395 total articles. After screening, 14 relevant articles were included in the review. These studies ranged from 1993 to 2020 and analyzed approximately 41.7million AF patient encounters. The use of catheter ablation for AF per electrophysiologist was similar across the rural-urban spectrum. Patients with AF and rural residence were less likely to receive a direct oral anticoagulant and more likely to remain on warfarin (relative risk, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.88–0.92]). Patients in rural communities were less likely to receive non-emergent AF care (odds ratio [OR], 0.96 [95% CI, 0.93–0.98]). In-hospital mortality for patients with AF admitted to rural hospitals was higher than urban hospitals (OR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.01–1.39)]. Measurable differences exist in both treatments and outcomes of patients with AF between rural and urban settings in the United States. These differences should inform future investigations and strategies to improve health in people with AF.

Introduction

Hospital admissions are responsible for almost 75% of the $6.65 billion spent on the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) in the United States each year. 1, 2, 3 The rate of AF‐related hospitalization events in the United States has increased over the past 10 years and currently exceeds 450 000 per year. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 Approximately 70% of the patients who are hospitalized for AF are admitted through the emergency department (ED). 3, 4, 7

Multiple data sources suggest increased ED utilization related to AF. Analysis of the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample revealed an increase in AF‐related ED visits in the United States of more than 30% from 2007 to 2014. 8, 9 Registry data have also revealed that patients in the United States who present to the ED with AF are admitted to inpatient units more than 60% of the time. 7, 8, 9, 10 The progressive increase in AF‐related ED visits and hospital admissions emphasizes the need for more‐efficient strategies for managing AF.

Atrial fibrillation integrated multidisciplinary care — evidence and team composition: International AF guidelines recommend a multidisciplinary team approach to address patient education regarding general AF knowledge, symptom management, aggressive treatment of modifiable risk factors, stroke prevention, patient-centered decision-making, and improved adherence to treatment guidelines. Use of a multidisciplinary team-based approach with atrial fibrillation (AF) patients has been associated with improved outcomes such as a 49% reduction in all-cause mortality, 42% reduction in cardiovascular hospitalizations, 50%–82% reduction in emergency department visits, significantly shorter wait times to see an electrophysiologist, more cost-effective care, and fewer readmissions and shorter length of hospital stays. Although the exact composition of the teams varied between studies, core components included an electrophysiologist, general cardiologist, sleep apnea and/or anticoagulation/stroke specialist, clinical pharmacists, and an AF nurse specialist or advanced practitioner, with other specialists invited as needed.

### Standard versus atrial fibrillation-specific management strategy (SAFETY) to reduce recurrent admission and prolong survival: pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial [^2a0a674f]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Patients are increasingly being admitted with chronic atrial fibrillation, and disease-specific management might reduce recurrent admissions and prolong survival. However, evidence is scant to support the application of this therapeutic approach. We aimed to assess SAFETY — a management strategy that is specific to atrial fibrillation.

Methods

We did a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial in patients admitted with chronic, non-valvular atrial fibrillation (but not heart failure). Patients were recruited from three tertiary referral hospitals in Australia. 335 participants were randomly assigned by computer-generated schedule (stratified for rhythm or rate control) to either standard management (n = 167) or the SAFETY intervention (n = 168). Standard management consisted of routine primary care and hospital outpatient follow-up. The SAFETY intervention comprised a home visit and Holter monitoring 7–14 days after discharge by a cardiac nurse with prolonged follow-up and multidisciplinary support as needed. Clinical reviews were undertaken at 12 and 24 months (minimum follow-up). Coprimary outcomes were death or unplanned readmission (both all-cause), measured as event-free survival and the proportion of actual versus maximum days alive and out of hospital. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. The trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTRN 12610000221055).

Findings

During median follow-up of 905 days (IQR 773–1050), 49 people died and 987 unplanned admissions were recorded (totalling 5530 days in hospital). 127 (76%) patients assigned to the SAFETY intervention died or had an unplanned readmission (median event-free survival 183 days [IQR 116–409]) and 137 (82%) people allocated standard management achieved a coprimary outcome (199 days [116–249]; hazard ratio 0·97, 95% CI 0·76–1·23; p = 0·851). Patients assigned to the SAFETY intervention had 99·5% maximum event-free days (95% CI 99·3–99·7), equating to a median of 900 (IQR 767–1025) of 937 maximum days alive and out of hospital. By comparison, those allocated to standard management had 99·2% (95% CI 98·8–99·4) maximum event-free days, equating to a median of 860 (IQR 752–1047) of 937 maximum days alive and out of hospital (effect size 0·22, 95% CI 0·21–0·23; p = 0·039).

Interpretation

A post-discharge management programme specific to atrial fibrillation was associated with proportionately more days alive and out of hospital (but not prolonged event-free survival) relative to standard management. Disease-specific management is a possible strategy to improve poor health outcomes in patients admitted with chronic atrial fibrillation.

Atrial fibrillation centers — efficiency and financial considerations note that AF is a costly public health problem with hospitalization a major cost driver, and although an integrated approach has intuitive appeal, evidence for improved outcomes remains limited; a recent meta-analysis (n = 3 studies with a total of 1338 patients) was associated with lower all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations without significant effects on AF-related hospitalizations or cerebrovascular events, and the number needed to treat in an integrated AF clinic to prevent 1 cardiovascular hospitalization and 1 death was 18 and 19, respectively, compared with a number needed to treat of 11 and 17 to prevent 1 cardiovascular hospitalization and 1 death in a heart failure clinic.

### Management of atrial fibrillation: translating clinical trial data into clinical practice [^b9c82eb5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia with significant consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality. In light of the limitations of available pharmacologic treatment options (suboptimal efficacy plus safety and tolerability issues), atrial fibrillation management should be individualized based on patient characteristics and comorbidities that could influence response to specific management approaches. The importance of adequate anticoagulation should not be overlooked. This review provides a practical guide for primary care physicians, internists, and cardiologists on current management strategies for atrial fibrillation, based on recent guidelines and current clinical data.

### Treatment timing and the effects of rhythm control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation: nationwide cohort study [^4ba61533]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of mortality and morbidity from stroke and congestive heart failure, and impaired quality of life, even for patients with optimal anticoagulation and rate control treatment. Rate control is integral to the management of atrial fibrillation, and is often sufficient to improve related symptoms. Rhythm control refers to attempts to restore and maintain sinus rhythm using antiarrhythmic drug treatment, cardioversion, and atrial fibrillation ablation together with adequate rate control. Such treatment improves symptoms and the quality of life of patients. Several randomised trials have compared rhythm control with rate control, including the landmark Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Sinus Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) trial, and shown no significant differences between these treatment strategies in their effect on mortality and stroke. It has been suggested that ablation improves outcomes in selected patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure, in comparison with antiarrhythmic drug treatment combined with rate control. One trial showed, that in comparison with a placebo, the antiarrhythmic drug dronedarone reduced the composite outcome of death from any causes or the first admission to hospital for cardiovascular events in patients with atrial fibrillation. Data on the prognostic effect of rhythm control treatment are inconclusive, with no clear indication of benefit or harm.

Recently, the Early Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention Trial (EAST-AFNET 4) showed that rhythm control treatment was associated with a lower risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes than usual care among patients who had recently (within one year) been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. It is unclear whether the results can be generalised to patients in whom rhythm control is initiated later, or to the non-trial clinical setting without the structured protocol based follow-up of randomised trials.

To investigate whether the results of a rhythm control strategy are related to the duration between atrial fibrillation diagnosis and treatment initiation, we examined the association between rhythm control and clinical outcomes in comparison with rate control, stratified by timing of treatment initiation.

### Clinical review: clinical management of atrial fibrillation-rate control versus rhythm control [^76553cb4]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in the critically ill and is associated with adverse outcomes. Although there are plausible benefits from conversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm (the so-called 'rhythm-control' strategy), recent randomized trials have failed to demonstrate the superiority of this approach over the rate-control strategy. Regardless of approach, continuous therapeutic anticoagulation is crucial for stroke prevention. This review addresses the findings of these studies and their implications for clinical management of patients with atrial fibrillation.

Atrial fibrillation — treatment algorithm for pharmacological conversion to sinus rhythm lists options by left ventricular (LV) function and setting. In patients with normal LV function, IV amiodarone or ibutilide (2a) are listed, and procainamide may be considered when amiodarone and ibutilide are not optimal; recommend avoidance of IV procainamide after amiodarone or ibutilide. For heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; LVEF ≤ 40%), IV amiodarone (2a) is listed. For AF occurring outside the hospital in patients with normal LV function ("pill‑in‑the‑pocket"), flecainide or propafenone (2a) are listed. Use is "in the absence of preexcitation", the first dose is administered in a monitored facility, and IV amiodarone requires several hours for efficacy whereas ibutilide is generally effective in 30 to 90 min but carries higher risk of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes.

### The impact of new and emerging clinical data on treatment strategies for atrial fibrillation [^e2f380d0]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

The Atrial Fibrillation (AF) Exchange Group, an international multidisciplinary group concerned with the management of AF, was convened to review recent advances in the field and the potential impact on treatment strategies.

Methods

Issues discussed included epidemiology and the impact of the rising incidence of AF on health care systems, developments in pharmacological and surgical interventions in the management of arrhythmias and thromboprophylaxis, the potential to affect treatment strategies, and barriers to implementing them.

Results

The incidence of AF and the associated burden on health care systems are increasing with aging populations, prevalence of comorbidities and more effective treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Advances in available medical treatments, in particular dronedarone and dabigatran, with other products in development, offer the possibility of changes in treatment paradigms and a greater emphasis on reducing hospitalizations and improvement in long-term outcomes instead of a symptom/safety-driven approach in which the priority is symptom suppression without provoking drug toxicity. Developments in catheter ablation techniques may mean that, in experienced centers, ablation may be offered as first-line treatment in selected patient populations. Barriers to optimal treatment include underdiagnosis, lack of recognition as a serious condition and as a risk factor for stroke, limited access to care, inadequate implementation of guidelines, and poor adherence to treatment.

Conclusions

The focus of the management of AF may be changing as a consequence of new treatments based on the outcome improvements they offer. However, the benefits will not be fully realized if guidelines and guidance are not observed in routine clinical practice.

### Acute management of atrial fibrillation: part I. rate and rhythm control [^f20a4056]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the arrhythmia most commonly encountered in family practice. Serious complications can include congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and thromboembolism. Initial treatment is directed at controlling the ventricular rate, most often with a calcium channel blocker, a beta blocker, or digoxin. Medical or electrical cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm is the next step in patients who remain in atrial fibrillation. Heparin should be administered to hospitalized patients undergoing medical or electrical cardioversion. Anticoagulation with warfarin should be used for three weeks before elective cardioversion and continued for four weeks after cardioversion. The recommendations provided in this two-part article are consistent with guidelines published by the American Heart Association and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

### Impact of a practice guideline for patients with atrial fibrillation on medical resource utilization and costs [^c5ec5738]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Health care resource utilization is high for patients presenting with acute atrial fibrillation (AF). The potential for treatment algorithms to safely reduce resource consumption in this setting has not been prospectively evaluated. We designed and implemented a practice guideline for the management of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with the primary diagnosis of AF, with emphasis on appropriate cardioversion, use of oral rate-controlling medications, and expedited referral to an outpatient AF clinic. We prospectively collected clinical and resource utilization data on all such patients for 14 months before and after institution of the guideline. Institution of the guideline was associated with a decreased rate of hospital admission (from 74% to 38%), with no differences in ED return visits or hospital readmission within 30 days. No strokes or deaths were observed. This large decrease in resource utilization during the intervention phase of the study translated to an average decrease in 30-day total direct health care costs of approximately $1,400 US dollars per patient. Our clinical and cost outcomes were minimally affected after statistical adjustment for baseline differences between study groups. We conclude that the implementation of our practice guideline was feasible, safe, and effective. Widespread adoption of such practices may have large financial implications for the health care system.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) epidemiology and subtype definitions — The term lone AF generally applies to young individuals (under 60 y of age) without clinical or echocardiographic evidence of cardiopulmonary disease, including hypertension, and these patients have a favorable prognosis with respect to thromboembolism and mortality. By convention, nonvalvular AF is restricted to cases in which the rhythm disturbance occurs in the absence of rheumatic mitral valve disease, a prosthetic heart valve, or mitral valve repair. AF is the most common arrhythmia in clinical practice, accounting for approximately one-third of hospitalizations for cardiac rhythm disturbances. It has been estimated that 2.2 million people in America and 4.5 million in the European Union have paroxysmal or persistent AF, and during the past 20 y there has been a 66% increase in hospital admissions for AF due to a combination of factors including the aging of the population, a rising prevalence of chronic heart disease, and more frequent diagnosis through use of ambulatory monitoring devices.

Conclusions

We have developed a consensus recommendation for a standardized minimum set of outcomes that are deemed most important to patients with AF comprising long-term consequences of disease outcomes, complications of treatment outcomes, and patient-reported outcomes. This recommendation is targeted for integration into routine clinical practice and research. Use of the standard set may enable institutions to monitor, compare, and improve the quality of their care for patients living with AF.

### Atrial fibrillation in critical illness: state of the art [^0fdb97c6]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia experienced by critically ill patients. It has been associated with adverse short-and long-term outcomes, including an increased risk of thromboembolic events, heart failure, and death. Due to complex and multifactorial pathophysiology, a heterogenous patient population, and a lack of clinical tools for risk stratification validated in this population, AF in critical illness is challenging to predict, prevent, and manage. Personalized management strategies that consider patient factors such as underlying cardiac structure and function, potentially reversible arrhythmogenic triggers, and risk for complications of AF are needed. Furthermore, evaluation of the effects of these interventions on long-term outcomes is warranted. Critical illness survivors who have had AF represent a unique population who require systematic follow-up after discharge. However, the frequency, type, and intensity of follow-up is unknown. This state-of-the-art review aims to summarize the evidence, contextualize the current guidelines within the setting of critical illness, and highlight gaps in knowledge and research opportunities to further our understanding of this arrhythmia and improve patient outcomes.

### Contemporary management of atrial fibrillation: what can clinical registries tell us about stroke prevention and current therapeutic approaches? [^0e1c3f63]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

As highlighted in this review, registries extend knowledge of the natural history, risk factors, treatment practices, and long‐term outcomes and risks of management strategies within a truly representative population of AF patients managed in clinical practice. Together with patient database evaluations, these resources can greatly improve understanding of the needs and gaps in care for diverse patient subgroups. Though a comprehensive review of administrative databases was not within the scope of this review, increasingly relevant literature derived from mining of patient data can inform the management of patients with AF in an array of care settings.

Registry data are the means by which to determine whether patients are managed in line with evidence‐based guidelines — but they offer more than just a reflection of whether everyday practice adheres to accepted norms or ideals. Follow‐up of large numbers of patients allows assessment of long‐term outcomes and infrequent complications. There is scope to gather more information on the impact of AF and its management on quality of life as well as to provide insights into the overall health economic burden of AF. These registries have already helped shape and improve the way we manage patients, and well‐designed registries have the potential to yield hypotheses to guide future clinical and basic research.

### Clinical service organisation for adults with atrial fibrillation [^66d635a3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Data synthesis

We undertook meta‐analyses only where this was meaningful, that is if the treatments, participants, and the underlying clinical question were similar enough for pooling to make sense.

We used a random‐effects model (inverse‐variance method), as we expected some heterogeneity in the interventions.

When we were unable to combine the data in a meta‐analysis, we provided a narrative description of the results as reported by the original study authors.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

An insufficient number of included studies precluded our preplanned subgroup analyses.

As heterogeneity could not be explained, we combined trials using random‐effects analyses and interpreted the results cautiously, or we did not combine them at all.

Sensitivity analysis

We carried out sensitivity analyses to test whether key methodological factors or decisions affected the main results by only including studies with a low risk of bias. We excluded studies at high or unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and incomplete data.

### Atrial fibrillation [^460bc238]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) results from the chaotic depolarization of atrial tissue and is the most common dysrhythmia diagnosed in United States (US) emergency departments. AF affects greater than 1% of the general population, with a peak prevalence of 10% in those greater than 80 years of age. By 2050, it is estimated that nearly 16 million US patients will suffer from AF. AF has significant health effects, and places a considerable economic burden on the health care system. This article discusses recommendations that are derived from a combination of existing guidelines, additional evidence, and consensus.

### Effectiveness of structured, hospital-based, nurse-led atrial fibrillation clinics: a comparison between a real-world population and a clinical trial population [^fb2be8e2]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

A previous randomised trial showed that structured, nurse-led atrial fibrillation (AF) care is superior to conventional AF care, although further research is needed to determine the outcomes of such care in a real-world setting. We compared the outcomes of patients in real-world, nurse-led, structured hospital AF clinics with the outcomes of a randomised trial of the efficacy of a nurse-led AF clinic, with respect to a composite outcome of cardiovascular-related hospitalisation and death.

Methods

All patients were referred to the AF nurse specialist by cardiologists. The AF nurse specialist provided patient education, risk-factor control and stimulated empowerment and compliance. During follow-up, treatment was adjusted according to clinical guidelines. Patient education was repeated, and compliance with medical treatment was controlled. The study size was powered as a non-inferiority study. Outcome measures were adjudicated by the same principles in both cohorts.

Results

A total of 596 patients from the real world and 356 patients from a clinical trial were included in this study. No significant difference between groups with respect to age, type of AF or CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score was found. The composite primary end point occurred with an incidence rate of 8.0 (95% CI 6.1 to 10.4) per 100 person-years in the real-world population and 8.3 (95% CI 6.3 to 10.9) per 100 person-years in the clinical trial, with a crude HR of 0.83 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.23).

Conclusions

Structured, nurse-led, hospital-based AF care appears to be effective, and patient outcomes in an actual, hospital-based, structured AF care are as least as good as those in trial settings.

The introduction of evidence-based and structured guidelines has undoubtedly improved the care of cardiologic patients and in many cases simplified decision-making for the treatment team. The European Society of Cardiology in collaboration with the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, the American College of Clinical Pharmacy, and the Heart Rhythm Society, and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society/Canadian Heart Rhythm Society have developed guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation. Because all 3 guidelines refer to almost the same scientific data, their recommendations are undoubtedly largely in agreement. Nevertheless, there are some interesting differences based on different interpretations of the same study, different publication dates, or differences in local conditions and health care resources.

### Management of atrial fibrillation for older people with frailty: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0fbc354c]. Age and Ageing (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

At hospital admission frailty was associated with decreased OAC prescription. However, there was no statistically significant association at the time of discharge. A single study in a community setting showed that frailty was associated with increased OAC prescription. There is evidence that in patients with AF, frailty is associated with increased stroke incidence, mortality, symptom severity, and length of hospital stay.

Although anticoagulation is largely initiated and managed in primary care, there is a lack of evidence to guide optimal care in this setting for patients with AF and frailty. This may in part explain a gap between current guidelines and clinical practice in management of these patients, particularly in relation to OAC prescription.

Study Design, Setting, and Participants

The design of the AF treatment pathway (Figure 1) and the design of the 2‐center, prospective, 2‐stage clinical study (Figure 2) were approved by the participating clinicians and the authors' institutional review board before the study was begun. The informed consent requirement was waived. We evaluated the AF treatment pathway during a 9‐month period (June 27, 2016 to March 20, 2017) at 2 large tertiary care hospitals in the Northeastern United States.

### Evidence-practice gaps in postdischarge initiation with oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation [^3d3d6a31]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This is the first study of its size in Australia to look at the journey of patients with AF from admission to the hospital through to discharge to the community. We quantified for the first time that OACs are underused in people with AF discharged from the hospital. The effectiveness of OACs for stroke prevention is well established, and increasing rates of use in high‐risk individuals even by a small amount could substantially reduce morbidity and mortality. Further research is needed to elucidate the reasons for underuse and whether they are patient, prescriber, or hospital factors, and how best to improve care in this population.

### Integrated care of patients with atrial fibrillation: the 2016 ESC atrial fibrillation guidelines [^e5975470]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the evolving epidemics in cardiovascular medicine. AF is projected to develop in 25% of currently 40-year-old adults, provokes many, often severe strokes, is associated with increased mortality and often leads to heart failure or sudden death even in well-anticoagulated patients. The last few years have seen the development of new approaches to detect and treat patients with AF, from ECG screening to surgical procedures to prevent recurrent AF. While these improvements provide tools to improve outcomes and quality of life in affected patients, they often need multidisciplinary input into patient management. It therefore seems timely that the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has issued new AF guidelines in August 2016.

Abstract

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an increasingly prevalent heart rhythm condition in adults. It is considered a common cardiovascular condition with complex clinical management. The increasing prevalence and complexity in management underpin the need to adapt and innovate in the delivery of care for people living with AF. There is a need to systematically examine the optimal way in which clinical services are organised to deliver evidence‐based care for people with AF. Recommended approaches include collaborative, organised multidisciplinary, and virtual (or eHealth/mHealth) models of care.

Objectives

To assess the effects of clinical service organisation for AF versus usual care for people with all types of AF.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL to October 2022. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP to April 2023. We applied no restrictions on date, publication status, or language.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published as full texts and as abstract only, involving adults (≥ 18 years) with a diagnosis of any type of AF. We included RCTs comparing organised clinical service, disease‐specific management interventions (including e‐health models of care) for people with AF that were multicomponent and multidisciplinary in nature to usual care.

Data collection and analysis

Three review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from the included studies. We calculated risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random‐effects analyses. We then calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) using the RR. We performed sensitivity analyses by only including studies with a low risk of selection and attrition bias. We assessed heterogeneity using the I² statistic and the certainty of the evidence according to GRADE.

The primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality and all‐cause hospitalisation. The secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular hospitalisation, AF‐related emergency department visits, thromboembolic complications, minor cerebrovascular bleeding events, major cerebrovascular bleeding events, all bleeding events, AF‐related quality of life, AF symptom burden, cost of intervention, and length of hospital stay.

Main results

We included 8 studies (8205 participants) of collaborative, multidisciplinary care, or virtual care for people with AF. The average age of participants ranged from 60 to 73 years. The studies were conducted in China, the Netherlands, and Australia. The included studies involved either a nurse‐led multidisciplinary approach (n = 4) or management using mHealth (n = 2) compared to usual care. Only six out of the eight included studies could be included in the meta‐analysis (for all‐cause mortality and all‐cause hospitalisation, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular hospitalisation, thromboembolic complications, and major bleeding), as quality of life was not assessed using a validated outcome measure specific for AF. We assessed the overall risk of bias as high, as all studies had at least one domain at unclear or high risk of bias rating for performance bias (blinding) in particular.

Organised AF clinical services probably result in a large reduction in all‐cause mortality (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.89; 5 studies, 4664 participants; moderate certainty evidence; 6‐year NNTB 37) compared to usual care. However, organised AF clinical services probably make little to no difference to all‐cause hospitalisation (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.02; 2 studies, 1340 participants; moderate certainty evidence; 2‐year NNTB 101) and may not reduce cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.19; 5 studies, 4564 participants; low certainty evidence; 6‐year NNTB 86) compared to usual care. Organised AF clinical services reduce cardiovascular hospitalisation (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.96; 3 studies, 3641 participants; high certainty evidence; 6‐year NNTB 28) compared to usual care.

Organised AF clinical services may have little to no effect on thromboembolic complications such as stroke (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.77; 5 studies, 4653 participants; low certainty evidence; 6‐year NNTB 588) and major cerebrovascular bleeding events (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.97; 3 studies, 2964 participants; low certainty evidence; 6‐year NNTB 556). None of the studies reported minor cerebrovascular events.

Authors' conclusions

Moderate certainty evidence shows that organisation of clinical services for AF likely results in a large reduction in all‐cause mortality, but probably makes little to no difference to all‐cause hospitalisation compared to usual care. Organised AF clinical services may not reduce cardiovascular mortality, but do reduce cardiovascular hospitalisation compared to usual care. However, organised AF clinical services may make little to no difference to thromboembolic complications and major cerebrovascular events. None of the studies reported minor cerebrovascular events. Due to the limited number of studies, more research is required to compare different models of care organisation, including utilisation of mHealth. Appropriately powered trials are needed to confirm these findings and robustly examine the effect on inconclusive outcomes. The findings of this review underscore the importance of the co‐ordination of care underpinned by collaborative multidisciplinary approaches and augmented by virtual care.

Heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction in atrial fibrillation — dofetilide outcomes and background therapy are detailed as follows: In a randomized program, a substudy of symptomatic heart failure (HF) with atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter reported that dofetilide (0.5 mg twice daily initiated in hospital) increased maintenance and conversion of sinus rhythm, with torsades de pointes risk concentrated early. Specifically, the probability of sinus rhythm after 1 y was 79% vs 42% with placebo, AF conversion was 44% vs 39%, and torsades de pointes occurred in 25 patients (3.3%) with three-quarters within the first 3 d. For patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and persistent AF, clinicians are directed that they "should be treated" with beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor antagonists; in retrospective SOLVD analyses, enalapril reduced incident AF by 78% relative to placebo.

### Rationale, considerations, and goals for atrial fibrillation centers of excellence: a Heart Rhythm Society perspective [^2df50c68]. Heart Rhythm (2020). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) care improvement opportunities — stroke prevention and equity — highlight that there are significant opportunities at multiple levels to improve care of patients with AF, with one such important opportunity being the delivery of care for stroke prevention. Large cohort studies and international registries consistently demonstrate underuse of oral anticoagulation (OAC) in appropriate patients, overutilization in low-risk patients, and ineffective dosing, and all of these practices are associated with poor outcomes. The establishment of effective quality improvement programs has improved rates of appropriate OAC for eligible stroke-reduction patients to > 95%. Discrepancies in care delivery as a result of race, ethnicity, and sex have resulted in differences in patient education, clinic access, OAC treatment, antiarrhythmic drug therapy, and ablation, and establishing programs focused on minimizing these disparities presents an important opportunity to improve the quality and equality of care and thereby improve outcomes for patients with AF. Randomized trials of a multidisciplinary, integrated AF clinic approach focused on risk factor management have resulted in reductions in wait times for specialist assessment, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and mortality, though development of these clinics requires expert staff, collaboration, and special resources that carry significant costs.

### Atrial fibrillation following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and targeted temperature management-are we giving It the attention it deserves? [^32bd184d]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Atrial fibrillation has been associated with increased mortality in the general population and mixed populations of critical ill. Atrial fibrillation can also affect patients during post-cardiac arrest care. We sought to assess the prognostic implications of atrial fibrillation following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, including relation to the level of targeted temperature management.

Design

A post hoc analysis of a prospective randomized trial.

Setting

Thirty-six ICUs.

Patients

We included 897 (96%) of the 939 comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors from the targeted temperature management trial (year, 2010–2013) with data on heart rhythm on day 2.

Interventions

Targeted temperature management at 33°C or 36°C.

Measurements and Main Results

Endpoints included cumulative proportion of atrial fibrillation following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and 180-day all-cause mortality and specific death causes stratified by atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation on day 2 was used as primary endpoint analyses to exclude effects of short-term atrial fibrillation related to resuscitation and initial management. The cumulative proportions of atrial fibrillation were 15% and 11% on days 1 and 2, respectively. Forty-three percent of patients with initial atrial fibrillation the first day were reported with sinus rhythm on day 2. No difference was found between the groups treated with targeted temperature management at 33°C and 36°C. Patients affected by atrial fibrillation had significantly higher 180-day mortality (atrial fibrillation: 66% vs no-atrial fibrillation: 43%; plogrank < 0.0001 and unadjusted hazard ratio, 1.75 [1.35–2.30]; p < 0.0001). The association between atrial fibrillation and higher mortality remained significant (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.34 [1.01–1.79]; p < 0.05) adjusted for potential confounders. Atrial fibrillation was independently associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death and multiple-organ failure (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.07 [1.39–3.09]; p < 0.001), whereas no association with higher risk of death from cerebral causes was found.

Conclusions

Atrial fibrillation was independently associated with higher mortality, primarily driven by cardiovascular causes and multiple-organ failure, and may thus identify a vulnerable subpopulation. Whether treatment to prevent atrial fibrillation is associated with an improved prognosis remains to be established.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to rhythm control, pharmacological cardioversion, indications, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider administering pharmacological cardioversion as an alternative to electrical cardioversion in hemodynamically stable patients with AF or in situations when electrical cardioversion is preferred but cannot be performed.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) pericardioversion anticoagulation rationale — early experience and trial data support timing and modality: "This led to an empiric recommendation for 3 weeks of anticoagulation before cardioversion in the prospective, randomized, multicenter ACUTE… study of patients with > 2 days' duration of AF". "Precardioversion anticoagulation of at least 3 weeks may be accomplished via either therapeutic anticoagulation with VKAs or DOACs", and "Cardiac computed tomography… has emerged as an alternate imaging modality to exclude intracardiac thrombus". Justification includes that anticoagulation is continued "for the subsequent 4 weeks after cardioversion", with risks driven by "elevated thromboembolic risks… high early recurrence of AF, and observation of atrial dysfunction 2–5 days". Risks are "elevated around the time of cardioversion, especially within the 30 days after cardioversion", with recovery of atrial systole "over the ensuing 1 month".

Atrial fibrillation is a frequently encountered arrhythmia, particularly affecting the elderly. Patients at significant risk for stroke should be considered for anticoagulation with warfarin. Management of atrial fibrillation revolves around either controlling the ventricular rate response or trying to maintain sinus rhythm with either pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic therapies. There are many treatment options to consider, based upon the patient's expectations, symptoms, and comorbid conditions. Therefore, the treatment of atrial fibrillation must be individualized.

### Care for atrial fibrillation and outcomes in rural versus urban communities in the United States: a systematic and narrative review [^fc835e94]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This review demonstrates measurable differences in both the treatment and outcomes of patients with AF between rural and urban communities across nearly 3 decades of disparities research in the United States (Figure 2). Patients with AF in rural communities were less likely to receive DOACs, less likely to receive nonemergent ambulatory AF care, and have higher mortality rates. Given that AF affects nearly 1% to 2% of the US population and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditure, these findings have broad implications for patients with AF living in rural parts of the United States.

Figure 2
Differences in AF care between rural and urban communities.

Patients with AF in rural communities had lower odds of receiving DOAC, having stroke as the initial manifestation of AF, presenting to an ambulatory setting for AF care, and getting hospitalized for AF. They additionally had higher odds in presenting to an ED setting for AF care and in‐hospital mortality. AF indicates atrial fibrillation; DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant; and ED, emergency department.

Atrial fibrillation — effects on mortality and hospitalization: In the AFFIRM study, a trend toward increased overall mortality was observed in patients treated for rhythm control compared with rate control after an average of 3.5 y (26.7% vs. 25.9%, p = 0.08). The rhythm-control strategy was associated with excess mortality among older patients, those with HF, and those with CAD, and a substudy suggested that deleterious effects of antiarrhythmic drugs (mortality increase of 49%) may have offset the benefits of sinus rhythm (which was associated with a 53% reduction in mortality). Hospitalization was more frequent in the rhythm-control arms in all trials, mainly due to admissions for cardioversion, and a substudy of RACE found no benefit of rhythm control even in a selected subgroup.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to rhythm control, general indications, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating rhythm control in patients with AF for the following purposes:

- improve symptoms of AF

- improve symptoms and outcomes, such as mortality and hospitalizations, for HF and ischemia in patients with HF

- reduce the risk of AF progression

- reduce hospitalizations, stroke, and mortality in patients with a recent diagnosis of AF

- reduce the risk of developing dementia or worsening cardiac structural abnormalities.

Cardioversion of atrial fibrillation — basis for cardioversion indicates that cardioversion may be performed electively to restore sinus rhythm in patients with persistent AF, may be immediate when the arrhythmia is the main factor responsible for acute heart failure, hypotension, or worsening angina in coronary artery disease, and carries a risk of thromboembolism unless anticoagulation prophylaxis is initiated before the procedure, with risk greatest when the arrhythmia has been present for longer than 48 h.

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 atrial fibrillation — Goals and endpoints for pharmacological therapy: "Whether paroxysmal or persistent, AF is a chronic disorder, and recurrence at some point is likely in most patients". Pharmacological therapy "is indicated in patients who have troublesome symptoms related to paroxysmal AF or recurrent AF after cardioversion who can tolerate antiarrhythmic drugs and have a good chance of remaining in sinus rhythm over an extended period". Study endpoints and quality vary: "The number and quality of studies with each drug are limited; endpoints vary", and "because of clustering of recurrences in the first few weeks after cardioversion, the median time to first recurrence detected by transtelephonic monitoring may not differ between 2 treatment strategies". Importantly, "Recurrence of AF is not equivalent to treatment failure", and "Underlying heart disease or extracardiac disease is present in 80% of patients with persistent AF". Trials "included few patients at risk of drug-induced HF, proarrhythmia, or conduction disturbances".
