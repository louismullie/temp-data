## Question

Combined birth control and migraine with aura

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether combined hormonal contraception (CHC) is safe and appropriate for a patient with migraine with aura, and if not, what alternatives should be recommended and why. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how migraine with aura is defined and how it differs from migraine without aura. Then, I should verify the independent stroke risks associated with migraine with aura and with CHC use. Next, I will examine the magnitude of the combined risk when both are present, and whether any estrogen dose is acceptable. After that, I should review authoritative guideline positions from the CDC/US MEC and the AHA/ASA. Then, I need to check FDA labeling for CHC products to ensure consistency. Finally, I will consider safer alternative contraceptive options and practical counseling points, including special scenarios like smoking, age ≥ 35, and progestin-only method considerations.

> Let me first confirm the definitions, because I need to ensure we are classifying the patient correctly. Migraine with aura consists of fully reversible focal neurologic symptoms that typically precede or accompany the headache and are most often visual, though they can be sensory, speech, motor, or brainstem; by contrast, migraine without aura lacks these focal neurologic features, and menstrual migraine is considered a subtype of migraine without aura, not with aura, which is an important distinction for safety [^116qxog4].

> I will now examine the baseline vascular risk of migraine with aura itself. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of ischemic stroke risk in migraine with aura: multiple meta-analyses and large cohort syntheses consistently show about a 2-fold increased risk, with pooled relative risks around 2.16 to 2.27, and higher in younger women and those with additional risk factors, underscoring a true and biologically plausible association rather than a mere artifact [^115sdoeG] [^114gpZ6A] [^1177oyT6].

> Next, I should review CHC-associated stroke risk independently of migraine. CHCs, particularly those containing ethinyl estradiol, increase the risk of arterial and venous thrombotic events including ischemic stroke; this is a class effect that rises with age, hypertension, smoking, and higher estrogen dose, with older product labels and contemporary summaries quantifying several-fold relative increases even in otherwise low-risk users, reinforcing the need for careful selection and monitoring when CHCs are used [^115G6YnC] [^113BPXrd] [^111thtin].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to check the joint risk when migraine with aura and CHC coexist. Observational case-control data show a striking synergistic effect: the combination increases ischemic stroke risk about 6-fold compared with women who have neither exposure, and this risk appears most pronounced in women with migraine with aura; absolute risk is low but age-dependent, rising from roughly 20 per 100,000 person-years at age 18 to over 300 per 100,000 at age 40, which meaningfully changes counseling and decisions around method selection [^113H816C] [^114LjaY2] [^114tHSv2].

> I should confirm guideline positions next, because I need to ensure my recommendation aligns with the highest authority. The CDC's U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use assigns migraine with aura a Category 4 for CHCs, indicating an unacceptable health risk; the AHA/ASA 2024 guideline similarly recommends progestin-only or nonhormonal contraception in patients with migraine with aura to avoid the increased ischemic stroke risk from CHCs, emphasizing shared decision-making in the presence of stroke risk factors and explicitly discouraging CHCs in this setting [^116qxog4] [^113r2HbD] [^111thtin].

> Wait, I should double-check labeling to avoid any inconsistency. Multiple FDA labels for CHCs explicitly contraindicate use in women with migraine with aura and require discontinuation if aura emerges or migraine frequency or severity increases during therapy, which is consistent with guideline language and mechanistic concern about additive cerebrovascular risk [^116bt8Vg] [^115RPFSp] [^113cs719].

> Let me consider alternatives, because safe and effective options are essential. Progestin-only methods — POPs, injectables, implants, and LNG-IUDs — are Category 1 for migraine with aura, meaning no restriction; I should confirm stroke data for these methods: large reviews and guideline notes indicate no increased ischemic stroke risk with progestin-only contraception, and observational and pilot data suggest that some progestin-only pills, such as desogestrel 75 mcg, may modestly reduce migraine attack frequency and aura duration in selected patients, though evidence quality is low and not required for safety decisions here [^116qxog4] [^112Za5ck] [^116TcGCz] [^115yhZur]. Nonhormonal options such as the copper IUD are also Category 1 and provide highly effective, hormone-free contraception without vascular risk, which I should present prominently in shared decision-making [^115hteJP].

> But wait, what if the patient is young and otherwise healthy — does a very low estrogen dose change the calculus? I should verify this nuance. Even with modern low-dose formulations, the synergistic stroke risk with migraine with aura persists, and guidelines do not carve out a "safe" estrogen dose exception for this subgroup; therefore, the recommendation remains to avoid CHCs in migraine with aura regardless of dose, while acknowledging that absolute risk remains low but clinically meaningful when amplified by age and other factors [^111thtin] [^113H816C].

> I need to ensure I address special scenarios that further elevate risk. Smoking, age ≥ 35, and hypertension each compound CHC-related stroke risk; in women with migraine with aura who smoke or are ≥ 35, the combined risk can reach very high multiples, so I should strongly counsel smoking cessation and steer toward progestin-only or nonhormonal methods, documenting shared decision-making and the patient's preferences and priorities [^115Yruv2] [^114JgWdE].

> Next, I should review practical counseling and monitoring points. I should confirm the diagnosis of aura with a careful history, educate the patient to recognize new or changing aura, and advise immediate cessation of CHCs if aura appears for the first time or evolves during use. I should also screen for and optimize vascular risk factors such as blood pressure, smoking, and diabetes, and coordinate with neurology for migraine management that does not introduce additional vascular risk, including consideration of preventive strategies when appropriate [^116qxog4] [^113r2HbD] [^116rybPg] [^113cs719].

> In summary, I should conclude clearly and verify alignment with guidelines. Combined hormonal contraception is contraindicated in women with migraine with aura due to a markedly increased risk of ischemic stroke from the synergistic combination of independent risks. Progestin-only or nonhormonal contraception should be recommended instead, with individualized counseling on efficacy, bleeding patterns, and migraine considerations, and vigilant attention to vascular risk modification and symptom monitoring [^116qxog4] [^113r2HbD] [^111thtin].

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) are **contraindicated for women with migraine with aura** because they increase ischemic stroke risk approximately 2–4 fold [^115jBCtr] [^116qxog4], with the highest risk in those with aura and additional vascular risk factors (smoking, hypertension, age ≥ 35) [^115Yruv2]. This is supported by the CDC (US MEC category 4) [^116qxog4] and AHA/ASA guidelines, which recommend **progestin-only or nonhormonal methods** (copper IUD, LNG-IUD, implant, DMPA, POP) as safe alternatives [^115hteJP] [^113r2HbD]. If a woman on CHCs develops new or worsening aura, stop CHCs immediately and switch to a safer method [^115RPFSp] [^113r2HbD].

## Stroke risk associated with combined hormonal contraceptives in migraine with aura

- **Independent risk factors**: Migraine with aura and CHCs each independently increase ischemic stroke risk [^114gpZ6A] [^115jBCtr].

- **Combined risk**: CHC use in migraine with aura increases stroke risk about 2–4 fold vs nonusers, with higher risk in those with aura and additional vascular risk factors (smoking, hypertension, age ≥ 35) [^115jBCtr] [^115Yruv2].

- **Absolute risk**: In women 20–44 with migraine with aura, CHC use increases absolute stroke risk to ~36.9/100,000 vs 2.5/100,000 in those with neither condition [^113H816C].

## Summary of evidence

| **Factor** | **Stroke risk** |
|-|-|
| migraine with aura alone | Increased ~2-fold [^114gpZ6A] |
| CHCs alone | Increased ~2-fold [^115YHk4t] |
| Combined (migraine with aura + CHCs) | Increased ~4–6 fold [^113H816C] [^114LjaY2] |
| Progestin-only or nonhormonal methods | No increased stroke risk [^112Za5ck] [^113r2HbD] |

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (delyla) [^1149AjXs]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

A two- to four-fold increase in relative risk of postoperative thromboembolic complications has been reported with the use of oral contraceptives. The relative risk of venous thrombosis in women who have predisposing conditions is twice that of women without such medical conditions. If feasible, oral contraceptives should be discontinued at least four weeks prior to and for two weeks after elective surgery of a type associated with an increase in risk of thromboembolism and during and following prolonged immobilization. Since the immediate postpartum period is also associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, oral contraceptives should be started no earlier than four weeks after delivery in women who elect not to breast-feed or after a midtrimester pregnancy termination.

c. Cerebrovascular diseases

Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (> 35 years), hypertensive women who also smoke. Hypertension was found to be a risk factor for both users and nonusers, for both types of strokes, while smoking interacted to increase the risk for hemorrhagic strokes.

In a large study, the relative risk of thrombotic strokes has been shown to range from 3 for normotensive users to 14 for users with severe hypertension. The relative risk of hemorrhagic stroke is reported to be 1.2 for nonsmokers who used oral contraceptives, 2.6 for smokers who did not use oral contraceptives, 7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.8 for normotensive users and 25.7 for users with severe hypertension. The attributable risk is also greater in older women. Oral contraceptives also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors such as certain inherited or acquired thrombophilias. Women with migraine (particularly migraine/headaches with focal neurological symptoms, see CONTRAINDICATIONS) who take combination oral contraceptives may be at an increased risk of stroke.

5.7	Adverse Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects

Hyperglycemia

ANNOVERA is contraindicated in diabetic females over age 35, or females who have diabetes with hypertension, nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, other vascular disease, or females with diabetes of > 20 years duration [see Contraindications (4)]. ANNOVERA may decrease glucose tolerance. Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic females who are taking ANNOVERA.

Dyslipidemia

Consider alternative contraception for females with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. ANNOVERA may cause adverse lipid changes.

Females with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using ANNOVERA.

5.8	Headache

ANNOVERA is contraindicated in females who have headaches with focal neurological symptoms or have migraine headaches with aura, and in females over age 35 years who have migraine headaches with or without aura [see Contraindications (4)].

If a woman taking ANNOVERA develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue ANNOVERA if indicated.

Consider discontinuation of ANNOVERA in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during CHC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) [see Contraindications (4)].

### Use of combined hormonal contraceptives among women with systemic lupus erythematosus with and without medical contraindications to oestrogen [^115mPc5X]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess the prevalence of combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) in reproductive-age women with SLE with and without possible contraindications and to determine factors associated with their use in the presence of possible contraindications.

Methods

This observational cohort study included premenopausal women ages 18–45 years enrolled in the SLICC Registry ≤ 15 months after SLE onset, with annual assessments spanning 2000–2017. World Health Organization Category 3 or 4 contraindications to CHCs (e.g. hypertension, aPL) were assessed at each study visit. High disease activity (SLEDAI score > 12 or use of > 0.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone) was considered a relative contraindication.

Results

A total of 927 SLE women contributed 6315 visits, of which 3811 (60%) occurred in the presence of one or more possible contraindication to CHCs. Women used CHCs during 512 (8%) visits, of which 281 (55%) took place in the setting of one or more possible contraindication. The most frequently observed contraindications were aPL (52%), hypertension (34%) and migraine with aura (22%). Women with one or more contraindication were slightly less likely to be taking CHCs [7% of visits (95% CI 7, 8)] than women with no contraindications [9% (95% CI 8, 10)].

Conclusion

CHC use was low compared with general population estimates (> 35%) and more than half of CHC users had at least one possible contraindication. Many yet unmeasured factors, including patient preferences, may have contributed to these observations. Further work should also aim to clarify outcomes associated with this exposure.

Safety of hormonal contraceptives among women with migraine: A systematic review☆ 12 2016 By Tepper, Naomi K.; Whiteman, Maura K.; Zapata, Lauren B. ;. Source: Contraception. 94: 630–640 English. Details: Alternative Title: Contraception Personal Author: Description: Background: Migraine is common among women of reproductive age and is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. Combined oral contraceptives are also associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. Use of hormonal contraception among women with migraine might further elevate the risk of stroke among women of reproductive age. Objective: To identify evidence regarding the risk of arterial thromboembolism among women with migraine who use hormonal contraceptives. Methods: We searched the PubMed database for all articles published from database inception through January 2016.

We included studies that examined women with migraine overall or separated by subtype. Hormonal contraceptives of interest included combined hormonal methods and progestin-only methods. Results: Seven articles met inclusion criteria. All were case–control studies of fair to poor quality reporting on use of COCs or oral contraceptives not further described and all reported stroke outcomes. Four studies demonstrated that, among women with migraine, COC use was associated with approximately two to four times the risk of stroke compared with nonuse. The only study to examine specific migraine subtypes found an elevated risk of stroke among women with migraine with aura, and this risk was similar regardless of OC use, although these odds ratios were not reported.

Two studies did not report risks among women with migraine and COC use combined, but both found increased risks of stroke with migraine and COC use independently. No evidence was found on other hormonal contraceptives or on risk of myocardial infarction. Conclusion: Limited evidence suggests a two- to fourfold increased risk of stroke among women with migraine who use COCs compared with nonuse. Additional study is needed on the risks of hormonal contraceptives, including combined and progestin-only methods, among women with different migraine subtypes. Subjects: Keywords:

### May lamotrigine be an alternative to topiramate in the prevention of migraine with aura? Results of a retrospective study [^115kj7vE]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Finally, according to the North American Antiepileptic Drug pregnancy registry, topiramate showed a dose independent threefold higher risk of congenital malformations and child developmental retardation in women exposed to the drug, especially in the first trimester of pregnancy. On the other hand, teratogenic activity of lamotrigine is dose-dependent and exerted at higher dosage than that used for migraine prophylaxis. Based on our findings, lamotrigine should be considered in clinical practice for patients having migraine with aura reporting unresponsiveness to topiramate treatment or who discontinue the drug due to side effects. Moreover, lamotrigine could be safely offered to patients who have contraindications to topiramate, especially migraine with aura women planning to have pregnancy.

Regarding the effects on aura frequency and duration, our results showed a trend towards a better efficacy of lamotrigine compared with topiramate. Responder rates for monthly aura frequency were similar between the two treatment groups. However, approximately half of the lamotrigine-treated patients reported a complete disappearance of aura at 6-month follow-up. Additionally, lamotrigine determined a reduction of aura duration per episode of approximately 15 min. In line with previous findings, lamotrigine should then be considered in clinical practice for the treatment of prolonged or disturbing migraine with aura. We are aware of several limitations of this study. A possible bias in patients' selection, the small number of patients recruited, the absence of a placebo controlled group and the retrospective nature of our study may have indicated a higher efficacy of both drugs than observed in other studies. Although results similar to ours for lamotrigine have been previously reported by Pascual et al with a retrospective, non-placebo-controlledì analysis, we think that the main result of our study was not the demonstration of the effectiveness of any specific drug, rather the evidence of a similar effectiveness of lamotrigine compared with topiramate. This could open new therapeutic possibilities, especially in patients for whom topiramate is contraindicated or who are intolerant to this drug. We hope that our observation may stimulate further prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled trials to prove the role of lamotrigine in the prophylaxis of migraine with aura.

The following chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who use different methods of birth control. Each box on the chart contains a list of birth control methods that are similar in effectiveness. The most effective methods are at the top of the chart. The box on the bottom of the chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who do not use birth control and are trying to get pregnant.

Who should not take Iclevia?

Do not take Iclevia if you:

smoke and are over 35 years of age
have or had blood clots in your arms, legs, lungs, or eyes
had a stroke
had a heart attack
have certain heart valve problems or heart rhythm abnormalities that can cause blood clots to form in the heart
have or had a problem with your blood that makes it clot more than normal
have high blood pressure that cannot be controlled by medicine or have high blood pressure with blood vessels problems
have diabetes
and are over the age of 35
with high blood pressure
with kidney, eye, nerve, or blood vessel damage
for more than 20 years
have certain kinds of severe migraine headaches with aura, numbness, weakness or changes in vision, or any migraine headaches if you are over 35 years of age
have or had breast cancer
have liver problems, including liver tumors
have any unexplained vaginal bleeding
take any Hepatitis C drug combination containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir. This may increase levels of the liver enzyme "alanine aminotransferase" (ALT) in the blood.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^116XHMJM]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.2.5. Stratification

Recommendations:

1.2.5.1. There is usually no need for stratification in acute treatment trials.

1.2.5.2. Stratification may be considered when an imbalance between the treatment groups or an important factor may influence the results of a trial.

Comments:

Randomization alone may not ensure full comparability between subjects in different treatment groups, especially in smaller trials, and stratified randomization is sometimes used to circumvent potential imbalances. The EMA recommends that stratification variables usually be included as covariates in primary analyses, regardless of their prognostic value. In controlled trials for migraine, the use of stratification by prognostic factors should be limited to a few variables and only to those that have historically demonstrated effects on primary efficacy endpoint(s). Stratification variables that have been used in acute treatment trials include age, body weight, headache intensity at baseline, migraine type (i.e. with or without aura), menstrual versus non-menstrual attacks, and concomitant preventive treatment. Given the preponderance of females with migraine, sex may also be used as a stratification factor to control for imbalances in treatment groups.

1.2.6. Intention to treat

Recommendations:

1.2.6.1. Randomized controlled trials of acute treatments for migraine should follow the principle of intention to treat (ITT), which implies that analyses should include all randomised subjects in the groups to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of treatment received.

1.2.6.2. The full analysis set may be modified to exclude subjects from the analysis if no treatment was taken or if no data points after treatment were recorded. A plan should be provided prospectively as to how participants missing the 2-hour endpoint or who treat but do not record data will be handled. Those who treat but do not record data should probably be counted as failures, and those who use rescue medication before the 2-hour time assessment should be counted as failures.

Comments:

The ITT principle encourages, where reasonable, the inclusion of subjects who withdrew, were lost to follow-up, or did not fully adhere to trial protocol. The ITT principle should be adhered to when the primary outcome is a variable that measures a change from baseline to any post-dose time point or to the end of the trial. When the primary outcome is defined as a rate of change, and the analysis will therefore imply a slope or rate of calculation, only subjects who have received at least one dose and recorded at least one data point should be included.

### Use of combined hormonal contraceptives among women with migraines and risk of ischemic stroke [^114LjaY2]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine with aura and combined hormonal contraceptives are independently associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. However, little is known about whether there are any joint effects of migraine and hormonal contraceptives on risk of stroke.

Objective

We sought to estimate the incidence of stroke in women of reproductive age and examine the association among combined hormonal contraceptive use, migraine type (with or without aura), and ischemic stroke.

Study Design

This study used a nationwide health care claims database and employed a nested case-control study design. Females ages 15–49 years with first-ever stroke during 2006 through 2012 were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification inpatient services diagnosis codes. Four controls were matched to each case based on age. Migraine headache with and without aura was identified using inpatient or outpatient diagnosis codes. Current combined hormonal contraceptive use was identified using the National Drug Code from the pharmacy database. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of ischemic stroke by migraine type and combined hormonal contraceptive use.

Results

From 2006 through 2012, there were 25,887 ischemic strokes among females ages 15–49 years, for a cumulative incidence of 11 strokes/100,000 females. Compared to those with neither migraine nor combined hormonal contraceptive use, the odds ratio of ischemic stroke was highest among those with migraine with aura using combined hormonal contraceptives (odds ratio, 6.1; 95% confidence interval, 3.1–12.1); odds ratios were also elevated for migraine with aura without combined hormonal contraceptive use (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.9–3.7), migraine without aura and combined hormonal contraceptive use (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–2.9), and migraine without aura without combined hormonal contraceptive use (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.9–2.7).

Conclusion

The joint effect of combined hormonal contraceptives and migraine with aura was associated with a 6-fold increased risk of ischemic stroke compared with neither risk factor. Use of combined hormonal contraceptives did not substantially further increase risk of ischemic stroke among women with migraine without aura. Determining migraine type is critical in assessing safety of combined hormonal contraceptives among women with migraine.

### Combined oral contraceptives in women with menstrual migraine without aura [^115j5eBC]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of two regimens (21 active pills + 7 placebo pills vs. 24 active pills + 4 placebo pills) of combined oral contraception (COC), both containing 20 μg of ethinyl E(2) and 3 mg of drospirenone, in improving the severity of pure menstrual migraine without aura.

Design

Prospective randomized study.

Setting

Patients attending the gynecology department of the University of Siena for consultation regarding an appropriate contraception.

Patient(S)

Women ages 20 to 35 years (n = 60) suffering from pure menstrual migraine without aura.

Intervention(S)

Three months of contraceptive use (ethinyl E(2) 20 μg/drospirenone 3 mg) in two different regimens: group A received 21 active + 7 placebo pills whereas group B received 24 active + 4 placebo pills.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Monthly evaluation of the duration and severity of patients' daily headache attacks.

Result(S)

Although both study groups demonstrated significant reduction in the intensity and duration of menstrual migraine, patients in group B (24/4 COC) reported a significant reduction in the intensity and a shorter duration of their menstrual migraine, compared with group A (21/7 COC).

Conclusion(S)

The 24/4 COC regimen is recommended as the preferred treatment for patients suffering from pure menstrual migraine without aura.

### Evidence-based guideline: premature ovarian insufficiency [^1116ioy1]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). High credibility.

Premature ovarian insufficiency — HT regimen, bleeding, endometriosis, and migraine guidance: The guideline group recommends that the dose of progestogen is increased when higher doses of estrogen therapy are used, and in women with POI, as with any women using HT, unscheduled bleeding requires assessment. The guideline group recommends that women with POI and a history of endometriosis should be treated with combined estrogen-progestogen HT, even after hysterectomy, to avoid recurrence of endometriosis or malignant transformation. Migraine should not be considered a contraindication to HRT use by women with POI; HCPs should consider changing dose, route of administration, or regimen, if migraine worsens during HRT, and women with POI and migraine with aura should be advised to use transdermal estrogen as this may be the lowest-risk route of administration.

### Migraine and cardiovascular disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115sdoeG]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Publications over the past years have focused not only on the association of migraine with ischaemic stroke but also on the association of migraine with other vascular events, including haemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, angina, and death due to cardiovascular disease. Our pooled results do not suggest an association between overall migraine and haemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, or death due to cardiovascular disease, whereas the risk of angina seems to be increased by 30%. Individual studies have reported a twofold increased risk of myocardial infarction, angina, and death due to cardiovascular disease for people who have migraine with aura, w3 but not for haemorrhagic stroke. w18

Pooled analyses further indicate that the risk of ischaemic stroke is significantly higher among women than among men. In contrast, the lack of an association between migraine and myocardial infarction did not differ between women and men. This may indicate a differential pathophysiology between migraine and ischaemic stroke and between migraine and myocardial infarction, as well as sex specific effects. Although the associations between migraine and angina and between migraine and death due to cardiovascular disease suggest a higher risk among women than among men, studies were too few to allow a reliable assessment. Certain conditions among women, especially young women, seem to be important determinants in increasing the risk of cardiovascular events, even in the absence of overt atherosclerotic disease. Sex hormones may be such candidates; they have been associated with risk of both migraine and cardiovascular events. In addition, their "magnitude of impact" may be much greater on the cervical-cranial circulation than on the coronary circulation. This needs further investigation.

Implications for clinical practice

The most consistent evidence was the increased risk of ischaemic stroke among people with migraine, which seems to be driven by migraine with aura. In addition, the risk seemed to be further magnified by being younger (< 45 years), being female, smoking, and using oral contraceptives. Thus, in particular, young women who have migraine with aura should be strongly advised to stop smoking, and methods of birth control other than oral contraceptives may be considered. Some evidence shows that among women who have migraine with aura the combination of smoking and use of oral contraceptives leads to the highest risk estimates for ischaemic stroke. w4 Firm evidence on the association of migraine and other ischaemic vascular events is lacking. Therefore patients with migraine should be treated the same as any other patient without migraine: they should be screened for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, adverse lipid profile, and increased risk of coronary heart disease and, if appropriate, these risk factors should be modified.

If you take oral contraceptives and need elective surgery, need to stay in bed for a prolonged illness, or have recently delivered a baby, you may be at risk of developing blood clots. You should consult your doctor about stopping oral contraceptives three to four weeks before surgery and not taking oral contraceptives for two weeks after surgery or during bed rest. You should also not take oral contraceptives soon after delivery of a baby or a midtrimester pregnancy termination. It is advisable to wait for at least four weeks after delivery if you are not breast-feeding. If you are breast-feeding, you should wait until you have weaned your child before using the pill. (See also the section on breast-feeding in "GENERAL PRECAUTIONS".)

2. Heart attacks and strokes

Oral contraceptives may increase the tendency to develop strokes (stoppage or rupture of blood vessels in the brain) and angina pectoris and heart attacks (blockage of blood vessels in the heart). Any of these conditions can cause death or serious disability.

Smoking greatly increases the possibility of suffering heart attacks and strokes. Furthermore, smoking and the use of oral contraceptives greatly increase the chances of developing and dying of heart disease.

Women with migraine (especially migraine with aura) who take oral contraceptives also may be at higher risk of stroke.

### Migraine and vascular diseases: a review of the evidence and potential implications for management [^115VfWFD]. Cephalalgia (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The higher-than-expected incidence of vascular diseases reported in migraineurs suggests that migraine may, in some cases, be a dangerous condition rather than just a distressing but harmless disorder. We provide a systematic review of data linking migraine to vascular diseases.

Migraine and Vascular Diseases

Available data indicate an increased risk of ischemic stroke in subjects suffering from migraine with aura. In addition, evidence suggests an association between migraine with aura and cardiac disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, retinal vasculopathy and mortality that needs to be further corroborated; consequently, for those conditions, migraine with aura can be only considered among the less-well-documented risk factors. As the absolute risk of ischemic stroke in the overall migraineur population is low, subjects suffering from migraine with aura should be made aware of the possible link but not unduly alarmed. It is a common notion that the vascular risk of migraineurs may be further increased by the presence of easily treatable vascular risk factors such as arterial hypertension, cigarette smoking and oral contraceptive use.

Conclusions

Forthcoming guidelines should appropriately recommend supporting migraineurs not only with measures aimed at decreasing headache frequency, thus improving quality of life, but also with general measures and preventive strategies aimed to reduce the overall vascular risk. In fact, headache specialists should take care not only of relieving pain but also of assessing and treating concurrent vascular risk factors, while gynecologists, in particular, should routinely consider the presence and type of migraine before prescribing oral contraceptives.

### Evidence-based contraception: common questions and answers [^1139Sk86]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Primary care clinicians are uniquely situated to reduce unintended pregnancy in the context of a patient's medical comorbidities, social circumstance, and gender identity. New evidence regarding contraception use has emerged in recent years. The copper intrauterine device is the most effective option for emergency contraception, with similar effectiveness found for the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, 52 mg, and both offer extended future contraception. Ulipristal given within 120 hours after unprotected intercourse is the most effective oral emergency contraceptive. Oral levonorgestrel, 1.5 mg, is slightly less effective than ulipristal, and is less effective in patients with a body mass index of more than 30 kg per m2 and if administered after 72 hours. The Yuzpe method, which uses a combination of oral contraceptives, is less effective than ulipristal or oral levonorgestrel, 1.5 mg, and has high risk of nausea and vomiting. Contraception methods based on fertility awareness are safe and have similar effectiveness as condom use and the withdrawal method. Patients who have migraine with aura have a higher risk of ischemic stroke, and combined oral contraceptives appear to increase this risk. Therefore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends avoiding their use in these patients. Studies support the extended use of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, 52 mg, for seven years, the copper intrauterine device for 12 years, and the etonogestrel subdermal contraceptive implant for five years. One levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device, 52 mg, (Mirena) was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for seven years of use to prevent pregnancy. However, the intervals for the copper intrauterine device and the etonogestrel subdermal contraceptive implant are longer than approved by the FDA, and patient-clinician shared decision-making should be used. Subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, 104 mg, a newer formulation with prefilled syringes, can be safely self-administered every 13 weeks. Because bone density loss appears to be reversible, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends considering use of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate beyond two years despite an FDA boxed warning about increased fracture risk. Testosterone does not prevent pregnancy but is safe to use with hormonal contraception; thus, transgender and gender-diverse patients with a uterus can be offered the full range of contraceptive options.

Target population

The target population for established and new technologies comprises people who have migraine with aura, migraine without aura, or chronic migraine, as well as those who experience attacks of probable migraine, as specified in the latest edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD). Because ICHD has been modified as the understanding of migraine has evolved, the most recent criteria should be applied when calculating outcomes in meta-analyses.

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol [^1125YB7d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Headache

Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets is contraindicated in females who have headaches with focal neurological symptoms or have migraine headaches with aura, and in women over age 35 years who have migraine headaches with or without aura [see Contraindications (4)].

If a female taking levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets develop new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets if indicated.

Consider discontinuation of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets if there is an increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) [see Contraindications (4)].

5.9 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea

Bleeding and/or spotting that occurs at any time while taking the first 84 tablets of each extended-cycle regimen is considered "unscheduled" bleeding/spotting. Bleeding that occurs during the time a woman takes the seven white inert tablets is considered "scheduled" bleeding.

Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting

Females using levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets may experience unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting especially during the first 3 months of use. Bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or by changing to a different contraceptive product. If unscheduled bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles evaluate for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy.

Before prescribing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets, advise the woman to weigh the occurrence of fewer scheduled menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) against the occurrence of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting.

The clinical trial of the efficacy of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets (91-day cycles) in preventing pregnancy also assessed scheduled and unscheduled bleeding. The participants in the study were composed primarily of women who had used oral contraceptives previously as opposed to new users. Women with a history of breakthrough bleeding/spotting ≥ 10 consecutive days on oral contraceptives were excluded from the study. More levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets subjects, compared to subjects on the comparator 28-day cycle regimen, discontinued prematurely for unacceptable bleeding (7.7% [levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets] vs. 1.8% [28-day cycle regimen]).

### Perimenstrual migraines and their response to preventive therapy with topiramate [^116ADAsb]. Cephalalgia (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Preventive treatment with topiramate is effective for overall reduction of migraine frequency, but there are few data regarding its efficacy on perimenstrual migraines. To determine whether topiramate can prevent perimenstrual migraines, we analyzed data from premenopausal women as a subgroup of the Prolonged Migraine Prevention with Topiramate (PROMPT) study.

Methods

In total, 198 women from the PROMPT study with menstrually related migraine (MRM) were evaluated. After a one-to-two-month prospective baseline period, patients received open-label topiramate (50–200 mg/day) for six months.

Results

During topiramate treatment, mean monthly migraine frequency was reduced from 7.03 at baseline to 4.36 (mean change: -2.66; p < .001, endpoint analysis). Mean percentage reductions were similar for migraines during and outside the perimenstrual period (-45.9% and -46.1%, respectively). In patients with aura, reductions in migraine days with (-48.3%) or without (-43.4%) aura were similar to those in patients without aura (-45.4%). Reductions were also similar whether women were taking combined oral contraceptives (-47.0%) or were not (-46.6%).

Conclusions

Topiramate reduces the frequency, but not severity or duration, of perimenstrual migraines in women with MRM, including migraines with and without aura, and regardless of combined oral contraceptive use.

### Migraine and risk of stroke [^115tXYsq]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

MIGRAINE AND VASCULAR RISK FACTORS

The role of conventional vascular risk factors on the risk of cardiovascular events in people with migraine is controversial. Migraine, and particularly MA, is associated with an unfavourable cardiovascular risk profile and an increased 10-year predicted risk of coronary heart disease based on the Framingham Risk Score. Frequent headache and long-term migraine are associated with a poorer cardiovascular risk profile. Although people with migraine have an increased risk of ischaemic stroke in the presence of vascular risk factors, several studies have shown that the association between migraine and ischaemic stroke is apparent in people with low Framingham Risk Score. The few exceptions were a positive association with family history of cardiovascular disease, cigarette smoking and oral contraceptives. This agrees with reports that coronary and carotid arteries of individuals with active migraine are found to be less severely affected by atherosclerosis than individuals without migraine, suggesting a non-atherosclerotic mechanism behind the MA-ischaemic stroke link.

Clinical implication

Most migraine patients have MO and are of no or little increased risk of stroke, and they should be reassured instead of being frightened. People with MA are at increased risk of developing cardio/cerebrovascular disease, and while migraine prevention in people with MA has not been shown to reduce stroke risk, management of vascular risk factors in those with MA is important in reducing stroke risk. Comorbidities should be treated adequately (arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidaemia). Migraine patients with aura should be advised to stop smoking, particularly if they also take oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptive use should be carefully discussed in women with MA because of the increased vascular risk. Their prescription should be contraindicated in women with MA and other comorbid vascular risk factor or congenital or acquired thrombophilia.

### Medical contraindications to estrogen and contraceptive use among women veterans [^116kYEvQ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Women veterans have high rates of medical comorbidities and may be particularly vulnerable to adverse health outcomes associated with unintended pregnancy.

Objectives

The objective of the study was to estimate the prevalence of medical contraindications to estrogen-containing combined hormonal contraception among women veterans of reproductive age and to evaluate the relationship between contraindications and contraceptive use.

Study Design

This was a secondary analysis of data from a cross-sectional, telephone-based survey with a national sample of 2302 female veterans, aged 18–45 years, who use the Veterans Administration Healthcare System for primary care. This analysis included women at risk of unintended pregnancy, defined as heterosexually active and not pregnant or trying to conceive and with no history of hysterectomy or infertility. Seven contraindications to combined hormonal contraception were identified using survey data or medical diagnosis codes: hypertension; coronary artery disease; active migraine in women older than 35 years or migraine with aura; smoking in women older than 35 years; and a history of thromboembolism, stroke, or breast cancer. Outcomes were current use of combined hormonal contraception and contraceptive method type (combined hormonal contraception, and other prescription methods, nonprescription methods or no method). Multivariable logistic and multinomial regression were used to assess the relationship between contraindications and combined hormonal contraception use and method type, respectively.

Results

Among 1169 women veterans at risk of unintended pregnancy, 339 (29%) had at least 1 contraindication to combined hormonal contraception. The most prevalent conditions were hypertension (14.9%) and migraine (8.7%). In adjusted analyses, women with contraindications were less likely than women without contraindications to report use of combined hormonal contraception (adjusted odds ratio, 0.54, 95% confidence interval, 0.37–0.79). Relative to use of combined hormonal contraception, women with contraindications were more likely than women without contraindications to use other prescription methods (adjusted odds ratio, 1.74, 95% confidence interval, 1.17–2.60), nonprescription methods (adjusted odds ratio, 1.96, 95% confidence interval, 1.19–3.22), and no method (adjusted odds ratio, 2.29, 95% confidence interval, 1.35–3.89).

Conclusion

Women veterans at risk of unintended pregnancy have a high burden of medical contraindications to estrogen. Women with contraindications were less likely to use combined hormonal contraceptive methods but were more likely to use no method, suggesting an unmet need for contraception in this medically vulnerable population.

### Combined hormonal contraception use in reproductive-age women with contraindications to estrogen use [^113NeM76]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's US Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use recommends that combined hormonal contraceptives (ie, birth control pills, contraceptive patch, vaginal ring) should be avoided in women with specific medical conditions because of the increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with estrogen use. Whether women with category 3 (theoretical or proven risk usually outweigh the advantages) or category 4 (unacceptable health risk) contraindications are appropriately avoiding estrogen-containing combined hormonal contraceptives is unknown.

Objective

We describe the prevalence of combined hormonal contraceptive use among a sample of reproductive-age women with medical contraindications to estrogen use. Our hypothesis was that women with categories 3 and 4 contraindications would use estrogen-containing contraception less often than women without medical contraindications. We also explored whether inappropriate estrogen-containing contraceptive use is related to contraceptive provider characteristics.

Study Design

Data are from the baseline survey of the MyNewOptions study, which included privately insured women residing in Pennsylvania aged 18–40 years, who were sexually active and not intending pregnancy in the next year. Women were surveyed about their medical conditions, contraceptive use, and characteristics of their contraceptive provider. Women were considered to have a contraindication to combined hormonal contraceptives if they reported a category 3 or category 4 contraindication: hypertension, smokers older than age 35 years, a history of venous thromboembolism, diabetes with complications, coronary artery disease, systemic lupus erythematosus with antiphospholipid antibodies, breast cancer, or migraine headaches with aura. χ(2) tests for general association were used to compare combined hormonal contraceptives use, contraceptive health provider characteristics, and sociodemographic data in women with and without contraindications to estrogen use.

Results

The MyNewOptions baseline study sample included 987 adult women who were mostly young (46% were 18–25 years), white (94%), employed (70%), and married or cohabiting (54%). Thirteen percent (n = 130) of the sample had a medical contraindication to estrogen-containing contraceptive use: migraine with aura (81%) was the most common contraindication, followed by smokers older than age 35 years (7%), hypertension (11%), history of venous thromboembolism (4%), and diabetes with complications (2%). High use of combined hormonal contraceptives was reported among the women with medical contraindications to estrogen at 39% (n = 51). This was not statistically different from women without a medical contraindication (47%, P = .1). Among the 130 women with a contraindication, whether they did or did not use an estrogen-containing contraceptive did not vary by education level, income, or weight category. With respect to their contraceptive prescribers, there were no differences in prescriber specialty, provider type, or clinic type comparing women using and not using an estrogen-containing contraceptive.

Conclusion

Among this study sample of reproductive-age women, there was a high rate of combined hormonal contraceptive use in women with a medical contraindication to estrogen use. These women may be at an increased risk for cardiovascular events. Processes need to be improved to ensure that women with medical contraindications to estrogen-containing contraception are being offered the safest and most effective methods, including long-acting reversible contraceptives, such as intrauterine devices and the contraceptive implant.

### Levonorgestrel / ethinyl estradiol (jolessa) [^116Kk1g3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.5 Age-related
Considerations

The risk for cardiovascular disease and prevalence of risk factors for cardiovascular disease increase with age. Certain conditions, such as smoking and migraine headache without aura, that do not contraindicate COC use in younger females, are contraindications to use in women over 35 years of age [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Consider the presence of underlying risk factors that may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease or VTE, particularly before initiating JOLESSA for women over 35 years, such as:

Hypertension
Diabetes
Dyslipidemia
Obesity

5.6 Gallbladder
Disease

Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs, including JOLESSA, may worsen existing gallbladder disease.

A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Females with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC-related cholestasis.

5.7 Adverse
Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects

Hyperglycemia

JOLESSA is contraindicated in diabetic women over age 35, or females who have diabetes with hypertension, nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, other vascular disease or females with diabetes of > 20 years of duration [see Contraindications (4)]. JOLESSA may decrease glucose tolerance. Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic females who are using JOLESSA.

Dyslipidemia

Consider alternative contraception for females with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. JOLESSA may cause adverse lipid changes.

Females with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may have an increase in serum triglyceride concentrations when using JOLESSA, which may increase the risk of pancreatitis.

5.8 Headache

JOLESSA is contraindicated in females who have headaches with focal neurological symptoms or have migraine headaches with aura, and in women over age 35 years who have migraine headaches with or without aura [see Contraindications (4)].

If a female taking JOLESSA develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue JOLESSA if indicated. Consider discontinuation of JOLESSA if there is an increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) [see Contraindications (4)].

### Migraine and risk of stroke [^117VyzqG]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

MIGRAINE, STROKE AND SPECIAL CONCERNS IN WOMEN

Migraine is a predominantly female disorder, affecting women with a ratio of approximately 3:1 to men. The highest 1-year prevalence of migraine is between ages of 25 and 55 years, and it is estimated that 22%–37% of women will experience migraine during their reproductive years. As the association between migraine and ischaemic stroke is particularly strong in women with MA under the age of 45, certain aspects during a woman's life need to be considered.

Migraine and oral contraceptives

Migraine is particularly prevalent in the fertile period when women opt for oral contraception. While the risks of venous thromboembolism in users of oral contraceptives are well established, the risks of cardiovascular arterial diseases are more uncertain. The safety of oral contraceptives in women with migraine remains controversial. Numerous studies report increased risk of ischaemic stroke in women with migraine who use oral contraceptive. Stronger associations are found for MA and in those with additional vascular risk factors. Particularly smoking combined with the use of oral contraceptives in young women with MA increase risk of ischaemic stroke. The risk of stroke in women taking oral contraceptives seems to correlate with the dose of oestrogen contained in the formulation. Caution should be warranted when interpreting the data on the risk of stroke in women with migraine using oral contraceptives; as migraine is often not diagnosed according to ICHD criteria, many studies do not distinguish between MA and MO, and the dose classification of oral contraceptives is often heterogeneous. Studies evaluating the effect of oral contraceptive use on the risk of haemorrhagic stroke is conflicting, and no firm conclusions can be made.

Clinical implication

For most women, modern oral contraceptives are safe and highly effective methods of contraception. Despite the overall low risk of stroke from oral contraceptives, certain subgroups of women, particularly those who have MA, are older than 35 years, smoke cigarettes or have other stroke risk factors, may be at higher risk. One should look for an underlying genetic or acquired coagulopathy in those with previous thromboembolism or risk factors for an underlying coagulopathy (eg, family history of thromboembolism, spontaneous abortion, history of malignancy). Type of oral contraceptive should also be taken into consideration, as the oestrogen content differs between products. New onset of migraine aura, new onset MO in temporal relationship to starting oral contraceptive, development of unusual aura symptoms or prolonged aura may necessitate further evaluation or cessation of oral contraceptives.

1. Clinical trials for the acute treatment of migraine attacks

1.1. Subject selection

1.1.1. Migraine definition

Recommendation:

Eligible subjects should fulfil the diagnostic criteria for migraine according to the most current version of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) of the IHS.

Comments:

Clinical trials of acute treatments for migraine can include subjects who have migraine without aura, migraine with aura, and both migraine types, but the ICHD diagnostic criteria should be fulfilled to avoid population heterogeneity. In trials focusing on the acute treatment of migraine with aura, subjects with both migraine types can be included, as aura symptoms are recognizable, the attack types are distinguishable, and most people who have migraine with aura also have attacks of migraine without aura. (Refer to Section 2.1 for more information about migraine with aura.) In trials enrolling participants with a history of both types of attacks, the type of the treated attack should be classified according to ICHD criteria based on the clinical features captured in a diary. Note that this requirement may be impractical when subjects are instructed to treat early, because early treatment of migraine can modify the clinical features of an attack and thereby prevent analysis by type (refer to Section 2.2 for more information about early intervention trials). In some instances, after efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in subjects with confirmed diagnoses of migraine without aura and migraine with aura, trials targeting subjects with probable migraine – migraine-like attacks missing one of the features required to fulfil all criteria for a type or subtype of migraine – may be appropriate.

MIGRAINE AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK

Migraine and Cardiovascular Disease: Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis

What was known?.

Migraines affect up to 13% of the population and are significantly more common in women. Up to a third of migraine patients experience aura. A 2004 meta-analysis showed a significant association between ischemic stroke and both migraine with and without aura.

What this study adds.

This updated meta-analysis incorporates data from six new studies, including three large cohort studies (which increased the sample size from roughly 7800 patients to over 210,000 patients). Only well-designed case-control or cohort studies were included. The investigators found that migraine with aura was associated with a two-fold increase in risk for ischemic stroke (RR = 2.16, 95%CI, 1.53–3.03). The risk was higher for women than men (RR = 2.08, 95%CI, 1.13–3.84), those < 45 years (RR = 2.65, 95%CI, 1.41–4.97), smokers (RR = 9.03, 95%CI, 4.22–19.34), and oral contraceptive users (RR = 7.02, 95%CI, 1.51–32.68). Patients with migraine without aura showed no increased risk. There was no association between migraine and myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death.

How should I change my practice?.

Aggressive modification of cardiovascular risk factors and alternatives to estrogen-containing contraceptives should be considered for women with migraine with aura.

### Efficacy and safety of rimegepant 75 mg oral tablet, a CGRP receptor antagonist, for the acute treatment of migraine: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115CRRsb]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Participants

The trial population included males and females aged 18 years and older who had migraine with or without aura according to the criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3 rd Edition, beta version; a 1-year history of attacks lasting about 4 to 72 hours if untreated, with the age of onset prior to 50 years of age; at least 2 and not more than 8 migraine attacks of moderate or severe intensity per month, as well as fewer than 15 days with migraine or nonmigraine headache within the last 3 months. Participants had to be able to distinguish migraine attacks from attacks of tension-type and cluster headache, and those taking preventive migraine medication had to be on a stable dose for at least 3 months before study entry. If they met all other criteria for inclusion, participants with contraindications to triptans could be included. Females of childbearing potential and nonsterile males could participate if they were using 2 acceptable methods of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study; the 2 methods had to include 1 barrier method (eg, condom with spermicidal gel, intrauterine devices, cervical cap, etc.) and 1 other method that could include oral contraceptives or another barrier method. Females also had to have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin) at baseline and could not be breastfeeding.

Participants were excluded if they had any medical condition that might interfere with study assessments of efficacy and safety or expose them to undue risk of a significant adverse event (AE). Participants were also excluded if they had been treated for or showed evidence of alcohol or drug abuse within the past 12 months; had a history of drug or other allergy that made them unsuitable for participation; or had electrocardiogram or laboratory test findings that raised safety or tolerability concerns. Complete criteria for exclusion from the study are available in the study protocol.

Randomization and Blinding

Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio via an interactive web-response system to rimegepant 75 mg oral tablet or placebo for treatment of a single migraine attack of moderate-to-severe pain intensity. Randomization was stratified by the use of preventive migraine medication at randomization (yes or no). All participants, investigators, and study personnel were blinded to treatment assignments.

### Contraindications to hormonal contraception among postpartum women in Texas [^114CV8zD]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Using updated medical eligibility criteria in a sample of low-income, postpartum women, we found that one in five reported a contraindication to combined hormonal contraception, and the prevalence of contraindications to progestin-only methods was considerably lower (1/20 for DMPA and less than 1/100 for progestin-only pills). Consistent with other studies,– migraine with aura and hypertension were the most frequently reported contraindications.

The prevalence of contraindications to hormonal contraception in our study is lower than that reported in another study of low-income Latina women in Texas, which included a larger share of women older than age 30 years. Compared with other studies conducted among reproductive-aged U.S. women, the prevalence of contraindications in our sample is somewhat higher. However, those studies did not assess migraine with aura and lack information on other contraindications.

The proportion of postpartum women with a contraindication is concerning given increasing rates of maternal morbidity and mortality; Texas has among the highest rates in the United States. In addition to age and obesity, factors associated with having a contraindication, our multivariable analysis demonstrated that the prevalence of contraindications was higher among Black women, who already have the highest rates of adverse outcomes for mothers and infants. This underscores the importance of clinician screening for contraindications postpartum to ensure pregnancy-related or chronic conditions are well-managed.

In contrast to prior research that found either no associationor a negative associationbetween health insurance and contraindications, the prevalence of contraindications was higher among insured participants in our sample, perhaps because access to health care resulted in diagnosis of medical conditions associated with contraindications or because participants with medical conditions paid out-of-pocket for insurance. Contraindications were more common among participants who did not have a postpartum visit. Although the reason for this is unclear, this is a missed opportunity to address health needs of those most at risk for adverse outcomes. Further research is needed to validate and further explore this association. Moreover, expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid, by income and immigration status is needed to support maternal health.

Migraine and the combined contraceptive pill?

Women with migraine and active aura have a twofold increased risk of ischaemic stroke. In women aged less than 45 years, smoking and the combined contraceptive pill further increase the stroke risk.NICE recommends avoiding combined hormonal contraceptives in women who have migraine with aura due to the increased risk of stroke. In these patients, we recommend the progesterone-only pill, contraceptive implant, depot or levonorgesterol intrauterine device.

Treating headache in the emergency department

When managing acute, severe headache in the emergency department, our first concern is to identify red flags (see table 4). An accurate headache history is essential and if a true thunderclap or sinister headache is identified this will need investigating.

Table 4
Secondary headaches presenting to the emergency department

When there is a positive diagnosis of severe migraine, its effective management can ensure high-quality patient care and also facilitates a timely discharge. We offer sumatriptan 6 mg, typically with an antiemetic such as metoclopramide or prochlorperazine. A recent systematic review advised against using morphine, tramadol, intramuscular diclofenac, haloperidol or dexamethasone. A period of intravenous rehydration may also help. It is also essential to make a future management plan to help prevent readmissions, which often are multiple in severe migraineurs. Clinicians can review the need for migraine prophylaxis and abortive therapy as an outpatient. A GON block can help patients in crisis before discharge.

### Risk of ischaemic stroke in people with migraine: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^114gpZ6A]. BMJ (2005). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To explore the association between migraine and risk of ischaemic stroke.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Observational studies published between 1966 and June 2004 (identified through Medline and Embase) that examined the association between migraine and risk of ischaemic stroke.

Results

14 studies (11 case-control studies and 3 cohort studies) were identified. These studies suggest that the risk of stroke is increased in people with migraine (relative risk 2.16, 95% confidence interval 1.89 to 2.48). This increase in risk was consistent in people who had migraine with aura (relative risk 2.27, 1.61 to 3.19) and migraine without aura (relative risk 1.83, 1.06 to 3.15), as well as in those taking oral contraceptives (relative risk 8.72, 5.05 to 15.05).

Conclusions

Data from observational studies suggest that migraine may be a risk factor in developing stroke. More studies are needed to explore the mechanism of this potential association. In addition, the risk of migraine among users of oral contraceptives must be further investigated.

Contraceptive and hormone replacement therapy

It is common for stroke to occur in women taking either hormonal based contraceptive therapy or hormone replacement therapy (HRT). There is no evidence from randomised trials that HRT reduces the risk of ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke. This was reviewed in the recent European Stroke Organisation guidelines on stroke in women. On meta-analysis of data from 6 trials and approximately 45,000 participants, there was no difference in rate of ischaemic stroke (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.41). On meta-analysis of data from 5 trials and approximately 35,000 participants, there was no difference in the rate of haemorrhagic stroke (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.15). The use of oestrogen containing combined oral contraceptive treatment has been associated with an increased risk of both myocardial infarction and stroke. In a meta-analysis of 14 studies, the risk of stroke was increased more than two-fold. The risk of stroke with oral contraceptives is higher in people with other cardiovascular risk factors including smoking, increasing age, and in particular with migraine with aura. For example, in this study, the risk of stroke was increased 7-fold in women with migraine with aura taking the contraceptive pill, although there was considerable uncertainty in this estimate. The increased risk is dose related with a reported increase in odds of stroke of 1.2 every 10-μg increment in oestrogen dose. There is less certainty regarding progestogen only contraceptives and they may not increase risk, but data are limited. However, they are the more appropriate choice should oral contraception be required in a high-risk person.

### Migraine and estrogen [^114o3gP4]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim is to systematically and critically review the relationship between migraine and estrogen, the predominant female sex hormone, with a focus on studies published in the last 18 months.

Recent Findings

Recent functional MRI (fMRI) studies of the brain support the existence of anatomical and functional differences between men and women, as well as between participants with migraine and healthy controls. In addition to the naturally occurring changes in endogenous sex hormones over the lifespan (e.g. puberty and menopause), exogenous sex hormones (e.g. hormonal contraception or hormone therapy) also may modulate migraine. Recent data support the historical view of an elevated risk of migraine with significant drops in estrogen levels. In addition, several lines of research support that reducing the magnitude of decline in estrogen concentrations prevents menstrually related migraine (MRM) and migraine aura frequency.

Summary

Current literature has consistently demonstrated that headache, in particular migraine, is more prevalent in women as compared with men, specifically during reproductive years. Recent studies have found differences in headache characteristics, central nervous system anatomy, as well as functional activation by fMRI between the sexes in migraine patients. Although the cause underlying these differences is likely multifactorial, considerable evidence supports an important role for sex hormones. Recent studies continue to support that MRM is precipitated by drops in estrogen concentrations, and minimizing this decline may prevent these headaches. Limited data also suggest that specific regimens of combined hormone contraceptive use in MRM and migraine with aura may decrease both headache frequency and aura.

Thrombophilia and VTE

A previous history of thrombosis is the most significant risk factor for recurrent VTE during pregnancy and postpartum. Among women with pregnancy-related VTE, 20% to 50% have inherited or acquired thrombophilia. Thrombophilia is associated with a 16-fold increased odds of pregnancy-associated stroke. A concurrent PFO may further increase the risk of cerebral embolism. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the treatment of choice for thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy and postpartum due to its relative safety profile. Many professional societies provide guidelines for thrombophrophylaxis in the antepartum and postpartum setting. American Society of Hematology guidelines set a 1% to 4% VTE threshold risk for recommending antepartum prophylaxis and a 1% to 3% VTE risk threshold for recommending postpartum prophylaxis. In the absence of randomized controlled trials, ACOG recommends that the initiation of pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis should be based on individual risk factors, and discussion of the risks and benefits should take place within a multidisciplinary setting.

Migraine with Aura

Migraine with Aura (MA) is well-recognized as a risk factor for ischemic stroke, particularly in young women. The high incidence of PFO in patients with MA is thought to contribute to the 8-fold increased risk of ischemic stroke in MA patients taking combined hormonal contraception, which should be avoided in these individuals. Migraine is also associated with increased risk of preeclampsia and pregnancy-associated stroke. Of note, no evidence supports aspirin for primary stroke prevention in nonpregnant patients with MA.

### Migraine aura or transient ischemic attacks? A five-year follow-up case-control study of women with transient central nervous system disorders in pregnancy [^1126Tr4o]. BMC Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Pregnancy, as well as migraine, are well-known risk factors for cerebrovascular (CV) episodes (transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and stroke). The differentiation of TIAs from migraine aura in pregnancy is a rather common clinical problem. Both disorders consist of transient neurological phenomena stemming from the central nervous system (CNS). To complicate the matter, TIAs may be accompanied by headache and migraine aura often occurs without ensuing headache (International Classification of Headache Disorders, second edition (ICHD-2), category 1.2.3 Typical aura without headache). Migraine is particularly common among fertile women, affecting approximately 20–25% of young and middle aged women in Europe. Although several studies have shown that migraine improves during pregnancy, the migraine worsens in some women, and some women experience their first migraine attack in this period, and particularly migraine with aura (MA).

We have previously reported the occurrence of headache and transient neurological symptoms in a large cohort (n = 1,631) of pregnant women based on questionnaires and interviews. The aim of the present study was, with the help of thorough clinical and laboratory investigations and a follow-up, to ascertain the diagnoses for the neurological symptoms, and the CV risk factors in a sample of women with symptoms or signs indicative of transient CNS disorders during pregnancy. We hoped that this would enable us to formulate guidelines on how to differentiate the two disorders among pregnant women.

### Medical contraindications in women seeking combined hormonal contraception [^112QXGjY]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of medical contraindications in a large group of women seeking combined hormonal contraception (CHC).

Study Design

The Contraceptive CHOICE Project is a prospective cohort study designed to promote the use of long-acting reversible contraceptive methods to reduce unintended pregnancies in the St Louis region. During baseline enrollment, participants were asked about their desired methods of contraception and medical history. Potential medical contraindications were defined as self-reported history of hypertension, myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular accidents, migraines with aura, any migraine and age 35 years or older, smoking in women older than 35 years, venous thromboembolism, or liver disease. We reviewed all research charts of women with self-reported medical contraindications to verify all conditions. Binomial 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated around percentages.

Results

Between August 2007 and December 2009, 5087 women who enrolled in the CHOICE Project provided information about their medical history and 1010 women (19.9%) desired CHC at baseline. Seventy women (6.93%; 95% CI, 5.44–8.68%) were defined as having a potential medical contraindication to CHC at baseline. After chart review, only 24 of 1010 participants desiring CHC (2.38%; 95% CI, 1.53–3.52%) were found to have true medical contraindications to CHC including 17 with hypertension, 2 with migraines with aura, 2 with a history of venous thromboembolism, and 3 smokers aged 35 years or older.

Conclusion

The prevalence of medical contraindications to CHC was very low in this large sample of reproductive-aged women. This low prevalence supports provision of CHC without a prescription.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^1177oyT6]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Migraine — Epidemiology and stroke risk evidence: Migraine affects 14.4% of individuals and disproportionately affects women 15 to 49 years of age with a prevalence between 20% and 30%, and an association between migraine, particularly migraine with aura, and stroke risk has consistently been identified in observational studies; this association is stronger for ischemic stroke than for hemorrhagic stroke and is more evident in young women. Four recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses including a combined total of 49 observational studies (28 cohort studies, 21 case-control studies) reported RRs ranging from 1.3 to 1.6 for any stroke and up to 1.5 for hemorrhagic stroke; migraine with aura confers higher risk for ischemic stroke with a pooled RR of 2.17 (95% CI, 1.78–2.64). A study using insurance claims data from 1.2 million US adults with migraine 18 to 64 years of age found that 18% were at either medium or high risk of vascular events according to comorbidities. Use of combined hormonal contraception in those with migraine with aura is associated with increased risk for ischemic stroke.

### Contraindications to hormonal contraception among postpartum women in Texas [^116Y7R5x]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine the prevalence of contraindications to hormonal contraception among postpartum women.

Methods

Low-income postpartum women who planned to delay childbearing for 2 years or longer after delivery were recruited for a prospective cohort study from eight Texas hospitals. Women self-reported health conditions that corresponded to category 3 and 4 contraindications to combined hormonal contraception and progestin-only methods, based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2016 Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use. We used mixed-effects Poisson regression models to assess characteristics associated with reporting any contraindication 6 months after delivery. We examined the proportion of women who used a contraindicated method.

Results

Of 1,452 women who completed the 6-month interview, 19.1% reported a category 3 or 4 contraindication to combined hormonal contraception (16.8% category 4) and 5.4% reported a contraindication to depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (0.1% category 4). Only 0.8% had any category 3 or 4 contraindication to progestin-only pills and 0.6% to the implant. Migraine with aura (12.4%) and hypertension (4.8%) were the most common contraindications. The prevalence of any contraindication was higher among women who were 30 years or older (prevalence ratio 1.45 95% CI 1.21–1.73), overweight (prevalence ratio 1.39, 95% CI 1.07–1.80), obese (prevalence ratio 1.55, 95% CI 1.16–2.07), and insured (prevalence ratio 1.34, 95% CI 1.04–1.74). Compared with U.S.-born Latina women, the prevalence of contraindications was higher among Black women (prevalence ratio 1.37, 95% CI 1.14–1.64) and lower among foreign-born Latina women (prevalence ratio 0.71, 95% CI 0.59–0.86). Among women with contraindications, 28 (10.3%) were using combined hormonal contraception; six (8%) were using a contraindicated progestin-only method.

Conclusion

Nearly one in five participants had a category 3 or 4 contraindication to combined hormonal contraception. Patients at higher risk for adverse birth outcomes are more likely to have contraindications. Clinicians should counsel on contraception and contraindications prenatally to facilitate the most informed postpartum decision.

RESULTS

Of the 1,700 women enrolled in the study, 1,452 (85.4%) completed the 6-month survey and were included in these analyses. The most commonly reported contraindications included migraine with aura (12.4%), hypertension (4.8%), and gall bladder disease (1.7%); all other contraindications were reported by less than 1.0% of the sample (Table 2). Among participants, 19.1% (278/1,452) had any category 3 or 4 contraindication to combined hormonal contraception (2.3% [34/1,452] category 3 only), and 5.4% (78/1,452) had any category 3 or 4 contraindication to DMPA (5.3% [77/1,452] category 3 only). Only 0.8% (11/1,452) of the sample had any category 3 or 4 contraindication to progestin-only pills and 0.6% (9/1,452) to the implant. A total of 19.1% (278/1,452) of the sample had any contraindication to hormonal contraception (2.3% [34/1,452] category 3 only).

### Estrogens, migraine, and stroke [^117C3vcA]. Stroke (2004). Low credibility.

Epidemiological studies suggest the existence of close but complex relationships between estrogens, migraine, and stroke in women before menopause. Migraine, particularly without aura, is strongly influenced by estrogens as illustrated by the frequency of onset at puberty, of menstrual migraine, and of improvement during pregnancy. Migraine, particularly with aura, is a risk factor for ischemic stroke with a relative risk of 3, further increased by tobacco smoking and oral contraceptive use. The pathophysiological mechanism underlying these close relationships remains unknown. In practice, given the very low absolute risk of stroke in young women, there is no systematic contraindication to oral contraceptive use in young female migraineurs but rather a firm recommendation for no smoking and for the use of low-estrogen-content pills or progestogens only, particularly in migraine with aura.

---

### Norethindrone acetate / ethinyl estradiol (Femlyv) [^115RPFSp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Migraine

FEMLYV is contraindicated in females who have migraines with aura [see Contraindications (4)]. Discontinue FEMLYV in females using FEMLYV who develop new migraines that are recurrent, persistent, or severe. Discontinue FEMLYV if there is an increased frequency or severity of migraines during CHC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event).

Migraines with aura increase the risk for stroke. This stroke risk is further increased in females who have migraines with aura with use of CHCs.

5.4 Malignant Neoplasms

Breast Cancer

FEMLYV is contraindicated in females who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4)].

Epidemiology studies have not found a consistent association between use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and breast cancer risk. Studies do not show an association between ever (current or past) use of COCs and risk of breast cancer. However, some studies report a small increase in the risk of breast cancer among current or recent users (< 6 months since last use) and current users with longer duration of COC use [see Postmarketing Experience (6.2)].

Cervical Cancer

A causal relationship between the use of CHCs and the development of cervical cancer and intraepithelial neoplasia has not been clearly established. In observational studies, the use of oral hormonal contraceptives in females for five years or more, compared to females who did not use oral hormonal contraceptives, was associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer and intraepithelial neoplasia. In these studies, the use of oral hormonal contraceptives in females for 10 years or more, compared to females who received oral hormonal contraceptives for 5–9 years, was associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer and intraepithelial neoplasia. Limitations in these epidemiologic studies include potential recall bias, differences in sexual behavior, and other factors such as establishing whether there were data on persistent high-risk Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection.

### An evidence-based approach to hormonal contraception and headaches [^112DZNVe]. Contraception (2009). Low credibility.

Some controversy exists regarding contraceptive management in women with migraines, particularly migraines with aura. The available scientific literature indicates that combined hormonal contraception is safe with most headache subtypes. However, it should be avoided in women with migraine with aura and women with simple migraines who have other risk factors for stroke. Progestin only contraceptives as well as the copper intrauterine device can be safely used in women with migraines. Accurate classification of a patient's headache type can avoid unnecessary restriction of effective contraceptive methods, particularly those containing estrogen.

### Oestrogen and attacks of migraine with and without aura [^111nfDH9]. The Lancet: Neurology (2004). Medium credibility.

During women's reproductive years, migraine is three times more common than in men of a similar age. Although this female preponderance is commonly assumed to be associated with the additional trigger of fluctuating sex hormones of the menstrual cycle, few studies have been done to confirm or refute this. This review is confined to the relation between oestrogen and attacks of migraine. The evidence for an association between oestrogen "withdrawal" and attacks of migraine without aura is presented, as well as evidence for an association between high oestrogen states and attacks of migraine with aura. Only clinical data are presented here.

### Safety of hormonal contraceptives among women with migraine: a systematic review [^115jBCtr]. Contraception (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is common among women of reproductive age and is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are also associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. Use of hormonal contraception among women with migraine might further elevate the risk of stroke among women of reproductive age.

Objective

To identify evidence regarding the risk of arterial thromboembolism (stroke or myocardial infarction) among women with migraine who use hormonal contraceptives.

Methods

We searched the PubMed database for all articles published from database inception through January 2016. We included studies that examined women with migraine overall or separated by subtype (with or without aura). Hormonal contraceptives of interest included combined hormonal methods (COCs, patch and ring) and progestin-only methods (progestin-only pills, injectables, implants and progestin intrauterine devices).

Results

Seven articles met inclusion criteria. All were case-control studies of fair to poor quality reporting on use of COCs or oral contraceptives (OCs) not further described and all reported stroke outcomes. Four studies demonstrated that, among women with migraine (not separated by subtype), COC use was associated with approximately two to four times the risk of stroke compared with nonuse. The only study to examine specific migraine subtypes found an elevated risk of stroke among women with migraine with aura, and this risk was similar regardless of OC use, although these odds ratios were not reported. Two studies did not report risks among women with migraine and COC use combined, but both found increased risks of stroke with migraine and COC use independently. No evidence was found on other hormonal contraceptives or on risk of myocardial infarction.

Conclusion

Limited evidence suggests a two- to fourfold increased risk of stroke among women with migraine who use COCs compared with nonuse. Additional study is needed on the risks of hormonal contraceptives, including combined and progestin-only methods, among women with different migraine subtypes.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^117EDtQ2]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.1.7. Age at entry

Recommendation:

Adult subjects participating in clinical trials should be between 18 and 65 years of age at entry.

Comments:

Only people who are at least 18 years old can provide informed consent. The inclusion of subjects older than 65 years is encouraged in post-marketing surveillance studies. After age 65, those with migraine are more likely to have (and be taking medications for) coexistent conditions than a younger population, which can confound assessments of safety and drug-drug interactions. Adverse health-related outcomes due to coexistent disease may be difficult to separate from a complication of the treatment under investigation.

1.1.8. Sex

Recommendation:

1.1.8.1. Males and females with migraine are eligible to participate in clinical trials of acute migraine medications.

Comments:

Migraine is at least three times more prevalent in females than in males. Special caution should be taken to avoid enrolling women who may be pregnant or lactating, unless they are the target of the trial. Partners of fertile-age women should practice effective contraception (refer to Section 2.3 for information about menstrual migraine).

1.1.9. Concomitant drug use

Recommendations:

1.1.9.1. Therapies not for migraine

Trials allowing participants to treat conditions other than migraine should pre-specify the permitted uses of concomitant therapies (i.e. open or restricted). The use of contraceptive medication should also be pre-specified. In phase II clinical trials, subjects should not be allowed to treat conditions other than migraine unless pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses have clearly shown a lack of interactions between the intervention being assessed for migraine and the concomitant therapy. In later development trials (i.e. phase III and IV), the treatment of concomitant and comorbid conditions may be specifically permitted with due precautions.

1.1.9.2. Acute migraine treatment

Investigational treatments should not be administered until at least 48 hours after the use of other acute treatments for migraine, including over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, prescription medications, and medical devices.

### Effect of preventive (beta blocker) treatment, behavioural migraine management, or their combination on outcomes of optimised acute treatment in frequent migraine: randomised controlled trial [^115sHEC6]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Participants

We recruited participants from physicians' referrals and local advertisements at two outpatient sites: one site with two offices serving greater Columbus, Ohio, and one site in Athens, Ohio, serving rural southeastern Ohio. Inclusion criteria were age 18 to 65 years, diagnosis of migraine (with or without aura) according to the international classification of headache disorders criteria at two separate evaluations during the evaluation clinic visit, and diary confirmed criteria for severity of migraine during the optimised acute treatment run-in of at least three migraines with disability per 30 days. Exclusion criteria were diagnosis of probable medication overuse headache according to the international classification of headache disorders criteria, a pain disorder other than migraine as the primary presenting problem, 20 or more days with headache a month, contraindication or sensitivity to any study drug, current use of migraine preventive drugs (with participant's preference or welfare contraindicating withdrawal), current psychological treatment, psychiatric disorder needing immediate or priority treatment, and inability to read and understand the study materials; for women, current or planned breast feeding or pregnancy or unwillingness to use an established contraceptive method were also exclusion criteria. All participants gave written informed consent.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^1165RaQb]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.1.4. Frequency of attacks

Recommendations:

1.1.4.1. Attacks of migraine should occur two to eight times per month.

1.1.4.2. The frequency of other headaches (including non-target) must be no greater than 1 day per month.

1.1.4.3. There should be at least 48 hours of freedom from headache between attacks of migraine under study.

1.1.4.4. Subjects should experience fewer than 15 headache days per month.

Comments:

A minimum of two attacks per month is recommended. The maximum frequency of eight attacks per month reduces the probability that those with incipient medication overuse, medication-overuse headache, or chronic migraine will be included in the trial. Allowing 48 hours of freedom from headache between migraine attacks permits clear identification of individual attacks and distinction from relapse, and it avoids the use of multiple treatments for a single prolonged attack. The evaluation of three to five consecutive attacks provides information on consistency of response and may attenuate the placebo effect on the first attack (refer to Section 1.2.12 for more information about consistency of response).

1.1.5. Duration of migraine

Recommendation:

Migraine should be present for at least 1 year prior to inclusion in a clinical trial.

Comments:

Because there are no objective signs or biomarkers for the diagnosis of migraine, and the 1-year requirement increases the specificity of the diagnostic criteria, a minimum course of 1 year is advised to exclude people with headache types that may mimic migraine. The history may be based on subject recall or physician evaluation of medical records. At least five prior attacks of migraine without aura or two prior attacks of migraine with aura are required for diagnoses using ICHD criteria.

1.1.6. Age at onset

Recommendation:

The age at onset of migraine should be less than 50 years.

Comments:

Few adults will be excluded by this criterion, as migraine beginning after the age of 50 years is rare, and the prevalence of secondary headaches or organic diseases mimicking migraine increases after age 50. The inclusion of subjects with onset of migraine after 50 years of age can be considered in phase IV trials, as long as the migraine diagnosis is well established by ICHD criteria, and secondary headaches have been ruled out.

### Norethisterone and its acetate – what's so special about them? [^111tGrTw]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Progestogens (progestins) are widely used for contraception, in postmenopausal hormone therapy, and in treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding and endometriosis. Norethisterone (NET) and its acetate (NETA) differ from other progestogens by their partial conversion to ethinylestradiol (EE). We review their special characteristics and focus on the clinically relevant risk factors associated with estrogen action, such as migraine with aura and risk of thrombosis.

Methods

Narrative review based on a medical literature (OvidMedline and PubMed) search.

Results

NET converts to significant amounts of EE; 10–20mg NET corresponds to 20–30µg EE. The effects of NET on the endometrium are pronounced, making it a good choice for treating abnormal uterine bleeding, endometriosis, and endometrial hyperplasia. NET also has beneficial effects on bone mineral density and positive or neutral effects on cardiovascular health. Conversely, long-term use of NET is associated with a slightly increased breast cancer risk, and the risk of venous thromboembolism is moderately increased. This risk seems to be dose-dependent; contraceptive use carries no risk, but therapeutic doses might be associated with an increased risk. Studies suggest an association between combinations of EE and progestogens and ischaemic stroke, which in particular concerns women with migraine. No studies have, however, assessed this risk related to the therapeutic use of NET.

Conclusions

NET is a potent progestogen, especially when considering the endometrium. Its partial conversion to EE, however, is important to remember. Clinical consideration is required with women at high risk for either breast cancer or thromboembolism, or experiencing migraine with aura.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^111thtin]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Hormonal contraception — recommendations: For individuals considering combined hormonal contraception (CHC), lower doses of ethinyl estradiol are recommended (Class 1, Level B-NR) to minimize potential increased stroke risk. In individuals with specific stroke risk factors (age ≥ 35 years, tobacco use, hypertension, or migraine with aura) who are considering contraception, shared decision-making is recommended (Class 1, Level C-EO) to determine the best contraceptive choice to balance the risk of stroke from contraception and the risk of stroke with pregnancy. In individuals with these stroke risk factors considering contraception, progestin-only contraception or nonhormonal contraception is reasonable (Class 2a, Level C-LD) to reduce the increased stroke risk associated with estrogen-containing contraception.

Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Counseling for patients of childbearing potential — risk counseling notes that topiramate and valproate have well-demonstrated teratogenic effects, especially when used in polytherapy, and valproate use during pregnancy is also associated with developmental disorders in offspring; an FDA black box warning regarding fetal risk from valproate use exists as of the time of this guideline. It further states that topiramate at a daily dose of 200 mg or less does not interact with oral combined hormonal contraceptives; however, at higher doses it can have drug interactions that decrease their effectiveness, and that the risk of major congenital malformation in offspring of women with epilepsy taking antiepileptics is possibly decreased by folic acid supplementation. Clinically, clinicians must consider the teratogenic effect of topiramate and valproate in their choice of migraine prevention therapy recommendations to patients of childbearing potential (Level A).

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — headaches: Nonmigraine (mild or severe) is category 1; migraine without aura (includes menstrual migraine) is category 2; migraine with aura is category 4. Clarification highlights that aura is a specific focal neurologic symptom and that any new headaches or marked changes in headaches should be evaluated. Evidence notes that among women with migraine, oral contraceptive use is associated with about a threefold increased risk for ischemic stroke compared with nonuse, that the risk for ischemic stroke is increased among women using COCs compared with nonuse, and that it is increased among women with migraine with aura compared with women without migraine; menstrual migraine is a subtype of migraine without aura.

### Effectiveness of the progestin-only pill for migraine treatment in women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116TcGCz]. Cephalalgia (2018). Low credibility.

Background Migraine is highly prevalent in women (18%). Peak morbidity affects their most productive years, coinciding with peak fertility. Hormonal contraception is often tailored for migraine prevention. Estrogen-containing contraceptives may be contraindicated in women experiencing migraine with aura due to the risk of vascular events. While improvements in migraine with a progestin-only pill (POP), which inhibits ovulation are documented, the strength and quality of evidence has not been formally evaluated. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of progestin-only contraceptives for migraine treatment by systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources and selection MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Libraries were searched (1980 to September 2016) for studies on progestin-only treatments for migraine. Studies in English on > 4 non-menopausal women aged 18–50 with migraine diagnosed by formal criteria were included. Data extraction and analysis Data were quality-assessed using the GRADE system. A random effects model was used for pooled analyses. Results Pooled analyses of four studies demonstrated that desogestrel 75mcg/day, POP significantly but modestly reduced the number of migraine attacks and migraine days. Reduced intensity and duration, reduced analgesic and triptan use were observed, along with improved headache-related quality of life. GRADE analysis indicated evidence was low to very low for each outcome measure. Adverse effects resulted in treatment cessation for < 10% of participants. Two studies compared desogestrel POP to a combined oral contraceptive, demonstrating similar migraine outcomes for both treatments. Conclusions The desogestrel POP shows promise in improving migraine in women. Current evidence is observational and based on small samples of women using only one oral progestin-only formulation. Further randomized trials on additional progestin-only contraceptives are required to confirm their role in migraine management.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^115Yruv2]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Combined hormonal contraception (CHC) — age and risk factor interactions are described, with marked age-related increases and synergistic effects. With CHC, stroke risk increased with age, growing from 3.4 to 64.4 events per 100 000 person-years for individuals 15 to 49 years of age, and risk is higher especially when 35 years of age is used as a cutoff. CHC synergistically increases the risk of hypertension up to 4-fold, smoking up to 3-fold, and migraine with aura up to 6-fold, and higher estrogen doses significantly increased the risk of stroke in those who smoke. Progestin-only contraception in all routes is not associated with an overall increased stroke risk, but in the setting of hypertension progestin-only contraception can increase stroke risk. In RATIO data, higher risk of stroke in women with cardiovascular risk factors than women without was seen in combinations containing 30 μg of estrogen plus second or third-generation progestins, whereas the different generations of progestin stroke risk did not differ in women without stroke risk factors.

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (amethyst) [^115G6YnC]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

c. Cerebrovascular Diseases

Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (> 35 years), hypertensive women who also smoke. Hypertension was found to be a risk factor for both users and nonusers, for both types of strokes, while smoking interacted to increase the risk for hemorrhagic strokes. Transient ischemic attacks have also been associated with oral contraceptive use.

In a large study, the relative risk of thrombotic strokes has been shown to range from 3 for normotensive users to 14 for users with severe hypertension. The relative risk of hemorrhagic stroke is reported to be 1.2 for nonsmokers who used oral contraceptives, 2.6 for smokers who did not use oral contraceptives, 7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.8 for normotensive users and 25.7 for users with severe hypertension. The attributable risk is also greater in older women. Oral contraceptives also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors such as certain inherited or acquired thrombophilias. Women with migraine (particularly migraine/headaches with focal neurological symptoms such as aura) who take combination oral contraceptives may be at an increased risk of stroke. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS).

d. Dose-Related Risk of Vascular Disease from Oral Contraceptives

A positive association has been observed between the amount of estrogen and progestogen in oral contraceptives and the risk of vascular disease. A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins (HDL) has been reported with many progestational agents. A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins has been associated with an increased incidence of ischemic heart disease. Because estrogens increase HDL cholesterol, the net effect of an oral contraceptive depends on a balance achieved between doses of estrogen and progestogen and the nature and absolute amount of progestogen used in the contraceptive. The amount of both hormones should be considered in the choice of an oral contraceptive.

Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen is in keeping with good principles of therapeutics. For any particular estrogen/progestogen combination, the dosage regimen prescribed should be one which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and the needs of the individual patient. New acceptors of oral contraceptive agents should be started on preparations containing the lowest estrogen content which is judged appropriate for the individual patient.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^116rybPg]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Step 5: Preventive treatment

Initiation and termination

In patients whose migraine continues to impair their quality of life despite optimized acute therapy, additional preventive therapy should be considered (Table 4). In practice, patients who are considered for preventive treatment remain adversely affected on at least 2 days per month, although this should not be regarded as an absolute rule. Aside from migraine frequency, clinicians should always consider factors such as the severity of attacks, the duration of attacks (for example, menstruation-related attacks tend to last longer) and migraine-related disability. A further indication for preventive therapy is overuse of acute medication.

Table 4
Preventive migraine treatment

SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. a Sodium valproate is absolutely contraindicated in women of childbearing potential.

Efficacy of preventive therapy is rarely observed immediately. Only after several weeks or months can efficacy be ascertained, so patients should be discouraged from abandoning the treatment in these early stages on the grounds of apparent inefficacy. If a therapeutic dose of an oral preventive medication is ineffective after 2–3 months, an alternative should be tried. For monoclonal antibody treatments that target calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or its receptor, efficacy should be assessed only after 3–6 months. For onabotulinumtoxinA, efficacy should be assessed after 6–9 months.

Failure of one preventive treatment does not predict failure of treatment with other drug classes, except when failure is due to poor adherence. Treatment adherence is often very poor but can be improved by simplified dosing schedules (once daily or less). For most preventive medications, clinical experience suggests that pausing can be considered when treatment has been successful for 6–12 months. The purpose of pausing is to ascertain whether preventive treatment can be stopped, which minimizes the risk of unnecessary drug exposure and allows some patients to manage their migraine with acute medications only. A useful measure to quantify the degree of preventive treatment success is to calculate the percentage reduction in monthly migraine days or monthly headache days of moderate-to-severe intensity. However, a pragmatic approach is needed and clinicians should decide to pause preventive therapy on a case-by-case basis.

### Migraine headache: an under-appreciated risk factor for cardiovascular disease in women [^111XPWFS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Also, a knowledge gap exists about whether controlling migraine symptoms and use of long‐term combination cardiovascular preventive therapy (eg, beta‐blockers, statins, aspirin, etc) might reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, particularly stroke. Triptans are commonly used to abort moderate to severe attacks of migraine. Although triptans exert vasoconstrictive effects, studies indicate that triptan use does not increase cardiovascular risk in patients with migraine. 59 Use of NSAIDs should be limited to acute migraine attacks, to mitigate long‐term risks of cardiovascular events associated with chronic NSAID therapy. Moreover, both agents (ie, NSAIDs and triptans) should be avoided in pregnant women and those with cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and focus on prevention of attacks and using other analgesic agents should be entertained.

Patients with migraine should be counseled about a healthy lifestyle such as regular physical activity, smoking cessation, and modification of other traditional CVD risks (eg, blood pressure control and weight loss). For example, a study of elderly patients with migraine found significant interaction between migraine and smoking for the risk of stroke and combined vascular events, such that migraine was associated with an increased risk of stroke and vascular events among active smokers but not among non‐smokers. 44 These findings highlight the importance of smoking cessation. As population‐based studies have demonstrated that patients with migraine are more likely to smoke, have high blood pressure, unfavorable cholesterol profile, and report a parental history of premature myocardial infarction, 60 it is important to identify those patients who might benefit from traditional risk factor modification. A recent European position document has suggested that hormonal contraceptive use, particularly combined therapy, might further increase ischemic stroke risk in those with migraine, especially those with aura. 61 This recommendation is consistent with American Heart Association guidelines for stroke in women, which cautions against use of hormonal contraceptives, but notes that the evidence is not conclusive. 62

### Improving combined contraceptive pill / oral contraceptives prescribing in general practice [^1126J73F]. BMJ Open Quality (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

The vast majority of contraceptive provision occurs in the primary care setting and comprehensive national guidelines exist for the safe and quality provision of the COCP (as summarised below).

Faculty of sexual and reproductive health

Guidance recommends assessing medical eligibility by establishing and documenting the following: blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), history of migraine, cardiovascular risk factors (including thrombophilia and previous venous thromboembolism (VTE) and smoking status), current and previous medical conditions, family history and use of enzyme-inducing medications. Each criterion corresponds to a UKMEC category as follows:

UKMEC category 1: A condition where there is no restriction for use of this method

UKMEC category 2: A condition where the advantages of this method generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks

UKMEC category 3: A condition where the theoretical or proven risks generally outweigh the advantages of using the method (advise specialist advice sought)

UKMEC category 4: A condition that represents unacceptable health risk if the method is used

Following an initial comprehensive COCP check, FSRH then advocates a pill check 3 months after initiation followed by annual pill checks subsequently.

### The use of hormonal contraceptives in fertility treatments: a committee opinion [^115Hr3n5]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Progestin-only pill (POP) as an alternative — risk profile and reproductive effects indicate that one alternative to combination hormonal contraception in those patients with risk factors for use is the progestin-only pill (POP), and available evidence demonstrates that POP use does not increase the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with menstrual migraines and may be an acceptable alternative. Women with hypertension using a POP have a slightly increased risk of cardiovascular events compared with those not using this method, and it is also contraindicated in patients with active or recent (< 5 years) breast cancer. Disadvantages in reproductive medicine include a higher risk of irregular vaginal bleeding and functional ovarian cysts, with approximately 20%-30% of users experiencing intermenstrual bleeding or spotting, which is a common reason for discontinuation and is most frequent on initiation. In a study of 21 women using a POP for at least 6 months, functional cysts were noted in 8 on initial examination, and four of the 13 women without cysts at baseline subsequently developed new functional cysts associated with symptoms in 2; the use of POP before IVF is less likely to suppress cyst formation or premature follicular development.

### Fertility treatment and oral contraceptive discontinuation for identification of pregnancy planning in routinely collected health data-an application to analgesic and antibiotic utilisation [^112C7DaR]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitations

A limitation of our chosen proxies for pregnancy planning is the inability to assess pregnancy planning in women who did not use contraception, or who used other types of contraception than short-acting hormonal. This meant that only 24.2% of the population could be classified by proxies for pregnancy intention. We did not include women without short-acting hormonal contraceptive use as a control group in our study, as they are likely a heterogeneous group of women who plan pregnancies, and women who do not plan pregnancies, but use other types of contraception. Furthermore, we ascertained that women were under observation for 1 year before the start of pregnancy by identifying prescription fills in NorPD. For women without contraceptive or fertility treatment use, 1 year of look-back would only be available if they had filled other prescriptions, thus introducing different selection criteria among the groups. Some conditions, including migraine with aura, hypertension, or a history of thromboembolic disorders, are considered contraindications for using hormonal contraceptives, and so women with these diagnoses are likely under-represented in our sample. We did not have information on migraine or thromboembolic disorders, but we found a similar prevalence of chronic hypertension in women on OC and women who were excluded from our study sample (Additional file 9). The main differences between included and excluded women were that included women were younger and more often nulliparous. Hence, our findings on patterns of prescription fills in peri-pregnancy may not be generalisable to the entire pregnant population. However, our findings regarding the selected proxies for pregnancy planning should be applicable to other settings that have the same availability of fertility treatment and similar use contraceptive medications.

5.7 Adverse Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects

Hyperglycemia

TWIRLA is contraindicated in diabetic women over age 35, or women who have diabetes with hypertension, nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, other vascular disease, or women with diabetes of > 20 years duration [see Contraindications (4)]. TWIRLA may decrease glucose tolerance. Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are using TWIRLA.

Dyslipidemia

Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. TWIRLA may cause adverse lipid changes.

Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may have an increase in serum triglyceride concentrations when using TWIRLA, which may increase the risk of pancreatitis.

5.8 Headache

TWIRLA is contraindicated in women who have headaches with focal neurological symptoms or have migraine headaches with aura, and in women over age 35 years who have migraine headaches with or without aura [see Contraindications (4)].

If a woman using TWIRLA develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue TWIRLA if indicated. Consider discontinuation of TWIRLA if there is any increased frequency or severity of migraines during CHC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event).

### Effects of an estrogen-free, desogestrel-containing oral contraceptive in women with migraine with aura: a prospective diary-based pilot study [^115yhZur]. Contraception (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine with aura (MA) is a contraindication to the use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) because of the increased risk of ischemic stroke. Progestogen-only contraceptive pill (POP) is a safe alternative to COCs and it is preferable in women with cerebrovascular diseases or risk factors for stroke.

Study Design

Prospective diary-based pilot study. Thirty women with MA (n = 15 who have never used COCs and n = 15 who had previously used COCs were diagnosed according to the International Headache Society criteria. The observational period lasted 9 months during which women filled in a diary with the clinical characteristics of headache attacks. After a 3-month run-in period, each subject received an estrogen-free desogestrel (DSG) (75 mcg/day)-containing OC (Cerazette(®); Schering-Plough, formerly NV Organon, Oss, The Netherlands). Follow-up evaluations were planned at the end of the third and sixth month of treatment.

Results

The number (mean ± S.D.) of migraine attacks was significantly reduced both in previous COCs users (from 3.9 ± 1.0 to 2.9 ± 0.8; p < .001) and nonusers (from 3.2 ± 0.9 to 2.6 ± 1.3; p < .02) following 6 months of POP use in comparison with the run-in period. Duration of headache pain did not differ significantly in both groups throughout the study. Interestingly enough, a beneficial POP effect on the duration (mean ± S.D.) of visual aura (from 16.3 ± 9.5 to 11.4 ± 5.6 min) and on the total duration (mean ± S.D.) of neurological symptoms (from 33.6 ± 23.3 to 18.6 ± 18.0 min) was only significantly reported by previous COCs users (p < .001, for both) by the end of the study period. The POP was well tolerated by each woman and the bleeding pattern was variable with a tendency towards infrequent bleeding.

Conclusions

The present study supports the use of the POP containing desogestrel in a population of women with MA and underlines a positive effect on symptoms of aura, especially in MA sensitive to previous use of COCs.

### Understanding migraine headaches in women… [^1174hzCC]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Throughout the childbearing years, migraine headache is two to three times more prevalent in women than in men. In addition, migraine has special features in women, principally menstrually-synchronized migraine attacks, safety issues for using oral contraceptives, and changes associated with pregnancy and menopause. Matharu and colleagues review these and other aspects of migraine in women. A headache diary may be necessary to confirm the relationship between migraine and menstruation, especially if periods are irregular. Prophylactic medication for two days before the anticipated onset of menstruation is recommended, using naproxen or fenoprofen. Mefenamic acid is recommended if the patient also has dysmenorrhea. Perimenstrual estrogen supplementation, such as the 100-mcg transdermal estrogen patch, also can be effective. In severe cases, danazol, tamoxifen, and bromocriptine have been used.

In women with migraine, the headaches may worsen, improve, or not change when they are taking combined oral contraceptives. If migraine occurs, it is most likely to be at times of estrogen withdrawal. This result can be countered by continuous use of OCPs, but women may find the associated irregular bleeding unacceptable. The most serious concern in women with migraine who are taking OCPs is increased risk of ischemic stroke. The risk is small, increasing from a rate of 5 to 10 per 100, 000 women-years in women without migraine to a rate of 17 to 19 per 100, 000 women-years in those with migraine. The risk is greatest in women with migraine with aura and in those with additional risk factors, such as new persisting headache or new-onset migraine aura. The authors recommend screening women for risk factors, using the lowest possible dosage of estrogen, and avoiding the use of OCPs in women who have migraine with aura.

Approximately 60 to 70 percent of women with migraine experience relief during pregnancy. Treatment options are restricted in attacks that occur in the pregnant patient because ergotamines and triptans are not recommended in this group. Acetaminophen may be used for analgesia. Ibuprofen and naproxen are not recommended close to delivery but may provide relief earlier in pregnancy. Several antiemetics, such as metoclo-pramide, chlorpromazine, prochlorperazine, and promethazine, are regarded as safe for use during pregnancy.

5.2 Hyperkalemia

NEXTSTELLIS is contraindicated in females with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (e.g., renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Females receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Monitor serum potassium concentration in females at increased risk for hyperkalemia (i.e., those females who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly with NEXTSTELLIS) [see Drug interactions (7)]. Monitor females taking NEXTSTELLIS who later develop medical conditions and/or begin medication that put them at an increased risk for hyperkalemia.

NEXTSTELLIS contains drospirenone, a progestin, which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk females, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. In two Phase 3 trials of NEXTSTELLIS (N = 3,632) for the prevention of pregnancy in females 16–50 years of age, seven subjects were noted to have hyperkalemia and one subject discontinued due to elevated potassium levels. Most females who developed hyperkalemia in the clinical development studies of NEXTSTELLIS had only mild potassium elevations and/or isolated increases that returned to normal while still on study medication.

5.3 Hypertension

NEXTSTELLIS is contraindicated in females with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see Contraindications (4)]. For all females, including those with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure periodically and stop NEXTSTELLIS if blood pressure rises significantly.

An increase in blood pressure has been reported in females using COCs. This increase is more likely in older females with extended duration of use.

5.4 Migraine

NEXTSTELLIS is contraindicated in females who have migraines with aura [see Contraindications (4)]. Discontinue NEXTSTELLIS in females using NEXTSTELLIS who develop new migraines that are recurrent, persistent, or severe. Discontinue NEXTSTELLIS if there is an increased frequency or severity of migraines during CHC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event).

Migraines with aura increase the risk for stroke. This stroke risk is further increased in females who have migraines with aura with use of CHCs.

Clinical context for preventive therapy selection underscores individualized care and study limitations: "Treatment regimens, therefore, need to be designed case by case, which may include complex or even nontraditional approaches". "A shortcoming of migraine prevention clinical studies is the relatively brief treatment duration (often only 12–16 weeks)". "Long-term assessment of the efficacy and safety of migraine preventive treatments is needed". Additional considerations include that "It seems reasonable that a clinician be mindful of comorbid and coexistent conditions in patients with migraine, to maximize potential treatment efficacy and minimize AE risk", and "Because migraine is frequent in women of childbearing age, the potential for adverse fetal effects related to migraine prevention strategies is particularly concerning".

### Comparative effects of drug interventions for the acute management of migraine episodes in adults: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115vweTZ]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Additional analyses

We evaluated possible heterogeneity of treatment effects using bayesian network meta-regressions for sex assigned at birth and presence of aura. To evaluate the robustness of our findings, we carried out the following sensitivity analyses on our primary outcomes: trials only with doses licensed by the FDA, with low risk of bias, with participants experiencing moderate or severe headache, with a diagnosis of menstrual related migraine, splitting nodes with high and low doses, assessed the effect of placebo response, excluding studies with participants with medical comorbidity, or excluding studies that allowed the use of preventive drugs.

Patient and public involvement

We discussed the aims and design of this study with members of the public, including those who had experienced migraine (one patient representative is a coauthor of this paper and has been involved in all stages of the project). We used their feedback to guide the selection of outcomes for the study and inform the interpretation of the results presented in this manuscript. Three members of the research team conducted statistical analyses and presented the results in a blinded fashion (ie, the names of the interventions were masked to reduce bias from previous experience or knowledge) to two independent panels of expert clinicians and patient representatives from international organisations in Argentina, Canada, Europe, and the US.

### Use of combined hormonal contraceptives among… stacks… [^111y9Xv4]. stacks.cdc.gov (2016). Low credibility.

Use of combined hormonal contraceptives among women with migraines and risk of ischemic stroke Supporting Files 5 2017 By Champaloux, Steven W.; Tepper, Naomi K.; Monsour, Michael;. File Language: English. Details Alternative Title: Am J Obstet Gynecol Personal Author: Description: BACKGROUND: Migraine with aura and combined hormonal contraceptives are independently associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. However, little is known about whether there are any joint effects of migraine and hormonal contraceptives on risk of stroke. OBJECTIVE: We sought to estimate the incidence of stroke in women of reproductive age and examine the association among combined hormonal contraceptive use, migraine type, and ischemic stroke. STUDY DESIGN: Migraine headache with and without aura was identified using inpatient or outpatient diagnosis codes.

Current combined hormonal contraceptive use was identified using the National Drug Code from the pharmacy database. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of ischemic stroke by migraine type and combined hormonal contraceptive use. Compared to those with neither migraine nor combined hormonal contraceptive use, the odds ratio of ischemic stroke was highest among those with migraine with aura using combined hormonal contraceptives; odds ratios were also elevated. for migraine with aura without combined hormonal contraceptive use, migraine without aura and combined hormonal contraceptive use, and migraine without aura without combined hormonal contraceptive use.

CONCLUSION: The joint effect of combined hormonal contraceptives and migraine with aura was associated with a 6-fold increased risk of ischemic stroke compared with neither risk factor. Use of combined hormonal contraceptives did not substantially further increase risk of ischemic stroke among women with migraine without aura. Determining migraine type is critical in assessing safety of combined hormonal contraceptives among women with migraine.

Provider considerations before using combined hormonal contraception in fertility patients — providers should be aware of US Medical Eligibility Criteria and RR categories and assess comorbidities including advanced age, smoking, migraine with aura, venous thromboembolic risks, and cardiovascular disease; a migraine history should be elicited before starting combination methods. Women with migraine on combination hormonal contraception had 3 times higher odds of ischemic stroke than those with migraine not using combined methods, with an OR of 3.81 for migraine with aura and an OR of 2.97 for migraine without aura.

b. Thromboembolism

An increased risk of thromboembolic and thrombotic disease associated with the use of oral contraceptives is well established. Case control studies have found the relative risk of users compared to non-users to be 3 for the first episode of superficial venous thrombosis, 4 to 11 for deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and 1.5 to 6 for women with predisposing conditions for venous thromboembolic disease. Cohort studies have shown the relative risk to be somewhat lower, about 3 for new cases and about 4.5 for new cases requiring hospitalization. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives is not related to length of use and disappears after pill use is stopped.

A two- to four-fold increase in relative risk of postoperative thromboembolic complications has been reported with the use of oral contraceptives. The relative risk of venous thrombosis in women who have predisposing conditions is twice that of women without such medical conditions. If feasible, oral contraceptives should be discontinued at least four weeks prior to and for two weeks after elective surgery of a type associated with an increase in risk of thromboembolism and during and following prolonged immobilization. Since the immediate postpartum period is also associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, oral contraceptives should be started no earlier than four to six weeks after delivery in women who elect not to breastfeed.

c. Cerebrovascular diseases

Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risk of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes) although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (> 35 years), hypertensive women who also smoke. Hypertension was found to be a risk factor for both users and nonusers, for both types of strokes, while smoking interacted to increase the risk for hemorrhagic strokes.

In a large study, the relative risk of thrombotic strokes has been shown to range from 3 for normotensive users to 14 for users with severe hypertension. The relative risk of hemorrhagic stroke is reported to be 1.2 for nonsmokers who used oral contraceptives, 2.6 for smokers who did not use oral contraceptives, 7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.8 for normotensive users and 25.7 for users with severe hypertension. The attributable risk is also greater in older women. Oral contraceptives also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors such as certain inherited or acquired thrombophilias, hyperlipidemias, and obesity. Women with migraine (particularly migraine with aura) who take combination oral contraceptives may be at an increased risk of stroke.

Study Patients

Patients were required to be previously diagnosed with episodic migraine, with or without aura, as defined by International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3), and to have had the diagnosis for ≥ 1 year. Additional inclusion criteria were as follows: male or female, aged 18 to 75 years; migraine onset prior to 50 years of age; history of episodic migraine (ICHD-3) with 2–8 monthly attacks (with or without aura), ≤ 14 headache days per month, and ≥ 48 hours of headache-free time between attacks; reported usual migraine pain (without treatment) of 2 (moderate) or 3 (severe) on headache pain severity scale (range 0–3); able to differentiate between migraine and a tension-type or cluster headache; if female and of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test was required at all study visits; female patients were required not to be lactating, not to be planning to become pregnant, and to practice reliable birth control or abstinence throughout the study. Participants had to read, speak, and understand English proficiently, to provide written, informed consent, and to be willing and, in the opinion of the investigator, able to comply with study procedures and scheduling.

Exclusion criteria were as follows: prior exposure to celecoxib oral solution; intolerance to any celecoxib or sulfonamide formulation, or significant AEs or contraindications related to other NSAIDs (eg, due to gastrointestinal bleed, ulcer, or history of acute renal failure); treatment with an investigational drug or device within 30 days of randomization, or participation in a central nervous system clinical trial within 2 months of randomization. Patients were also excluded if they had experienced medication overuse in the 90 days before screening, defined as opioids or combination medications, including barbiturates, used ≥ 10 days; NSAIDs or other simple medications (such as over the counter medications) > 14 days per month; and triptans or ergots ≥ 10 days per month. Alcohol or substance use disorder identified within 12 months of screening, a positive urine drug screen for recreational drugs or alcohol, or prescription drug use not explained by disclosed concomitant medication use also excluded patients from participation.

### Migraine and menopause-a narrative review [^115dER7k]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Importance and Objectives

This narrative review addresses common clinical questions and concerns of both physicians and patients about migraine during and after the perimenopausal transition, specifically (1) How does the perimenopausal transition affect migraine prevalence and does this vary by migraine type? (2) Does the magnitude of stroke risk associated with migraine increase with hormone therapy (HT)?, and (3) What are best practices as regards migraine treatment in perimenopausal women?

Methods

We searched PubMed from 2010 through the present. Search terms included migraine, menopause, and HT. Articles were included if they were in English and had full text availability. In addition, key references identified in the search articles were included.

Discussion and Conclusion

Many women are informed that their migraines will disappear postmenopause; there are some data to support this, but a specific time frame has not been evidenced. Stroke risk in women with migraine with aura is small in absolute terms, but important at the population level, because migraine is so prevalent. The risk becomes clinically important in the context of additional stroke risk factors, which increase with aging such as hypertension. Estrogen in combined hormonal contraception increases the risk of an ischemic stroke, however, the lower amount of estrogen in HT may not contribute to a meaningful increase in stroke risk. HT is a preventative sex-specific treatment for female migraineurs for the menopausal transition. Sex differences for other conventional treatments outside their use in menstrual and menstrually related migraine have not been studied specifically in the menopausal transition.

### Headache and female hormones: what you need to know [^114onSBo]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

The normal female lifecycle is associated with hormonal milestones, including menarche, pregnancy, contraceptive use, menopause, and the use of replacement sex hormones. Attacks of migraine without aura, but not with aura, are more likely to occur 2 days before onset and on the first 2 days of menses, but they are not more severe than those that occur outside the perimenstrual period. Oral sumatriptan and naratriptan are effective as short-term perimenstrual prophylaxis. Postdural headache can occur during the postpartum period. The International Headache Society Task Force assessed the efficacy of treatment of women who had migraine with combined oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, as well as the risk of ischemic stroke associated with their use. There is no contraindication to the use of oral contraceptives in women with migraine in the absence of migraine aura or other risk factors. There is a potentially increased risk of ischemic stroke in women with migraine who are using combined oral contraceptives and have additional risk factors that cannot easily be controlled, including migraine with aura. There is no compelling evidence that postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy either decreases or increases stroke risk.

Pregnant and breastfeeding women

Migraine often remits during pregnancy, but if treatment is continued, the potential for harm to the fetus demands special consideration. Despite relatively poor efficacy, paracetamol should be used as the first-line medication for acute treatment of migraine in pregnancy; NSAIDs can be used only during the second trimester. Triptans should be used only under the strict supervision of a specialist, as the safety data available are limited and originate from post-marketing surveillance; most data relate to the use of sumatriptan. For nausea associated with migraine in pregnancy, metoclopramide can be used.

Preventive migraine medications are best avoided during pregnancy owing to the potential for fetal harm. However, if preventive therapy is considered clinically indicated because of frequent and disabling migraine attacks, the best available safety data support the use of propranolol or, if propranolol is contraindicated, amitriptyline. Both should be used under specialist supervision to adequately monitor any potential fetal harm. Topiramate, candesartan and sodium valproate are contraindicated; sodium valproate is known to be teratogenic, so must not be used, and the use of topiramate and candesartan is associated with adverse effects on the fetus.

Migraine medication therapy in the post-partum period also requires caution because of potential risks to the infant. Paracetamol is the preferred acute medication, although ibuprofen and sumatriptan are also considered safe. If preventive medication is required, propranolol is the recommended first choice as it has the best safety profile. Pharmacological treatments for migraine during pregnancy and breastfeeding have been reviewed in more detail elsewhere.

Women with menstrual migraine

Approximately 8% of women with migraine experience migraine attacks that are exclusively related to their menstruation, referred to as pure menstrual migraine. If optimized acute medication therapy does not suffice for these patients, initiation of perimenstrual preventive treatment should be considered. This approach typically involves daily intake of a long-acting NSAID (for example, naproxen) or triptan (for example, frovatriptan or naratriptan) for 5 days, beginning 2 days before the expected first day of menstruation –. Some women with pure menstrual migraine without aura benefit from continuous use (that is, without a break) of combined hormonal contraceptives. By contrast, combined hormonal contraceptives are contraindicated in women with migraine with aura regardless of any association with their menstrual cycle, owing to an associated increase in the risk of stroke.

### Headache as a side effect of combination estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives: a systematic review [^1173hfFF]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

We conducted a 2-part systematic review of published studies to examine the evidence that combination oral contraceptives can aggravate or cause headache.

Study Design

We used trials with a control group to assess headache risk that was attributable to oral contraceptive use and prospective cohort trials to answer important clinical questions about the natural history and treatment response of headache that occurs with oral contraceptive use.

Results

Because of differences in study populations, oral contraceptive formulations, trial end points and trial duration, it was not possible to pool data; but the evidence supports several conclusions. There is little indication that oral contraceptives have a clinically important effect on headache activity in most women.

Conclusion

Headache that occurs during early cycles of oral contraceptive use tends to improve or disappear with continued use. No evidence supports the common clinical practice of switching oral contraceptives to treat headache; however, manipulating the extent or duration of estrogen withdrawal may provide benefit.

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (vienva) [^113q7oLx]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8. Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects

Oral contraceptives have been shown to cause glucose intolerance in a significant percentage of users. Carefully monitor females with prediabetes and diabetes who are using levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol. Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol may decrease glucose tolerance.

A small proportion of women will have persistent hypertriglyceridemia while on COCs. As discussed earlier (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS), changes in serum triglycerides and lipoprotein levels have been reported in oral-contraceptive users.

9. Elevated Blood Pressure

Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). For all females, including those with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure at routine visits and stop levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol if blood pressure rises significantly.

An increase in blood pressure has been reported in females using CHCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The effect of CHCs on blood pressure may vary according to the progestin in the CHC.

10. Headache

Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol is contraindicated in females who have headaches with focal neurological symptoms or have migraine headaches with aura, and in women over age 35 years who have migraine head aches with or without aura.

### Use of combined oral contraceptives among women with migraine and nonmigrainous headaches: a systematic review [^111Z3xwM]. Contraception (2006). Low credibility.

This systematic review examines evidence evaluating whether women with headaches who use combined oral contraceptives (COCs) have a greater risk of stroke than women with headaches who do not use COCs. We searched MEDLINE for articles published from 1966 through March 2005 relevant to headaches and COC use as risk factors for stroke. Of the 79 articles identified, nine met our selection criteria (eight reports of six observational studies plus one meta-analysis). All studies reported specifically on migraine headaches. Evidence from six case-control studies suggested that COC users with a history of migraine were two to four times as likely to have an ischemic stroke as nonusers with a history of migraine. The odds ratios for ischemic stroke ranged from 6 to almost 14 for COC users with migraine compared with nonusers without migraine. The three studies that provided evidence on hemorrhagic stroke reported low or no risk associated with migraine or with COC use.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^113FjpDX]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Migraine — secondary stroke prevention considerations: Migraine has been associated with ischemic stroke and white matter hyperintensities in numerous studies, and in patients with migraine who have had an ischemic stroke, data on the risk of recurrent stroke are limited and conflicting. On the basis of these limited data, practitioners may consider implementing preventive treatments to reduce migraine frequency in patients with migraine and prior ischemic stroke, and avoiding oral contraceptive agents with exogenous estrogen in women with migraine with aura and prior ischemic stroke may perhaps be appropriate. Observational studies provide conflicting evidence about the association between triptan therapy and stroke risk and excluded patients with prior ischemic stroke; there are theoretical risks with calcitonin gene–related peptide receptor antagonists but clinical evidence is lacking, therefore no recommendations can be made for the use of triptans and calcitonin gene–related peptide receptor antagonists in patients with migraine and prior ischemic stroke.
