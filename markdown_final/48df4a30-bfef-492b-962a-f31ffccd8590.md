## Question

Does long qt syndrome lead to torsades

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether long QT syndrome leads to torsades de pointes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions of long QT syndrome and torsades de pointes. Then, I should verify the mechanistic link between prolonged repolarization and torsades initiation. Next, I will review epidemiologic and guideline-based risk data to quantify the relationship. After that, I should consider modifiers that increase or decrease risk, including QTc thresholds, triggers, and genetics. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically sound conclusion and outline practical implications for management and monitoring.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate entities. Long QT syndrome is characterized by pathologic prolongation of ventricular repolarization, reflected on ECG as a prolonged corrected QT interval, due to ion channel dysfunction that reduces repolarization reserve, and it can be congenital or acquired from drugs or electrolyte disturbances. Torsades de pointes is a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with waxing and waning QRS amplitude that characteristically occurs in the setting of a prolonged QT interval and often follows a short–long–short R–R sequence, distinguishing it from other polymorphic VTs that occur with normal QT.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the mechanistic link. The arrhythmic substrate in LQTS arises from delayed repolarization with increased dispersion of repolarization across the myocardium and the emergence of early afterdepolarizations, which can trigger focal activity that degenerates into reentrant polymorphic VT consistent with torsades de pointes, a causal chain repeatedly demonstrated in experimental models and supported by clinical observations of pause-dependent initiation and termination dynamics [^117TtD7T] [^1159rbzQ] [^114RP4CX].

> Next, I should review the strength of association and risk gradients. Guidelines and scientific statements consistently describe torsades as occurring in the setting of a long QT, and risk rises exponentially with longer QTc. For example, a QTc greater than 500 ms confers roughly a 2- to 3-fold higher risk in both congenital and drug-induced forms, and the incidence of torsades with QT-prolonging antiarrhythmics has been reported in the 1% to 10% range, underscoring a dose–response relationship between repolarization delay and arrhythmia [^111L7C2T] [^113EMYDX] [^1139UEzN].

> Wait, let me verify modifiers that can amplify or mitigate risk so I don't overgeneralize. Female sex, bradycardia or pause-dependent sequences, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, structural heart disease, and polypharmacy with QT-prolonging agents all increase risk, whereas a normal baseline QTc and absence of these factors lower risk. Importantly, even patients with concealed congenital LQTS can manifest torsades when exposed to QT-prolonging drugs, reflecting reduced repolarization reserve, and some patients with apparently normal QT intervals can still develop torsades under the right triggers, which means QTc alone does not perfectly predict events [^113duRxv] [^112twYsf] [^112wq3Gb].

> I should double-check the directionality claim. The question is whether LQTS leads to torsades, not merely correlates with it. The mechanistic model, epidemiologic gradients, and guideline framing all support that prolonged repolarization in LQTS creates the substrate and triggers for torsades; torsades is defined clinically as occurring in the setting of a long QT, and LQTS is repeatedly described as a disorder with a propensity to torsades, which establishes a causal relationship rather than mere association [^114KHsYw] [^111EzUVi].

> But wait, what if the QT is only mildly prolonged? Does LQTS still "lead to" torsades? I need to ensure I qualify the risk. Risk is not binary; it increases continuously with longer QTc, and while QTc greater than 500 ms is a high-risk threshold, torsades can occur at lower QTc values, particularly with additional risk factors or concealed channelopathy, so LQTS increases susceptibility across a spectrum rather than guaranteeing arrhythmia at any fixed QTc [^111L7C2T] [^112wq3Gb] [^113duRxv].

> Let me consider clinical implications so the answer is actionable. In patients with LQTS, I should avoid QT-prolonging drugs when possible, correct electrolytes promptly, recognize pause-dependent triggers, and treat acute torsades with magnesium, potassium repletion to high-normal, and overdrive pacing or isoproterenol if bradycardia-driven. For long-term risk reduction, beta-blockers are first-line and ICDs are considered for high-risk phenotypes or breakthrough events, aligning with contemporary guidelines and expert statements [^1114qAWd] [^112fMMWt] [^114JwHz8].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Yes, long QT syndrome leads to torsades de pointes by providing the electrophysiologic substrate of prolonged and heterogeneous repolarization with early afterdepolarizations, and the risk is modulated by QTc magnitude, triggers, and genetic or acquired cofactors. This is a mechanistically coherent and clinically validated causal relationship rather than a coincidental association [^112NSX3o] [^114KHsYw] [^117TtD7T].

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) **increases the risk of torsades de pointes (TdP)** [^112NSX3o] due to prolonged ventricular repolarization and early afterdepolarizations [^117TtD7T]. The risk is highest when the QTc exceeds 500 ms [^111L7C2T] or when there is a **QTc rise > 60 ms from baseline** [^113m8FBf]. TdP in LQTS is often triggered by bradycardia, electrolyte disturbances (notably hypokalemia/hypomagnesemia) [^113duRxv], or QT-prolonging drugs [^1175DvPq]. Management includes correcting electrolytes, stopping QT-prolonging agents, and using intravenous magnesium [^1114qAWd]; temporary pacing or isoproterenol is used for recurrent TdP [^112fMMWt], and beta-blockers or ICDs are indicated for long-term prevention [^1167jEqB] [^1159ireN].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking LQTS to TdP

LQTS **prolongs ventricular repolarization**, creating an arrhythmogenic substrate via:

- **Early afterdepolarizations (EADs)**: Prolonged repolarization promotes EADs [^117TtD7T], which can trigger TdP [^116ZJtag].

- **Increased dispersion of repolarization**: Heterogeneous repolarization facilitates reentry and TdP [^117TtD7T].

- **Pause-dependent triggers**: Bradycardia or long-short sequences often initiate TdP [^112NSX3o].

---

## Clinical evidence of association

Extensive clinical and experimental data confirm the **strong association** between LQTS and TdP:

- **Congenital LQTS**: Mutations in KCNQ1, KCNH2, and SCN5A [^1136ALbT] cause prolonged repolarization and TdP [^114KHsYw].

- **Acquired LQTS**: Drugs, electrolyte disturbances, or bradycardia can prolong QT and provoke TdP [^1175DvPq] [^113duRxv].

- **Risk thresholds**: QTc > 500 ms or a rise > 60 ms from baseline markedly increases TdP risk [^111L7C2T] [^113m8FBf].

---

## Risk factors and triggers

Several factors **modulate TdP risk** in LQTS:

| **Risk factor category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Genetic mutations | - KCNQ1 <br/> - KCNH2 <br/> - SCN5A [^1136ALbT] |
| Electrolyte abnormalities | - Hypokalemia <br/> - Hypomagnesemia [^113duRxv] |
| Medications | - Antiarrhythmics (e.g. sotalol, amiodarone) <br/> - Antipsychotics <br/> - Antidepressants <br/> - Antibiotics (e.g. macrolides, fluoroquinolones) [^1114qAWd] [^114DuDGd] [^111GJTV6] |
| Bradycardia | - Sinus bradycardia <br/> - AV block [^112NSX3o] |
| Clinical factors | - Female sex <br/> - Older age <br/> - Structural heart disease [^113duRxv] |

---

## Clinical manifestations and consequences

TdP in LQTS presents with:

- **Palpitations**: Often the initial symptom [^114m9PY8].

- **Syncope**: Due to transient cerebral hypoperfusion [^notfound].

- **Cardiac arrest**: From degeneration into ventricular fibrillation [^114KHsYw].

- **Sudden cardiac death**: Particularly in untreated or high-risk patients [^114KHsYw].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management focuses on **preventing TdP** and treating acute episodes:

- **Acute management**: Intravenous magnesium sulfate, correction of electrolytes, and removal of offending agents [^1114qAWd] [^11552sJp].

- **Temporary pacing or isoproterenol**: For recurrent TdP despite magnesium [^112fMMWt].

- **Long-term management**: Beta-blockers, lifestyle modifications, and ICDs for high-risk patients [^1167jEqB] [^113qBrdG].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

With appropriate management, **prognosis is favorable**; beta-blockers and ICDs significantly reduce TdP and sudden death [^111rUYPT]. However, **untreated or high-risk patients** remain at substantial risk of recurrent TdP and sudden cardiac death [^114KHsYw].

---

Long QT syndrome **increases the risk of torsades de pointes** through prolonged repolarization and EADs; risk rises with longer QTc, electrolyte disturbances, and QT-prolonging drugs. Management with electrolyte correction, magnesium, and targeted therapy reduces TdP and improves outcomes.

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) clinical manifestations include arrhythmic events due to runs of torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia that can cause syncope, cardiac arrest, and — when deteriorating into ventricular fibrillation — sudden death; among untreated patients, recurrent syncope may eventually lead to sudden death. Atrial arrhythmias, specifically atrial fibrillation, are more frequent than in controls, and event triggers are gene-specific, with most events during physical or emotional stress in LQT1, at rest or with sudden noises in LQT2, and at rest or during sleep in LQT3. While QT prolongation is the hallmark, it may be absent; between 10% (LQT3) and 37% (LQT1) of genotype-positive patients have a QT interval within normal limits at rest. Repolarization may show bizarre morphological alterations; macroscopic T-wave alternans is a distinctive LQTS ECG pattern indicating high electrical instability, notches on the T-wave are typical for LQT2 and linked with higher arrhythmic risk, and long sinus pauses are not infrequent among LQT3 patients.

### Long QT syndrome: genetics and future perspective [^114m9PY8]. Pediatric Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is an inherited primary arrhythmia syndrome that may present with malignant arrhythmia and, rarely, risk of sudden death. The clinical symptoms include palpitations, syncope, and anoxic seizures secondary to ventricular arrhythmia, classically torsade de pointes. This predisposition to malignant arrhythmia is from a cardiac ion channelopathy that results in delayed repolarization of the cardiomyocyte action potential. The QT interval on the surface electrocardiogram is a summation of the individual cellular ventricular action potential durations, and hence is a surrogate marker of the abnormal cellular membrane repolarization. Severely affected phenotypes administered current standard of care therapies may not be fully protected from the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias. There are 17 different subtypes of LQTS associated with monogenic mutations of 15 autosomal dominant genes. It is now possible to model the various LQTS phenotypes through the generation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. RNA interference can silence or suppress the expression of mutant genes. Thus, RNA interference can be a potential therapeutic intervention that may be employed in LQTS to knock out mutant mRNAs which code for the defective proteins. CRISPR/Cas9 is a genome editing technology that offers great potential in elucidating gene function and a potential therapeutic strategy for monogenic disease. Further studies are required to determine whether CRISPR/Cas9 can be employed as an efficacious and safe rescue of the LQTS phenotype. Current progress has raised opportunities to generate in vitro human cardiomyocyte models for drug screening and to explore gene therapy through genome editing.

### Transient hypogonadism is associated with heart rate-corrected QT prolongation and torsades de pointes risk during active systemic inflammation in men [^114JSYAd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The heart rate–corrected QT interval (QTc), a surrogate of the average action potential duration in ventricular myocytes, is widely used in the clinical practice as an important marker of arrhythmic risk. In fact, whenever QTc prolongs over 470 ms in men or 480 ms in women, a condition designated as long‐QT syndrome (LQTS), the vulnerability to malignant ventricular arrhythmias, particularly torsades de pointes (TdP), progressively increases (QTc > 500 ms, high risk; QTc > 600 ms, very high risk). TdP is a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia characterized by a pattern of twisting points, which specifically develops in patients with LQTS, and that can degenerate in ventricular fibrillation (VF) and sudden cardiac death.LQTS is traditionally classified as congenital, attributable to inherited mutations in genes encoding for cardiac ion channels and regulatory proteins, or acquired. While congenital LQTS is relatively rare, acquired LQTS is commonand recognizes many possible causes, primarily medications blocking the human ether‐à‐go‐go potassium channel, and electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia), but also structural heart diseases, bradyarrhythmias, endocrine and liver diseases, nervous system injuries, starvation, hypothermia, and toxins. All these factors have in common the aptitude to induce the dysfunction of ≥ 1 of the channels regulating the action potential duration, leading to an inward shift in the balance of the total currents. However, all of the above "conventional" risk factors cannot explain all cases of LQTS/TdP development and recurrence observed in clinical practice.

### Torsades de pointes and self-terminating ventricular fibrillation in a prescription methadone user [^114swmeu]. Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Methadone is known to prolong the QT interval and precipitate torsades de pointes. A 54-year-old prescription methadone user with hypokalaemia was referred to Critical Care with acute confusion and respiratory distress. Alcohol withdrawal was the presumed precipitant. The real precipitant only became evident on analysis of a 24-h ECG (Holter monitor) attached to the patient at the time. The patient had suffered prolonged (10 min) ventricular arrhythmias including torsades de pointes and self-terminating ventricular fibrillation. The patient made a full recovery. Risk factors for acquired long QT syndrome and the treatment of torsades de pointes are discussed.

Hospital setting pathophysiology and genetic predisposition context for torsade de pointes are summarized: "In hospitalized patients, TdP is commonly associated with acquired prolongation of the uncorrected or rate-corrected QT interval, QTc, with or without underlying genetic predisposition", and the "term repolarization reserve was introduced by Roden", who explained redundancy of ion currents that "protect against excessive QT prolongation by drugs", with lesions causing "reduced repolarization reserve" that "can remain subclinical but nevertheless increase risk on drug exposure".

Torsades de pointes — polymorphic VT is described as occurring in the setting of a long QT interval with waxing and waning QRS amplitude; it often has a long-short initiating sequence with a long coupling interval to the first VT beat and may present with salvos of NSVT, and it can result from bradycardia including high-grade AV block that leads to a long-short sequence initiating torsades de pointes.

Laboratory Tests

There are no specific laboratory tests recommended.

QT-Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes

Citalopram causes dose dependent QT prolongation and should not be dosed above 40 mg/day. Torsade de Pointes has been reported postmarketing. Citalopram should not be used in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia should be corrected prior to initiation of treatment and periodically monitored. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients on concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval. Dose escalations over 20 mg/day in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers or patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor are not recommended.

Drug Interactions

Drugs that Prolong the QT interval: ECG monitoring is recommended with concomitant medications that have demonstrated prolongation of the QT interval (see WARNINGS- QT-Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes).

Serotonergic Drugs: Based on the mechanism of action of SNRIs and SSRIs including citalopram, and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when citalopram is coadministered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as triptans, linezolid (an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), lithium, tramadol, or St. John's Wort (see WARNINGS-Serotonin Syndrome). The concomitant use of citalopram with other SSRIs, SNRIs or tryptophan is not recommended (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions).

Triptans: There have been rare postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome with use of an SSRI and a triptan. If concomitant treatment of citalopram with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (see WARNINGS - Serotonin Syndrome).

CNS Drugs - Given the primary CNS effects of citalopram, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs.

### Drug-induced torsades de pointes: the evolving role of pharmacogenetics [^116ptepX]. Heart Rhythm (2005). Low credibility.

Drug-induced torsades de pointes (TdP) is a rare, but potentially lethal, unwanted effect of drugs, including many commonly prescribed noncardiac drugs. Despite its low frequency, drug-induced TdP has generated a great deal of angst among physicians and pharmaceutical companies as well as tragedy, albeit rare, among patients. Although in retrospect many patients who died suddenly as a result of drug-induced TdP had identifiable risk factors, prediction in individual cases remains problematic. Over the past decade, tremendous progress has been made with respect to elucidating the fundamental pathogenic mechanisms that underlie drug-induced TdP. The vast majority of drugs associated with "QT liability" and the potential for drug-induced TdP, including all of the drugs removed from the market because of this side effect, are "HERG (human ether-á-go-go-related gene) blockers". These drugs inhibit the KCNH2-encoded HERG potassium channel, which is one of the critical repolarizing forces involved in the exquisite orchestration of the heart's action potential. Consequently, myocyte repolarization is potentially delayed as evidenced by prolongation of the QT interval, thus providing the substrate for drug-induced TdP. Rare mutations in KCNH2 provide the pathogenic substrate for type 2 congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), thus placing this cardiac potassium channel squarely in the intersection between congenital LQTS (the "Rosetta stone" of the heritable channelopathies) and acquired LQTS (drug-induced TdP). In addition, common polymorphisms residing in the LQTS-causing channel genes may confer heightened arrhythmogenic susceptibility and contribute to the makings of a vulnerable host. This review focuses on the present strategy of identifying "at-risk compounds" and the potential future strategy involving pharmacogenetics to pinpoint "at-risk hosts" in an effort to curb this rare, unintended, but potentially life-threatening side effect.

### Quantitative understanding of QTc prolongation and gender as risk factors for torsade de pointes [^116UBLX9]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Several risk factors for development of a potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia, torsade de pointes, have been observed, including female gender. However, in most investigations, only few torsade events were included and/or rarely were postdose heart rate corrected QT (QTc) measurements included, as a surrogate of drug exposure. We developed a multivariate logistic regression model using data from 22,214 patients (33% women) with 84 torsade events (56% women) to evaluate the relationship between risk factors for torsade using data from four anti-arrhythmic drug development programs. Before model development, we evaluated different QT/QTc postdose metrics (average, maximum, etc.) to determine which QT metric should be included into the model. The developed multivariate model showed that, after accounting for known risk factors for torsade and postdose QTc, that female gender remained a significant risk factor for torsade.

### Long QT syndrome [^114JwHz8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The hereditary long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a genetic channelopathy with variable penetrance that is associated with increased propensity to syncope, polymorphous ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes), and sudden arrhythmic death. This inherited cardiac disorder constitutes an important cause of malignant ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in young individuals with normal cardiac morphology. Risk assessment in affected LQTS patients relies upon a constellation of electrocardiographic, clinical, and genetic factors. Administration of beta-blockers is the mainstay therapy in affected patients, and primary prevention with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator or left cervicothoracic sympathetic denervation are therapeutic options in patients who remain symptomatic despite beta-blocker therapy. Accumulating data from the International LQTS Registry have recently facilitated a comprehensive analysis of risk factors for aborted cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death in pre-specified age groups, including the childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and post-40 periods. These analyses have consistently indicated that the phenotypic expression of LQTS is time dependent and age specific, warranting continuous risk assessment in affected patients. Furthermore, the biophysical function, type, and location of the ion-channel mutation are currently emerging as important determinants of outcome in genotyped patients. These new data may be used to improve risk stratification and for the development of gene-specific therapies that may reduce the risk of life-threatening cardiac events in patients with this inherited cardiac disorder.

### The genetics underlying acquired long QT syndrome: impact for genetic screening [^115bRbex]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

Acquired long QT syndrome (aLQTS) exhibits QT prolongation and Torsades de Pointes ventricular tachycardia triggered by drugs, hypokalaemia, or bradycardia. Sometimes, QTc remains prolonged despite elimination of triggers, suggesting the presence of an underlying genetic substrate. In aLQTS subjects, we assessed the prevalence of mutations in major LQTS genes and their probability of being carriers of a disease-causing genetic variant based on clinical factors.

Methods and Results

We screened for the five major LQTS genes among 188 aLQTS probands (55 ± 20 years, 140 females) from Japan, France, and Italy. Based on control QTc (without triggers), subjects were designated 'true aLQTS' (QTc within normal limits) or 'unmasked cLQTS' (all others) and compared for QTc and genetics with 2379 members of 1010 genotyped congenital long QT syndrome (cLQTS) families. Cardiac symptoms were present in 86% of aLQTS subjects. Control QTc of aLQTS was 453 ± 39 ms, shorter than in cLQTS (478 ± 46 ms, P < 0.001) and longer than in non-carriers (406 ± 26 ms, P < 0.001). In 53 (28%) aLQTS subjects, 47 disease-causing mutations were identified. Compared with cLQTS, in 'true aLQTS', KCNQ1 mutations were much less frequent than KCNH2 (20% [95% CI 7–41%] vs. 64% [95% CI 43–82%], P < 0.01). A clinical score based on control QTc, age, and symptoms allowed identification of patients more likely to carry LQTS mutations.

Conclusion

A third of aLQTS patients carry cLQTS mutations, those on KCNH2 being more common. The probability of being a carrier of cLQTS disease-causing mutations can be predicted by simple clinical parameters, thus allowing possibly cost-effective genetic testing leading to cascade screening for identification of additional at-risk family members.

### Drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval… [^1127uEuT]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

The most common reason for removing a prescription drug from the U. S. market in the past decade has been prolongation of the QT interval. There is an increased risk for the development of torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia, when the QT interval is prolonged. Roden reviewed the drugs most commonly implicated in QT prolongation and the clinical factors that increase the risk of torsades de pointes. Medication-induced QT prolongation was first recognized with the use of quinidine in the 1920s. Roden lists other drugs that also are implicated in prolongation of the QT interval and may cause torsades de pointes. Use of these medications, especially when a congenital QT prolongation syndrome or other clinical risk factor is present, increases the chance that torsades de pointes may develop.

Because the risk of torsades de pointes is sufficiently high at typical clinical dosages of sotalol, dofetilide, and ibutilide, the review author recommends in-hospital cardiac monitoring when therapy with these agents is initiated. The risk of torsades de pointes is not related linearly to the degree of QT prolongation, although any drug that prolongs the QT interval beyond 500 msec is thought to confer an elevated risk. Heart rate exerts an important effect on the risk for associated torsades de pointes, with a greater propensity for developing the arrhythmia when bradycardia is present. QT prolongation occurs when a drug or congenital syndrome affects ion channels in cardiac cells and leads to prolongation of the action potential during depolarization. This step may lead to a reduced reserve for normal repolarization, which then increases the risk of developing torsades de pointes. However, these known links do not explain completely the risk of torsades de pointes.

Amiodarone often causes QT prolongation beyond 500 msec, yet rarely causes torsades de pointes. Terfenadine was removed from the market because of associated episodes of torsades de pointes, yet therapeutic dosages only extended the QT interval by 6 msec. The degree of QT prolongation caused by a given medication can be influenced by the concomitant use of other agents that inhibit drug elimination. Examples cited by Roden include erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, amiodarone, quinidine, and a number of antidepressants and antiretrovirals.

### QT interval and drug therapy [^111dBbWc]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2016). Low credibility.

The QT interval is an important component of the electrocardiogram, which when prolonged can predict the risk of developing the potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmia, torsades de pointes. There is growing understanding of the genetics associated with cardiac arrhythmias and an increasing number of drugs that can prolong the QT interval. Consequently, assessment of the effect of drugs on the QT interval has become a significant aspect of drug development, regulatory assessment and clinical care. Here, we review the QT interval and the risks associated with drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval.

### Torsades de pointes in the PACU after outpatient endoscopy: a case report [^116CusDa]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Follow-up and outcomes

During her hospital stay, the patient continued to have long QT syndrome and experienced two additional episodes of recurrent Torsades de Pointes (Fig. 3), pulseless ventricular fibrillation, and cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation. These episodes occurred in the intensive care unit despite discontinuation of all QT prolonging medications and a normal electrolyte panel. Each episode responded to defibrillation with return to normal sinus rhythm. Interventional cardiology was consulted for further evaluation and treatment and she was transferred to the Cardiac Critical Care Unit. After failure of medical management and persistent prolonged QT syndrome, the diagnosis of congenital long QT syndrome was made. This was acutely exacerbated by secretory diarrhea, electrolyte abnormalities, and QT prolonging medications. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator was placed on day 8 of her hospital stay and she was discharged home on hospital day 10.

### Long QT syndrome: reduced repolarization reserve and the genetic link [^112twYsf]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Marked QT prolongation and torsades de pointes can occur not only in the congenital long QT syndromes (LQTSs) but also as a consequence of environmental stimuli, notably administration of certain drugs. A key feature of this 'acquired' form of the LQTS has been its unpredictable nature. That is, although risk factors have been identified in series of patients, they have not been terribly useful in addressing risk in an individual patient. Normal cardiac repolarization depends critically on the interplay of multiple ion currents, and these provide some redundancy, or 'reserve', to protect against excessive QT prolongation by drugs. We have proposed that lesions in these repolarizing mechanisms can remain subclinical but nevertheless increase risk on drug exposure, and have termed this situation 'reduced repolarization reserve'. The evidence in support of this concept is presented, and the known and potential contributions by genetic variants to risk is examined. Assessing variability in susceptibility to acquired LQTS provides a framework for analysis of other complex gene-environment interactions.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Long QT syndrome and torsades de pointes — electrolyte optimization and medication precautions include that intravenous magnesium can suppress episodes of torsades de pointes without necessarily shortening QT, repeated doses may be needed, and the risk of magnesium toxicity is very small with the doses usually used to treat torsades de pointes, 1 to 2 g intravenously; maintaining serum potassium between 4.5 mEq/L and 5 mEq/L shortens QT and may reduce the chance of recurrent torsades de pointes. QT-prolonging medications are not used in patients with congenital or acquired long QT syndrome unless there is no suitable alternative or the benefit greatly exceeds the risk, episodes of torsades de pointes can be precipitated by exposure to a QT-prolonging medication with increased risk when the QT is already prolonged from genetic and clinical risk factors, and implicated medication classes include antiarrhythmics, antihistamines, antibiotics, antifungals, antidepressants, antipsychotics, opiates, and anticancer agents.

### Genetics of long-QT syndrome [^112RJEbt]. Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome characterized by a prolonged QT interval in the 12-lead ECG, torsades de pointes and not negligible prevalence of sudden cardiac death. The genetic testing plays an important role in the diagnosis of LQTS. A total of 15 genes have been reported for autosomal-dominant forms of Romano-Ward-type congenital LQTS and 2 genes for autosomal-recessive forms of the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in genetics of LQTS and briefly describe forward perspectives of LQTS investigation.

### Repolarization injury and occurrence of Torsades de pointes during acute Takotsubo syndrome [^112FRRKV]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Repolarization injury, although often overlooked, is frequent in TS and carries an associated risk of TdP. It is important to document the QTc interval and consider TdP risk in the management of TS patients. Many intriguing aspects of repolarization injury and occurrence of TdP in TS remain unexplained, offering avenues for further study. For instance, it would be valuable to investigate why some TS patients are susceptible to TdP while others, despite similar or even greater QTc prolongation, are not. The association of admission QTc with posthospital survival requires validation in a larger number of patients and may prove a useful prognostic marker.

PERSPECTIVES

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Repolarization injury is common in TS, a process characterized by QTc interval lengthening and T-wave inversion. More than half of patients have QTc prolongation during hospitalization, and one-quarter have QTc > 500 ms, providing the substrate for TdP. This arrhythmia is uncommon in TS, usually occurring in those with QTc > 500 ms and within 48 hours of hospital admission. Most patients do not have conditions known to increase the risk of TdP; therefore, this arrhythmia is unpredictable in this setting. In most patients, QTc prolongation and T-wave inversion resolve at follow-up. Prolonged QTc at admission may be associated with worse long-term survival.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: TS represents a unique form of reversible acquired long QT syndrome in which both mechanical and electrophysiologic stunning coexist. TS is no longer uncommon; therefore, this condition provides an opportunity for further research into acquired long QT syndrome and for further understanding of the factors that promote the occurrence of TdP.

Hospital treatment of sustained torsade de pointes (TdP) — acute interventions and dosing: "For patients with TdP that does not terminate spontaneously or that degenerates into ventricular fibrillation, immediate direct-current cardioversion should be performed". For episodes in patients on QT‑prolonging drugs with prolonged QT, "intravenous magnesium sulfate is reasonable… (Class IIa, Level of Evidence: B)", with dosing that "Magnesium sulfate 2 g can be infused intravenously as a first-line agent… irrespective of the serum magnesium level", and "repeat infusions of magnesium sulfate 2 g" if needed. To prevent pause‑dependent triggers, temporary transvenous pacing may be used "at rates > 70 beats per minute". "Replacement of potassium to supratherapeutic levels of 4.5 to 5.0 mmol/L may also be considered", though evidence is limited "(Class IIb, Level of Evidence: C)".

Introduction

Long QT syndrome (LQTS), an inherited primary arrhythmia syndrome, demonstrates a prevalence of 1 out of every 2000 healthy live births. This cardiac ion channel repolarization abnormality manifests on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG), as a prolongation of the corrected QT interval, secondary to a delayed repolarization of the cardiomyocyte action potential. This reduction in repolarization reserve places the cardiomyocytes at risk of propagating ventricular arrhythmia from early after depolarizations (EADs) that develop in phase two or three of the action potential. These EADs are a product of the inherent dynamical chaos present in biological systems of cardiomyocytes. When small regions of myocardium develop EADs synchronously, it can trigger focal ventricular tachycardia that, if rapid enough, might result in vortex-like re-entrant excitation of the myocardium, Torsade de pointes (TdP). The clinical symptoms of LQTS include palpitations, syncope, and seizures, often due to adrenergic-induced TdP tachycardia. A recessive form of the condition associated with deafness was first described in 1957 (by Jervell and Lange-Nielsen), and an autosomal dominant familial form by Dr. Romano in 1963 and Prof. Conor Ward in 1964. In 1985, Schwartz and Locati were the first to publish on the natural history of the disease and noted a 71% mortality rate in untreated patients from the first syncope. Mortality in the current era for patients with LQTS with appropriate medical therapy is now 0.3%.

### Quinidine sulfate tablet (Quinidine sulfate) [^115AXyAC]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Proarrhythmic Effects

Like many other drugs (including all other class IA antiarrhythmics), quinidine prolongs the QTCinterval, and this can lead to torsades de pointes, a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia (see OVERDOSAGE). The risk of torsades is increased by bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, or high serum levels of quinidine, but it may appear in the absence of any of these risk factors. The best predictor of this arrhythmia appears to be the length of the QTCinterval, and quinidine should be used with extreme care in patients who have preexisting long-QT syndromes, who have histories of torsades de pointes of any cause, or who have previously responded to quinidine (or other drugs that prolong ventricular repolarization) with marked lengthening of the QTCinterval. Estimation of the incidence of torsades in patients with therapeutic levels of quinidine is not possible from the available data. Other ventricular arrhythmias that have been reported with quinidine include frequent extrasystoles, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular flutter, and ventricular fibrillation.

Paradoxical Increase in Ventricular Rate in Atrial Flutter/ Fibrillation

When quinidine is administered to patients with atrial flutter/fibrillation, the desired pharmacologic reversion to sinus rhythm may (rarely) be preceded by a slowing of the atrial rate with a consequent increase in the rate of beats conducted to the ventricles. The resulting ventricular rate may be very high (greater than 200 beats per minute) and poorly tolerated. This hazard may be decreased if partial atrioventricular block is achieved prior to initiation of quinidine therapy, using conduction-reducing drugs such as digitalis, verapamil, diltiazem, or a β-receptor blocking agent.

Exacerbated Bradycardia in Sick Sinus Syndrome

In patients with the sick sinus syndrome, quinidine has been associated with marked sinus node depression and bradycardia.

Pharmacokinetic Considerations

Renal or hepatic dysfunction causes the elimination of quinidine to be slowed, while congestive heart failure causes a reduction in quinidine's apparent volume of distribution. Any of these conditions can lead to quinidine toxicity if dosage is not appropriately reduced. In addition, interactions with coadministered drugs can alter the serum concentration and activity of quinidine, leading either to toxicity or to lack of efficacy if the dose of quinidine is not appropriately modified. (See PRECAUTIONS /Drug Interactions .)

Table 5
Clinical Risk Factors of TdP

Drugs for correcting prolonged QTc should be started if worrisome ECG signs of TdP exist (eg, frequent ventricular premature beats or short runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia) or if TdP develops (asymptomatic or symptomatic). Premonitory and worrisome signs for TdP are prolonged QTc (> 500 ms), severe aberration of the T‐U segment, beat‐to‐beat instability (more marked aberration of the T wave after a long R‐R interval), and/or frequent ventricular premature beats (Figure 4 B). Patients with such abnormalities should be admitted to a cardiac care unit. The first‐line treatment is magnesium sulfate, given intravenously with repeated doses if signs of electric instability persist. Next is the initiation of a β‐adrenergic drug, such as isoproterenol, titrated to obtain an HR of > 100 bpm with careful evaluation of the response, because patients with inherited congenital long QT syndrome could experience worsening symptoms. The role of antiarrhythmic therapies is less well established, but in case of refractory TdP, lidocaine infusion can be considered. 197

Temporary ventricular or atrial pacing at 100 to 120 bpm should be considered if the patient is refractory to the previous measures. If the patient has a preexisting pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator system, changes in the lower rates can have the same protective effects. This measure leads to the disappearance of virtually all ventricular arrhythmias. 198

Drugs that cause TdP: incidence interpretation and prescribing guidance indicate uncertainty in attribution and emphasize individualized risk–benefit decisions. The proportion of sudden arrhythmic deaths that are due to TdP is unclear because few individuals are being monitored at the time of death, and when TdP occurs in outpatient settings first responders are likely to observe ventricular fibrillation, making it impossible to determine whether ventricular fibrillation was preceded by QT prolongation and then TdP. Use of a QT-prolonging drug must be based on risk-benefit analysis in individual patients, and where efficacy of alternatives is equivalent, the non–QT-prolonging agent should be preferred; where benefit clearly outweighs risk, QT prolongation should not limit necessary therapy. The only class of drugs for which reasonable TdP incidence data are available is the antiarrhythmic agents.

Syncope — arrhythmic and drug-induced mechanisms — Bradycardia from subsidiary pacemaker sites can present with slow rates (25–40 b.p.m.) and "predisposes to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), especially of the torsade de pointes type". Syncope or near-syncope occurs at the onset of paroxysmal tachycardia before vascular compensation develops, and several drugs can cause brady- and tachyarrhythmias, including QT‑prolonging agents across antiarrhythmics, vasodilators, psychotropics, antimicrobials, and non‑sedating antihistamines. Syncope due to torsade de pointes is not uncommon and is caused by drugs prolonging the QT interval, being particularly frequent in long QT syndrome. Under‑reporting is substantial, with only 1% of adverse drug reactions reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Medication-induced arrhythmias — management directives: For sustained ventricular arrhythmias (VA) potentially due to digoxin toxicity, administration of digoxin antibodies is recommended. In patients with recurrent torsades de pointes associated with acquired QT prolongation and bradycardia not suppressed with intravenous magnesium, increasing the heart rate with atrial or ventricular pacing or isoproterenol are recommended to suppress the arrhythmia. For patients with QT prolongation due to a medication, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or other acquired factor and recurrent torsades de pointes, administration of intravenous magnesium sulfate is recommended to suppress the arrhythmia. For torsades de pointes with acquired QT prolongation, potassium repletion to 4.0 mmol/L or more and magnesium repletion to normal values are beneficial. In patients taking sodium channel blockers who present with elevated defibrillation or pacing thresholds, discontinuing the presumed responsible medication or reprogramming the device can be useful to restore effective device therapy. In congenital or acquired long QT syndrome, QT-prolonging medications are potentially harmful.

### Diagnostic criteria for the long QT syndrome. An update [^114aNV6J]. Circulation (1993). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Schwartz's diagnostic criteria for congenital long QT syndrome" for long QT syndrome.

The Schwartz's diagnostic criteria for congenital long QT syndrome is a clinical scoring system used to diagnose congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), a genetic disorder of the heart's electrical system. This calculator is applicable to patients of all ages who present with unexplained syncope, seizures, or cardiac arrest, or have a family history of sudden cardiac death at a young age.

The Schwartz's criteria uses a combination of clinical and electrocardiographic features, including the QT interval, T-wave alternans, notched T waves in three leads, low heart rate for age, clinical history, and family history. The score ranges from 1 to 6, with a score of 3.5 or higher being indicative of a high probability of LQTS.

The Schwartz's criteria should not be used in patients with secondary causes of QT prolongation such as medications, electrolyte imbalances, or other medical conditions. It is also less accurate in neonates and very young children due to the physiological shortening of the QT interval in this age group.

The Schwartz's diagnostic criteria for congenital Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) calculator evaluates several clinical and family history factors to estimate the probability of LQTS. Each factor is assigned a specific score, and the scores are summed to predict the likelihood of having LQTS.

The factors and their respective scores are as follows:

QTc Interval (calculated by Bazett's formula):
- **≥ 480 msec**: 6 points
- **460–470 msec**: 4 points
- **450 msec in males**: 2 points

Other Electrocardiogram Findings:

- **Torsade de pointes**: 4 points
- **T-wave alternans**: 2 points
- **Notched T wave in 3 leads**: 2 points
- **Low resting heart rate below the 2nd percentile for age**: 1 point

History of Syncope:

- **With stress**: 4 points
- **Without stress**: 2 points

Congenital Deafness:

- **Yes**: 1 point
- **No**: 0 points

Family History:

- **Definite long QT syndrome**: 2 points
- Unexplained sudden cardiac death < 30 years in immediate family members (not the same family member having definite LQTS): 1 point

To determine the total score, add the points for each selected input. The final score is interpreted as follows:

- **1 or 2 points**: The probability of congenital LQTS is low.
- **3 to 6 points**: The probability of congenital LQTS is intermediate.
- **7 points or more**: The probability of congenital LQTS is high.

This structured scoring system enables healthcare providers to quantify the risk of LQTS systematically, assisting in clinical decision-making and patient management.

### Clinician responses to a clinical decision support advisory for high risk of torsades de pointes [^112fbDfY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Torsades de pointes (TdP) is a serious cardiac arrhythmia that may degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. Individuals who have corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation are at an increased risk of TdP and sudden cardiac death. CredibleMeds maintains a list of > 200 medications that prolong the QTc interval and categorizes those drugs based on their risk of provoking TdP. The highest risk medications on the CredibleMeds list are those on the "Known Risk of TdP" list, which includes drugs that prolong the QTc interval and are known to be associated risk with TdP, even when taken as recommended.

Patient‐specific risk assessment tools have been developed to help determine the risk of a patient developing QTc interval prolongation. The Tisdale QT risk score assigns weighted values to various risk factors and calculates the risk of QT interval prolongation. Factors evaluated in this score include age, sex, hypokalemia, admission QTc interval, use of a loop diuretic, number of QT interval–prolonging drugs, sepsis, heart failure, and admission for acute myocardial infarction. Although this score was developed and validated in cardiac care units, there is a potential for the score to be applicable in a broader inpatient setting.

### Mechanisms underlying the spontaneous termination of torsades de pointes in an experimental model of long QT syndrome [^1159rbzQ]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Torsades de pointes (TdP) represent a complex polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. While the triggering mechanisms of early afterdepolarization and increased dispersion of repolarization are well investigated, the sudden self-limiting termination remains poorly understood.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to perform analysis of TdP to investigate factors causing spontaneous termination.

Methods

We used a large data set from Langendorff experiments in isolated rabbit hearts in which drug-induced QT prolongation, bradycardia, and hypokalemia provoke TdP. We included 427 episodes with typical TdP characteristics of polymorphic self-terminating beats and twisting QRS complexes occurring in the presence of abnormal QT prolongation due to various different QT-prolonging drugs. The use of 8 monophasic action potential catheters allowed the characterization of action potential duration, configuration, and dispersion of repolarization beyond the capabilities of the surface electrocardiogram. To identify possible mechanisms of arrhythmia termination, the initial, midpoint, and terminal 3 ventricular complexes were analyzed for each episode.

Results

An abrupt decrease in spatial dispersion over the course of a TdP episode was identified as a precursor for termination of TdP. Within the last 3 beats, a sudden significant decrease in the dispersion of repolarization was observed as a predictor of termination. In parallel, there was a decrease in action potential duration (action potential duration at 90% repolarization) before termination. Also, a change in action potential configuration (action potential duration at 90% repolarization/action potential duration at 50% repolarization ratio) in terms of the loss of action potential dome with a restitution of action potential triangulation was observed.

Conclusion

In > 400 TdP episodes, homogenization of myocardial repolarization with the recovery of an action potential configuration determines the termination of TdP episodes.

### Current concepts in the mechanisms and management of drug-induced QT prolongation and torsade de pointes [^114DuDGd]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Drug-induced long QT syndrome is characterized by a prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc) and increased risk of a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia known as torsade de pointes (TdP). We review mechanisms, predispositions, culprit agents, and management of this potentially fatal phenomenon. Virtually all drugs that prolong QTc block the rapid component of the delayed rectifier current (I(kr)). Some drugs prolong QTc in a dose-dependent manner, others do so at any dose. Most patients that develop drug-induced TdP have underlying risk factors. Female sex is the most common. Implicated drugs include class 1A and III antiarrhythmics, macrolide antibiotics, pentamidine, antimalarials, antipsychotics, arsenic trioxide, and methadone. Treatment for TdP includes immediate defibrillation for hemodynamic instability and intravenous magnesium sulfate. Potassium levels should be maintained in the high normal range, and all QT prolonging agents must be promptly discontinued.

### Anesthesia for patients with congenital long QT syndrome [^1111jw7b]. Anesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

Long QT syndrome is a malfunction of cardiac ion channels resulting in impaired ventricular repolarization that can lead to a characteristic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia known as torsades de pointes. Stressors, by increasing sympathetic tone, and drugs can provoke torsade de pointes, leading to syncope, seizures, or sudden cardiac death in these patients. Beta blockade, implantation of cardioverter defibrillators, and left cardiac sympathetic denervation are used in the treatment of these patients. However, these treatment modalities do not guarantee the prevention of sudden cardiac death. Certain drugs, including anesthetic agents, are known to contribute to QT prolongation. After reviewing the literature the authors give recommendations for the anesthetic management of these patients in the perioperative period.

Long QT syndrome — QTc thresholds and medication precautions: The risk of adverse events increases with QTc > 500 ms, especially with long QT syndrome type 2. QT-prolonging medications (www.crediblemeds.org) should not be used in patients with long QT syndrome unless there is no suitable alternative; careful QTc monitoring is recommended with consideration for discontinuation if QTc is markedly prolonged. Concurrent use of stimulant or nonstimulant attention deficit/hyperactivity medications was associated with an increased risk of syncope/cardiac arrest in 1 study but not in another retrospective study, and episodes of torsades de pointes can be precipitated by QT-prolonging medication or hypokalemia induced by diuretics or gastrointestinal illnesses.

### Long QT syndrome and short QT syndrome [^115g4Cqn]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a genetic disorder characterized by prolongation of the QT interval in the electrocardiogram (ECG) and a propensity to torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia frequently leading to syncope, cardiac arrest, or sudden death usually in young otherwise healthy individuals. The long QT syndrome is caused by mutations of predominantly potassium and sodium ion channel genes or channel-related proteins leading to positive overcharge of myocardial cell with consequent heterogeneous prolongation of repolarization in various layers and regions of myocardium. These conditions facilitate the early after-depolarization and reentry phenomena underlying development of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia observed in patients with LQTS. Obtaining detailed patient history regarding cardiac events in the patient and his/her family members combined with careful interpretation of standard 12-lead ECG (with precise measurement of QT interval in all available ECGs and evaluation of T-wave morphology) usually is sufficient to diagnose the LQTS. Genetic testing plays an important role and is particularly useful in cases with nondiagnostic or borderline ECG findings. The clinical course of patients with LQTS depends on the extent of QTc prolongation and history of cardiac events and is modulated by age, sex, and genotype. beta-Blockers remain the therapy of choice for LQTS, but implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator is increasingly used in high-risk patients.

### Droperidol [^111SQfD2]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

WARNING

Cases of QT prolongation and/or torsade de pointes have been reported in patients receiving droperidol at doses at or below recommended doses. Some cases have occurred in patients with no known risk factors for QT prolongation and some cases have been fatal.

Due to its potential for serious proarrhythmic effects and death, droperidol should be reserved for use in the treatment of patients who fail to show an acceptable response to other adequate treatments, either because of insufficient effectiveness or the inability to achieve an effective dose due to intolerable adverse effects from those drugs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Cases of QT prolongation and serious arrhythmias (e.g., torsade de pointes) have been reported in patients treated with droperidol. Based on these reports, all patients should undergo a 12-lead ECG prior to administration of droperidol to determine if a prolonged QT interval (i.e. QTc greater than 440 msec for males or 450 msec for females) is present. If there is a prolonged QT interval, droperidol should NOT be administered. For patients in whom the potential benefit of droperidol treatment is felt to outweigh the risks of potentially serious arrhythmias, ECG monitoring should be performed prior to treatment and continued for 2–3 hours after completing treatment to monitor for arrhythmias.

Droperidol is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected QT prolongation, including patients with congenital long QT syndrome.

Droperidol should be administered with extreme caution to patients who may be at risk for development of prolonged QT syndrome (e.g., congestive heart failure, bradycardia, use of a diuretic, cardiac hypertrophy, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or administration of other drugs known to increase the QT interval). Other risk factors may include age over 65 years, alcohol abuse, and use of agents such as benzodiazepines, volatile anesthetics, and IV opiates. Droperidol should be initiated at a low dose and adjusted upward, with caution, as needed to achieve the desired effect.

### Prevention of torsade de pointes in hospital settings: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and the American college of cardiology foundation [^1136ALbT]. Circulation (2010). Medium credibility.

Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) genetics and their relation to drug-induced torsade de pointes (TdP) are described: KCNQ1, KCNH2, and SCN5A are the major susceptibility genes accounting for nearly 75% of all congenital LQTS cases, with approximately two-thirds from KCNQ1/KCNH2 loss-of-function and approximately 5% to 10% from sodium channel gain-of-function; beyond these, 9 minor genes account for an additional 5% and the remaining 20% of congenital LQTS cases remain genotype negative. Congenital LQTS affects approximately 1 in 2500 persons; in drug-induced settings, case series identify subclinical congenital LQTS in 5% to 20% of cases, while among individuals with isolated drug-induced acquired LQTS the genetic testing yield for the 3 major genes is approximately 10% to 15%. Population polymorphisms may be relevant, such as KCNE2-Q9E present in approximately 3% to 5% of African Americans.

### Antipsychotic drugs: prolonged QTc interval, torsade de pointes, and sudden death [^116yD1HJ]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors review the mechanisms and establish the risk of torsade de pointes and sudden death with antipsychotic drugs.

Method

They present a review of original concepts, the distinction between familial and drug-induced cases of torsade de pointes, and the recognition of the role of noncardiac drugs in torsade de pointes and sudden death. They review the evidence linking QTc interval prolongation, potassium channels, and torsade de pointes from both the long QT syndrome and drugs. They examine the risk for torsade de pointes from antipsychotic drugs and estimate the frequency of sudden death on the basis of epidemiological data in normal and schizophrenic populations.

Results

All drugs that cause torsade de pointes prolong the QTc interval and bind to the potassium rectifier channel, but the relationships are not precise. Prediction of torsade de pointes and sudden death can be improved by examining dose dependency, the percent of QTc intervals higher than 500 msec, and the risk of drug-drug interactions. Although sudden unexpected death occurs almost twice as often in populations treated with antipsychotics as in normal populations, there are still only 10–15 such events in 10,000 person-years of observation.

Conclusions

Although pimozide, sertindole, droperidol, and haloperidol have been documented to cause torsade de pointes and sudden death, the most marked risk is with thioridazine. There is no association with olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone. Ziprasidone does prolong the QT interval, but there is no evidence to suggest that this leads to torsade de pointes or sudden death. Only widespread use will prove if ziprasidone is entirely safe. To date, all antipsychotic drugs have the potential for serious adverse events. Balancing these risks with the positive effects of treatment poses a challenge for psychiatry.

### The morphology of the QT interval predicts torsade de pointes during acquired bradyarrhythmias [^115nWvxh]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to define the electrocardiographic (ECG) predictors of torsade de pointes (TdP) during acquired bradyarrhythmias.

Background

Complete atrioventricular block (CAVB) might lead to downregulation of potassium channels, QT interval prolongation, and TdP. Because potassium-channel malfunction causes characteristic T-wave abnormalities in the congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), we reasoned that T-wave abnormalities like those described in the congenital LQTS would identify patients at risk for TdP during acquired bradyarrhythmias.

Methods

In a case-control study, we compared 30 cases of bradyarrhythmias complicated by TdP with 113 cases of uncomplicated bradyarrhythmias. On the basis of the criteria used for the congenital LQTS, T waves were defined as LQT1-like (long QT interval with broad T waves), LQT2-like (notched T waves), and LQT3-like (small and late) T waves.

Results

Neither the ventricular rate nor the QRS width at the time of worst bradyarrhythmia predicted the risk of TdP. However, the QT, corrected QT (QTc), and T(peak)-T(end) intervals correlated with the risk of TdP. The best single discriminator was a T(peak)-T(end) of 117 ms. LQT1-like and LQT3-like morphologies were rare during bradyarrhythmias. In contrast, LQT2-like "notched T waves" were observed in 55% of patients with TdP but in only 3% of patients with uncomplicated bradyarrhythmias (p < 0.001). A 2-step model based on QT duration and the presence of LQT2-like T waves identified patients at risk for TdP with a positive predictive value of 84%.

Conclusions

Prolonged QT interval, QTc interval, and T(peak)-T(end) correlate with increased risk for TdP during acquired bradyarrhythmias, particularly when accompanied by LQT2-like notched T waves.

Drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) — management recommendations state that in patients with drug-induced LQTS, removal of the offending agent is indicated (Level of Evidence: A). Class IIa recommendations are that management with intravenous magnesium sulfate is reasonable for patients who take QT-prolonging drugs and present with few episodes of torsades de pointes in which the QT remains long, and that atrial or ventricular pacing or isoproterenol is reasonable for patients taking QT-prolonging drugs who present with recurrent torsades de pointes (Level of Evidence: B). Class IIb guidance is that potassium repletion to 4.5 to 5 mmol/L may be reasonable for patients who take QT-prolonging drugs and present with few episodes of torsades de pointes in whom the QT remains long (Level of Evidence: C).

### Type 3 long QT syndrome: is the effectiveness of treatment with β-blockers population-specific? [^117AiENs]. Heart Rhythm (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy of beta-blocker treatment in type 3 long QT syndrome (LQT3) remains debated.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that beta-blocker use is associated with cardiac events (CEs) in a French cohort of LQT3 patients.

Methods

All patients with a likely pathogenic/pathogenic variant in the SCN5A gene (linked to LQT3) were included and followed-up. Documented ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, torsades de pointes, aborted cardiac arrest, sudden death, and appropriate shocks were considered as severe cardiac events (SCEs). CEs also included syncope.

Results

We included 147 patients from 54 families carrying 23 variants. Six of the patients developed symptoms before the age of 1 year and were analyzed separately. The 141 remaining patients (52.5% male; median age at diagnosis 24.0 years) were followed-up for a median of 11 years. The probabilities of a CE and an SCE from birth to the age of 40 were 20.5% and 9.9%, respectively. QTc prolongation (hazard ratio [HR] 1.12 [1.0–1.2]; p = 0.005]) and proband status (HR 4.07 [1.9–8.9]; P < .001) were independently associated with the occurrence of CEs. Proband status (HR 8.13 [1.7–38.8]; p = 0.009) was found to be independently associated with SCEs, whereas QTc prolongation (HR 1.11 [1.0–1.3]; p = 0.108) did not reach statistical significance. The cumulative probability of the age at first CE/SCE was not lower in patients treated with a beta-blocker.

Conclusion

In agreement with the literature, proband status and lengthened QTc were associated with a higher risk of CEs. Our data do not show a protective effect of beta-blocker treatment.

### Further evidence of inherited long QT syndrome gene mutations in antiarrhythmic drug-associated torsades de pointes [^113dkSxV]. Heart Rhythm (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Pathophysiologically significant ion-channel mutations have been detected in only a minority of cases of acquired long QT syndrome (LQTS).

Objective

The aim of this study was to clarify the putative role of subclinical inherited LQTS in drug-associated torsades de pointes (TdP) and to assess the concomitant proarrhythmic factors.

Methods

We evaluated 16 consecutive cases with documented, antiarrhythmic drug-induced TdP who were referred to the Laboratory of Molecular Medicine at Helsinki University for LQTS genetic testing between September 2000 and August 2005.

Results

A prolonged QTc interval was observed in 56% of the patients before administration of the drug. TdP was associated with amiodarone in seven, sotalol in six, flecainide in two, and propafenone in one of the cases. Except for the culprit drug, one or more risk factors such as female sex, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation were present in each drug-associated TdP. DNA samples were screened for the four common Finnish founder mutations (KCNQ1 G589D and IVS7–2A→G, HERG L552S, and R176W), which are known to account for the majority of inherited LQTS in Finland. A total of three (19%) individuals carried one of these four mutations.

Conclusions

Our data show that previously unsuspected LQTS mutations may be present in patients with antiarrhythmic drug-associated TdPs. A normal QTc interval does not exclude the risk of proarrhythmia.

Electrical understanding of long-QT syndrome pathophysiology

The congenital LQTS is characterized by prolonged and dispersed cardiac repolarization and is classically deemed a 'purely electrical' disease (Graphical Abstract, upper quadrants). Mutations in 17 genes encoding ion-channel subunits or their channel-interacting proteins have been linked to LQTS. Of these, three major and five minor genes have been recently classified as definitely causative, reducing repolarizing outward currents, mostly via loss of function of I Ks (LQT1) or I Kr (LQT2), or augmenting late I Na (LQT3). Distortions of the delicate balance of these ion currents underlie the clinically observed long QT interval. Patients with LQTS are at increased risk of developing life-threatening torsades-de-pointes (TdP) arrhythmias [prolonged repolarization-dependent polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) with the characteristic, sinusoid-like twisting of the QRS axis around the iso-electric baseline]. Torsades-de-pointes initiation is mostly pause-dependent (± 70%, short–long–short, LQT2 and LQT3) or acceleration/non-pause induced (LQT1).

### Mexiletine prevents recurrent torsades de Pointes in acquired long QT Syndrome refractory to conventional measures [^111HXPKv]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to examine the role of mexiletine, a late sodium current (I Na-L) blocker, in acute termination of torsades de pointes (TdP) refractory to conventional therapy in acquired long QT syndromes (LQTS).

Background

Long QT interval can predispose to TdP and is therefore associated with significant mortality. Currently, there is no available pharmacotherapy to target directly the ionic basis of most LQTS for the acute termination of TdP. Earlier evidence highlighted the role of I Na-L in the pathophysiology of long QT and TdP, particularly in patients with congenital LQTS.

Methods

Twelve patients with TdP caused by acquired LQTS were treated with mexiletine after failure of conventional treatment including discontinuation of QT-prolonging drugs, intravenous administration of magnesium, and correction of serum electrolyte abnormalities.

Results

No recurrence of TdP occurred within 2 h after initiation of treatment with mexiletine in all 12 patients. Macro T-wave alternans accompanied by QT prolongation, an electrocardiographic precursor of TdP that was seen in 3 patients, was also abolished by mexiletine. Treatment with mexiletine shortened the QTc interval from 599 ± 27 ms to 514 ± 16 ms (p = 0.001). The interval from the peak to the end of the T-wave (T p-e interval) decreased from 145 ± 18 ms to 106 ± 9 ms (p = 0.005). The T p-e /QT ratio decreased from 0.27 ± 0.02 to 0.23 ± 0.018 (p = 0.01). Mexiletine had no significant effect on QRS complex duration.

Conclusions

I Na-L blockade with mexiletine may be an effective treatment approach to terminate refractory TdP from several acquired causes of LQTS.

### Mexiletine effectively prevented refractory torsades de pointes and ventricular fibrillation in a patient with congenital type 2 long QT syndrome [^114a4AJ6]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

We report a 28-year-old female patient with congenital type 2 long QT syndrome (LQTS) in which mexiletine shortened corrected QT interval (QTc) and effectively prevented refractory Torsade de Pointes (TdP) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). She developed TdP and VF, and was subsequently diagnosed with congenital type 2 LQTS. She had refractory TdP and VF every day despite medical therapy including β-blocker. They were completely suppressed after the initiation of mexiletine with shorting of QTc interval.

### Clinical and therapeutic aspects of congenital and acquired long QT syndrome [^111EzUVi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The long QT syndrome is characterized by prolongation of the corrected QT (QTc) interval on the surface electrocardiogram. It is associated with precipitation of a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, torsade de pointes, which may cause sudden death. The syndrome is a disorder of cardiac repolarization caused by the alterations in the transmembrane potassium and sodium currents. Six genetic loci for the congenital forms of the syndrome have been identified; sporadic cases occur because of spontaneous mutations. Acquired causes of the long QT syndrome include drugs, electrolyte imbalance, toxins, marked bradycardia, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, myocardial ischemia, protein-sparing fasting, autonomic neuropathy, and human immunodeficiency virus disease. Clinical symptoms are the result of the precipitation of torsade de pointes and range from such minor symptoms as dizziness to syncope and sudden death. Short-term treatment is aimed at preventing the recurrences of torsade de pointes and includes intravenous magnesium and potassium administration, temporary cardiac pacing, and correction of electrolyte imbalance; rarely, intravenous isoproterenol is indicated. Long-term management includes use of beta-blockers, permanent pacemaker placement, and cardioverter-defibrillator implantation. Asymptomatic patients are treated if under the age of 40 years at the time of diagnosis.

Long QT syndrome

LQTS forms a genetically heterogeneous group of conditions, characterised by prolonged ventricular repolarisation and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias, particularly torsade de pointes. In contrast to BrS, the mutations in LQTS result in a favouring of depolarising currents over repolarising ones. Evidence from several mouse models (for references see) have implicated prolonged APD in two major problems generating an arrhythmic substrate (figure 4). First, increased refractory periods from channels that remain depolarised for greater periods create pockets of functional block, which may act as the focus for re-entry. Second, differences in dispersion of repolarisation across the myocardium may result in a functional re-entry acting as a trigger for torsade de pointes. EADs are also more common due to the extended time of depolarisation, which may in turn trigger polymorphic VT.

Figure 4
Mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis in long QT syndrome from animal models. The scales demonstrate that associated genetic mutations result in a gain of depolarising currents or a loss of repolarising currents. This in turn results in triggered activity in the form of early after-depolarisations, the formation of refractory pockets and the generation of abnormal transmural gradients. The lowest trace shows an ECG with the initiation of torsade de pointes recapitulating the clinical phenotype. All traces shown are from mice.

Definition of prolonged QT interval thresholds — The expert writing group recommends that a QTc over the 99th percentile should be considered abnormally prolonged. Approximate 99th percentile QTc values for otherwise healthy postpubertal individuals are 470 ms for males and 480 ms for females. For both males and females, a QTc > 500 ms is considered highly abnormal. Some standard 12-lead ECG algorithms label a QTc > 440 ms as borderline QT prolongation, despite the fact that this value is exceeded by approximately 10% to 20% of the population.

### Sudden arrhythmia death syndrome: importance of the long QT syndrome [^113XauZo]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

In approximately 5 percent of sudden cardiac deaths, no demonstrable anatomic abnormality is found. Some cases are caused by sudden arrhythmia death syndrome. A prolonged QT interval is a common thread among the various entities associated with sudden arrhythmia death syndrome. A number of drugs are known to cause QT prolongation (e.g., terfenadine), as are hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, myocarditis, and endocrine and nutritional disorders. Recently, attention has focused on a group of inherited gene mutations in cardiac ion channels that cause long QT syndrome and carry an increased risk for sudden death. Some of the highest rates of inherited long QT syndrome occur in Southeast Asian and Pacific Rim countries. The median age of persons who die of long QT syndrome is 32 years; men are predominately affected. In addition to a prolonged QT interval, which occurs in some but not all persons with long QT syndrome, another characteristic electrocardiographic abnormality is the so-called Brugada sign (an upward deflection of the terminal portion of the QRS complex). Most cardiac events are precipitated by vigorous exercise or emotional stress, but they also can occur during sleep. Torsades de pointes and ventricular fibrillation are the usual fatal arrhythmias. Long QT syndrome should be suspected in patients with recurrent syncope during exertion and those with family histories of sudden, unexpected death. Unfortunately, not all persons with long QT syndrome have premonitory symptoms or identifiable electrocardiographic abnormalities, and they may first present with sudden death. Beta blockers, potassium supplements, and implantable defibrillators have been used for treatment of long QT syndrome. Identifying the specific gene mutation in a given patient with long QT syndrome can help guide prophylactic therapy.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Drug‑induced long QT and torsades de pointes management — high‑risk patients should be monitored during initiation of QT‑prolonging antiarrhythmic medications, with temporary pacing used for recurrent torsades after potassium and magnesium supplementation and isoproterenol to increase heart rate and abolish postectopic pauses. Intravenous magnesium can suppress episodes of torsades de pointes, with doses usually used of 1 to 2 g intravenously, and repeated doses may be titrated; maintaining serum potassium between 4.5 mEq/L and 5 mEq/L shortens QT and may reduce recurrence. Genetic findings in medication‑induced torsades de pointes do not yet support general genetic screening, although in long QT syndrome genetic testing may be performed in the index case and, if the patient did not survive, electrocardiographic screening of first‑degree relatives may be performed. QT‑prolonging medications are not used in congenital or acquired long QT syndrome unless there is no suitable alternative or the benefit greatly exceeds the risk, and implicated drugs span multiple classes including antiarrhythmics, antihistamines, antibiotics, antifungals, antidepressants, antipsychotics, opiates, and anticancer agents.

### R-from-T as a common mechanism of arrhythmia initiation in long QT syndromes [^114RP4CX]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

QT prolongation is a major risk factor of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in congenital and acquired long QT syndromes (LQTS), – heart failure, and ischemia. During the last 2 decades, genetic sequencing and molecular studies have revealed a diverse taxonomy of congenital LQTS subtypes, classified by both the specific genetic mutations and the ion channels they affect. Since the discovery of LQTS type 1 (LQT1), 16 distinct subtypes of LQTS have been classified, with the major subtypes being LQT1, LQTS type 2 (LQT2), and LQTS type 3 (LQT3). In addition, many drugs have been identified to prolong QT interval resulting in acquired LQTS.

While the molecular causes of LQTS are complex, clinical studies have shown that polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias (PVTs) or Torsade de Pointes in LQTS patients are usually preceded by several characteristic ECG features (Figure 1):

Introduction

Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a genetic condition that impacts 1 out of 2000 lives. It leads to dysfunctional cardiac repolarization and manifests as sudden cardiac arrest in 13% of patients. LQTS is defined by a prolongation of the cardiac action potential, reflected as a corrected QT (QTc) interval > 440 ms among males or > 460 ms among females. This pattern can lead to irregular heartbeat pattern, torsades de pointes, and potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, sometimes as the first symptom of the disease.

Congenital LQTS has several genetic variants implicated. Specifically, mutations in three major genes have been causally linked: KCNQ1 in subtype 1, KCNH2 in subtype 2, and SCN5A in subtype 3. However, widespread genetic testing of the general population is currently limited. Routine clinical genomic testing, while desirable, is complicated by cost, logistics and need for expert interpretation at a large scale, especially when individual experiences and perceptions of arrhythmias vary widely.

According to the Schwartz score, diagnosis and risk stratification depend on clinical and family history and electrocardiogram (ECG) features. There are a few challenges with the utility of this criteria. One major issue in the diagnosis of LQTS is symptom variability, which can sometimes result in asymptomatic presentation. The arrhythmias associated with LQTS may be triggered by various factors such as stress, physical activity, or pharmacotherapy, adding complexity to the diagnosis as symptoms may not be consistently present and perceived.

In addition, cases of LQTS may lack observable ECG characteristics. QT interval and T wave morphology constitute key criteria for the Schwartz score, yet normal QTc in up to 40% of patients with genetic risk can complicate detection of the disease. While these patients have a lower risk of life-threatening events compared to those with evident symptoms, their risk is still higher than unaffected genotype-negative family members. These patients also remain predisposed to developing life-threatening torsades de pointes if exposed to pharmacological substances that inhibit potassium channels and may pass on phenotypic disease to future generations. Above all, even if patients demonstrate long QTc, this presentation often fails to trigger work up because of the multiple etiologies of QTc prolongation. To better improve the use of information from waveform data, artificial intelligence could be leveraged on ECGs for genomic inference.

AHA/ACCF scientific statement on prevention of torsade de pointes in hospital settings — Cardiac arrest due to torsade de pointes (TdP) in acquired drug-induced long-QT syndrome (LQTS) is described as "a rare but potentially catastrophic event in hospital settings". Administration of a QT‑prolonging drug to hospitalized patients "may be more likely to cause TdP" than in outpatients because hospitalized patients often have additional risk factors, including being "elderly people with underlying heart disease" and having "renal or hepatic dysfunction, electrolyte abnormalities, or bradycardia", with possible rapid intravenous administration. In units with continuous electrocardiograms (ECGs), "the possibility of TdP may be anticipated by the detection of an increasing QT interval and other premonitory ECG signs of impending arrhythmia", after which "it then becomes possible to discontinue the culprit drug and manage concomitant provocative conditions (eg, hypokalemia, bradyarrhythmias) to reduce the occurrence of cardiac arrest". The statement "is to raise awareness among those who care for patients in hospital units about the risk, ECG monitoring, and management of drug-induced LQTS" and reviews "methods to monitor QT intervals in hospital settings, and immediate management of marked QT prolongation and TdP". The term torsade de pointes "was coined by Dessertenne in 1966" as "a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia characterized by a pattern of twisting points", with a typical ECG feature being "a change in the amplitude and morphology (twisting) of the QRS complexes around the isoelectric line".

Women with the congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) — risk patterns and ICD consideration: In women with the congenital LQTS, the risk of cardiac arrest is greater during the postpartum period compared with before or during pregnancy, and the relative tachycardia seen during pregnancy may serve to shorten the QT interval and be protective. Beta blockers can generally be used safely during pregnancy, and use during pregnancy is generally well tolerated by both the mother and the fetus, although a decrease in fetal heart rate can be seen. Multiple observations indicate increased susceptibility in women: the incidence of both congenital and acquired long QT and resultant torsades de pointes is higher in women than in men; in the Long QT Registry, 70% of the subjects and 58% of affected family members are women; and until puberty, males were more likely than females to have cardiac arrest or syncope, with potentially fatal events subsequently predominating in females. Drug-induced torsades de pointes is more common in women than in men. For high-risk patients, ICD therapy should be strongly considered in patients with long-term QT syndromes who are drug resistant and those with marked potential for life-threatening arrhythmias.

### Evaluation of the QT interval in patients with drug-induced QT prolongation and torsades de pointes [^117DTv3o]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Data on the optimal location of the electrocardiogram (ECG) leads for the diagnosis of drug-induced long QT syndrome (diLQTS) with torsades de pointes (TdP) are lacking.

Methods

We systematically reviewed the literature for the ECGs of patients with diLQTS and subsequent TdP. We assessed T wave morphology in each lead and measured the longest QT interval in the limb and chest leads in a standardized fashion.

Results

Of 84 patients, 61.9% were female and the mean age was 58.8 years. QTc was significantly longer in chest versus limb leads (mean (SD) 671 (102) vs. 655 (97) ms, p = .02). Using only limb leads for QT interpretation, 18 (21.4%) ECGs were noninterpretable: 10 (11.9%) due to too flat T waves, 7 (8.3%) due to frequent, early PVCs and 1 (1.2%) due to too low ECG recording quality. In the chest leads, ECGs were noninterpretable in nine (10.7%) patients: six (7.1%) due to frequent, early PVCs, one (1.2%) due to insufficient ECG quality, two (2.4%) due to missing chest leads but none due to too flat T waves. The most common T wave morphologies in the limb leads were flat (51.0%), broad (14.3%), and late peaking (12.6%) T waves. Corresponding chest lead morphologies were inverted (35.5%), flat (19.6%), and biphasic (15.2%) T waves.

Conclusions

Our results indicate that QT evaluation by limb leads only underestimates the incidence of diLQTS experiencing TdP and favors the screening using both limb and chest lead ECG.

### Drug-induced torsades de pointes and implications for drug development [^116aCX9D]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2004). Low credibility.

Torsades de pointes is a potentially lethal arrhythmia that occasionally appears as an adverse effect of pharmacotherapy. Recently developed understanding of the underlying electrophysiology allows better estimation of the drug-induced risks and explains the failures of older approaches through the surface ECG. This article expresses a consensus reached by an independent academic task force on the physiologic understanding of drug-induced repolarization changes, their preclinical and clinical evaluation, and the risk-to-benefit interpretation of drug-induced torsades de pointes. The consensus of the task force includes suggestions on how to evaluate the risk of torsades within drug development programs. Individual sections of the text discuss the techniques and limitations of methods directed at drug-related ion channel phenomena, investigations aimed at action potentials changes, preclinical studies of phenomena seen only in the whole (or nearly whole) heart, and interpretation of human ECGs obtained in clinical studies. The final section of the text discusses drug-induced torsades within the larger evaluation of drug-related risks and benefits.

The average of these intervals would then be used as the adjusted QT interval. It is important to note that the majority of patients with documented acquired LQTS never experience torsades de pointes, and many patients with torsades de pointes have a normal QT interval shortly before the event. It appears that a variety of coincident circumstances, including genetic predisposition and a prolonged QT interval. are required to precipitate torsades de pointes. Factors that predispose to QT prolongation and higher risk of torsades de pointes include older age, female sex, low left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular hypertrophy, ischemia, slow heart rate, and electrolyte abnormalities including hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. 5, 27–34 Certain.

An example of a mixed interaction is that of erythromycin and cisapride. Not only do both drugs block potassium. the specific circumstances of the patient, and other available therapeutic options. For example, a QT interval–prolonging medication is the appropriate. Despite these recommendations, uncertainty remains regarding the specific relationship between the degree of QT prolongation and the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias with each individual drug.

A patient with long QT syndrome and syncope underwent electrophysiological testing and recording of monophasic action potentials (MAP). Programmed ventricular stimulation using up to three premature stimuli did not provoke arrhythmias. Transient action potential prolongation and afterdepolarizations were observed during pauses directly after high-rate fix frequent right ventricular burst pacing at 120–160 bpm. During the pause after burst pacing at 180 bpm, afterdepolarizations at 16–19% amplitude of the MAP plateau persisted for several beats and preceded a short episode of torsades de pointes.

### Torsade or not torsade? That is the question… [^113jPpr1]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Ditmanson LF, Phibbs BP. Torsade or Not Torsade? That Is the Question. Arch Intern Med. 1998; 158: 1578–1579. doi: In reply Verdino's letter seems to miss practically everything about the case we described. In the first place, his comments about prolongation of QT interval are irrelevant since there was no preceding electrocardiogram from which QTc could be determined. On the only previous tracing, there was a ventricular bigeminy, which meant that QTc could not be measured on the alternating sinus beats. Second, as Verdino himself observes, after the episode our patient received a number of agents that shorten QTc, which again, was not possible to measure.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Torsades de pointes definition — Torsades de pointes is polymorphic VT that occurs in the setting of a long QT interval and is characterized by a waxing and waning QRS amplitude; it often has a long-short initiating sequence with a long coupling interval to the first VT beat and may present with salvos of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). The twisting of the points may not always be seen, especially if the episode is nonsustained or if only a limited number of leads are available, and torsades de pointes can result from bradycardia including high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block that leads to a long-short sequence initiating torsades de pointes.

Torsade de pointes (TdP) — electrocardiographic onset and behavior in drug‑induced cases usually begin with a short‑long‑short pattern of R‑R cycles initiated by a short‑coupled premature ventricular complex (PVC) followed by a compensatory pause and then another PVC near the peak of the T wave; episodes typically show a warm‑up phenomenon, the TdP rate ranges from 160 to 240 beats per minute, and spontaneous termination often shows slowing in the last 2 to 3 beats. The term is better confined to episodic polymorphic tachycardias with marked (> 500 ms) QT‑interval prolongation and QT‑U deformity, reflecting a distinct mechanistic and therapeutic entity.

### Prevention of torsade de pointes in hospital settings: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and the American college of cardiology foundation [^1139UEzN]. Circulation (2010). Medium credibility.

Torsade de pointes (TdP) prevention in hospital settings — among patients who receive QT-prolonging drugs in hospital units with continuous ECG monitoring, TdP should be avoidable if there is an awareness of individual risk factors and the ECG signs of drug-induced LQTS. Key ECG risk factors include marked QT prolongation to > 500 ms (with the exception of amiodarone- or verapamil-induced QT prolongation), marked QT-U prolongation and distortion after a pause, onset of ventricular ectopy and couplets, macroscopic T-wave alternans, or episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that are initiated with a short-long-short R-R cycle sequence (typically, PVC–compensatory pause–PVC). Recognition of these ECG harbingers of TdP allows for treatment with intravenous magnesium, removal of the offending agent, and correction of electrolyte abnormalities and other exacerbating factors, including the prevention of bradycardia and long pauses with temporary pacing if necessary.

Premonitory ECG signs of torsade de pointes (TdP) — risk increases with corrected QT interval (QTc), as each 10‑ms increase in QTc contributes approximately a 5% to 7% exponential increase in risk; a patient with a QTc of 500 ms has a 63% to 97% higher risk than a patient with a QTc of 440 ms, and data from congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) indicate that a QTc > 500 ms is associated with a 2‑ to 3‑fold higher risk, with similar increased risk in drug‑induced TdP when QTc > 500 ms is exceeded. There is no threshold of QT prolongation at which TdP is certain to occur; before onset, a short‑long‑short R‑R sequence is associated with marked QT prolongation and T‑U–wave distortion, TdP is especially likely when QT prolongation reflects an increase in Tpeak–Tend, and exaggerated QT‑interval prolongation with T‑U distortion after a pause should be considered a strong marker of risk for TdP.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Management of torsades de pointes with QT-prolonging antiarrhythmics — monitoring high-risk patients during initiation and recognizing the syndrome early are emphasized; maintaining serum potassium between 4.5 and 5 mEq/L shortens QT, although no specific data are available on the efficacy of potassium repletion to prevent torsades de pointes; intravenous magnesium can suppress episodes even when serum magnesium is normal; magnesium toxicity can occur when concentrations reach 6 to 8 mEq/L but is a very small risk with doses usually used, 1 to 2 g intravenously; temporary pacing is highly effective for recurrent torsades after potassium repletion and magnesium supplementation, and isoproterenol can also be used to increase heart rate and abolish postectopic pauses; anecdotes have reported that lidocaine, verapamil, and even occasionally amiodarone have been effective, although amiodarone may itself cause torsades de pointes, albeit much less commonly than with other QT‑prolonging antiarrhythmics.

### Acquired long QT syndrome: a focus for the general pediatrician [^114Qb2yu]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Acquired long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a disorder of cardiac repolarization most often due to specific drugs, hypokalemia, or hypomagnesemia that may precipitate torsade de pointes and cause sudden cardiac death. Common presentations of the LQTS are palpitations, presyncope, syncope, cardiac arrest, and seizures. An abnormal 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained while the patient is at rest is the key to diagnosis. The occurrence of drug-induced LQTS is unpredictable in any given individual, but a common observation is that most patients have at least 1 identifiable risk factor in addition to drug exposure. The cornerstone of the management of acquired LQTS includes the identification and discontinuation of any precipitating drug and the correction of metabolic abnormalities, such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. Most of the episodes of torsade de pointes are short-lived and terminate spontaneously. We propose a management protocol that could be useful for the daily practice in the emergency pediatric department to reduce the risk of acquired QT prolongation.

### Long QT syndrome caused by noncardiac drugs [^115gh1Ef]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Numerous medications not intended for cardiac use (including antibiotics, histamine blockers, and antipsychotic medications) incidentally block potassium channels in myocardial cells, prolong the QT interval, and may trigger malignant arrhythmias. Although the odds for a given patient for developing arrhythmias are small, the number of patients receiving such drugs is enormous. Most patients developing proarrhythmia have additional risk factors that could be easily identified from their medical history. The list of risk factors includes female gender, organic heart disease, hypokalemia, and a history of long QT or drug-induced arrhythmias. Patients without risk factors are at very low risk. For these patients, it is neither practical nor necessary to record an electrocardiogram before therapy is initiated and the most important preventive measure is to avoid concurrent administration of 2 or more drugs that prolong the QT interval or administration of a medication that impairs the metabolism of a QT-prolonging drug. We performed a computerized literature search using the key words "long QT", "torsade", "drug-adverse effects", and "drug-ventricular arrhythmias", searching for published reports of drug-induced torsade de pointes. The references in each of these reports also were reviewed to identify additional publications. In addition, we reviewed the published reviews and the Internet sites dealing with drug-induced arrhythmias. All the original articles quoted in these reviews and Web sites were examined critically.

### Diagnosis, management and therapeutic strategies for congenital long QT syndrome [^116ZJtag]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

The age of onset of arrhythmias is typically younger in LQT1 patients and in particular LQT1 males are at risk, whereas most LQT2 and LQT3 patients who become symptomatic experience their first symptoms around puberty and here particular females are at risk (figure 3). Also, the morphology of the ST-T segments is rather specific for the three subtypes, and the genotype can be accurately predicted with these characteristic features. Furthermore, each genotype also has specific triggers for arrhythmic events and rather specific electrocardiographic features of the onset of the arrhythmias (figure 3). The arrhythmias in LQTS (figure 4F) originate from the last part of the ventricular action potential where severe action potential prolongation results in early afterdepolarisations that at one instant reach threshold for subsequent fast sodium inward current and a trigger beat that then degenerates into fast polymorphic ventricular arrhythmia: Torsades de Pointes and ventricular fibrillation. Adrenergic triggers, particularly exercise and swimming, are the most important trigger for arrhythmic events in LQT1, whereas in LQT2 sudden arousal (ie, auditory stimuli) is predominant (figure 3). Events in LQT3 occur most frequently in rest. These gene-specific characteristics not surprisingly associate with a high response to β-blockers of LQT1 patients, although also in LQT2 and LQT3 patients β-blockers constitute the first line of therapy. LQT3 patients are most sensitive to (late) sodium channel current blockers. Because of the genotype-specific features (figure 3) with impact on prognosis and therapy, genetic testing has become an integral part of the diagnosis and management of LQTS patients.

### Ciprofloxacin-induced acquired long QT syndrome [^111GJTV6]. Heart Rhythm (2004). Low credibility.

Quinolone antibiotics have potentially serious proarrhythmic effects. The effects on intracardiac potassium channels result in QT interval prolongation, leading to torsades de pointes. Evidence suggests fluoroquinolones cause QT-mediated proarrhythmia, and weak evidence links ciprofloxacin with QT-mediated arrhythmias. Ciprofloxacin may be given to select patients because the agent is believed to be safer than other drugs in its class. We report two cases of unexplained cardiac arrest temporally related to ciprofloxacin administration. Two female patients (ages 44 and 67 years) developed marked QTc prolongation (QTc 590 and 680 ms) within 24 hours of ciprofloxacin administration, with recurrent syncope and documented torsades de pointes requiring defibrillation. The patients previously were stable with sotalol and amiodarone therapy for supraventricular arrhythmia without obvious QTc prolongation prior to ciprofloxacin therapy. Marked QTc prolongation and subsequent proarrhythmia became a clinical concern only after initiation of ciprofloxacin. In both cases, the QTc normalized after cessation of ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin may cause QTc prolongation and rarely torsades de pointes. This effect is of particular concern in patients with predisposing factors, such as concomitant medications or underlying heart disease reflecting decreased repolarization reserve.

Drug-induced long QT syndrome — clinical features and risks include that marked QT prolongation with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia torsades de pointes occurs in 1% to 10% of patients receiving QT-prolonging antiarrhythmic drugs and most cases display a "short-long-short" sequence before tachycardia. QT intervals, uncorrected for rate, are generally greater than 500 ms, prominent U waves are common, and marked QTU prolongation may be evident only on postpause beats. Genetic susceptibility may contribute, with commoner DNA variants having frequencies ranging up to 15% of some populations. Presentations include incidental detection, palpitations, syncope due to prolonged episodes of torsades de pointes, or sudden cardiac death. The QT-prolonging agent d-sotalol increased mortality in a large randomized clinical trial, and in the DIAMOND trial, 3.3% of patients with severe heart failure (HF) had torsades de pointes during the first 72 h of dofetilide therapy. An up-to-date list is maintained at www.torsades.org and www.qtdrugs.org.

Torsades de Pointes (TdP) is a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia that can be associated with metabolic abnormalities, exposure to arrhythmogenic medications, and congenital long-QT syndrome. This report describes a patient with ALL and multiple complications of therapy who developed TdP. The patient had no evidence of congenital long-QT syndrome, but a constellation of factors appears to have led to QT prolongation, ventricular ectopy, and TdP. Although the patient suffered cardiac arrest, rapid recognition of TdP and prompt defibrillation resulted in an excellent outcome.

### 2023 HRS expert consensus statement on the management of arrhythmias during pregnancy [^113ENGWc]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Long QT syndrome in the fetus — torsades de pointes (TdP) and antiarrhythmic management: In fetuses with TdP, a maternal intravenous loading dose of magnesium sulfate followed by continuous infusion should be administered as first‑line therapy at all stages of pregnancy before considering urgent delivery. If TdP persists despite magnesium, maternal treatment with lidocaine or with a beta‑blocker (preferably propranolol) is reasonable at all stages of pregnancy before considering urgent delivery. In fetuses with TdP or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia associated with potential or documented long QT syndrome, sotalol, procainamide, and amiodarone should not be administered because they can further lengthen QTc and exacerbate arrhythmias.

### Pause-dependent torsade de pointes following acute myocardial infarction: a variant of the acquired long QT syndrome [^1174HVC3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

We report on a previously unrecognized form of the long QT syndrome (QT interval prolongation and pause-dependent polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [VT]) entirely related to myocardial infarction (MI).

Background

Polymorphic VT in the setting of acute MI generally occurs during the hyperacute phase, is related to ischemia, and is not associated with QT prolongation. Although QT prolongation after MI is well described, typical pause-dependent polymorphic VT (torsade de pointes) secondary to uncomplicated MI was previously unknown.

Methods

Of 434 consecutive admissions for acute MI, 8 patients had progressive QT prolongation that led to typical torsade de pointes. None of these patients had active ischemia or other known causes of QT prolongation. These patients were compared with 100 consecutive patients with uncomplicated MI who served as controls.

Results

The incidence of torsade de pointes following MI was 1.8% (95% confidence interval 0.8% to 3.6%). The QTc intervals of patients and controls were similar on admission. The QTc lengthened by day 2 in both groups, but more so in patients with torsade de pointes (from 470 ± 46 to 492 ± 57 ms [p < 0.05] and from 445 ± 58 to 558 ± 84 ms, respectively [p < 0.01]). Maximal QT prolongation and torsade de pointes occurred 3 to 11 days after infarction. Therapy included defibrillation, magnesium, lidocaine and beta-blockers. Three patients required rapid cardiac pacing. The long-term course was uneventful.

Conclusions

Infarct-related torsade de pointes is uncommon but potentially lethal. An acquired long QT syndrome should be considered in patients recovering from MI who experience polymorphic VT as specific therapeutic measures are mandatory.

### Genetic and phenotypic characterization of community hospital patients with QT prolongation [^11793Huq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Congenital long‐QT syndrome (LQTS) is a genetic disorder characterized by prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc) on an ECG. It is associated with increased risk of torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death. The estimated prevalence of LQTS is 1:2000 live births. 1

QTc ≥ 500 ms is considered to be highly abnormal and associated with increased risk of torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia, 2 but also carriers of LQTS mutations with a QTc ≤ 440 ms have an increased risk of life‐threatening cardiac events. 3 Treatment with β‐blocker medication significantly reduces the risk of adverse outcomes. 4

More than 1500 sequence variants in 17 genes have previously been reported to be pathogenic or likely pathogenic for LQTS, although the evidence for some of these is limited. 5 Autosomal dominant is the most common inheritance pattern, and KCNQ1 (LQT1) harbors most genetic defects, followed by KCNH2 (LQT2) and SCN5A (LQT3). 6, 7 Penetrance is incomplete, and expression is variable within families; these factors complicate both interpretation of pathogenicity of sequence variants in LQTS genes and genetic counseling. 8

Most molecular genetic studies of LQTS have been conducted in cohorts clinically diagnosed with LQTS or ascertained through cascade screening of relatives for a specific causative variant, and 80% of families meeting clinical diagnostic criteria have detectable pathogenic or likely pathogenic sequence variants in the 17 known LQTS genes. 9

Current guidelines recommend genetic testing of asymptomatic patients if repetitive ECGs show a QTc ≥ 480 ms (European Society of Cardiology guidelines 2) or a QTc > 500 ms (Heart Rhythm Society/European Heart Rhythm Association Expert Consensus Statement 7) in the absence of secondary causes that may prolong the QT interval. An LQTS risk score (Schwartz) > 3 is also considered diagnostic. 2, 7, 10 In accordance with current clinical guidelines for LQTS, genetic analyses have often been limited to the 3 main LQTS genes. The prevalence and spectrum of pathogenic and likely pathogenic sequence variants in the remaining LQTS genes are less well documented.

The aim of the present study was to estimate the prevalence of pathogenic and likely pathogenic sequence variants in patients who had at least 1 ECG with a QTc ≥ 500 ms admitted to a community hospital. Targeted sequencing was used to analyze all 17 known LQTS genes. We further wanted to determine if these patients fulfilled the clinical criteria for LQTS, according to current guidelines.

### Fragmented QRS is associated with torsades de pointes in patients with acquired long QT syndrome [^113UtadU]. Heart Rhythm (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acquired long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a disease due to a secondary repolarization abnormality induced by various predisposing factors. In contrast to congenital LQTS, risk factors that produce acquired LQTS include organic heart diseases that often exhibit depolarization abnormality. Although various repolarization parameters have been evaluated in acquired LQTS, the existence of depolarization abnormality in association with torsades de pointes (TdP) has not been reported.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate both repolarization (QT components) and depolarization parameters (fragmented QRS [fQRS]) in acquired LQTS patients with markedly prolonged QT interval.

Methods

Seventy patients with acquired severe QT prolongation (QTc ≥ 550 ms) were studied. Thirty-two patients had syncope or TdP (syncope group). Thirty-eight patients did not have any symptoms (asymptomatic group). The existence of fQRS and QT components (QT, QTc, Tpe [interval between peak and end of T wave] intervals, and U-wave voltage) was analyzed.

Results

The syncope group had more frequent fQRS (81%) than did the asymptomatic group (21%, P < .01) and the incidence of fQRS was not different before and after removal of predisposing factors. The incidence of organic heart disease was not different between the two groups. No differences in QTc interval were noted between the syncope and asymptomatic groups, although the syncope group had longer QT and Tpe intervals and higher U wave than the asymptomatic group (P < .01).

Conclusion

Acquired predisposing factors promoted repolarization abnormality (especially prolongation of QT and Tpe intervals), and the existence of fQRS had an important role in the development of TdP in patients with acquired LQTS.

### Predicting the unpredictable: drug-induced QT prolongation and torsades de pointes [^1119NUeF]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Drug-induced long QT syndrome (diLQTS) and congenital LQTS (cLQTS) share many features, and both syndromes can result in life-threatening torsades de pointes (TdP). Our understanding of their mechanistic and genetic similarities has led to their improved clinical management. However, our inability to prevent diLQTS has resulted in removal of many medicines from the market and from development. Genetic and clinical risk factors for diLQTS and TdP are well known and raise the possibility of TdP prevention. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) can scan the patient's electronic health records for clinical risk factors predictive of diLQTS and warn when a drug that can cause TdP is prescribed. CDSS have reduced prescriptions of QT-prolonging drugs, but these relatively small changes lack the power to reduce TdP. The growing genetic evidence linking diLQTS to cLQTS suggests that prevention of TdP in the future may require inclusion of both genetic and clinical predictors into CDSS.

Hospital prevention of torsade de pointes (TdP) — QTc monitoring thresholds, risk signs, and protocol: The guidelines "do recommend removal of the offending agent in patients with drug-induced LQTS (Class I, Level of Evidence: A); however, they do not define what QTc value should prompt discontinuation". After administration of an at‑risk drug, "if the QTc exceeds 500 ms or there has been an increase of at least 60 ms compared with the predrug baseline value… prompt action is indicated". ECG signs of risk "include an increase in QTc from predrug baseline of 60 ms, marked QTc interval prolongation > 500 ms", with additional features listed. For serial measurements, "a consistent method should be used (ie, same recording device, ECG lead, measurement tool [automated or manual], and heart rate-correction formula)". When impending signs develop, recommended actions are to "discontinue the offending drug, replace potassium, administer magnesium, consider temporary pacing… and transfer the patient to a hospital unit with the highest level of ECG monitoring surveillance where immediate defibrillation is available". Additionally, "Patients should not be transported from the unit… and they should be in a unit with the highest possible ECG monitoring surveillance".

### Energy drinks: another cause of QT prolongation? [^112S56Yc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

So, does energy drink–induced QT prolongation pose a serious health risk? The most obvious at‐risk group would be those with a genetic long‐QT syndrome (LQTS); a health risk in this group is supported by 2 case reports and a small clinical trial. A previously healthy 22‐year‐old woman experienced cardiac arrest after drinking 6 cans of energy drink over 4 hours. 8 The initial ECG showed torsade de pointes, and her QTc shortly after arrival was prolonged at 526 ms, normalizing to 419 ms over the next few days. Subsequent genetic testing confirmed LQTS‐1. In a similar case, a 13‐year‐old girl who presented with chest pain and palpitations after consuming an energy drink had a prolonged QTc interval on admission (561 ms) that fully normalized by the next day. 9 Genetic testing again confirmed LQTS‐1. Finally, in a randomized, placebo‐controlled study of subjects with familial LQTS, the QTc interval increased by > 50 ms after energy drink in 3 of 24 patients. 10 Perhaps some of the cardiac arrests linked to energy drinks were the result of unmasking a previously undiagnosed genetic ion channelopathy.

Manual measurement — recommended lead choice, special situations, and atrial fibrillation approach are outlined: the lead for manual QT measurement is one from the patient's 12‑lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with a T‑wave amplitude of at least 2 mm and a well‑defined T‑wave end; when conduction causes a wide QRS, one method is to measure a J‑T interval from the end of the QRS to the end of the T wave; in atrial fibrillation, one way is to identify the shortest and longest R‑R intervals, calculate the QTc for each, and average the 2 QTc values; alternatively, a long rhythm strip can be used to determine whether the interval from R wave to T‑wave peak (or nadir) is more than 50% of the R‑R interval, indicating that the QTc would be longer than the critical threshold of 500 ms if measured.

### A new paradigm for predicting risk of torsades de pointes during drug development: commentary on: "Improved prediction of drug-induced torsades de pointes through simulations of dynamics and machine learning algorithms" [^115y8QvH]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Drug-induced long QT syndrome (diLQTS) is a clinical entity in which administration of a drug produces marked prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG. DiLQTS places a patient at risk of developing Torsades de Pointes (TdP), a malignant polymorphic ventricular tachycardia associated with arrhythmic sudden cardiac death (SCD). In addition to diLQTS, other clinical risk factors for TdP include female gender, bradycardia, electrolyte disturbances, recent conversion to normal (sinus) rhythm, and congenital LQTS.
