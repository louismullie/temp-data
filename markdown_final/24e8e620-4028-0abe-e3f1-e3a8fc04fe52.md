## Question

Work up for incidental adenoma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the workup for an incidental adrenal adenoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical scenario and scope. Then, I should verify the initial imaging characterization and how to interpret Hounsfield units. Next, I will review the mandatory biochemical evaluation and when to add selective tests. After that, I need to stratify management by imaging and hormonal results, including when to observe, when to operate, and when to surveil. Finally, I should confirm follow-up intervals, special populations, and summarize a practical algorithm with caveats and exceptions, ensuring each step aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and scope. An incidental adrenal adenoma is typically an adrenal mass ≥ 1 cm discovered on imaging obtained for unrelated reasons, with prevalence rising due to increased cross-sectional imaging and aging, and most are benign and nonfunctioning, though a meaningful minority are hormonally active or malignant, which mandates a structured workup to answer two questions: is it functional, and is it malignant [^150bcf2b] [^932a67b7] [^e47dec2b].

> Wait, let me verify the initial imaging approach. Non-contrast CT is the first-line modality to assess attenuation in Hounsfield units and morphology; lipid-rich adenomas are typically homogeneous and ≤ 10 HU, which obviates further imaging, whereas lesions 11–20 HU are indeterminate and > 20 HU raise suspicion for malignancy, prompting additional imaging or surgical consideration depending on size and clinical context [^23f3c769] [^1b9ff8ce] [^2fd583b8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about washout. I initially thought contrast-enhanced washout might be universally needed, but I should double-check current guidance. Contemporary recommendations de-emphasize routine adrenal washout CT in the defined incidentaloma population; instead, non-contrast CT density and size guide next steps, with washout reserved for select indeterminate cases or when it meaningfully changes management, so I need to correct that outdated impulse and align with current practice [^7e366f8f] [^23f3c769].

> Next, I should review the mandatory biochemical evaluation. All adrenal incidentalomas ≥ 1 cm should undergo screening for autonomous cortisol secretion with a 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test, and catecholamine excess should be excluded with plasma free metanephrines or a 24-hour urine fractionated metanephrines; selective testing for primary aldosteronism is indicated if the patient is hypertensive or hypokalemic, and androgen excess is considered when clinically suspected, given the prevalence of mild autonomous cortisol secretion and silent pheochromocytoma in this population [^1b9ff8ce] [^786d5bc5] [^25d661b9].

> I will now examine management stratification by imaging and hormonal results. If the lesion is ≤ 10 HU, homogeneous, and < 4 cm with negative biochemical testing, no further imaging or routine follow-up is recommended; if the lesion is 11–20 HU or 1–4 cm with indeterminate features, obtain a single repeat non-contrast CT or MRI at 6–12 months to confirm stability; if the lesion is ≥ 4 cm, has > 20 HU, is heterogeneous, or shows growth, discuss multidisciplinary management and consider surgical resection given malignancy risk and the possibility of adrenocortical carcinoma, especially in younger patients or those with extra-adrenal malignancy history [^1b9ff8ce] [^2fd583b8] [^a7bdb405].

> But wait, what if the mass is hormonally active. Functional tumors warrant surgical referral: pheochromocytoma requires adrenalectomy after appropriate alpha-blockade, overt Cushing's or clinically significant autonomous cortisol secretion merits unilateral adrenalectomy, and aldosterone-producing adenomas in appropriate surgical candidates should be resected; minimally invasive approaches are preferred when feasible, and postoperative steroid management should be planned, including empiric coverage after overt Cushing's and assessment of the need for replacement after mild autonomous cortisol secretion [^1b9ff8ce] [^ab7df6ff] [^eb77fcb0].

> Let me consider follow-up and surveillance carefully. For nonfunctional adenomas with benign imaging features, routine scheduled follow-up is not suggested; for indeterminate lesions observed nonoperatively, a single repeat non-contrast CT or MRI at 6–12 months is reasonable, with surgical referral if growth exceeds 20% and ≥ 5 mm; if stable, many guidelines allow discharge from imaging surveillance, though some recommend periodic clinical reassessment for new symptoms; growth < 3 mm/year is generally considered low risk and does not mandate escalation by itself [^1b9ff8ce] [^a7bdb405] [^a8d9e778].

> I should confirm special populations and contexts. In patients with a history of extra-adrenal malignancy, the pretest probability of adrenal metastasis is higher, so a lower threshold for PET/CT, biopsy, or surgery is appropriate, and pheochromocytoma must still be excluded before any invasive procedure; in patients under 40 years, malignancy risk is relatively higher, so a lower threshold for resection of indeterminate lesions is reasonable; bilateral adrenal masses require individualized evaluation for macronodular hyperplasia, pheochromocytoma, or metastases, with management tailored to etiology and comorbidities [^2fd583b8] [^5700e282] [^f1b73f71].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of biopsy. Adrenal biopsy is not indicated to diagnose a benign adenoma and should be avoided if pheochromocytoma is suspected; it is reserved for patients with a history of extra-adrenal malignancy, inconclusive imaging, and when histology will change management, with catecholamine excess excluded beforehand to mitigate procedural risk [^792f00e5] [^01f89f5e].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check each branch. Start with non-contrast CT to assess size and HU; if ≤ 10 HU, homogeneous, and < 4 cm, stop imaging and proceed with biochemical testing only; if 11–20 HU or indeterminate 1–4 cm, obtain DST and metanephrines and plan a single 6–12 month repeat non-contrast CT or MRI if nonoperative; if ≥ 4 cm, > 20 HU, heterogeneous, or growing, pursue multidisciplinary review and consider adrenalectomy; throughout, any hormonal excess triggers surgical referral irrespective of imaging features, and patients with extra-adrenal malignancy or age under 40 merit a lower threshold for aggressive evaluation [^1b9ff8ce] [^2fd583b8] [^a7bdb405].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and communication are explicit. Radiology reports should include size, HU, homogeneity, and clear recommendations for biochemical testing and follow-up; endocrine results should be interpreted in clinical context; and patients should be counseled on the low but real risks of malignancy and the possibility of evolving hormone secretion, aligning decisions with patient preferences and comorbidities to avoid both under- and overtreatment [^7e366f8f] [^150bcf2b] [^25d661b9].

The workup for an incidental adrenal adenoma centers on two questions: **is it functional** and **is it malignant**. All patients with an adrenal incidentaloma ≥ 1 cm should undergo **biochemical testing** for autonomous cortisol secretion (1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test) and catecholamines (plasma free metanephrines or 24-hour urine metanephrines) [^1b9ff8ce]; add an aldosterone-to-renin ratio if hypertensive or hypokalemic [^1b9ff8ce]. Non-contrast CT is the **first-line imaging** to assess size, density (HU), and growth; lesions ≤ 10 HU are benign and require no further imaging, while indeterminate lesions (11–20 HU or > 4 cm) warrant repeat imaging at 6–12 months [^a7bdb405] [^1b9ff8ce]. Surgery is indicated for functional tumors, suspected malignancy (≥ 4 cm, > 20 HU, or growth > 20% + ≥ 5 mm), or lesions with concerning imaging features; otherwise, observe with interval imaging and selective biochemical retesting [^2fd583b8] [^1b9ff8ce].

---

## Initial clinical assessment

History and physical examination should screen for **symptoms of hormone excess** (Cushingoid features, hypertension, palpitations, diaphoresis, virilization) and **extra-adrenal malignancy** that increases the risk of metastasis [^e47dec2b] [^1b9ff8ce].

---

## Biochemical evaluation

All patients with an adrenal incidentaloma ≥ 1 cm should undergo **biochemical testing** to exclude hormone excess [^1b9ff8ce]:

| **Hormone** | **Test** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Cortisol | 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test | All patients |
| Catecholamines | Plasma free metanephrines or 24-hour urine metanephrines | All patients |
| Aldosterone | Aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) | Hypertension or hypokalemia |
| Androgens | DHEAS, testosterone | Clinical suspicion of androgen excess |

---

## Imaging evaluation

Non-contrast CT is the **preferred initial imaging** modality to characterize adrenal masses [^23f3c769]:

- **Benign features**: Homogeneous, lipid-rich lesions with attenuation ≤ 10 HU require no further imaging [^23f3c769].
- **Indeterminate features**: 11–20 HU or size > 4 cm warrant repeat imaging at 6–12 months [^a7bdb405].
- **Suspicious features**: > 20 HU, heterogeneity, or growth > 20% + ≥ 5 mm suggest malignancy and should prompt surgical consultation [^2fd583b8].

MRI or PET/CT may be considered for **indeterminate lesions** or when CT is contraindicated [^c36ee984].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgery is indicated for:

- **Functional tumors**: Autonomous cortisol secretion, pheochromocytoma, or aldosterone-producing adenoma [^b05aab10].
- **Suspected malignancy**: Tumors ≥ 4 cm, > 20 HU, or with rapid growth (> 20% + ≥ 5 mm) [^2fd583b8].
- **Patient preference**: After counseling on risks and benefits [^905b9047].

Minimally invasive adrenalectomy is preferred for **benign or small malignant tumors** without local invasion [^2a33999e] [^dbfd8579].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

For nonfunctional, benign-appearing lesions (< 4 cm, ≤ 10 HU), **no routine follow-up** is required [^1b9ff8ce] [^c26c594d]. For indeterminate lesions, repeat non-contrast CT or MRI at 6–12 months is recommended; if stable, discontinue imaging [^a7bdb405]. Functional tumors or those with concerning features require individualized follow-up and multidisciplinary care [^fb07a52c].

---

## Special considerations

- **Extra-adrenal malignancy**: Higher risk of adrenal metastasis; consider PET/CT or biopsy if results will alter management [^5700e282].
- **Bilateral adrenal masses**: Evaluate for macronodular hyperplasia, pheochromocytoma, or metastases [^f1b73f71].
- **Young patients (< 40 years)**: Lower threshold for surgical intervention due to higher malignancy risk [^notfound].

---

The workup for an incidental adrenal adenoma requires a **multidisciplinary approach**, integrating biochemical testing, imaging characterization, and clinical judgment to guide management and surveillance [^06b315c6].

### Discrepancies in the recommended management of adrenal incidentalomas by various guidelines [^18f1908b]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Adrenal incidentalomas are being discovered with increasing frequency, and their discovery poses a challenge to clinicians. Despite the 2002 National Institutes of Health consensus statement, there are still discrepancies in the most recent guidelines from organizations representing endocrinology, endocrine surgery, urology and radiology. We review recent guidelines across the specialties involved in diagnosing and treating adrenal incidentalomas, and discuss points of agreement as well as controversy among guidelines.

Materials and Methods

PubMed®, Scopus®, Embase™ and Web of Science™ databases were searched systematically in November 2019 in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement to identify the most recently updated committee produced clinical guidelines in each of the 4 specialties. Five articles met the inclusion criteria.

Results

There is little debate among the reviewed guidelines as to the initial evaluation of an adrenal incidentaloma. All patients with a newly discovered adrenal incidentaloma should receive an unenhanced computerized tomogram and hormone screen. The most significant points of divergence among the guidelines regard reimaging an initially benign appearing mass, repeat hormone testing and management of an adrenal incidentaloma that is not easily characterized as benign or malignant on computerized tomography. The guidelines range from actively recommending against any repeat imaging and hormone screening to recommending a repeat scan as early as in 3 to 6 months and annual hormonal screening for several years.

Conclusions

After reviewing the guidelines and the evidence used to support them we posit that best practices lie at their convergence and have presented our management recommendations on how to navigate the guidelines when they are discrepant.

### Diagnosis, management, and follow-up of the incidentally discovered adrenal mass: CUA guideline endorsed by the AUA [^05d8accf]. The Journal of Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Incidental adrenal masses are common and require a multidisciplinary approach to evaluation and management that includes family physicians, urologists, endocrinologists, and radiologists. The purpose of this guideline is to provide an updated approach to the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of adrenal incidentalomas, with a special focus on the areas of discrepancy/controversy existing among the published guidelines from other associations.

Materials and Methods

This guideline was developed by the Canadian Urological Association (CUA) through a working group comprised of urologists, endocrinologists, and radiologists and subsequently endorsed by the American Urological Association (AUA). A systematic review utilizing the GRADE approach served as the basis for evidence-based recommendations with consensus statements provided in the absence of evidence. For each guideline statement, the strength of recommendation was reported as weak or strong, and the quality of evidence was evaluated as low, medium, or high.

Results

The CUA working group provided evidence- and consensus-based recommendations based on an updated systematic review and subject matter expertise. Important updates on evidence-based radiological evaluation and hormonal testing are included in the recommendations. This guideline clarifies which patients may benefit from surgery and highlights where short term surveillance is appropriate.

Conclusion

Incidentally detected adrenal masses require a comprehensive assessment of hormonal function and oncologic risk. This guideline provides a contemporary approach to the appropriate clinical, radiographic, and endocrine assessments required for the evaluation, management, and follow-up of patients with such lesions.

### Adrenal incidentaloma: evaluation and management [^0579de0b]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Adrenal incidentalomas are adrenal masses discovered incidental to imaging studies performed for reasons unrelated to adrenal pathology. Although most adrenal incidentalomas are non-functioning benign adenomas, their increasing prevalence presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The assessment of adrenal incidentalomas is aimed at deciding whether or not the tumour should be surgically removed. Adrenalectomy is indicated for phaeochromocytoma, other symptomatic hormone-secreting tumours and those with a high risk of malignancy. Biochemical screening for tumour hypersecretion is mandatory in all adrenal incidentalomas, since hormone secreting tumours may be clinically silent. The diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma is of paramount importance because of its life-threatening complications. Non-functioning adrenal incidentalomas need assessment for risk of malignancy, and this is based on the size of the tumour and its imaging characteristics. An observational policy with periodic radiological and biochemical reassessment is pursued in patients with non-functioning incidentalomas with low malignancy risk. The duration and frequency of reassessment remains unclear, as the natural history of adrenal incidentalomas has yet to be clearly defined, and there is a lack of controlled studies comparing surgical intervention with observation. However, the possibility of acquiring autonomous hypersecretion or conversion to malignancy in an incidentaloma diagnosed to be a benign non-functioning lesion is very low, and most patients may be safely discharged after an initial follow-up period of 2 years.

### Management of incidental adrenal masses: a white paper of the ACR incidental findings committee [^0f69a69c]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The ACR Incidental Findings Committee presents recommendations for managing adrenal masses that are incidentally detected on CT or MRI. These recommendations represent an update to the adrenal component of the JACR 2010 white paper on managing incidental findings in the adrenal glands, kidneys, liver, and pancreas. The Adrenal Subcommittee, constituted by abdominal radiologists and an endocrine surgeon, developed this algorithm. The algorithm draws from published evidence coupled with expert subspecialist opinion and was finalized by a process of iterative consensus. Algorithm branches categorize incidental adrenal masses on the basis of patient characteristics and imaging features. For each specified combination, the algorithm concludes with characterization of benignity or indolence (sufficient to discontinue follow-up) and/or a subsequent management recommendation. The algorithm addresses many, but not all, possible pathologies and clinical scenarios. Our goal is to improve the quality of patient care by providing guidance on how to manage incidentally detected adrenal masses.

### Adrenal incidentaloma [^150bcf2b]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

An adrenal incidentaloma is now established as a common endocrine diagnosis that requires a multidisciplinary approach for effective management. The majority of patients can be reassured and discharged, but a personalized approach based upon image analysis, endocrine workup, and clinical symptoms and signs are required in every case. Adrenocortical carcinoma remains a real concern but is restricted to < 2% of all cases. Functional adrenal incidentaloma lesions are commoner (but still probably < 10% of total) and the greatest challenge remains the diagnosis and optimum management of autonomous cortisol secretion. Modern-day surgery has improved outcomes and novel radiological and urinary biomarkers will improve early detection and patient stratification in future years to come.

### Adrenal incidentalomas – a continuing management dilemma [^925dfeb5]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Adrenal incidentalomas (AI), adrenal tumors detected through an imaging procedure done for reasons unrelated to adrenal dysfunction, is becoming a common clinical problem with the more frequent utilization of different imaging techniques. Most such tumors are benign and hormonally inactive. A variety of diagnostic strategies have been developed to distinguish the latter; however, they are still controversial. Even after a commissioned systematic review of the literature and a state of the science conference sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, the optimal strategy for hormonal screening of a patient with AI is unknown, but we anticipate further refinements and major advances in the field. Surgery is the ultimate solution for the diagnostic-therapeutic dilemma of AI. Careful planning is required, and the learning curve which influences clinical decision making is especially relevant to immediate outcomes. The benefit of making a diagnosis of a clinically significant AI must be considered in the context of the patient's overall condition and preferences.

### Management of the clinically inapparent adrenal mass ("incidentaloma") [^9112d9ca]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Program convened surgeons, endocrinologists, pathologists, biostatisticians, radiologists, oncologists, and other health care professionals, as well as members of the general public, to address the causes, prevalence, and natural history of clinically inapparent adrenal masses, or "incidentalomas"; the appropriate evaluation and treatment of such masses; and directions for future research. Improvements in abdominal imaging techniques have increased detection of adrenal incidentalomas, and because the prevalence of these masses increases with age, appropriate management of adrenal tumors will be a growing challenge in our aging society. To address six predetermined questions, the 12-member nonfederal, nonadvocate state-of-the-science panel heard presentations from 21 experts in adrenal incidentalomas and consulted a systematic review of medical literature on the topic provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and an extensive bibliography developed by the National Library of Medicine. The panel recommended a 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test and measurement of plasma-free metanephrines for all patients with an adrenal incidentaloma; additional measurement of serum potassium and plasma aldosterone concentration-plasma renin activity ratio for patients with hypertension; and surgery for patients with biochemical evidence of pheochromocytoma, patients with tumors greater than 6 cm, and patients with tumors greater than 4 cm who also meet other criteria. The panel also advocated a multidisciplinary approach to managing adrenal incidentalomas. The statement is an independent report of the panel and is not a policy statement of the National Institutes of Health or the federal government.

### Evaluation of an adrenal incidentaloma [^f44eb02d]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Given the frequent use of cross-sectional imaging in medicine, adrenal masses are discovered at an increasing rate. Once detected, it is critical to ensure the patient undergoes the appropriate biochemical/hormonal workup to rule out any aberrant activity and ensure imaging features do not raise suspicion for a malignant neoplasm. Patients with hormonal overactivity, concerning size, and/or imaging characteristics must be referred for surgical consideration. For those not requiring adrenalectomy, it is important to determine which patients mandate follow-up to ensure no further growth or development of hormonal production. It is also critical to understand what is the appropriate follow-up.

Surgical Management of Adrenal Incidentaloma

Indications for unilateral adrenalectomy

The principle threat of a unilateral adrenal lesion, with indeterminate imaging characteristics, is an ACC. For ACC without metastases, surgery is the most important single therapeutic measure. Guidelines recommend that surgery for patients with ACC should be limited to referral centers and performed by surgeons with expertise in adrenal surgery (open and laparoscopic) and with a volume of more than 15 adrenalectomies per year (benign and malignant).

Patients with a functional unilateral adenoma, with clinically significant hormone excess, are offered unilateral adrenalectomy. Patients with a unilateral adrenal adenoma and ACS, are considered for surgery on an individual basis and after MDT discussion. Surgery is taken into consideration along with the patient's age, degree of cortisol excess, general health, comorbidities, and patient preference. In all patients, considered for surgery, ACTH-independent cortisol excess should be confirmed.

There is no absolute size for the recommendation of surgery in nonfunctioning adenomas. Due to the paucity of follow-up data on the natural history of large suspected benign AIs, and the realization that the larger the mass, the higher the incidence of malignancy, surgery may be considered in larger lesions (> 4 cm) even if imaging characteristics suggest a benign lesion. Any indeterminate nodule on imaging greater than 4 cm should be offered surgery.

Occasionally myelolipomas and adrenal cysts are removed if they get to a significant size and cause compressive symptoms. Adrenal metastases are resected if appropriate in the context of the underlying pathology. In general, patients are deemed suitable if the underlying extra-adrenal malignancy is controlled, the metastasis is isolated to the adrenal gland and the patient has an adequate performance status to justify aggressive treatment.

### American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for adrenalectomy: executive summary [^c4ac1828]. JAMA Surgery (2022). High credibility.

American Association of Endocrine Surgeons Guidelines for Adrenalectomy — scope, evaluation, and follow-up for adrenal tumors are highlighted: The guidelines "represent a series of 26 carefully composed recommendations" and the update "focuses on 7 areas of clinical concern to the practicing adrenal surgeon". For incidentally identified adrenal nodules, the commentary underscores "a comprehensive biochemical evaluation of patients with incidentally identified adrenal nodules more than 1 cm on cross-sectional imaging (recommendations 1.1–1.3)" and describes "referral to a multidisciplinary clinic (staffed by endocrinology and adrenal surgeons)". It states, "We encourage adrenal surgeons to lead the implementation of similar processes and the multidisciplinary discussion of patients with adrenal tumors including those being considered for unconventional treatments (recommendation 7.4)". Regarding follow-up in patients with "nonfunctional adrenal tumors with benign imaging characteristics", it notes that "Multidisciplinary care is particularly important in determining the appropriate follow-up" and that "the authors do not recommend routine scheduled follow-up in these patients (recommendation 1.4)", with the "level of evidence is "low quality".

### Approach to the patient with adrenal incidentaloma [^e47dec2b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Adrenal tumors are commonly discovered incidentally on cross-sectional abdominal imaging performed for reasons other than adrenal mass. Incidence of adrenal tumors increased 10-fold in the past 2 decades, with most diagnosed in older adults. In any patient with a newly discovered adrenal mass, determining whether the adrenal mass is malignant and whether it is hormonally active is equally important to guide the best management. Malignancy is diagnosed in 5% to 8% of patients with adrenal tumors, with a higher risk in young patients, if history of extra-adrenal malignancy, in those with large adrenal tumors with indeterminate imaging characteristics, and in bilateral adrenal tumors. Although overt hormone excess is uncommon in adrenal incidentalomas, mild autonomous cortisol secretion can be diagnosed in up to 30% to 50% of patients. Because autonomous cortisol secretion is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and metabolic abnormalities, all patients with adrenal incidentalomas require work up with dexamethasone suppression test. Management of adrenal tumors varies based on etiology, associated comorbidities, and patient's preference. This article reviews the current evidence on the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with adrenal mass and focuses on management of the most common etiologies of adrenal incidentalomas.

### Adrenal lesions found incidentally: how to improve clinical and cost-effectiveness [^7da774ff]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Background

The significant variability in the approach to treating patients with adrenal incidentalomas stems from the fact that there were no UK NHS-compatible guidelines for managing the condition. Guidance has limited utility, as highlighted in a NHS report confirming that adrenal incidentalomas are a common clinical dilemma and the majority of affected patients are inappropriately investigated.

A recent literature review (using search terms including 'adrenal incidentaloma management' and 'adrenal incidentaloma guidance') indicated that US/European guidelines have been largely based on retrospective, limited and often conflicting data relating to thresholds and timelines for planning investigations.NHS management plans are not driven by insurers or fee-for-service payments (unlike US/European-based systems), limiting the relevance of these guidelines to the UK.

A study from a UK district general hospital identified 75 patients with adrenal incidentalomas in 2010. The majority (80%) received no biochemical investigation or follow-up, with only 13 (17%) referred for specialist review and two further patients undergoing additional evaluation in primary care. A further UK study, focusing on biochemical investigations, accepted that, for patients with adrenal incidentaloma, ' Their best management strategy is unknown'. The medical literature emphasises international acknowledgement that these tumours pose a management dilemma, but there is no NHS-compatible system to ensure appropriate management.

Management and Surveillance

With the increasing incidence of adrenal incidentaloma diagnosis, the cohort of patients with known adrenal nodules continues to expand. For the subset of patients with hormone secretion or suspicion for malignancy, management is typically surgical resection. For patients with non-functional adenomas or indeterminate diagnoses, appropriate surveillance and timing of repeat biochemical testing remain controversial.

Multiple studies have found that while the rate of malignant transformation of a non-functional tumor is rare, previously non-functional tumors can become functional, The Korean Endocrine Society practice guidelines recommended annual hormone studies for 4–5 years to assess for functionality; however, the ESE guidelines recommend against repeat hormonal testing in patients with a non-functional tumor at initial evaluation in the absence of new clinical signs of hormone excess. It is recommended that comorbidities potentially attributable to cortisol excess be reassessed annually. While diagnoses of pheochromocytoma, aldosteronoma, and overt Cushing's are clear indications for surgery, recommendations around MACS are more nuanced. Ample data support the detrimental physiologic effects of hypercortisolism. Some studies suggest a linear association between cortisol secretion and mortality. A large, international, retrospective cohort study demonstrated significantly increased cardiometabolic comorbidities and all-cause mortality in patients with adrenal incidentalomas with autonomous cortisol secretion. However, a large meta-analysis of 32 studies found that while there is an increase in metabolic comorbidities and cardiovascular events in patients with MACS compared with non-functional tumors, there was no significant difference in mortality. Within the restrictions of these data, current guidelines suggest that patients with MACS secondary to a unilateral adenoma and comorbid conditions associated with hypercortisolism undergo adrenalectomy because of anticipated significant improvements in cardiometabolic health.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® adrenal mass evaluation: 2021 update [^bd9f3315]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The appropriate evaluation of adrenal masses is strongly dependent on the clinical circumstances in which it is discovered. Adrenal incidentalomas are masses that are discovered on imaging studies that have been obtained for purposes other than adrenal disease. Although the vast majority of adrenal incidentalomas are benign, further radiological and biochemical evaluation of these lesions is important to arrive at a specific diagnosis. Patients with a history of malignancy or symptoms of excess hormone require different imaging evaluations than patients with incidentalomas. This document reviews imaging approaches to adrenal masses and the various modalities utilized in evaluation of adrenal lesions. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### The clinically inapparent adrenal mass: update in diagnosis and management [^ad5b5861]. Endocrine Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Clinically inapparent adrenal masses are incidentally detected after imaging studies conducted for reasons other than the evaluation of the adrenal glands. They have frequently been referred to as adrenal incidentalomas. In preparation for a National Institutes of Health State-of-the-Science Conference on this topic, extensive literature research, including Medline, BIOSIS, and Embase between 1966 and July 2002, as well as references of published metaanalyses and selected review articles identified more than 5400 citations. Based on 699 articles that were retrieved for further examination, we provide a comprehensive update of the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches focusing on endocrine and radiological features as well as surgical options. In addition, we present recent developments in the discovery of tumor markers, endocrine testing for subclinical disease including autonomous glucocorticoid hypersecretion and silent pheochromocytoma, novel imaging techniques, and minimally invasive surgery. Based on the statements of the conference, the available literature, and ongoing studies, our aim is to provide practical recommendations for the management of this common entity and to highlight areas for future studies and research.

### Imaging of adrenal masses [^c36ee984]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Adrenal lesions are common and require appropriate management when clinically relevant. The approach to the evaluation of an adrenal lesion is to exclude malignancy and hormone excess as these are associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

Methods

Imaging of adrenal lesions primarily aims to identify features indicating benignity. Noncontrast computed tomography is recommended as first-line imaging for adrenal lesions. Indeterminate lesions that require further characterization may proceed to adrenal protocol computed tomography (with contrast) or magnetic resonance imaging, with a trend in recent years towards increasing use of magnetic resonance imaging. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography may also be used to assess adrenal lesions in certain clinical scenarios.

Results

Clinical guidelines recommend that all adrenal incidentalomas require further dedicated imaging unless they are clearly benign on imaging. The imaging strategy of adrenal lesions depends upon a number of factors including patient history, nature of detection, imaging characteristics (size, heterogeneity, presence of intracellular lipid), and the presence or absence of hormone excess. Special considerations are given to pregnant patients, young patients < 40 years, and those with a history of an extra-adrenal malignancy.

Conclusion

This review outlines the role of imaging for adrenal lesions, describes the various imaging options and investigation strategies, and highlights relevant imaging findings.

### American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for adrenalectomy: executive summary [^1b9ff8ce]. JAMA Surgery (2022). High credibility.

American Association of Endocrine Surgeons — adrenal incidentaloma evaluation and surveillance are specified with strong recommendations and growth-based management guidance: We recommend that all patients with an adrenal incidentaloma 1 cm or larger undergo biochemical testing for autonomous cortisol secretion; patients with hypokalemia or hypertension also require biochemical evaluation for primary aldosteronism, and patients with adrenal imaging findings that have noncontrast CT with HU greater than 10 should undergo evaluation for pheochromocytoma (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.). We recommend that a primary adrenal malignancy be considered in patients with an adrenal incidentaloma larger 4 cm and/or HU greater than 20 on noncontrast CT and in any patient younger than 18 years, and we recommend that patients with a history of extra-adrenal malignancy be recognized to be at increased risk for adrenal metastases (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.). Most nonfunctional adrenal nodules with benign imaging characteristics remain stable in size, but up to 10% of adrenal incidentalomas will grow 1 cm or more over 2 to 5 years of surveillance; surgical resection may be considered for nodules that are larger than 2 cm at initial presentation and grow more than 1 cm by 12 months, while smaller nodules or those with less growth may undergo repeated short-interval imaging at 6 to 12 months. The risk context provided notes 3% in patients without a history of malignancy and up to 8% in patients with a history of extra-adrenal malignancy.

### Cardio-metabolic pathophysiology in mild glucocorticoid excess: potential implications for management of adrenal incidentaloma [^abb82fa3]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

Adrenal adenomas are incidentally identified in up to 5% of computer tomography scans performed for unrelated indications. A proportion of these adrenal incidentalomas are found to autonomously secrete cortisol based on definitions in current guidelines. Epidemiological studies suggest that chronic exposure to mild glucocorticoid excess from adrenal incidentalomas is associated with significantly increased cardiometabolic risk. However, current management guidelines adopt a conservative approach as no large prospective randomized studies have demonstrated that these patients benefit from surgery. This narrative review examines the epidemiological and mechanistic studies related to three common clinical settings of mild glucocorticoid excess to gain further insight into the potential benefits of treating patients with adrenal incidentaloma and possible autonomous cortisol secretion.

### The landmark series: evaluation and management of adrenal incidentalomas [^932a67b7]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology

Adrenal incidentalomas can be considered both a modern and an iatrogenic diagnosis, and are defined as adrenal masses ≥ 1 cm discovered on imaging obtained to evaluate unrelated clinical conditions. The prevalence of incidental adrenal masses varies by data source, patient selection, and diagnostic method, but ranges from 1 to 5% on computed tomography (CT) scans. – In autopsy studies, the prevalence of adrenal incidentalomas ranges from 1 to 8.7%, and increases with age. Less than 1% of adrenal tumors are seen in people under 18 years of age, while the prevalence increases to more than 10% in the elderly, with peak increase between 50–60 years of age. These prevalence estimates may reflect some selection bias. In a large, unselected population undergoing annual check-ups in China, the overall prevalence was 1.4%, ranging from 0.2% in subjects 18–25 years of age, to 3.2% in those older than 65 years of age. The prevalence of adrenal incidentalomas does not vary by sex.

With the increased availability and use of diagnostic cross-sectional imaging, there has been a corresponding increase in incidental findings, including adrenal nodules. This increase is partially attributable to the more frequent discovery of small adrenal masses in older adults. One retrospective, population-based cohort study in Olmsted County, MN, USA, from 1995 to 2017 found a tenfold increase in the standardized incidence over the study period. This increase was primarily driven by the incidental discovery of adenomas < 4 cm in size in patients ≥ 40 years of age. These data are of particular relevance given global trends toward population aging, which would suggest that both the occurrence and the identification of adrenal incidentalomas will continue to rise in the coming decades. It is therefore of paramount importance to accurately identify nodules that present a risk to patient health, both to ensure appropriate management and to minimize overtreatment.

### Incidental adrenal nodules [^ef69ae16]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Incidentally detected adrenal nodules are common, and prevalence increases with patient age. Although most are benign, it is important for the radiologist to be able to accurately determine which nodules require further testing and which are safely left alone. The American College of Radiology incidental adrenal White Paper provides a structured algorithm based on expert consensus for management of incidental adrenal nodules. If further diagnostic testing is indicated, adrenal computed tomography is the most appropriate test in patients for nodules less than 4 cm. In addition to imaging, biochemical testing and endocrinology referral is warranted to exclude a functioning mass.

### The landmark series: evaluation and management of adrenal incidentalomas [^a37dab76]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Adrenal incidentalomas are adrenal masses ≥ 1 cm discovered on imaging studies for unrelated clinical conditions. The prevalence of adrenal incidentalomas has increased as a byproduct of the widespread use of cross-sectional imaging, particularly in older adults. The clinical significance of adrenal incidentalomas varies based on tumor size, hormonal activity, and imaging characteristics. While most adrenal incidentalomas are benign and asymptomatic, a significant minority are hormonally active or malignant, necessitating careful evaluation and management. Adrenal hormone secretion can have significant clinical implications. Biochemical testing is crucial to assess for hormone excess, including steroid hormones (mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens), which are made in the adrenal cortex, as well as catecholamines, which are made in the adrenal medulla. Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) is the preferred modality for evaluating adrenal nodules as it allows for assessment of tissue density in Hounsfield units (HU). Benign lesions typically have an homogeneous appearance with HU ≤ 10. Contrast-enhanced CT with delayed washout can help differentiate benign tumors from malignant tumors. Tumors ≥ 4 cm, or those with indeterminate features may require further imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT. The management of adrenal incidentalomas is determined by hormonal secretion and imaging characteristics. Surgical resection is recommended for functional tumors and those that are suspicious for malignancy, including tumors ≥ 4 cm in size and those with rapid growth. Non-functional tumors < 4 cm may undergo imaging surveillance. The goal of this review is to summarize the contemporary literature and guidelines on adrenal incidentalomas, and to describe the key principles regarding evaluation and management.

### Diagnostic dilemmas: a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of adrenal incidentaloma pathology based on radiographic size [^05de70d5]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The malignant potential of a small, incidentally found lesion of the adrenal gland causes great anxiety amongst patients, but rarely causes harm. An adrenal incidentaloma (AI) is defined as mass measuring greater than 1 cm on the adrenal gland found fortuitously during radiographic imaging. The diameter of the average AI measures approximately 3–3.5 cm on Computed Tomography (CT) scan. With increased utilization and advancements in the sensitivity of medical imaging, adrenal masses are observed in as many as 4.4% of all patients undergoing CT scan.

Over the past two decades, an increasing body of evidence has supported restructuring the current guidelines for the management of AIs. Most AIs result in the histological diagnosis of benign adrenal cortical adenoma. Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is more commonly diagnosed at younger ages than benign adrenal masses and is found more often in males than females. For patients without a history of malignancy, the estimated prevalence of ACC is less than 2 cases per million adrenal lesions identified. Twenty-five percent of benign masses increase in size during follow up; however, given the estimated 1 in 1000 risk of malignant transformation over time for benign masses, continued observation may be an appropriate option. Exposing patients to additional risks with surgery for a rare chance of cancer in smaller adrenal masses may not be warranted.

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and American Association of Endocrine Surgeons (AAES) guidelines have changed over the last decade in regards to excision based on size from a previous cutoff of ≥ 6 cm to now only > 4 cm. Current clinical guidelines recommend a workup to include contrasted cross-sectional imaging and a functional evaluation to investigate for hormonal activity. Surgical excision is then recommended if the lesion is radiographically suspicious, > 4 cm in size, or hormonally active. Due to the rarity of ACC, most of these recommendations are based on information obtained from controlled trials without randomization (Level 3 Evidence).

Because there have been few randomized controlled studies regarding the management of AIs, there is a lack of qualified management guidelines for patient care. To address this clinical question, we sought to perform a collaborative effort reviewing ten years of adrenalectomy data comparing pathologic outcomes based on size criteria. It was hypothesized that our data would further support a needed modification in the current guidelines for removal of AIs.

### Clinical review: the approach to the evaluation and management of bilateral adrenal masses [^f1b73f71]. Endocrine Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This white paper provides practical guidance for clinicians encountering bilateral adrenal masses.

Methods

A case-based approach to the evaluation and management of bilateral adrenal masses. Specific clinical scenarios presented here include cases of bilateral adrenal adenomas, hemorrhage, pheochromocytomas, metastatic disease, myelolipomas, as well as primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia.

Results

Bilateral adrenal masses represent approximately 10% to 20% of incidentally discovered adrenal masses. The general approach to the evaluation and management of bilateral adrenal masses follows the same protocol as the evaluation of unilateral adrenal masses, determined based on the patient's clinical history and examination as well as the imaging characteristics of each lesion, whether the lesions could represent a malignancy, demonstrate hormone excess, or possibly represent a familial syndrome. Furthermore, there are features unique to bilateral adrenal masses that must be considered, including the differential diagnosis, the evaluation, and the management depending on the etiology. Therefore, considerations for the optimal imaging modality, treatment (medical vs surgical therapy), and surveillance are included. These recommendations were developed through careful examination of existing published studies as well as expert clinical opinion consensus.

Conclusion

The evaluation and management of bilateral adrenal masses require a comprehensive systematic approach which includes the assessment and interpretation of the patient's clinical history, physical examination, dynamic hormone evaluation, and imaging modalities to determine the key radiographic features of each adrenal nodule. In addition, familial syndromes should be considered. Any final treatment options and approaches should always be considered individually.

### Adrenal incidentaloma [^84550fa2]. World Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Because of the frequent use of computed tomography and other abdominal imaging modalities, clinicians more frequently see the incidentally discovered, clinically silent adrenal mass. Most adrenal incidentalomas should be evaluated for hormonal activity and assessed for their risk of malignancy. Adrenalectomy is indicated for hyperfunctioning tumors and for any potential primary malignant adrenal lesion. Nonfunctioning cortical adenomas < 4 to 5 cm in size should be followed clinically and radiographically. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy has been used increasingly as the preferred approach in patients who require surgical resection whereas open adrenalectomy is reserved for patients with large, malignant tumors. The indications for adrenalectomy in patients with nonfunctioning adrenal tumors should not be liberalized because of the laparoscopic approach.

### Adrenal incidentaloma [^8f78c46c]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

An AI is now established as a common endocrine diagnosis that requires a multidisciplinary approach for effective management. The majority of patients can be reassured and discharged, but a personalized approach based upon image analysis, endocrine workup, and clinical symptoms and signs is required in every case. ACC remains a real concern but is restricted to < 2% of all cases. Functional AI lesions are commoner (but still probably < 10% of total) and the greatest challenge remains the diagnosis and optimum management of ACS. Modern-day surgery has improved outcomes and novel radiological and urinary biomarkers will improve early detection and patient stratification in future years to come.

### An evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach to the clinical considerations, management, and surveillance of adrenal lesions in familial adenomatous polyposis: report of three cases [^bf0131c1]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2006). Low credibility.

Adrenal masses are commonly discovered incidentally in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, and adrenal malignancies have been rarely reported. Individuals with familial adenomatous polyposis frequently undergo abdominal CT-scan examinations for surveillance or symptoms. Adrenal lesions often are detected unexpectedly and are thus becoming a common clinical problem in this population. Adrenal lesions encompass a heterogeneous spectrum of pathologic entities, including primary adrenocortical and medullary tumors, benign or malignant lesions, hormonally active or inactive lesions, metastases, and infections. When an adrenal mass is detected, the clinician needs to address two crucial questions: 1) is the mass malignant? and 2) is it hormonally active? This article presents three new cases of incidental adrenal lesions in familial adenomatous polyposis, reviews the medical literature for this setting, and provides an overview of the diagnostic clinical approach and management of the adrenal findings in familial adenomatous polyposis patients.

### Mild autonomous cortisol secretion: pathophysiology, comorbidities and management approaches [^25d661b9]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

The majority of incidentally discovered adrenal tumours are benign adrenocortical adenomas and the prevalence of adrenocortical adenomas is around 1–7% on cross-sectional abdominal imaging. These can be non-functioning adrenal tumours or they can be associated with autonomous cortisol secretion on a spectrum that ranges from rare clinically overt adrenal Cushing syndrome to the much more prevalent mild autonomous cortisol secretion (MACS) without signs of Cushing syndrome. MACS is diagnosed (based on an abnormal overnight dexamethasone suppression test) in 20–50% of patients with adrenal adenomas. MACS is associated with cardiovascular morbidity, frailty, fragility fractures, decreased quality of life and increased mortality. Management of MACS should be individualized based on patient characteristics and includes adrenalectomy or conservative follow-up with treatment of associated comorbidities. Identifying patients with MACS who are most likely to benefit from adrenalectomy is challenging, as adrenalectomy results in improvement of cardiovascular morbidity in some, but not all, patients with MACS. Of note, diagnosis and management of patients with bilateral MACS is especially challenging. Current gaps in MACS clinical practice include a lack of specific biomarkers diagnostic of MACS-related health outcomes and a paucity of clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of adrenalectomy on comorbidities associated with MACS. In addition, little evidence exists to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of long-term medical therapy in patients with MACS.

### Adrenal lesions found incidentally: how to improve clinical and cost-effectiveness [^a0960267]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

In summary, these studies highlight the lack of consensus regarding adrenal incidentaloma management. There is a risk of missing serious conditions that could be life threatening (including phaeochromocytoma and excess cortisol production) and that require rapid intervention. Many patients who ultimately do not require further follow-up need appropriate and timely investigation and effective communication to avoid unnecessary distress.

Our proposal, therefore, aimed to combine the new NHS-compatible European adrenal incidentaloma guidelines with information technology (IT) infrastructure and NHS-based referral processes to establish the first streamlined, clinically effective, patient-centred electronic Adrenal Incidentaloma Management System (eAIMS). This is highly innovative because it is

Evidence-based: eAIMS uses newly developed guidelines appropriate for integration into NHS processes (acknowledging the magnitude of the problem, referral processes and patient safety).
Multidisciplinary: Involving all key stakeholders (patients, commissioners, radiologists, clinical biochemists, hospital IT and Service Transformation experts as well as acute hospital physicians) in the design and evaluation from the outset.
Patient-orientated: Engaging patients in designing eAIMS (eg, steps followed in investigating and communicating results) and development of information leaflets. Patients will also help in evaluation via a survey of impact on anxiety.
Embedded: By involving IT experts and Service Transformation teams, this System will be embedded into routine clinical pathways for adrenal incidentaloma management.
Efficient: Exploiting IT to establish an integrated management system to facilitate interaction between the different steps and specialists in the pathway, ensuring timely investigations, multidisciplinary team interpretations, and communication with patients and general practitioners.
Cost-effective: Eliminating unnecessary investigations, outpatient visits and interventions(independently evaluated by University of East Anglia).
Generalisable: By selecting two sites with differing demographic populations and approaches to adrenal incidentaloma management, the potential for roll-out across the wider NHS is more assessable.
Addressing an unmet need: There is currently no system to address this gap in proactively managing patients with adrenal incidentalomas.

### Approach to the patient with bilateral adrenal masses [^83f08c8d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Bilateral adrenal masses, increasingly encountered in clinical practice, manifest across diverse contexts, including incidental discovery, malignancy staging, and targeted imaging after hormonal diagnosis of adrenal disorders. The spectrum encompasses various pathologies, such as cortical adenomas, macronodular adrenal disease, pheochromocytomas, myelolipomas, infiltrative disorders, and primary and secondary malignancies. Notably, not all masses in both adrenal glands necessarily share the same etiology, often exhibiting diverse causes. Recently, the European Society of Endocrinology and the European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors updated guidelines, introduced a 4-option schema based on imaging, aiding in targeted hormonal testing and management. This "Approach to the Patient" review delves into the latest advancements in imaging, biochemical, and genetic approaches for the diagnostic and management nuances of bilateral adrenal masses. It provides insights and a contemporary framework for navigating the complexities associated with this clinical entity.

Summarised recommendations for adrenal incidentaloma management

Based on the presented evidence, and with acknowledgement of areas requiring further research, the following AI management principles are provided:

Definition of adrenal incidentalomas

A robust definition of an AI inherently delineates a population with an extremely low prevalence of malignancy. To reiterate, we define AIs as ≥ 1 cm lesions in patients without current or prior extra-adrenal malignancy, or clinically suspected adrenal disease. AIs with overtly benign imaging features, such as myelolipomas or cysts, or those with long-term stability (for now, defined as 6–12 months) do not require further evaluation.

Recommendation for hormonal correlation

Radiology reports should include a recommendation to perform a hormonal evaluation for all remaining AIs, which will identify nearly all PCC, as well as most ACC. Additionally, endocrine correlation identifies subclinically functional adenomas (including MACS), where clinical management may take precedence. Recommending additional endocrinologist referral may depend on local preferences, as in some regions, to manage cost and access issues, endocrine testing can be performed by primary care physicians, with endocrinologist referral limited to those with abnormal results.

Elimination of adrenal washout CT

In the defined AI population, and with application of endocrine assessment, current evidence indicates no role for AWCT.

Categorisation on noncontrast CT

On ncCT (Fig. 1), homogeneous AIs ≤ 20 HU and ≤ 4 cm, or as per existing guidelines, < 10 HU and any size, are considered benign (Category-1), with no imaging follow-up required. AIs which are > 20 HU and 1–4 cm, OR 10–20 HU but > 4 cm, are highly likely benign (Category-2), and therefore 6–12 month ncCT is currently suggested as supported by most AI guidelines, purely to identify growth or stability.

Fig. 1
Management of adrenal incidentalomas on noncontrast CT a. a Table only to be used in conjunction with summarised recommendations. HU, Hounsfield unit

Those > 20 HU AND > 4 cm are considered higher risk (Category-3), with multidisciplinary meeting or surgical referral recommended, albeit acknowledging that most will still be of benign aetiology. As discussed prior, a more cautious approach is advised if AIs are > 40 HU and/or > 6 cm.

Consider performing immediate surgery as the management of choice in most cases and obtaining additional imaging as an option in some patients. Consider obtaining complete staging (including at least chest CT and/or FDG-PET/CT) before surgery. Obtain follow-up imaging in 6–12 months if surgery is not performed.

### Endocrine incidentalomas – challenges imposed by incidentally discovered lesions [^bd190223]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

Endocrine glands are among the organs that most frequently harbor incidentally discovered lesions. Pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid and adrenal incidentalomas are increasingly encountered in everyday practice with variable clinical implications. The major concerns are the risks of malignancy and hormonal hypersecretion mostly in the form of subclinically functioning tumors. Pituitary incidentalomas are usually microadenomas and most of the time clinically unimportant; however, incidentally discovered larger lesions require a more careful diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Thyroid incidentalomas are extremely common; exclusion of malignancy is the main concern in this clinical setting. Although parathyroid adenomas are not uncommon, these lesions are frequently missed owing to their small size and due to clinical unawareness. Adrenal incidentalomas carry a small but finite risk of malignancy. An intriguing challenge regarding incidentally discovered adrenal lesions is that a substantial proportion is associated with hormonal alterations, mainly in the form of subtle cortisol excess. Although still largely controversial, evidence is emerging that so-called subclinical hypercortisolism may not be completely harmless. The best biochemical criterion of subtle cortisol excess remains elusive. Surgical intervention in selected cases results in some beneficial effects, but more data are required in order to routinely support surgery in this clinical setting. This Review provides a brief overview of the prevalence, clinical effect and management of endocrine incidentalomas with a focus on data regarding the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges imposed by incidentally discovered adrenal lesions.

Importance

Adrenalectomy is the definitive treatment for multiple adrenal abnormalities. Advances in technology and genomics and an improved understanding of adrenal pathophysiology have altered operative techniques and indications.

Objective

To develop evidence-based recommendations to enhance the appropriate, safe, and effective approaches to adrenalectomy.

Evidence Review

A multidisciplinary panel identified and investigated 7 categories of relevant clinical concern to practicing surgeons. Questions were structured in the framework Population, Intervention/Exposure, Comparison, and Outcome, and a guided review of medical literature from PubMed and/or Embase from 1980 to 2021 was performed. Recommendations were developed using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology and were discussed until consensus, and patient advocacy representation was included.

Findings

Patients with an adrenal incidentaloma 1 cm or larger should undergo biochemical testing and further imaging characterization. Adrenal protocol computed tomography (CT) should be used to stratify malignancy risk and concern for pheochromocytoma. Routine scheduled follow-up of a nonfunctional adrenal nodule with benign imaging characteristics and unenhanced CT with Hounsfield units less than 10 is not suggested. When unilateral disease is present, laparoscopic adrenalectomy is recommended for patients with primary aldosteronism or autonomous cortisol secretion. Patients with clinical and radiographic findings consistent with adrenocortical carcinoma should be treated at high-volume multidisciplinary centers to optimize outcomes, including, when possible, a complete R0 resection without tumor disruption, which may require en bloc radical resection. Selective or nonselective α blockade can be used to safely prepare patients for surgical resection of paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma. Empirical perioperative glucocorticoid replacement therapy is indicated for patients with overt Cushing syndrome, but for patients with mild autonomous cortisol secretion, postoperative day 1 morning cortisol or cosyntropin stimulation testing can be used to determine the need for glucocorticoid replacement therapy. When patient and tumor variables are appropriate, we recommend minimally invasive adrenalectomy over open adrenalectomy because of improved perioperative morbidity. Minimally invasive adrenalectomy can be achieved either via a retroperitoneal or transperitoneal approach depending on surgeon expertise, as well as tumor and patient characteristics.

Conclusions and Relevance

Twenty-six clinically relevant and evidence-based recommendations are provided to assist surgeons with perioperative adrenal care.

### Evaluation of the adrenal mass in urologic practice [^6f3b7da7]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Adrenal masses are commonly encountered as incidental findings in urologic practice. Many of these lesions do not undergo appropriate testing, likely because guidelines have historically been complex and contradictory. However, the workup for the vast majority of these lesions is actually straightforward. Here we present a practical, guidelines-based approach to the workup of adrenal lesions. We focus on distinguishing between benign, nonhormonally active adenomas (which require no further imaging or intervention) from those which are concerning for malignancy or are hormonally active.

Future Directions

While adrenal incidentalomas are both common and increasing in incidence, there remains a significant gap in understanding and management. Notably, rates of completion of appropriate testing and imaging are low. A systematic review examining adherence to guidelines found that median rates of imaging (34%) and biochemical evaluation (18%) were unacceptably low. In this study, the factor most consistently associated with improved follow-up was the radiologist's recommendation, highlighting the significance of radiology reporting and suggesting a potential opportunity for improvement.

Several recent studies have tried to improve identification and management of adrenal incidentalomas by leveraging quality improvement initiatives and the electronic health record (EHR). Studies have targeted different steps to improve follow-up from standardizing radiology reports to engaging primary care providers to EHR-based strategies. Use of a standardized radiology template to report adrenal incidentalomas successfully improved rates of primary care provider (PCP) follow-up, biochemical testing, follow-up imaging, and appropriate specialist referrals in one center. Direct engagement with PCPs as well as the implementation of multidisciplinary adrenal clinics including endocrinologists and surgeons also represent promising targets for improving follow-up. One novel approach utilizing a natural language processing algorithm to detect clinically significant adrenal nodules increased biochemical evaluation sevenfold and adrenal-specific imaging threefold in participating patients. Orthogonal studies in primary aldosteronism utilizing EHR-based tools to automatically identify patients, and active choice nudges to guide provider ordering, resulted in a significantly higher proportion of patients being appropriately screened.

These novel approaches suggest that there are opportunities to leverage systems-based health care informatics to improve guideline-concordant care for adrenal incidentalomas at multiple levels. Optimal strategies would target: (1) identification, using standardized radiologic reporting of adrenal nodules and recommendations for biochemical and imaging evaluation; (2) evaluation, using EHR-embedded guidance to facilitate provider ordering of specific biochemical testing and imaging studies if indicated; (3) interpretation, providing normal ranges to support laboratory value interpretation and diagnosis; and (4) management, facilitating specialist referrals for patients who require further medical or surgical treatment or surveillance, as shown in Fig. 1.

Adrenal incidentalomas have increased due to advanced and more sensitive imaging modalities, their increased utilization, and the aging population. Most adrenal incidentalomas are nonfunctional and benign, but a subset of patients has functional and/or malignant tumors. The evaluation of patients with an adrenal incidentaloma involves addressing 2 clinical questions: (1) Is the tumor functional? (2) Is the tumor malignant? A careful history and physical examination focused on signs and symptoms of adrenal functional tumors, biochemical testing, and imaging features are the cornerstone in the evaluation of patients with an adrenal incidentaloma.

### Contemporary imaging of incidentally discovered adrenal masses [^d080ad26]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2009). Medium credibility.

The incidental discovery of adrenal masses during modern diagnostic imaging is a common occurrence. These masses form part of a long differential diagnostic list; most often, they are benign adrenal adenomas, but their discovery requires a clinical evaluation that is sufficiently broad to exclude clinically silent endocrine disease, metastases to the adrenal gland in patients with suspected or known malignancies, and rare adrenocortical carcinomas. CT, MRI and nuclear medicine approaches have all been used to evaluate incidentally discovered adrenal masses. Each technology provides information that contributes to the noninvasive characterization of the majority of these neoplasms. Understanding of the modalities used to assess an unanticipated adrenal mass allows for more rapid diagnosis and cost avoidance in a condition that has been referred to as a 'disease' of modern imaging technology.

### Radiologic evaluation of incidentally discovered adrenal masses [^a61fff4e]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

The increasing use of cross-sectional imaging has led to an increase in the incidental discovery of adrenal masses (adrenal incidentalomas). Although most of these lesions are benign, they often present a diagnostic dilemma. Before creating a management plan, the physician should determine if the lesion is benign or malignant and if the lesion is functioning or nonfunctioning. Incidentally discovered adrenal masses usually are benign adenomas; however, myelolipomas, cysts, hemorrhage, pheochromocytomas, metastases, and adrenocortical carcinomas are also possible. Unenhanced computed tomography and chemical shift magnetic resonance imaging can characterize most adenomas because the lesions have high lipid content. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography can further characterize the adenomas because of the washout characteristics with iodinated intravenous contrast media. Fluorodeoxyglucose- positron emission tomography can be helpful in characterizing some lesions, and biopsy is rarely required. This article summarizes the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria for the use of imaging modalities and biopsy to characterize incidentally discovered adrenal masses.

Biochemical Evaluation

Adrenal hormone evaluation is crucial for the management of adrenal incidentalomas, as functional tumors typically require surgical resection. Biochemical evaluation should be performed in conjunction with a careful clinical assessment including history and physical examination. A summary of the current screening guidelines can be found in Table 2. – While prior guidelines have recommended routine testing for all adrenal hormones, contemporary guidelines suggest routine testing for autonomous cortisol secretion and catecholamines, and only selective testing for aldosterone and androgens in patients with clinical signs or symptoms. These recommendations are based on the higher likelihood of clinically occult disease in pheochromocytoma and MACS, which makes testing based on clinical findings less reliable. Selective screening does increase the importance of meticulous and expert clinical evaluation.

### The evaluation of incidentally discovered adrenal masses [^03515875]. Endocrine Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this Disease State Clinical Review is to provide clinicians with a practical approach to the evaluation of incidentally discovered adrenal masses.

Methods

A case-based clinical approach to the evaluation of adrenal masses is presented. Recommendations were developed using available prospective and randomized studies, cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, anecdotal observations, and expert opinions.

Results

Incidentally discovered adrenal masses are common. The approach to the patient with an adrenal mass should involve assessment of malignant potential via imaging characteristics and adrenal hormone excess via clinical and biochemical features. The roles of biopsy, surgical or medical therapy, and longitudinal surveillance are also important to consider and are influenced by case-specific factors. Inappropriate or inadequate evaluations may put patients at increased risk for developing preventable adverse cardiometabolic outcomes or cancer.

Conclusion

Incidentally discovered adrenal masses require a multimodal assessment that involves interpretation of multiple imaging characteristics, dynamic and static hormonal measurements, and a nuanced approach to considering interventional diagnostics, treatments, and longitudinal surveillance. Herein, we review these evaluations and provide a practical approach for clinicians.

### Adrenal lesions found incidentally: how to improve clinical and cost-effectiveness [^f111d71a]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Adrenal incidentalomas are lesions that are incidentally identified while scanning for other conditions. While most are benign and hormonally non-functional, around 20% are malignant and/or hormonally active, requiring prompt intervention. Malignant lesions can be aggressive and life-threatening, while hormonally active tumours cause various endocrine disorders, with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite this, management of patients with adrenal incidentalomas is variable, with no robust evidence base. This project aimed to establish more effective and timely management of these patients.

Methods

We developed a web-based, electronic Adrenal Incidentaloma Management System (eAIMS), which incorporated the evidence-based and National Health Service–aligned 2016 European guidelines. The system captures key clinical, biochemical and radiological information necessary for adrenal incidentaloma patient management and generates a pre-populated outcome letter, saving clinical and administrative time while ensuring timely management plans with enhanced safety. Furthermore, we developed a prioritisation strategy, with members of the multidisciplinary team, which prioritised high-risk individuals for detailed discussion and management. Patient focus groups informed process-mapping and multidisciplinary team process re-design and patient information leaflet development. The project was partnered by University Hospital of South Manchester to maximise generalisability.

Results

Implementation of eAIMS, along with improvements in the prioritisation strategy, resulted in a 49% reduction in staff hands-on time, as well as a 78% reduction in the time from adrenal incidentaloma identification to multidisciplinary team decision. A health economic analysis identified a 28% reduction in costs.

Conclusions

The system's in-built data validation and the automatic generation of the multidisciplinary team outcome letter improved patient safety through a reduction in transcription errors. We are currently developing the next stage of the programme to proactively identify all new adrenal incidentaloma cases.

### American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for adrenalectomy: executive summary [^8fde6feb]. JAMA Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Adrenal incidentaloma — nonfunctional nodule surveillance and benign lesion management are specified as follows: We do not recommend routine scheduled follow-up of a nonfunctional adrenal nodule (size < 4 cm) with benign imaging characteristics and noncontrast HU less than 10 because the risk of developing malignancy is very low; nodules from 1 to 4 cm with indeterminate imaging characteristics (such as noncontrast CT with HU > 10) should undergo at least 1 repeated image at 6 to 12 months to confirm stability, and autonomous cortisol secretion may be reevaluated at a 2- to 5-year interval (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence); resection may be considered for indeterminate imaging, symptomatic tumors due to mass effect, substantive growth on surveillance, or those that have hemorrhaged, and we do not suggest resecting a myelolipoma or adrenal cyst with pathognomonic imaging features to improve the patient's quality of life unless there are symptoms of mass effect (Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Diagnostic dilemmas: a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of adrenal incidentaloma pathology based on radiographic size [^fe83511c]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Along with a conservative approach to management comes a need to clarify ongoing surveillance imaging and laboratory evaluation intervals. This is due to a 17%, 29%, 47% risk of AIs converting to functional status and a 6%, 14%, 29% risk of increasing in size at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. Current guidelines vary, with most suggesting follow-up guided by clinical judgment and the presumed cause of the mass based on initial workup. National Institute of Health (NIH) data suggests that for masses that are benign-appearing (< 10 HU; washout > 50%), small (< 3 cm), and completely non-functioning, imaging and biochemical reevaluation at 1–2 years (or more) is appropriate, with subsequent follow-up only if the clinical picture changes; the risk of malignancy or subsequent hyperfunction is almost nonexistent though reported conversion to ACC exists in recent literature. For indeterminate lesions, repeat evaluation for growth after 3–12 months is appropriate. Subsequent testing should occur earlier for lesions with increasing size, and later for those with no change. The AAES extends the criteria for "small" AIs to include those < 4 cm and they better outline surveillance recommendations to include radiographic reevaluation at 3 to 6 months, then annually for 1–2 years. Similarly, they suggest hormonal evaluation annually for up to 5 years. Repeat screening for hyperaldosteronism is not perceived to be beneficial, but most authors recommend screening for catecholamine and cortisol excess for at least four years due to the similar appearance of pheochromocytomas to lipid-poor adenomas on CT scan. This is one instance in which clinical judgment can be used to guide surveillance as most pheochromocytomas grow over time suggesting that further imaging may not be indicated in the setting of a stable mass.

Policy makers

Our results are relevant for policy makers in two ways: to inform new guidelines about the management of organ specific incidentalomas, and to update existing guidelines. We report the outcomes of incidentalomas across 12 different organs (table 2), as well as the meta-analysed prevalence of malignancy (table 4). Guidelines exist in the United States and Europe for the management of incidentalomas for five organs (pituitary, adrenal, ovary, kidney, and thyroid). Guidelines concerning pituitary and adrenal incidentalomas offer recommendations for clinicians requesting imaging, whereas the remaining three guidelines (ovary, renal, and thyroid) target radiologists and their recommendations assume a level of radiological expertise.

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American Association of Endocrine Surgeons 2009 guideline on the management of adrenal incidentalomastargets non-radiologist clinicians and recommends: "Patients with an adrenal incidentaloma should undergo evaluation clinically, biochemically, and radiographically for signs and symptoms of hypercortisolism, aldosteronism (if hypertensive), the presence of a pheochromocytoma, or a malignant tumour". This recommendation appears congruent with our results; our data suggest that around 12% of patients with adrenal incidentalomas will have subclinical Cushing's syndrome (also known as low level autonomous cortisol secretion). However, the same guideline recommends: "Patients with adrenal incidentalomas who do not fulfil the criteria for surgical resection need to have radiographic re-evaluation at 3 to 6 months and then annually for 1 to 2 years". This recommendation is incongruent with our data: we found that less than 1% of adrenal incidentalomas are malignant. The more recent 2016 European Society of Endocrinology recommendationsare more closely aligned with our results, but are also somewhat conservative: "We recommend that all adrenal incidentalomas undergo an imaging procedure to determine if the mass is homogeneous and lipid rich and therefore benign. For this purpose, we primarily recommend the use of non-contrast computed tomography. We suggest that if the non-contrast computed tomography is consistent with a benign adrenal mass (Hounsfield units ≤ 10) that is homogeneous and smaller than 4 cm, no further imaging is required".

Discussion

Continued innovation in imaging modalities has enhanced sensitivity in identifying abnormalities of the adrenal glands. The prevalence of adrenal adenomas in the general population is estimated at 3–7%, with the overwhelming majority of those discovered incidentally demonstrating benign pathology. However, because the risk of primary adrenocortical carcinoma is reported to be as high as 4.7% in patients with incidentally discovered adrenal masses, characterization and appropriate treatment remain crucial. The prevalence of clinically unapparent adrenal masses at autopsy is reported at nearly 2.1%. Detection is increasing with the advent of modern imaging technology. Estimates of incidence range from 0.1% for general health ultrasound screening to 0.42% in patients evaluated for non-endocrine symptoms to 4.3% in patients previously diagnosed with cancer. This prevalence also varies with age, at < 1% for patients younger than 30 years of age and increasing to 7% in patients 70 years of age or older. Overall, incidentally identified adrenal masses occur in up to 9% of CT scans, justifying the need for accurate guidelines to direct their management.

Advancements in imaging also allow for better characterization of adrenal masses prior to biopsy or surgical resection. Technological developments have improved the anatomic resolution, sensitivity, and specificity of cross-sectional imaging modalities, particularly MRI and contrasted CT (recommended modalities in the setting of AI), over the last 15–20 years. This is fueled by the superiority of these modalities over their conventional counterparts in the accurate detection of disease. Similarly, advancements have led to an increase in data generated with more cross-sectional images per scan. Improved cross-sectional imaging allows for detection of intralesional fat, water and blood enabling characterization of benign adrenal masses, such as adenomas, angiomyolipomas, cysts, granulomas and hemorrhage. Nieman et al. emphasize the importance of washout in delayed-phase CT scan due to the high prevalence of benign histology in masses with washout > 50%. When inconclusive, or if concerning features are noted, it may be appropriate to establish a tissue diagnosis by performing adrenal biopsy or perform definitive surgical management for potentially malignant lesions. Accurate characterization is imperative due to the potential for metastases to the adrenal gland, which may preclude surgical or radiation therapy to another primary site.

### Imaging features of adrenal masses [^bbd55a22]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The widespread use of imaging has dramatically increased the detection of incidental adrenal lesions, which are mostly benign and non-functioning adenomas. Nevertheless, differentiating a benign adrenal lesion from a malignant one can be challenging and is critical especially in oncology patients, since it will greatly affect patient management. In this setting, imaging plays a crucial role with several tools, which can be employed in the attempt to characterize adrenal lesions. Radiologists should recall the strengths and weaknesses of imaging modalities to better help clinicians and surgeons in the management of patients, avoiding a misinterpretation of imaging features which frequently overlap between benign and malignant conditions.

### Subclinical Cushing's syndrome [^bcdaf23d]. Pituitary (2004). Low credibility.

Clinically inapparent adrenal masses, or adrenal incidentalomas, are discovered inadvertently in the course of workup or treatment of unrelated disorders. Cortical adenoma is the most frequent type of adrenal incidentaloma accounting for approximately 50% of cases in surgical series and even greater shares in medical series. Incidentally discovered adrenal adenomas may secrete cortisol in an autonomous manner, that is not fully restrained by pituitary feed-back, in 5 to 20% of cases depending on study protocols and diagnostic criteria. A number of different alterations in the endocrine tests aimed to assess the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis has been demonstrated in such patients. This heterogeneous condition has been termed as subclinical Cushing's syndrome, a definition that is more accurate than preclinical Cushing's syndrome since the evolution towards clinically overt hypercortisolism does occur rarely, if ever. The criteria for qualifying subclinical cortisol excess are controversial and we presently do not have sufficient evidence to define a gold standard for the diagnosis of subclinical Cushing's syndrome. An increased frequency of hypertension, central obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes and hyperlipoproteinemia has been described in patients with subclinical Cushing's syndrome; however, there is not evidence-based demonstration of its long-term complications and, consequently, the management of this condition is largely empirical. Either adrenalectomy or careful observation associated with treatment of metabolic syndrome has been suggested as treatment options because data are insufficient to indicate the superiority of a surgical or nonsurgical approach to manage patients with subclinical hyperfunctioning adrenal cortical adenomas.

### Radiologic evaluation of incidentally discovered adrenal masses… [^449becbb]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Imaging to Determine Malignancy Most incidentally detected adrenal masses greater than 1 cm are characterized as benign, lipid-rich adenomas using the unenhanced phase of adrenal protocol CT. ADRENAL BIOPSY TO DETECT MALIGNANCY The role of adrenal biopsy has evolved. Biopsy is not performed to diagnose adrenal adenoma, but mostly to confirm or rule out malignancy in the few cases in which CT or MRI results are equivocal. However, before adrenal biopsy is performed, pheochromocytoma should be excluded with biochemical tests, especially in an incidentally detected mass, because hemorrhage and hypertensive crisis have been reported as complications of pheochromocytomas biopsy. 27, 28. Is the Lesion Functioning or Nonfunctioning. Subclinical hyperfunctioning adrenal nodules are well recognized; pheochromocytomas, aldosteronomas, and cortisol-secreting nodules are the most common.

13, 29 Although the literature yields variable results, the incidence of subclinical hyperfunctioning adrenal lesions is between 0. 4 and 15 percent. In one study, 19 of 33 adrenal pheochromocytomas were detected incidentally, and only 10 of the 19 patients were hypertensive. 30 Although a functioning mass is often suggested by the history and physical examination findings, the absence of these findings does not exclude a hormonally active lesion. Studies have shown detectable secretion of aldosterone, cortisol, or catecholamines in 5 to 23 percent of patients with adrenal incidentalomas. 31–34 Table 3 outlines the biochemical workup to help determine if the lesion is functioning.
5.

Follow-up and Treatment Patients with incidentally discovered adrenal masses measuring greater than 4 cm who do not have a history of malignancy usually undergo surgery if the lesions cannot be characterized as cysts or myelolipomas, because of the higher risk of adrenocortical carcinoma in masses of this size. 6 For lesions measuring 1 to 4 cm that are characterized as adenomas, follow-up unenhanced CT at 12 months can be performed to ensure that there has not been significant growth. Tumors that have grown should be further investigated, and adrenal biopsy or resection should be considered, although even growing adrenal lesions are usually not malignant. 13 If the size of the mass is stable, no further imaging is required, although serial biochemical evaluation may be needed. 35.

- evidence of hormone excess (including mild autonomous cortisol secretion in patients with clinically relevant comorbidities potentially attributable to cortisol)

- evidence of significant tumor growth during follow-up imaging

- candidates for adrenal surgery.

Imaging

Non-contrast, or unenhanced, CT is the preferred initial imaging modality for the evaluation of adrenal incidentalomas. CT allows assessment of tissue density or tissue attenuation and is essential to assess the likelihood of malignancy in adrenal lesions. An adrenal mass is considered benign if it appears homogeneous and lipid-rich, with a density of ≤ 10 HU on an unenhanced CT scan. While standard contrast-enhanced CT is not suitable for distinguishing benign from malignant adrenal tumors, CT with delayed washout is more helpful. An adrenal protocol CT includes an unenhanced sequence followed by intravenous contrast administration with repeat imaging at 60–75 s (venous phase) and again at 15 min (delayed phase). Injected intravenous contrast washes out of benign lesions more rapidly than malignant lesions. Specifically, benign adenomas demonstrate an absolute percentage washout > 60% at 15 min delay, which is therefore used as a key diagnostic cut-off.

The 2023 ESE/European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumours (ESNAT) guidelines recommend that the initial step is differentiating benign from malignant adrenal incidentalomas using a non-contrast CT. If non-contrast CT is consistent with a benign adrenal incidentaloma, i.e. homogenous in appearance and HU ≤ 10, no further imaging is required. This marks a significant shift from prior recommendations.

Tumor size is a key characteristic that determines management, due to the correlation between tumor size and risk of malignancy. In 2002, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) published a consensus recommendation on adrenal incidentalomas, which classified adrenal tumors measuring < 4 cm as having a low risk of malignancy, those between 4 and 6 cm as indeterminate, and tumors ≥ 6 cm as having a high risk of malignancy. Multiple international society guidelines continue to use a cut-off size of 4 cm to determine management. For indeterminate nodules 1–4 cm in size on CT, either immediate additional imaging (adrenal protocol CT or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) or interval imaging in 6–12 months is recommended due to a slightly increased risk of malignancy. Nodules ≥ 4 cm with indeterminate imaging characteristics are typically recommended for surgical resection.

Introduction

Adrenal cortical tumors are common, with a prevalence of 1–10%, but most are benign adrenal adenomas discovered incidentally. In contrast, adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignancy with an incidence of 0.7–2 cases per million/year. ACC exhibits a bimodal distribution predominantly affecting women (55–60%) and presenting in pediatric and adult populations. Approximately 75% of cases involve adrenal hormonal hypersecretion, primarily of cortisol and androgen, while estrogen or mineralocorticoid excess is rare.

Due to the rarity of ACC, limited preclinical models and clinical trials have hindered progress, resulting in poor outcomes, with a 5-year survival rate of 35% dropping to less than 15% in metastatic stage. Nevertheless, more recent studies reported a slight increase in survival rates, being RO resection cornerstone of curative treatment for ACC. In this regard, estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) for ACC patients undergoing R0 resection was 64.8% compared to 33.8% for patients undergoing an R1 resection. Prognosis worsens with advanced age and cortisol hypersecretion. ENSAT (European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors) staging is currently the most reliable prognostic tool.

MEN1-associated adrenal tumors — treatment and imaging are outlined: Surgery is indicated for functioning tumors and nonfunctioning tumors with atypical features, a size > 4 cm, or significant growth over a 6-month interval; some studies suggest consideration for surgery when adrenal lesions reach a size of > 3 cm. All functional tumors should undergo adrenalectomy, while small, nonfunctional adrenal nodules may be surveilled with cross-sectional imaging, and abdominal MRI scans are recommended every 3 years for tumors that are typically found to be benign on imaging.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for adrenal incidentaloma, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ENSAT/ESE 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining immediate additional imaging to avoid any follow-up imaging in patients with a homogeneous adrenal mass with unenhanced HUs of 11–20 and a tumor size < 4 cm on CT and without significant hormone excess on hormonal evaluation.
Consider obtaining interval imaging in 12 months by non-contrast CT or MRI as an alternative strategy.

Regarding specific circumstances for adrenal incidentaloma, more specifically with respect to patients with extra-adrenal malignancy, ENSAT/ESE 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain plasma or urinary metanephrines to exclude pheochromocytoma in patients with extra-adrenal malignancy with an indeterminate mass, even if the adrenal mass is likely to be a metastasis. Consider obtaining additional hormonal evaluation based on an individualized approach.
