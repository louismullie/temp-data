## Question

who should be on 2.5mg eliquis twice a day as opposed to 5mg twice a day for afib

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking who should be on 2.5 mg apixaban twice daily as opposed to 5 mg twice daily for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, especially distinguishing 5 mg vs 2.5 mg twice daily, handling renal impairment and dialysis, managing drug interactions, and avoiding inappropriate underdosing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indication and the base dose. Then, I should verify the exact dose-reduction criteria and confirm they are truly a two-of-three rule. Next, I will review ARISTOTLE data to validate outcomes with reduced dosing. After that, I need to check special populations such as severe CKD and hemodialysis, including pharmacokinetics and RENAL-AF findings. I will then examine interaction-driven dose changes with strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors or inducers. Finally, I will assess real-world dosing errors and synthesize practical recommendations [^1142oqX1] [^116fAT1g] [^114T3AXm] [^117LnKUC] [^11781JSy].

> Let me first confirm the labeled dose. For reduction of stroke and systemic embolism risk in nonvalvular AF, the recommended apixaban dose is 5 mg twice daily, and I should reduce to 2.5 mg twice daily only when the patient has at least two of the following: age 80 years or older, body weight 60 kg or less, or serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL or higher; I should double-check that language to ensure I am not missing any nuances or exceptions [^1142oqX1].

> Next, I should review ARISTOTLE to verify these criteria were prospectively applied and to understand outcomes with the reduced dose. Patients meeting two or more criteria received 2.5 mg twice daily in ARISTOTLE, with efficacy and safety versus warfarin consistent with those receiving 5 mg twice daily, and pharmacologic analyses demonstrated lower exposure with 2.5 mg yet similar reductions in thrombin generation markers; wait, let me verify those pharmacokinetic details to avoid overstating the precision of exposure estimates [^116fAT1g] [^114Xcg4W].

> Hold on, I should verify a common misconception: should dose be reduced for renal impairment alone. Wait, the label requires the two-of-three rule; renal dysfunction by itself does not mandate dose reduction unless serum creatinine is at least 1.5 mg/dL and one other criterion is present, so I need to ensure I am not suggesting unilateral reduction for creatinine without age or weight criteria [^1142oqX1] [^113iMMcA].

> Now, I will examine severe CKD and dialysis, because this is where uncertainty often leads to off-label practice. Pharmacokinetic studies in hemodialysis show that apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily yields exposures similar to 5 mg in normal renal function, whereas 5 mg twice daily can be supratherapeutic and dialysis removes little drug; but wait, I should confirm that RENAL-AF stopped early and did not definitively establish clinical superiority of a particular dialysis dose, so any suggestion to universally use 2.5 mg twice daily on dialysis remains off-label and evidence-limited, requiring individualized decisions and careful bleeding-risk assessment [^115vJBDb] [^114T3AXm] [^112coef5].

> But wait, what if I initially conclude that all patients on dialysis should receive 2.5 mg twice daily regardless of age or weight. Hmm, wait a minute, that overgeneralizes pharmacokinetic data; I should correct myself and emphasize that while lower dosing may avoid accumulation, the labeling does not endorse a one-size-fits-all dialysis dose and clinicians should integrate patient-specific thrombotic and bleeding risks, concurrent antiplatelet therapy, and the uncertain net benefit of anticoagulation in ESRD when selecting a dose [^114T3AXm] [^115vJBDb].

> Next, I should review drug interactions because they directly drive dose adjustments. For combined strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, or ritonavir, I need to reduce the apixaban dose by 50% when the starting dose is 5 or 10 mg twice daily, but if the patient is already on 2.5 mg twice daily I should avoid coadministration; conversely, I should avoid strong inducers like rifampin or carbamazepine due to substantially reduced exposure, and I need to remember the specific note that clarithromycin, although a strong inhibitor, generally does not require adjustment based on pharmacokinetics [^117LnKUC] [^1138Kjw6].

> I will now examine real-world dosing behavior to avoid inappropriate underdosing. Let me verify the magnitude of underdosing and whether it worsens outcomes; contemporary registries and claims-based analyses show frequent unlabeled use of 2.5 mg twice daily without meeting the two-of-three criteria, and such underdosing has been associated with higher cardiovascular hospitalizations and signals for increased stroke and mortality, so I need to ensure strict adherence to labeled criteria unless a compelling rationale exists and is documented [^11787GuU] [^11781JSy].

> Let me consider one more check on edge cases that tempt dose reduction, such as advanced age alone or mild-to-moderate CKD; I should confirm that ARISTOTLE analyses found patients with only one criterion still derived favorable efficacy and safety with the 5 mg twice-daily dose, reinforcing that single-criterion patients should not be automatically reduced without meeting the two-of-three rule [^116fAT1g].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure my final recommendations are precise and aligned with evidence: use 5 mg twice daily for most patients with nonvalvular AF, reduce to 2.5 mg twice daily only when at least two of age 80 years or older, body weight 60 kg or less, or serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL or higher are present; adjust for strong dual CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors as specified and avoid strong inducers; in ESRD or hemodialysis, consider the pharmacokinetic data favoring lower exposure with 2.5 mg twice daily but recognize this is off-label with limited randomized evidence, so I should confirm risks and benefits for the individual and avoid blanket rules; and above all, I should double-check that dose reductions are not applied for convenience or age alone, given the observed harm signals with inappropriate underdosing [^1142oqX1] [^117LnKUC] [^114T3AXm] [^11787GuU].

For atrial fibrillation, **apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily** is indicated only when a patient meets at least two of the following: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL [^1142oqX1] [^114Xcg4W]. The **standard dose is 5 mg twice daily**. In end-stage kidney disease on dialysis, use 5 mg twice daily unless age ≥ 80 years or body weight ≤ 60 kg — then use 2.5 mg twice daily — and avoid 2.5 mg twice daily unless criteria are met, as **underdosing increases stroke risk** [^1142oqX1] [^114T3AXm] [^11787GuU].

---

## FDA-approved dose reduction criteria

The FDA-approved labeling for apixaban (Eliquis) specifies that the **standard dose for stroke prevention in NVAF is 5 mg twice daily**. The dose should be **reduced to 2.5 mg twice daily** if the patient meets at least two of the following three criteria [^1142oqX1]:

- **Age**: ≥ 80 years
- **Body weight**: ≤ 60 kg
- **Serum creatinine**: ≥ 1.5 mg/dL

These criteria are based on pharmacokinetic and clinical trial data showing that patients meeting at least two criteria have **increased exposure to apixaban and a higher risk of bleeding**, necessitating dose reduction to maintain an appropriate balance between efficacy and safety [^114Xcg4W].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dose reduction

The landmark ARISTOTLE randomized trial provided the primary evidence supporting the FDA-approved dose reduction criteria. Patients with NVAF who met at least two criteria received 2.5 mg twice daily, while those with one or none received the standard 5 mg twice daily dose. The reduced dose **maintained efficacy** in preventing stroke and systemic embolism while significantly **reducing the risk of major bleeding** compared to warfarin [^114Xcg4W].

---

## Special considerations: renal impairment and dialysis

Renal impairment significantly affects apixaban pharmacokinetics. In patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on dialysis, pharmacokinetic studies show that the standard 5 mg twice daily dose leads to **higher drug exposure**, increasing bleeding risk, whereas 2.5 mg twice daily can result in exposure comparable to the standard dose in patients with normal renal function and may be considered when label-based dose-reduction criteria or strong inhibitors are present [^115vJBDb]. Additionally, the RENAL-AF trial, which specifically studied apixaban in dialysis patients with AF, used the reduced dose (2.5 mg twice daily) in patients aged ≥ 80 years or weighing ≤ 60 kg; although the trial was stopped early due to enrollment challenges, it provided valuable pharmacokinetic and safety data **supporting the use of the reduced dose** when criteria are met in this population [^114T3AXm].

---

## Risks associated with inappropriate dosing

Inappropriate dosing of apixaban — particularly underdosing — is a significant clinical concern. Underdosing patients who do not meet the FDA-approved criteria for dose reduction is associated with **increased risks of stroke**, systemic embolism, and cardiovascular hospitalization, whereas overdosing increases the risk of major bleeding. Therefore, **strict adherence to the approved dosing criteria is essential** to optimize clinical outcomes.

## Summary of indications for 2.5 mg twice daily dosing

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for 2.5 mg twice daily** |
|-|-|
| - Age ≥ 80 years <br/> - Body weight ≤ 60 kg <br/> - Serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL | At least two criteria met [^1142oqX1] |
| End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on dialysis | Use 2.5 mg twice daily only when dose-reduction criteria are met or with strong dual CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors; otherwise standard 5 mg twice daily |
| Concomitant use of strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir) | Dose reduction required [^117LnKUC] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where 2.5 mg twice daily is inappropriate

- **Patients meeting only one or none of the dose reduction criteria**: Standard dose (5 mg twice daily) should be used.
- **Patients with normal renal function, younger age, and normal body weight**: Standard dose recommended.
- **Patients with high thromboembolic risk without increased bleeding risk**: Standard dose preferred to ensure adequate stroke prevention.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The reduced dose of apixaban (2.5 mg twice daily) is specifically indicated for NVAF patients who **meet at least two** of the following: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL. It is also recommended with **strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp**, and in ESKD on dialysis only when dose-reduction criteria are met. Strict adherence to these criteria is **essential** to balance the risks of stroke and bleeding effectively.

### Apixaban for patients with atrial fibrillation on hemodialysis: A multicenter randomized controlled trial [^114T3AXm]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

There are no randomized data evaluating the safety or efficacy of apixaban for stroke prevention in patients with end-stage kidney disease on hemodialysis and with atrial fibrillation (AF).

- **Methods**: The RENAL-AF trial (Renal Hemodialysis Patients Allocated Apixaban Versus Warfarin in Atrial Fibrillation) was a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-outcome evaluation (PROBE) of apixaban versus warfarin in patients receiving hemodialysis with AF and a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥ 2. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to 5 mg of apixaban twice daily (2.5 mg twice daily for patients ≥ 80 years of age, weight ≤ 60 kg, or both) or dose-adjusted warfarin. The primary outcome was time to major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. Secondary outcomes included stroke, mortality, and apixaban pharmacokinetics, with pharmacokinetic sampling on day 1, day 3, and month 1.

- **Results**: From January 2017 through January 2019, 154 patients were randomly assigned to apixaban (n = 82) or warfarin (n = 72). The trial stopped prematurely because of enrollment challenges. Time in therapeutic range (international normalized ratio, 2.0–3.0) for warfarin-treated patients was 44% (interquartile range, 23%-59%). The 1-year rates for major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding were 32% and 26% in apixaban and warfarin groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.20 [95% CI, 0.63–2.30]), whereas 1-year rates for stroke or systemic embolism were 3.0% and 3.3% in apixaban and warfarin groups, respectively. Death was the most common major event in the apixaban group (21 patients [26%]) and in the warfarin group (13 patients [18%]).

### Clinical and pharmacological effects of apixaban dose adjustment in the ARISTOTLE trial [^114Xcg4W]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

In the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial, patients with atrial fibrillation and ≥ 2 dose-adjustment criteria (age ≥ 80 years, weight ≤ 60 kg, or creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dl [133 μmol/l]) were randomized to receive apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily or warfarin.

- **Objectives**: The purpose of this study was to describe the effects of apixaban dose adjustment on clinical and pharmacological outcomes.

- **Methods**: Patients receiving the correct dose of study drug were included (n = 18,073). The effect of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily versus warfarin on population pharmacokinetics, D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (PF1+2), and clinical outcomes was compared with the standard dose (5 mg twice daily).

- **Results**: Patients receiving apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily exhibited lower apixaban exposure (median area under the concentration time curve at a steady state 2,720 ng/ml vs. 3,599 ng/ml; p < 0.0001) than those receiving the standard dose. In patients with ≥ 2 dose-adjustment criteria, reductions in D-dimers (p interaction = 0.20) and PF1+2 (p interaction = 0.55) were consistent with those observed in the standard-dose population. Patients with ≥ 2 dose-adjustment criteria (n = 751) were at higher risk for stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding, and all-cause death than the standard-dose population (0 or 1 dose-adjustment criterion, n = 17,322). The effect of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily versus warfarin in the ≥ 2 dose-adjustment criteria population was consistent with the standard dose in the reductions in stroke or systemic embolism outcomes.

### Differences in preferences between clinicians and patients for the use and dosing of direct oral anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation [^11787GuU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban, are effective in reducing the risk of stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) when prescribed at the dose studied in randomized clinical trials. In these trial protocols, reduced DOAC doses were prescribed to patients with renal impairment for rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or edoxaban, or those meeting two of three criteria (age, body weight, creatinine level) for apixaban. The ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial, for example, studied apixaban at 5 mg twice daily; patients who met two of the three dose reduction criteria received 2.5 mg twice daily. For patients who met labeled dose reduction criteria, the outcomes associated with apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily versus warfarin to reduce the risk of stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding, and death were consistent with the outcomes associated with the labeled dose (apixaban 5 mg twice daily).

However, a prior study of cardiology practices in the United States revealed over four-fold higher rates of reduced-dose apixaban use compared with use in randomized trials (20.8% versus 4.7%). Additionally, in an analysis of approximately 15,000 patients with AF initiated on a DOAC, 13% received a reduced dose without meeting renal dose reduction criteria. DOAC underdosing (or unlabeled reduced dose) has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular hospitalization. Underdosing has also been linked to a higher risk of stroke and an increased risk of all-cause mortality.

### Eliquis [^1142oqX1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Reduction of risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation**: The recommended dose of Eliquis for most patients is 5 mg taken orally twice daily. The recommended dose is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with at least two of the following characteristics: age greater than or equal to 80 years, body weight less than or equal to 60 kg, or serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL.

- **Prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following hip or knee replacement surgery**: The recommended dose of Eliquis is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily. The initial dose should be taken 12 to 24 hours after surgery. In patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, the recommended duration of treatment is 35 days. In patients undergoing knee replacement surgery, the recommended duration of treatment is 12 days.

- **Treatment of DVT and PE**: The recommended dose of Eliquis is 10 mg taken orally twice daily for the first 7 days of therapy. After 7 days, the recommended dose is 5 mg taken orally twice daily.

- **Reduction in the risk of recurrence of DVT and PE**: The recommended dose of Eliquis is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily after at least 6 months of treatment for DVT or PE [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

- **Missed dose**: If a dose of Eliquis is not taken at the scheduled time, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day, and twice-daily administration should be resumed. The dose should not be doubled to make up for a missed dose.

- **Temporary interruption for surgery and other interventions**: Eliquis should be discontinued.

### Eliquis [^117LnKUC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Apixaban is a substrate of both CYP3A4 and P-gp. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp increase exposure to apixaban and heighten the risk of bleeding, while inducers decrease its exposure, raising the risk of stroke and other thromboembolic events.

- **Combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors**: For patients receiving Eliquis 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, reduce the dose by 50% when coadministered with drugs that are combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. For patients on a 2.5 mg twice-daily regimen, avoid coadministration with these inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

	- Although clarithromycin is a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, pharmacokinetic data suggest no dose adjustment is necessary when administered concomitantly with Eliquis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inducers**: Avoid using Eliquis with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John's wort) as these drugs will decrease exposure to apixaban [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Off-label dosing of direct oral anticoagulants among inpatients with atrial fibrillation in the United States [^11781JSy]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2023). High credibility.

Among patients hospitalized for atrial fibrillation, the frequency of off-label direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) dosing, associated factors, hospital-level variation, and temporal trends in contemporary practice are unknown.

- **Methods**: Using the Get With The Guidelines-Atrial Fibrillation registry, patients admitted from January 1, 2014, to March 31, 2020, and discharged on DOACs were stratified according to receipt of underdosing, overdosing, or recommended dosing. Factors associated with off-label dosing (defined as underdosing or overdosing) were identified using logistic regression. Median odds ratio (OR) and time-series analyses were used to assess hospital-level variation and temporal trends, respectively.

- **Results**: Of 22,470 patients (70.1 ± 12.1 years, 48.1% female, 82.5% White) prescribed a DOAC at discharge from hospitalization for atrial fibrillation (66% apixaban, 29% rivaroxaban, and 5% dabigatran), underdosing occurred among 2,006 (8.9%), overdosing among 511 (2.3%), and recommended dosing among 19,953 (88.8%). The overall rate of off-label dosing was 11.2%. Patient-related factors associated with off-label dose included age (underdosing: OR, 1.06 per 1-year increase [95% CI, 1.06–1.07]; overdosing: OR, 1.07 per 1-year increase [95% CI, 1.06–1.09]), dialysis dependence (underdosing: OR, 5.50 [95% CI, 3.76–8.05]; overdosing: OR, 5.47 [95% CI, 2.74–10.88]), female sex (overdosing: OR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.63–0.99]), and weight (overdosing: OR, 0.96 per 1-kg increase [95% CI, 0.95–1.00]). Across hospitals, the adjusted median OR for off-label DOAC dose was 1.45.

### Apixaban pharmacokinetics at steady state in hemodialysis patients [^115vJBDb]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

It is unclear whether warfarin is protective or harmful in patients with ESRD and atrial fibrillation. This state of equipoise raises the question of whether alternative anticoagulants may have a therapeutic role. We aimed to determine apixaban pharmacokinetics at steady state in patients on hemodialysis. Seven patients received apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily for 8 days. Blood samples were collected before and after apixaban administration on days 1 and 8 (nondialysis days). Significant accumulation of the drug was observed between days 1 and 8 with the 2.5-mg dose. The area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours increased from 628 to 2054 ng h/ml (P < 0.001). Trough levels increased from 45 to 132 ng/ml (P < 0.001). On day 9, following a 2.5-mg dose, apixaban levels were monitored hourly during dialysis, and only 4% of the drug was removed. After a 5-day washout period, five patients received 5 mg apixaban twice daily for 8 days. The area under the concentration-time curve further increased to 6045 ng h/ml (P = 0.03), and trough levels increased to 218 ng/ml (P = 0.03), above the 90th percentile for the 5-mg dose in patients with preserved renal function. Apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily in patients on hemodialysis resulted in drug exposure comparable with that of the standard dose (5 mg twice daily) in patients with preserved renal function and might be a reasonable alternative to warfarin for stroke prevention in patients on dialysis. Apixaban 5 mg twice daily led to supratherapeutic levels in patients on hemodialysis and should be avoided.

### SPL drug information for apixaban [^112nVQz4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of apixaban PO (also known as Eliquis) in patients with intermittent hemodialysis, it is advised to use with caution. It is also recommended to titrate with caution.

### Apixaban reduces hospitalizations in patients with venous thromboembolism: An analysis of the Apixaban for the Initial Management of Pulmonary Embolism and Deep-Vein Thrombosis as First-Line Therapy (AMPLIFY) trial [^115gDnMW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

These results are consistent with an analysis from the AMPLIFY-EXT trial, which showed that extended anticoagulation with apixaban reduced the risk of all-cause hospitalizations in patients with VTE who had already received anticoagulant therapy for 6 to 12 months for their index event. This result was also consistent across key subgroups, including index event, sex, age, level of renal impairment, and weight, as well as with the overall trial results that showed both doses of apixaban reduced the risk of recurrent VTE or all-cause death compared with placebo.

In addition, apixaban was shown to extend the mean time to first hospitalization compared with placebo by 43 days in the 2.5 mg twice-daily group and 49 days in the 5 mg twice-daily group. It also reduced the median length of stay of first hospitalization (apixaban 5 mg, 4.5 days; apixaban 2.5 mg, 5.0 days; placebo, 7.0 days). In the AMPLIFY-EXT trial, the rates of major bleeding were low and similar in the apixaban and placebo groups (apixaban 2.5 mg, 0.2%; apixaban 5 mg, 0.1%; placebo 0.5%).

VTE recurrence accounted for 51.6% of hospitalizations in the placebo group, which was reduced with both apixaban 2.5 mg and 5 mg (26.2% and 17.7%, respectively). Although bleeding rates were low and similar in AMPLIFY-EXT and not a main reason for hospitalization, apixaban still reduced the risk of hospitalization compared with placebo, possibly due to reducing the risk of VTE recurrence.

### SPL drug information for apixaban [^1138Kjw6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of apixaban PO (also known as Eliquis):

- **AIS**: Use extreme caution in patients with AF transitioning from apixaban to warfarin.

- **Bleeding**: Use caution in patients taking other drugs affecting hemostasis, including antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or thrombolytic agents, SSRIs, SNRIs, and NSAIDs.

- **Increased serum apixaban levels**: Use caution in patients taking P-glycoprotein or potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, or ritonavir). Reduce the dose of apixaban from 5–10 mg BID by 50%. Do not use P-glycoprotein or potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients receiving 2.5 mg BID of apixaban.

### Apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112F87kz]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Apixaban Dosage Calculator" assists with perioperative bleeding, perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery, periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, cancer-associated thrombosis, acute ischemic stroke, portal vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and atrial fibrillation.

The Apixaban Dosage Calculator is a clinical tool to determine the appropriate dosage of apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) used for thromboprophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic conditions such as atrial fibrillation (AF), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). The dosage depends on three factors: age, weight, and renal function (creatinine clearance). For atrial fibrillation, the recommended dose is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with at least two of the following three characteristics: age ≥ 80 years, body weight, and serum creatinine levels of at least 1.5 mg/dL.

The Apixaban Dosage Calculator determines the appropriate apixaban dosage based on specific patient information. This involves considering the patient's age, weight, creatinine clearance, and the reason for using apixaban. Here's how the process works:

- **Inputs**: Age is captured in years, with a range of 18 to 120. Weight can be entered either in kilograms (30 to 300 kg) or pounds (66 to 660 lb). If in pounds, it is converted to kilograms using a conversion rate (1 kg = 2.20462 lb). Creatinine clearance is measured in mL/min, ranging from 0 to 150. The indication for use includes four options: atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and another indication.

### Twice- or once-daily dosing of direct oral anticoagulants, a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112N9Zam]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Low credibility.

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) have similar half-lives, but the dosing regimen varies between once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID). For some prescribers, the QD regimen improves compliance, while others prefer BID regimens to promote better stability of plasma concentrations, particularly in the event of missed doses. A limited level of evidence provides guidance about the best treatment strategy. The purpose of this study was to compare the treatment effect of QD vs. BID administration of DOACs in major orthopedic surgery (MOS), non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), venous thromboembolism (VTE), and acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review up to April 2020 and included phase II clinical trials comparing DOAC QD vs. BID with the same daily dose. We extracted data for the occurrence of major thrombosis (proximal deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke) and major hemorrhage (International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria and recommendations of the European Medicines Agency for surgical patients). Relative risks (RR) were combined using a fixed and random effects weighted meta-analysis.

- **Results**: Twelve randomized controlled phase II trials were included (10,716 patients), representing 24 dosing regimen comparisons of apixaban, darexaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, letaxaban, and dabigatran. There was no difference for major thrombotic events (RR BID/QD = 1.06, 95% CI 0.86–1.30) nor for major bleeding (RR BID/QD = 1.02, 95% CI 0.84–1.23) between the BID vs. QD regimens, without heterogeneity (I² = 0%).

- **Conclusion**: Our study does not support a preference for BID over QD dosing regimens in the context of their effects on major thrombotic and bleeding events based on the available evidence.

### Apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation [^116LPtpz]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists are highly effective in preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation but have several limitations. Apixaban is a novel oral direct factor Xa inhibitor that has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke in a similar population in comparison with aspirin.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, double-blind trial, we compared apixaban (at a dose of 5 mg twice daily) with warfarin (target international normalized ratio, 2.0 to 3.0) in 18,201 patients with atrial fibrillation and at least one additional risk factor for stroke. The primary outcome was ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or systemic embolism. The trial was designed to test for non-inferiority, with key secondary objectives of testing for superiority with respect to the primary outcome and to the rates of major bleeding and death from any cause.

- **Results**: The median duration of follow-up was 1.8 years. The rate of the primary outcome was 1.27% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 1.60% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio with apixaban, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.95; P < 0.001 for non-inferiority; P = 0.01 for superiority). The rate of major bleeding was 2.13% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 3.09% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.80; P < 0.001), and the rates of death from any cause were 3.52% and 3.94%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.99; P = 0.047). The rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.24% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 0.47% per year in the warfarin group.

### Dose reduction of edoxaban in patients 80 years and older with atrial fibrillation: Post hoc analysis of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 randomized clinical trial [^116o4myW]. JAMA Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

In older patients with atrial fibrillation who take anticoagulants for stroke prevention, there is an increased risk of bleeding compared with younger patients. As a result, clinicians frequently prescribe lower than recommended doses for older patients despite the limited randomized data available on this approach.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the ischemic and bleeding outcomes in patients 80 years and older with atrial fibrillation receiving edoxaban, 60 mg versus 30 mg, and edoxaban, 30 mg versus warfarin.

The ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial (Effective Anticoagulation With Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 48) was a parallel-design, double-blind, global clinical trial that randomized patients with atrial fibrillation to either one of two edoxaban dosing regimens or warfarin. This secondary analysis focused on patients 80 years or older without dose-reduction criteria receiving edoxaban, 60 mg versus 30 mg, as well as patients with or without dose-reduction criteria receiving edoxaban, 30 mg, versus warfarin. Study data were analyzed between October 2022 and December 2023.

Interventions included oral edoxaban, 30 mg once daily; edoxaban, 60 mg once daily; or warfarin.

The main outcomes and measures were the primary net clinical outcome of death, stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding, and each individual component.

The analysis included 2,966 patients 80 years and older (mean [SD] age, 83 [2.7] years; 1,671 male [56%]). Among 1,138 patients 80 years and older without dose-reduction criteria, those receiving edoxaban, 60 mg versus 30 mg, had more instances of major bleeding.

### Apixaban for stroke prevention in subclinical atrial fibrillation [^114ptydy]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The ARTESIA study was published by Jeff S. Healey and colleagues in 2024 in the journal **The New England Journal of Medicine**. This study addresses atrial fibrillation. The trial posed the question: What is the role of apixaban in patients with subclinical atrial fibrillation (AF)?

- **Study design**: The study was a multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

- **Population**: The study included 4,012 patients (1,447 female, 2,565 male).

- **Inclusion criteria**: Adult patients with subclinical AF lasting from 6 minutes to 24 hours were included.

- **Exclusion criteria**: Key exclusions were clinical AF; mechanical valve prosthesis; deep vein thrombosis (DVT); recent pulmonary embolism; other conditions requiring treatment with an anticoagulant; contraindications to apixaban or aspirin; and pregnancy.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Apixaban group**: 2,015 patients received apixaban at a dose of 5 mg twice daily.
	- **Aspirin group**: 1,997 patients received aspirin at a daily dose of 81 mg.

- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant decrease in stroke or systemic embolism in the apixaban group (0.78% per patient-year vs. 1.24% per patient-year; hazard ratio [HR] 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45 to 0.88).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- There was a significant decrease in the incidence of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or systemic embolism (1.17% per patient-year vs. 1.56% per patient-year; HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.56 to 1).
	- There was no significant difference in myocardial infarction (0.52% per patient-year vs. 0.59% per patient-year; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.4).
	- There was no significant difference in death (5.06% per patient-year vs. 4.82% per patient-year; HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.21).

- **Safety outcomes**:
	- There was no significant difference in fatal bleeding.
	- A significant difference was observed in major bleeding (1.71% per patient-year for apixaban vs. 0.94% per patient-year for aspirin).

The study concluded by affirming the efficacy of apixaban for prevention in this patient group while noting associated bleeding risks.

### Apixaban 5 mg twice daily and clinical outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation and advanced age, low body weight, or high creatinine: A secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^116fAT1g]. JAMA Cardiology (2016). High credibility.

In the Apixaban for Reduction of Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Complications in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial, the standard dose of apixaban was 5 mg twice daily; patients with at least two dose-reduction criteria — 80 years or older, weight 60 kg or less, and creatinine level 1.5 mg/dL or higher — received a reduced dose of apixaban of 2.5 mg twice daily. Little is known about patients with one dose-reduction criterion who received the 5 mg twice daily dose of apixaban.

- **Objective**: To determine the frequency of one dose-reduction criterion and whether the effects of the 5 mg twice daily dose of apixaban on stroke or systemic embolism and bleeding varied among patients with one or no dose-reduction criteria.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Among 18,201 patients in the ARISTOTLE trial, 17,322 were included in this analysis. Annualized event rates of stroke or systemic embolism and major bleeding, as well as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were evaluated. Interactions between the effects of apixaban vs. warfarin and the presence of one or no dose-reduction criteria were assessed. The first patient was enrolled in the ARISTOTLE trial on December 19, 2006, with follow-up completed on January 30, 2011. Data were analyzed from January 2015 to May 30, 2016.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Analysis of major bleeding included events during study drug treatment. Analysis of stroke or systemic embolism was based on intention to treat.

- **Results**: Of the patients with one or no dose-reduction criteria assigned to receive the 5 mg twice daily dose of apixaban or warfarin, 3,966 had one dose.

### Apixaban concentrations with lower than recommended dosing in older adults with atrial fibrillation [^1152rBeo]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2019). Low credibility.

Lower than recommended doses of direct-acting oral anticoagulants are often prescribed to older adults with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Our goal was to determine the consequences of lower than recommended dosing on plasma apixaban concentrations during the clinical care of older adults with NVAF.

- **Design**: Convenience sample of patients receiving anticoagulation during 2017.

- **Setting**: Academic medical center.

- **Participants**: Stable adults older than 65 years with NVAF receiving apixaban on a chronic basis.

- **Measurements**: Patient age, weight, creatinine, co-medications, and apixaban concentrations.

Results indicate that a total of 110 older adults with NVAF (mean age = 80.4 years; range = 66–100 years with 45% women) were studied. Overall, 48 patients received the recommended dosing of 5 mg twice/day, and 42 received lower than recommended dosing. One patient in each category had concentrations below the expected 5% to 95% range at the time of peak concentrations. Differences in the proportion of apixaban concentrations within or outside expected ranges were not significant between patients receiving lower than recommended doses and those dosed as recommended at 5 mg twice/day (P = 0.35). However, in patients dosed as recommended with 5 mg twice/day, four had concentrations above the 5% to 95% range for peak levels expected at 3 to 4 hours after dosing; in two of these patients, this occurred around the midpoint of the dosing interval. Twenty patients received 2.5 mg twice/day as recommended. One-third had apixaban concentrations higher than expected peak concentrations compared with the clinical trials.

### D-dimer and reduced-dose apixaban for extended treatment after unprovoked venous thromboembolism: the Apidulcis study [^116oHmmG]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

All included patients underwent serial D-dimer assessment starting at baseline during anticoagulation (T0). Patients with positive baseline D-dimer were instructed to take apixaban 2.5 mg twice a day for 18 months, while those with negative D-dimer at T0 were asked to stop anticoagulant therapy and repeat D-dimer testing after 15 ± 3 (T1), 30 ± 4 (T2), and 60 ± 5 (T3) days from T0. At the first positive D-dimer result, apixaban 2.5 mg twice a day was given by the local investigator for a treatment duration of 18 months. Three boxes containing apixaban 2.5 mg tablets (each box sufficient for 1 month of treatment) were distributed to patients directly by the participant investigators and refilled every 3 months. Patients with persistently negative D-dimer results were invited to stay off anticoagulant treatment.

Patients underwent assessment, either at the clinic or by phone, every 3 to 6 months during the study period. Patients were invited to report to the study center if they had symptoms suggestive of recurrent venous thromboembolism (reVTE) or bleeding. An independent adjudication committee that was unaware of patient name, D-dimer testing result at inclusion, management, and enrolling center assessed all outcomes. Recurrent deep vein thrombosis (ReDVT) was diagnosed if a previously fully compressible segment at compression ultrasonography (CUS; contralateral or ipsilateral) could no longer be compressed or if an increase of ≥ 4 mm in the diameter of the residual thrombus during compression was detected. In patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), recurrence was diagnosed following objective criteria.

### Dose specific effectiveness and safety of DOACs in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation: A Canadian retrospective cohort study [^114NVWym]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been proven to be effective and safe for the prevention of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). However, suboptimal adherence, variable dosing, and use in patient populations that would have otherwise been excluded from clinical trials may impact the efficacy and safety profile of DOACs in a routine care setting. We compared stroke, bleeding, and mortality rates on and off therapy for standard and low-dose DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran) versus warfarin in a Canadian cohort. We also assessed the persistence of DOACs compared to warfarin.

- **Methods**: We conducted six 1–1 propensity-score matched retrospective cohort analyses using Quebec health administrative databases (2011–2017). NVAF patients (≥ 18 years) covered by the public medication insurance plan entered the cohort on the first OAC dispensation date. We excluded those with OAC use in the previous year or stroke or bleeding diagnoses in the previous two years. Follow-up ended at death, March 2017, or end of medication coverage by the public plan. Time-dependent Cox regression was applied.

- **Results**:
	- **Patient evaluation**:
		- **Apixaban**: 10,893 patients (7,206 standard-dose, 3,687 low-dose)
		- **Rivaroxaban**: 10,190 patients (7,396 standard-dose, 2,794 low-dose)
		- **Dabigatran**: 5,884 patients (2,756 standard-dose, 3,128 low-dose)
	- **Effectiveness and safety across standard-dose DOACs compared to warfarin**:
		- **Stroke risks**: Similar
		- **Bleeding risks**: Lower with apixaban (hazard ratio 0.63; 95% confidence interval 0.52–0.77) and dabigatran

### Anticoagulation in patients with chronic kidney disease [^112coef5]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Apixaban: Steady-state pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, including data from patients in the second month of the ARISTOTLE trial, which recruited participants with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) as low as 25 mL/min, showed considerable overlap of drug exposure with the 5 mg twice-daily apixaban dose in patients with mild, moderate, and severe chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, in a PK analysis of 7 patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on hemodialysis, Mavrakanas et al. showed that steady-state exposure on day seven with each apixaban dose was significantly higher compared to day one. The accumulation index was higher in ESKD (3.6) as compared to healthy controls (1.3–1.7). Steady-state exposure attained at the dose of 2.5 mg twice daily was comparable to that achieved with the 5 mg twice-daily dose in healthy volunteers, whereas exposure in some patients with ESKD was supratherapeutic with the 5 mg twice-daily dose. The authors recommended dose reduction of apixaban to 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with ESKD.

RENAL-AF was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that compared apixaban to warfarin in patients with ESKD and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation at high risk for stroke. Apixaban was given at the standard dose of 5 mg twice daily. The reduced dose (2.5 mg twice daily) was used in patients over 80 years of age or with a body weight under 60 kg. Exposure attained with the standard dose was higher than the exposure observed in patients from the ARISTOTLE trial, who had preserved kidney function (median steady-state area under the curve (AUC) in RENAL-AF was 2,475 ng/mL.h compared to 1,374 ng/mL.h in ARISTOTLE). Drug exposure with the reduced apixaban dose was comparable to patients with normal kidney function from the ARISTOTLE trial.

### Stroke and bleeding risks in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with reduced apixaban dose: A real-life study [^1154fYNt]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess the association between reduced apixaban dose and two outcomes: ischemic stroke/systemic embolism (SE) and major bleeding. We performed a retrospective cohort study within the database of the largest healthcare provider in Israel, identifying all patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation who started apixaban treatment between 2013 and 2017.

Apixaban users were classified into three dosing regimen groups based on renal function, age, and weight: standard dose (5 mg b.i.d.), adjusted reduced dose (2.5 mg b.i.d.), and underdosing (2.5 mg b.i.d.). Patients were followed through 2018 for the occurrence of stroke/SE and major bleeding.

Of the 27,765 included patients, 13,141 (47%) adequately received the standard apixaban dose, 4,739 patients (17%) received the adjusted reduced dose, and 9,885 patients (36%) were classified as underdosed. The CHA2DS2-VASc score-adjusted hazard ratio for ischemic stroke/SE was 1.1 (95% confidence interval, 0.83–1.43) in the adjusted reduced dose group, and 1.04 (95% CI, 0.83–1.35) in the underdosing group, compared with the standard apixaban dose group. The HAS-BLED score-adjusted hazard ratio for any major bleeding was 1.66 (95% CI, 1.32–2.09) in the adjusted reduced dose group, and 1.51 (95% CI, 1.24–1.83) in the underdosing group, compared with apixaban in the standard dose group.

Results were similar for major gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage separately. We conclude that underdosing with apixaban is very common and may not disproportionately elevate the risk of ischemic stroke.

### Apixaban compared to heparin/vitamin K antagonist in patients with atrial fibrillation scheduled for cardioversion: The EMANATE trial [^116XsJ6w]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The EMANATE trial was a multinational, randomized, active-controlled, open-label study conducted in patients with recently diagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF) who were scheduled for cardioversion. The study design has been previously described and is briefly summarized here. Patients with electrocardiographically confirmed AF and who had received anticoagulation for 48 hours or less were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either apixaban or usual care, which included parenteral heparin and/or an oral vitamin K antagonist (VKA). Randomization was performed using a centralized interactive voice-response system.

- **Study design**: The protocol encouraged administering a single loading dose of apixaban, either 10 mg or 5 mg, with image guidance left to the discretion of the investigator, to facilitate a more rapid transition to cardioversion. The dosage was adjusted to 2.5 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) or a single loading dose of 5 mg when two of the following conditions were present: age ≥ 80 years, weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL (133 μmol/L). Imaging guidance, either transoesophageal echocardiography or computed tomography, was decided by the investigator. b.i.d. signifies twice daily; VKA stands for vitamin K antagonist.

For those patients randomized to usual care with heparin and a VKA, the target international normalized ratio (INR) was set between 2.0 and 3.0. Heparin was administered until the INR reached 2 or higher. Those allocated to apixaban received a 5 mg b.i.d. dosage, with a reduction to 2.5 mg b.i.d. in patients meeting two of the following criteria: age ≥ 80 years, weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL (133 μmol/L). This dosage adjustment mirrors approved dosing guidelines for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular AF. Cardioversion was permitted after five doses of apixaban, at which point steady-state blood levels are anticipated to be achieved.

### Apixaban for stroke prevention in subclinical atrial fibrillation [^112ER3DX]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Subclinical atrial fibrillation is short-lasting and asymptomatic, typically detectable only through long-term continuous monitoring with pacemakers or defibrillators. This condition is associated with an increased risk of stroke by a factor of 2.5; however, the benefit of treatment with oral anticoagulation remains uncertain.

- **Methods**: We conducted a trial involving patients with subclinical atrial fibrillation lasting from 6 minutes to 24 hours. Patients were randomly assigned, in a double-blind, double-dummy design, to receive either apixaban at a dose of 5 mg twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily when indicated) or aspirin at a dose of 81 mg daily. The trial medication was discontinued and anticoagulation initiated if subclinical atrial fibrillation lasting more than 24 hours or clinical atrial fibrillation developed. The primary efficacy outcome — stroke or systemic embolism — was assessed in the intention-to-treat population (all patients who had undergone randomization). The primary safety outcome, major bleeding, was assessed in the on-treatment population (all patients who had undergone randomization and received at least one dose of the assigned trial drug, with follow-up censored 5 days after permanent discontinuation of trial medication for any reason).

- **Results**: We included 4012 patients with a mean (± SD) age of 76.8 ± 7.6 years and a mean CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 3.9 ± 1.1 (scores range from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating a higher risk of stroke); 36.1% of the patients were women. After a mean follow-up of 3.5 ± 1.8 years, stroke or systemic embolism oc​…

### Special considerations for therapeutic choice of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants for Japanese patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^114ERxnt]. Clinical cardiology (2017).

**Characteristics of the NOACs**: The characteristics of the four NOACs (edoxaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban) have been compared with those of warfarin and reported in numerous studies. In brief, NOACs have shorter half-lives and reach maximum blood concentration more quickly than warfarin. Unlike warfarin, NOACs have a specific target (either thrombin or factor Xa), do not require coagulation monitoring, and can be administered at fixed doses.

### Effectiveness and safety of standard-dose nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants and warfarin among patients with atrial fibrillation with a single stroke risk factor: A nationwide cohort study [^115TdTpZ]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The randomized clinical trials comparing nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) versus warfarin largely focused on recruiting high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation having more than two stroke risk factors. Only the trials testing dabigatran or apixaban included a few patients with one stroke risk factor. Despite this, regulatory approvals of all NOACs have been based on stroke prevention for patients with atrial fibrillation with one or more stroke risk factors.

The objective was to compare the effectiveness and safety of standard-dose NOACs (dabigatran at 150 mg twice daily, rivaroxaban at 20 mg once daily, and apixaban at 5 mg twice daily) and warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and one low-risk, non-sex-related stroke risk factor.

This nationwide observational cohort study used data from Danish registries to determine the inverse probability of treatment-weighted comparative effectiveness and safety of standard-dose NOACs compared to treatment with warfarin among 14,020 patients with atrial fibrillation and one low-risk, non-sex-related stroke risk factor.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Rates of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism, death, and bleeding.

Of 14,020 participants, 5,151 (36.7%) were women, and the median age for participants was 66.5 years. For the principal effectiveness endpoint of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism, no significant differences were observed between the NOACs compared with treatment with warfarin.

### Eliquis [^114DeRbj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Overdose of Eliquis increases the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

In controlled clinical trials, orally administered apixaban in healthy subjects at doses up to 50 mg daily for 3 to 7 days (25 mg twice daily for 7 days or 50 mg once daily for 3 days) had no clinically relevant adverse effects.

In healthy subjects, administration of activated charcoal 2 and 6 hours after ingestion of a 20-mg dose of apixaban reduced mean apixaban AUC by 50% and 27%, respectively. Thus, administration of activated charcoal may be useful in managing Eliquis overdose or accidental ingestion. An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of apixaban is available.

### Efficacy and safety considerations with dose-reduced direct oral anticoagulants: A review [^114pb5s3]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Dose-reduced regimens of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) may be used for two main purposes: dose-adjusted treatment intended as full-intensity anticoagulation (e.g. for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation [AF] in patients requiring dose reduction) or low-intensity treatment (e.g. extended-duration treatment of venous thromboembolism [VTE]). We reviewed randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to understand the scenarios in which dose-adjusted or low-intensity DOACs were tested and reviewed the labeled indications by regulatory authorities, using data from large registries to assess whether the use of dose-reduced DOACs in routine practice aligned with the findings of RCTs.

- **Observations**: Among 4,191 screened publications, 35 RCTs that used dose-adjusted DOACs were identified for dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban. Of these 35 RCTs, 29 were related to stroke prevention in AF. Efficacy and safety results for dose-adjusted DOACs in large RCTs of AF were similar to those found for full-dose DOACs. To our knowledge, dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban have not been studied as dose-adjusted therapy for acute VTE treatment. Low-intensity DOACs were identified in 37 RCTs. Low-intensity DOACs may be used for extended-duration treatment of VTE (apixaban and rivaroxaban), primary prevention in orthopedic surgeries (dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban), primary prevention in ambulatory high-risk cancer patients (apixaban and rivaroxaban), or (post-discharge) high-risk medical patients (rivaroxaban) in stable atherosclerotic vascular disease or following a recent event.

### Benefits and harms of standard versus reduced-dose direct oral anticoagulant therapy for older adults with multiple morbidities and atrial fibrillation [^1178Ved8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

No major changes in results were identified in sensitivity or stability analyses, though the association between standard dosing and major bleeding increased when censoring upon switch between DOAC dose (HR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.09–1.49]) (Tables S8 and S9). The E-value for the CI for bleeding was 1.21, signifying that an unmeasured confounder would have to increase the relative risk of bleeding by 21% independently of all measured confounders and increase the probability of being prescribed reduced DOAC dosing by 21%.

- **Effectiveness outcomes**: Overall, 6150 residents died during an average of 0.67 (SD 0.36) years of follow‐up (overall event rate 41.8 per 100 PY). After weighting, standard dose therapy was not associated with all‐cause mortality (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.92–1.06]; weighted rates for standard versus reduced dosing: 45.1 versus 45.6 deaths per 100 PY) (Figure 2). For the composite effectiveness outcome (acute myocardial infarction, systemic embolism, stroke, transient ischemic attack, venous thromboembolism), there were 820 thrombotic events over a mean follow‐up of 0.67 (SD 0.34) years (overall event rate 5.7 per 100 PY). After weighting, there was no significant association between DOAC dose and thrombotic events (HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.96–1.41]; weighted rates for standard versus reduced dosing: 6.4 versus 5.5 events per 100 PY). Subgroup results for mortality outcomes were similar to the primary analysis. In contrast, for thrombotic risk, HRs were much closer to the null value when estimating the association of standard versus reduced dose for those under 80.

### Milvexian vs apixaban for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: The LIBREXIA atrial fibrillation trial rationale and design [^116c5Abg]. American Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants are the standard of care for stroke prevention in eligible patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter; however, bleeding remains a significant concern, limiting their use. Milvexian is an oral Factor XIa inhibitor that may offer similar anticoagulant efficacy with less bleeding risk.

- **Methods**: LIBREXIA AF (NCT05757869) is a global phase III, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, event-driven trial to compare milvexian with apixaban in participants with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Participants are randomly assigned to milvexian 100 mg or apixaban (5 mg or 2.5 mg per label indication) twice daily. The primary efficacy objective is to evaluate if milvexian is noninferior to apixaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism. The principal safety objective is to evaluate if milvexian is superior to apixaban in reducing the endpoint of International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) major bleeding events and the composite endpoint of ISTH major and clinically relevant nonmajor (CRNM) bleeding events. In total, 15,500 participants from approximately 1,000 sites in over 30 countries are planned to be enrolled. They will be followed until both 430 primary efficacy outcome events and 530 principal safety events are observed, which is estimated to take approximately 4 years.

- **Conclusion**: The LIBREXIA AF study will determine the efficacy and safety of the oral Factor XIa inhibitor milvexian compared with apixaban in participants with either atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.

### Apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation [^1158bzAp]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). High credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists have been shown to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, many patients are not suitable candidates for, or are unwilling to receive vitamin K antagonist therapy, and these patients have a high risk of stroke. Apixaban, a novel factor Xa inhibitor, may be an alternative treatment for such patients.

- **Methods**: In a double-blind study, we randomly assigned 5599 patients with atrial fibrillation who were at increased risk for stroke and for whom vitamin K antagonist therapy was unsuitable to receive apixaban (at a dose of 5 mg twice daily) or aspirin (81 to 324 mg per day), to determine whether apixaban was superior. The mean follow-up period was 1.1 years. The primary outcome was the occurrence of stroke or systemic embolism.

- **Results**: Before enrollment, 40% of the patients had used a vitamin K antagonist. The data and safety monitoring board recommended early termination of the study because of a clear benefit in favor of apixaban. There were 51 primary outcome events (1.6% per year) among patients assigned to apixaban and 113 (3.7% per year) among those assigned to aspirin (hazard ratio with apixaban, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.62; P < 0.001). The rates of death were 3.5% per year in the apixaban group and 4.4% per year in the aspirin group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.02; P = 0.07). There were 44 cases of major bleeding (1.4% per year) in the apixaban group and 39 (1.2% per year) in the aspirin group (hazard ratio with apixaban, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.75; P = 0.57).

### Validity of different dose reduction criteria for apixaban [^115wTVeE]. American Heart Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Reduced-dose apixaban is recommended in patients fulfilling two of three criteria: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, and serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL. However, patient weight is often not available in electronic health data. We examined the validity of alternative definitions based on age and renal function alone, using an observational dataset of patients with atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease which included weight measurements.

### Betrixaban compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation: Results of a phase 2, randomized, dose-ranging study (Explore-Xa) [^112Vzix8]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an arrhythmia that affects an estimated 7 million people in the United States and the European Union, with a median age of 75 years. The greatest risk associated with AF is ischaemic stroke resulting from the embolism of thrombus from the left atrium. Guidelines recommend treatment with a vitamin K antagonist for stroke prevention in patients with AF based on the results of randomized, controlled trials comparing warfarin with placebo or no warfarin.

Use of warfarin is challenging because it has an unpredictable anticoagulant effect, a high propensity for food and drug interactions, and a risk of significant bleeding. A recent meta-analysis of contemporary randomized clinical trials, comprising over 50,000 patient-years on warfarin, revealed major bleeding rates ranging from 1.4% to 3.4% per year and are likely higher outside the confines of a clinical trial. Routine coagulation monitoring is required, which is inconvenient for patients and costly for the healthcare system.

Thrombin plays a key role in arterial and venous thromboses by activating platelets and facilitating the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Recently, dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, has been shown to be superior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke with improved ease of use and is available in many countries. Factor Xa is also an attractive target for anticoagulant therapy as it is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Rivaroxaban and apixaban, factor Xa inhibitors, have been shown to be effective for stroke prevention.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114Trmfb]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding atrial fibrillation, particularly for patients with chronic liver disease, the 2024 ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS guidelines recommend considering the initiation of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) over warfarin. Specifically, any DOAC is suggested for Child-Pugh class A, and apixaban, dabigatran, or edoxaban are recommended for Child-Pugh class B. This applies to patients with AF at an increased risk of systemic thromboembolism and mild-to-moderate liver disease (Child-Pugh class A or B) who are candidates for anticoagulation.

### Initial apixaban dosing in patients with atrial fibrillation [^1162jZuf]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Apixaban is a non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant approved for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). Labeling recommends dose reduction based on patient age, weight, and renal function. The aim of this study was to analyze adherence to labeling instructions concerning initial apixaban dosing in clinical practice and identify factors associated with inappropriate dose reduction.

- **Methods**: Patients with AF initiated on apixaban in 2016 were identified in the Heart Center Leipzig database. Records were screened to identify patient characteristics, prescribed apixaban dose, renal function, and further dosing-relevant secondary diagnoses and co-medication.

- **Results**: We identified 569 consecutive patients with AF initiated on apixaban. In 301 (52.9%) patients, apixaban was prescribed in a standard dose (5mg b.i.d.), and in 268 (47.1%) in a reduced dose (2.5mg b.i.d.). Of the 268 patients receiving a reduced dose, 163 (60.8%) did not meet labeling criteria for dose reduction. In univariate and multivariate regression analysis, age (OR: 0.736, 95% CI: 0.664–0.816, P < 0.0001), patient weight (OR: 1.120, 95% CI: 1.076–1.166, P < 0.0001), and serum creatinine level (OR: 0.910, 95% CI: 0.881–0.940, P < 0.0001) were independent predictors for apixaban underdosage.

- **Conclusions**: In clinical practice, apixaban dosing is frequently inconsistent with labeling. Factors associated with inappropriate dose reduction are age, patient weight, and serum creatinine level, which are the same factors used as criteria for dosing.

### Association between edoxaban dose, concentration, anti-factor Xa activity, and outcomes: an analysis of data from the randomised, double-blind ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^113mcKK9]. Lancet (2015). Low credibility.

New oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation were developed to be administered in fixed doses, eliminating the need for routine monitoring that has hindered the usage and acceptance of vitamin K antagonists. However, a concern has arisen that measuring drug concentration or anticoagulant activity may be necessary to prevent excess drug concentrations, which can significantly increase bleeding risk. In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial, higher-dose and lower-dose edoxaban were compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation. Each regimen included a 50% dose reduction in patients with clinical features known to increase edoxaban drug exposure. The aim was to assess whether adjusting the edoxaban dose in this trial prevented excess drug concentration and the risk of bleeding events.

- **Methods**: Data from the randomised, double-blind ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial were analysed. Edoxaban dose, plasma concentration, and anti-Factor Xa (FXa) activity were correlated, and efficacy and safety outcomes were compared with warfarin, stratified by dose reduction status. Patients with atrial fibrillation and at moderate to high risk of stroke were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either warfarin (adjusted to an international normalised ratio of 2.0–3.0), higher-dose edoxaban (60 mg once daily), or lower-dose edoxaban (30 mg once daily). Randomisation was performed using a central, 24-hour, interactive, computerised response system. International normalised ratio was measured using an encrypted point-of-care device. To maintain masking, sham international normalised ratio was employed.

### Apixaban dosing in hemodialysis - can drug level monitoring mitigate controversies [^116ezdQy]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

In our study examining drug levels over time, we did not observe signs of accumulation in 25 cases that provided at least two measurements (see Fig. 2). The first drug level measurement for these patients occurred at a median (interquartile range [IQR]) of 14 (8–30) days after the initiation of apixaban, with data available for 15 cases. The total follow-up time had a median (IQR) of 12 (2–16) months and ranged from 1 to 51 months, according to available data for all cases.

- **Figure 2**: Apixaban level (all) of each participant over time.
	- **Legend**: Serial drug level monitoring from 25 hemodialysis patients, each providing between 2 and 17 drug levels. The first drug level measurement took place at a median (IQR) of 14 (8–30) days after the initiation of apixaban, with a total follow-up time of 12 (2–16) months intake (available data for all cases).

When comparing drug levels, Figures 3 and Table 4 display scatter plots of our drug levels relative to the 10th to 90th and 5th to 95th percentiles of drug levels from non-chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients taking 5 mg of apixaban twice daily.

- **Figure 3**: Comparison of measured apixaban levels in our study with those from non-CKD patients taking therapeutic doses of 5 mg twice daily.
	- **Legend**: Cases 1–17 were on 2.5 mg once daily, and cases 18–31 were on 2.5 mg apixaban twice daily. Apixaban levels were measured pre-dialysis at the beginning of the week. Out of 143 samples, 85 were trough levels and 58 were random levels. Trough and random levels showed no significant differences. The lower detection limit of our assay was 40 ng/mL. Comparative confidence intervals and reference lines are delineated.

### Asundexian versus apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation [^111idcHj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The study OCEANIC-AF was published by Jonathan P. Piccini and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study addresses atrial fibrillation. The trial question in the OCEANIC-AF study was: What is the effect of asundexian in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) at risk of stroke? The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 14,810 patients (5,214 female and 9,596 male).

The inclusion criteria included adult patients with AF at risk of stroke. Key exclusion criteria were mechanical heart valve prosthesis, moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis, AF due to reversible causes, recent acute ischemic stroke, active bleeding, chronic bleeding disorder, history of non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and significant liver disease.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Asundexian**: n = 7,415 at an oral dose of 50 mg daily
	- **Apixaban**: n = 7,395 at an oral dose of 5 mg BID

- **Primary outcome**: A significant increase in stroke or systemic embolism (1.3% vs. 0.4%; HR 3.79, 95% CI 2.46 to 5.83).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant increase in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) or systemic embolism (1.3% vs. 0.3%; HR 4.38, 95% CI 2.76 to 6.96)
	- No significant difference in death from any cause (0.8% vs. 1%; HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.19)
	- Significant increase in AIS (1.1% vs. 0.3%; HR 4.06, 95% CI 2.52 to 6.54)

- **Safety outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in adverse events
	- Significant difference in major bleeding (0.2% vs. 0.7%)

In conclusion, the OCEANIC-AF study found that in adult patients with AF at risk of stroke, the use of asundexian compared to apixaban resulted in significant differences in stroke and systemic embolism outcomes.

### Apixaban versus no anticoagulation in patients undergoing long-term dialysis with incident atrial fibrillation [^113X4d5W]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

The relative efficacy and safety of apixaban compared with no anticoagulation have not been studied in patients on maintenance dialysis with atrial fibrillation. We aimed to determine whether apixaban is associated with better clinical outcomes compared with no anticoagulation in this population.

- **Design, setting, participants, and measurements**: This retrospective cohort study used 2012–2015 US Renal Data System data. Patients on maintenance dialysis with incident, nonvalvular atrial fibrillation treated with apixaban (521 patients) were matched for relevant baseline characteristics with patients not treated with any anticoagulant agent (1561 patients) using a propensity score. The primary outcome was hospital admission for a new stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), transient ischemic attack, or systemic thromboembolism. The secondary outcome was fatal or intracranial bleeding. Competing risk survival models were used.

- **Results**: Compared with no anticoagulation, apixaban was not associated with lower incidence of the primary outcome: hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.69 to 2.23; P = 0.47. A significantly higher incidence of fatal or intracranial bleeding was observed with apixaban compared with no treatment: hazard ratio, 2.74; 95% confidence interval, 1.37 to 5.47; P = 0.004. A trend toward fewer ischemic but more hemorrhagic strokes was seen with apixaban compared with no treatment. No significant difference in the composite outcome of myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke was seen with apixaban compared with no treatment.

### Off-label dosing of non-vitamin K-dependent oral antagonists in AF patients before and after stroke: results of the prospective multicenter Berlin Atrial Fibrillation Registry [^1127tDoV]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

An off-label daily dose was prescribed in 23 (20.7%) of 111 AF patients on rivaroxaban, with 5 (4.5%) patients being over-dosed [receiving 20 mg OD instead of 15 mg OD (n = 4) or 30 mg OD instead of 20 mg], and 19 (17.1%) patients being under-dosed (receiving 15 mg OD instead of 20 mg OD). Rivaroxaban under-dosing at hospital discharge after stroke was associated with age ≥ 80 years [OR 3.49, 95% CI 1.24–9.84, P = 0.02].

An off-label daily dose was prescribed in 74 (16.1%) of 459 AF patients on apixaban, with 18 (3.9%) patients being over-dosed (receiving 5.0 mg TD instead of 2.5 mg TD), and with 56 (12.2%) patients being under-dosed (receiving 2.5 mg TD instead of 5 mg TD). Apixaban under-dosing at hospital discharge after stroke was associated with body weight ≤ 60 kg [OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01–0.47, P < 0.01], CHA2DS2-VASc score [OR per point 1.47, 95% CI 1.08–2.00, P = 0.01], and HAS-BLED score [OR per point 1.91, 95% CI 1.28–2.84, P < 0.01].

### Apixaban in patients at risk of stroke undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation [^112P6ykB]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of continuous apixaban in patients undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation. Traditionally, atrial fibrillation ablation is performed with continuous anticoagulation, but continuous apixaban has not been previously tested.

The study was designed as a prospective, open, multi-centre trial with blinded outcome assessment, comparing continuous apixaban (5 mg b.i.d.) to vitamin K antagonists (VKA, with an international normalized ratio of 2–3). The primary outcome was a composite of death, stroke, or bleeding as defined by the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium criteria 2–5.

In a subset of the study, high-resolution brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to quantify acute brain lesions, and cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at baseline and at the end of follow-up.

Overall, 674 patients (median age 64 years, 33% female, 42% with non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation from 49 sites) were randomized. Out of these, 633 received the study drug and underwent ablation, and 335 patients underwent MRI (across 25 sites, with 323 analysable scans).

- **Primary outcome**: The primary outcome was observed in 22 out of 318 patients randomized to the apixaban group, and in 23 out of 315 randomized to the VKA group, resulting in a difference of −0.38% [90% confidence interval (CI) −4.0%, 3.3%], with the non-inferiority P = 0.0002 at the pre-specified absolute margin of 0.075. This composite outcome included 2 (0.3%) deaths, 2 (0.3%) strokes, and 24 (3.8%) ISTH major bleeds.

- **Acute brain lesions**: Acute small brain lesions were found in a similar number of patients in each arm [apixaban 44/162 (27.2%); VKA 40/161 (24.8%); P = 0.64].

- **Cognitive function**: Cognitive function showed improvement at the end of follow-up with a median increase of 1 MoCA unit (P = 0.005), and there were no significant differences between the study groups.

In conclusion, continuous apixaban is safe and effective for patients undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation at risk of stroke.

### Apixaban in patients at risk of stroke undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation [^116LitHV]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

It is recommended to perform atrial fibrillation ablation with continuous anticoagulation. However, continuous apixaban has not been thoroughly tested in this context.

- **Methods and results**: A prospective, open, multi-centre study with blinded outcome assessment was conducted to compare continuous apixaban (5mg b.i.d.) to vitamin K antagonists (VKA, international normalized ratio 2–3) in atrial fibrillation patients at risk of stroke. The primary outcome was a composite of death, stroke, or bleeding as defined by the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 2–5. Additionally, a high-resolution brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sub-study quantified acute brain lesions. Cognitive function was assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at baseline and at the end of follow-up. Overall, 674 patients (median age 64 years, 33% female, 42% with non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, across 49 sites) were randomized; 633 received the study drug and underwent ablation. Among these, 335 participants undertook MRI scans at 25 sites, resulting in 323 analysable scans. The primary outcome occurred in 22 out of 318 patients randomized to apixaban and in 23 out of 315 randomized to VKA, with a difference of -0.38% [90% confidence interval (CI) -4.0%, 3.3%], demonstrating non-inferiority (P = 0.0002) at the pre-specified absolute margin of 0.075. This included 2 (0.3%) deaths, 2 (0.3%) strokes, and 24 (3.8%) ISTH major bleeds. Acute small brain lesions were found in a similar number of patients in each group [apixaban 44/162 (27.2%); VKA 40/161 (24.8%); P = 0.64]. Cognitive function improved at the conclusion of the follow-up, with a median increase of 1 MoCA unit (P = 0.005), with no significant differences observed between the study groups.

- **Conclusions**: Continuous apixaban is safe and effective for patients undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116oV7Wb]. Chest (2018). High credibility.

The risk of stroke varies among different groups of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), depending on the presence of various stroke risk factors. We provide recommendations for antithrombotic treatment based on net clinical benefit for patients with AF at varying levels of stroke risk and in several common clinical scenarios.

- **Methods**: Systematic literature reviews were conducted to identify relevant articles published since the last formal search performed for the "Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines" (9th Edition). The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were drafted, voted on, and revised until consensus was reached.

- **Results**: For patients with AF without valvular heart disease, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at low risk of stroke (e.g. CHA₂DS₂-VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 (doubled), diabetes, stroke (doubled)-vascular disease, age 65–74 and sex category (female)] score of 0 in males or 1 in females), we suggest no antithrombotic therapy. The next step is to consider stroke prevention (i.e. oral anticoagulation therapy) for patients with one or more non-sex CHA₂DS₂-VASc stroke risk factors. For patients with a single non-sex CHA₂DS₂-VASc stroke risk factor, we suggest oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy.

### The 2020 Canadian Cardiovascular Society/Canadian Heart Rhythm Society comprehensive guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation [^111c9caA]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, specifically concerning anticoagulant therapy, the CCS/CHRS 2020 guidelines recommend preferring DOACs (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban) over warfarin in most patients with NVAF.

### Halcion [^112yvdqX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The recommended dosage for adults is 0.25 mg once daily before bedtime, with a maximum of 0.5 mg once daily. For geriatric patients, the starting dosage is 0.125 mg once daily, which may be increased to 0.25 mg if there is no response. Geriatric patients should not exceed 0.25 mg once daily.

Prescriptions for Halcion should not exceed a 1-month supply. The use of Halcion for more than 3 weeks requires evaluation for an underlying psychiatric or medical condition [see warnings and precautions (5.4, 5.6)].

- **Dosing information**: The recommended dosage is 0.25 mg once daily before bedtime. For some patients, such as those with low body weight, 0.125 mg once daily may suffice. The maximum recommended dosage is 0.5 mg once daily for patients who do not respond to a lower dose. It is crucial to use the lowest effective dose due to significant dose-related adverse reactions.

- **Use in geriatric patients**: For geriatric patients, the dosage ranges from 0.125 mg to 0.25 mg once daily, starting at 0.125 mg. The 0.25 mg dose is reserved for those who do not respond to a lower dose. The maximum recommended dosage remains 0.25 mg once daily. Elderly patients have a higher risk of dose-related adverse reactions [see use in specific populations (8.5)].

Prescriptions should be written for short-term use, typically 7 to 10 days, and should not exceed a 1-month supply.

### Effectiveness and safety of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban versus warfarin in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^117XwMzg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

We used the fill dates and days supplied per prescription to determine patients' treatment episodes, defined as the period from the fill date to the date when there were no residual days of supply. A gap of a maximum of 30 days between treatment episodes was allowed; patients were considered to be continuing on treatment as long as they had another medication fill within 30 days of the end of the last treatment episode. The allowable gap in treatment varied in previous observational NOAC comparison studies, ranging from 3 to 60 days. We chose 30 days instead of a longer gap (e.g. 60 days) because oral anticoagulants, especially NOACs, have a short half-life. A shorter allowable gap increased the likelihood that patients were indeed on treatment. We did not choose a shorter gap such as 3 days because, in reality, a short gap in treatment often reflects imperfect adherence to treatment rather than full discontinuation during the gap. Patients may miss a few pills from time to time, and some patients may intentionally miss or split pills as a cost-saving strategy; however, when patients had a 1-month gap, their adherence since the last prescription fill (measured by proportion of days covered) would fall to 50% to 75%, depending on whether the last fill was a 30- or 90-day supply. Consequently, we chose 1 month as the allowable gap. We conducted additional sensitivity tests to change the allowable gap to 7 days, and the findings remained largely the same.

### Frequency and outcomes of reduced dose non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants: Results from ORBIT-AF II (The Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation II) [^114ok5vw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The study included patients treated with NOACs who had follow-up data available. Patients without NOAC dosing information, those with dosing other than standard or reduced dose (e.g. NOAC every other day), and patients on warfarin were excluded. The group was then stratified by NOAC dosing — standard or reduced: for dabigatran, 150 mg (standard) and 75 mg (reduced) twice daily; rivaroxaban 20 mg (standard) and 15 mg (reduced) daily; apixaban 5 mg (standard) and 2.5 mg (reduced) twice daily; and edoxaban 60 mg (standard) and 30 mg (reduced) daily.

In addition, dosing at the patient level (for standard and reduced groups) was categorized as appropriate or inappropriate based on the approved FDA labeling for each agent. This included assessments of renal function, as well as weight, age, and chronic concomitant medications (where applicable). Patients for whom the selected NOAC was contraindicated were classified as off-label (e.g. patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis or those with preserved renal function receiving edoxaban, which is contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance > 95 mL/min).

Raw and adjusted clinical event rates were calculated and compared across dosing strata. These included thromboembolic events (stroke, non–central nervous system embolism, transient ischemic attack), myocardial infarction, major bleeding, bleeding hospitalization, death, and the composite of major adverse cardiovascular and neurological events (transient ischemic attack, stroke, non–central nervous system embolism).

### Risk of major bleeding, stroke/systemic embolism, and death associated with different oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation and severe chronic kidney disease [^114XF3cU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

We performed subgroup analyses for the comparison between apixaban and warfarin but not for the comparison between rivaroxaban and warfarin due to the limited number of rivaroxaban users. For these analyses, we evaluated the risks in the following prespecified subgroups: age (< 80 versus ≥ 80 years), sex (men versus women), HAS-BLED score (< 3 versus ≥ 3), and CHA2DS2-VASc score (< 4 versus ≥ 4: the mean). To formally test for statistically significant differences between subgroups, we included an indicator for the treatment, an indicator for the subgroup, and a product term of these two indicators, with a P value < 0.05 for the latter indicative of significant effect modification.

A series of sensitivity analyses were conducted:

- **Comparison of apixaban and rivaroxaban**: First, we performed an analysis using similar methods as described above to compare the risks of the outcomes between apixaban and rivaroxaban.

- **Hospitalizations for bleeding**: Second, hospitalizations for bleeding at any site were included in the analysis.

- **Negative control outcome analysis**: Third, we chose pneumonia as a negative control outcome and repeated the analysis because there is no known effect of oral anticoagulants on pneumonia. The purpose of this negative control outcome analysis was to assess the presence of residual/unmeasured confounding.

- **Separate drug dose comparisons**: Fourth, we conducted separate comparisons of standard-dose apixaban (5 mg twice daily) and reduced-dose apixaban (2.5 mg twice daily) with warfarin. Reduced-dose rivaroxaban (15 mg once daily) was compared with warfarin, as a dose reduction is recommended for this patient population.

- **Exclusion of initial overdose cases**: Fifth, we repeated the analyses after excluding patients whose initial dosages of apixaban were not in accordance with the recommended standards.

### Apixaban dosing in hemodialysis - can drug level monitoring mitigate controversies [^116HEfnW]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Our investigation provides evidence that drug levels from hemodialysis patients taking 2.5 mg apixaban twice daily are approximately comparable to those from non-CKD populations taking the same reduced dose, but are lower compared to non-CKD populations taking the standard dose of 5 mg twice daily. Individual under-dosing needs consideration, particularly with 2.5 mg twice daily and even more so with 2.5 mg once daily dosing. There is considerable inter- and intra-individual variability. Higher drug levels and concomitant antiplatelet therapy might result in higher risks of bleeding.

Target ranges for apixaban drug levels do not exist, and the correlation between drug levels and bleeding is poor. However, in light of contradictory recommendations and challenging risk-benefit analyses regarding anticoagulation in patients on hemodialysis, drug level monitoring can be a contributory tool, particularly for detecting drug levels at the edges of the spectrum (e.g. below detection limit or beyond the 95th percentile of non-CKD reference populations). Our study provides valuable practical guidance to improve safety and appropriate dosing in hemodialysis patients on apixaban.
