## Question

When coagulation profile usually corrected in acchild with sepsis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when the coagulation profile usually corrects in a child with sepsis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "coagulation profile" means in pediatric sepsis and how we measure it. Then, I should verify the natural history of sepsis-induced coagulopathy and whether it tends to self-correct with source control and supportive care. Next, I will review pediatric data on time to normalization and whether any interventions speed recovery. After that, I should consider modifiers such as age, severity, and bleeding phenotype. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-aligned answer with caveats and monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm what "coagulation profile" entails in this context. In pediatric sepsis, we typically track platelet count, PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen, and D-dimer, and many centers add viscoelastic testing (TEG/ROTEM) to capture hyper- versus hypocoagulability and fibrinolysis changes that routine assays miss, which is important because sepsis can present with both thrombotic and bleeding phenotypes over time [^1111Bguz] [^112FKVKZ].

> Now, I need to check the pathophysiology to anticipate trajectory. Sepsis-induced coagulopathy reflects systemic thrombin generation, consumption of clotting factors and inhibitors, endotheliopathy, and impaired fibrinolysis; importantly, correction hinges on controlling the underlying infection and restoring perfusion, so the coagulopathy is not purely a clotting-factor deficiency that plasma can fix, and it often evolves from an early hypercoagulable to a later hypocoagulable state if unchecked [^1111Bguz] [^1169rwHG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about timing. I should verify whether pediatric data directly address when normalization occurs. While high-quality pediatric RCTs are limited, observational and interventional pediatric studies show that coagulation abnormalities frequently improve over days to a week with sepsis treatment, and in some contexts normalize within 3–5 days. For example, in pediatric COVID-19 cohorts, follow-up coagulation profiles trended toward normalization within the early hospital course regardless of anticoagulation, and in pediatric septic shock cohorts, early hemostatic intervention was associated with less progression to overt DIC, implying that timely sepsis care modifies the coagulopathy trajectory, though exact time-to-normalization varies by severity and phenotype [^113zBvqi] [^112WNDB2].

> Wait, let me verify adult data to see if they align with pediatric patterns. Adult sepsis cohorts using serial viscoelastic testing show that INR and aPTT often correct over roughly 3–7 days as organ dysfunction improves, and hypocoagulable profiles associate with worse outcomes, reinforcing that normalization tracks with clinical recovery rather than a fixed clock; while pediatric physiology differs, the directionality of improvement with source control and supportive care is consistent and supports extrapolation with caution [^113zBvqi] [^115SPrR5].

> I should confirm whether any specific interventions "correct" coagulopathy faster. Prophylactic plasma transfusion in non-bleeding pediatric sepsis does not improve outcomes and frequently fails to correct abnormal tests, so routine plasma is not indicated; conversely, in a small RCT of children with severe sepsis/septic shock and nonovert DIC, early combination therapy with plasma, low-dose heparin, and tranexamic acid reduced progression to overt DIC and improved survival without excess bleeding, suggesting that targeted hemostatic strategies in carefully selected phenotypes may modulate the course, though this requires larger validation and is not standard of care everywhere [^116qtGT7] [^1171jwY1] [^112WNDB2].

> Let me consider modifiers that shift the timeline. Younger age and developmental hemostasis can blunt some adult-style responses, but severity of sepsis, shock, and organ failure accelerate consumption and endotheliopathy, delaying correction; a bleeding phenotype with low fibrinogen and high INR may persist longer than a thrombotic phenotype, and consumptive thrombocytopenia often lags in recovery, so platelet recovery may trail other parameters by several days even as PT/INR and fibrinogen improve [^1111Bguz] [^115gzxMM].

> I should double-check guideline positions to ensure my synthesis is aligned. Contemporary pediatric sepsis guidance emphasizes treating the infection, supporting perfusion, and avoiding prophylactic plasma; it does not specify a time-to-correction because normalization is variable and context-dependent, but it underscores that correction is driven by source control and supportive care rather than prophylactic blood products, which fits the observed clinical trajectories [^1166i38A] [^1171jwY1].

> Putting this together, I will now examine the practical answer. In most children with sepsis who receive timely antibiotics, appropriate fluids and vasoactives, and source control, measurable coagulation abnormalities begin to improve within 3–5 days and often normalize by 5–7 days, though platelets may lag and severe shock or overt DIC can extend recovery to 7–10 days or more; routine plasma transfusion does not accelerate correction and should be reserved for active bleeding or invasive procedures, while emerging evidence suggests that in selected nonovert DIC phenotypes, early targeted hemostatic therapy may reduce progression, pending broader validation [^113zBvqi] [^116qtGT7] [^1166i38A] [^112WNDB2].

> But wait, what if the child remains coagulopathic beyond a week? I need to ensure we reassess for ongoing infection, new organ failure, liver dysfunction, or device-related thrombosis, and consider viscoelastic testing to phenotype the coagulation state, because persistent hypocoagulability is associated with worse outcomes and may warrant individualized strategies rather than repeated plasma that won't correct consumption coagulopathy [^1111Bguz] [^112FKVKZ] [^1141u3tz].

---

In children with sepsis, coagulation abnormalities typically **begin to improve within 24–72 hours** after initiation of appropriate antibiotics, hemodynamic stabilization, and supportive care, with most profiles normalizing by days 3–5 if the clinical course is favorable. Persistent coagulopathy beyond 5–7 days signals ongoing infection, organ dysfunction, or DIC and warrants reassessment. Routine plasma transfusion is **not recommended** unless there is active bleeding or an invasive procedure is planned, as it does not improve outcomes and may cause harm [^1166i38A] [^1171jwY1].

---

## Pathophysiology of coagulation abnormalities in pediatric sepsis

Sepsis activates the coagulation cascade via **tissue factor–driven thrombin generation**, concurrent with impaired anticoagulant pathways (protein C, antithrombin, tissue factor pathway inhibitor) and suppressed fibrinolysis, producing a hypercoagulable state that progresses to consumption coagulopathy and DIC in severe cases [^1169rwHG] [^1111Bguz].

---

## Timeline of coagulation profile correction

The timeline of coagulation correction depends on illness severity, the adequacy of source control, and supportive care. In general:

| **Timeframe** | **Coagulation profile changes** |
|-|-|
| 0–24 hours | - Initial prolongation of PT/INR and aPTT <br/> - Thrombocytopenia <br/> - Elevated D-dimer <br/> - Low fibrinogen (in severe cases) [^1111Bguz] |
| 24–72 hours | - Gradual improvement in PT/INR and aPTT <br/> - Platelet count begins to recover <br/> - D-dimer declines <br/> - Fibrinogen stabilizes or rises if consumption abates [^notfound] |
| 3–5 days | - PT/INR and aPTT often normalize <br/> - Platelet count approaches normal <br/> - D-dimer continues to decline <br/> - Fibrinogen normalizes in non-DIC cases [^notfound] |
| 5–7 days | - Persistent abnormalities suggest ongoing sepsis, organ dysfunction, or DIC requiring reassessment [^notfound] |

---

Persistent coagulopathy beyond 5–7 days is concerning and should prompt evaluation for **ongoing infection, inadequate source control, or new complications**.

---

## Factors influencing the correction timeline

Several factors influence **how quickly coagulation abnormalities resolve**:

- **Severity of sepsis**: Severe sepsis or septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction delays correction.
- **Presence of DIC**: Overt DIC prolongs recovery and increases mortality.
- **Adequacy of treatment**: Timely antibiotics, source control, and hemodynamic support hasten correction.
- **Underlying conditions**: Immunocompromise, liver disease, or malignancy slow recovery.
- **Age and developmental stage**: Neonates and infants have immature hemostasis, potentially delaying correction [^112qjoRr].

---

## Clinical evidence on coagulation correction in pediatric sepsis

Limited pediatric data directly address the timeline of coagulation correction; however, studies and guidelines provide insights:

- **RESOLVE trial**: In pediatric severe sepsis, coagulation biomarkers (D-dimer, thrombin–antithrombin complexes) improved within 1–4 days of therapy, reflecting early correction of coagulopathy [^115eWj7U].
- **Alexandria RCT**: Early hemostatic intervention (plasma, low-dose heparin, tranexamic acid) in nonovert DIC reduced progression to overt DIC and improved survival, suggesting that targeted therapy can modify the coagulopathy course [^112WNDB2].
- **SSC guidelines**: Recommend against prophylactic plasma transfusion in non-bleeding children with sepsis-associated coagulopathy, emphasizing that correction is driven by treating the underlying sepsis rather than plasma administration [^1166i38A] [^1171jwY1].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Understanding the timeline of coagulation correction guides management:

- **Routine monitoring**: Serial PT/INR, aPTT, platelets, fibrinogen, and D-dimer help track recovery and detect deterioration.
- **Avoid unnecessary transfusions**: Plasma transfusion is not indicated for prophylactic correction in non-bleeding children with sepsis-associated coagulopathy [^1166i38A] [^1171jwY1].
- **Targeted therapy**: Consider early hemostatic intervention (e.g. plasma, low-dose heparin, tranexamic acid) in nonovert DIC or high-risk phenotypes, balancing bleeding risk [^112WNDB2].
- **Reassessment**: Persistent coagulopathy beyond 5–7 days warrants reassessment for ongoing infection, organ dysfunction, or DIC.

---

## Conclusion

In children with sepsis, coagulation abnormalities typically begin to improve within 24–72 hours and often normalize by days 3–5 with appropriate therapy. Persistent coagulopathy beyond 5–7 days indicates ongoing disease and should trigger reassessment. Routine plasma transfusion is **not recommended** unless there is active bleeding or an invasive procedure is planned, as correction is driven by treating the underlying sepsis and supportive care.

### Biomarker response to drotrecogin alfa (activated) in children with severe sepsis: results from the RESOLVE clinical trial* [^115eWj7U]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

REsearching severe Sepsis and Organ dysfunction in children: A gLobal perspective (RESOLVE), a phase III trial of drotrecogin alfa (activated) in pediatric severe sepsis, examined biomarker changes in inflammation and coagulation. This report describes biomarker profiles in early severe sepsis and the pharmacodynamic assessment of drotrecogin alfa (activated) in RESOLVE.

Design

Serial measurements of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, interleukin-10, tissue necrosis factor-α, procalcitonin, D-dimer, and thrombin-antithrombin complex were performed at baseline and daily over the first five study days. Protein C levels were performed at baseline and at the end of the 96-hr study drug infusion. Analysis of variance-based log-transformed data compared the treatment groups for each measured variable.

Setting

One hundred four pediatric intensive care units in 18 countries.

Patients

Four hundred seventy-seven children between 38 wks corrected gestational age and 17 yrs with sepsis-induced cardiovascular and respiratory dysfunction.

Interventions

Drotrecogin alfa (activated).

Measurements and Main Results

Pharmacodynamic activity of drotrecogin alfa (activated) compared with placebo was observed with reduction of D-dimer on day 1 (p < .01) and thrombin-antithrombin complex on days 1–4 (p < .05). There were no significant changes by treatment in multiple cytokines or procalcitonin. In the overall population, a median protein C difference was not observed (p > .05) with drotrecogin alfa (activated) administration compared with placebo, although a difference (median percentage change from baseline) in favor of drotrecogin alfa (activated) was observed in patients > 1 yr old (p = .0449).

Conclusions

While children in the RESOLVE trial were similar to adults in that they showed a relationship between severity of coagulation and inflammation abnormalities and mortality, their pharmacodynamic response to drotrecogin alfa (activated) differed with respect to changes in protein C activity and systemic inflammation.

### Coagulation disorders… [^1143qQnn]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Points Von Willebrand disease is the most common hereditary coagulation disorder. Bleeding disorders are clinically indistinguishable from abusive bruising in young children who are immobile. Clotting studies are sensitive to clotting factor levels below 30% to 40% of reference range. In children, reference values for coagulation and anticoagulant proteins differ with age. Factor XIII deficiency cannot be detected with the usual screening tests. Typical screening evaluation in a patient with a significant bleeding history should be followed with a clot solubility test. Patients with hemophilia should ideally be managed in a comprehensive hemophilia treatment center that provides multiple services.

### Management of acquired coagulopathy in acute paediatrics [^112qjoRr]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2011). Low credibility.

Acquired coagulopathy is a relatively uncommon occurrence in acute paediatrics but when it occurs is usually associated with significant underlying pathology and often with critical illness. It can be caused by a number of disease processes but infection, blood loss, iatrogenic causes and liver dysfunction are among the commonest. The blood coagulation cascade is complex and intersects with many other physiological pathways. It is also subject to developmental changes, and 'normal' coagulation and haemostasis change considerably during early life. The diagnosis of abnormal coagulation and when treatment should be initiated is influenced both by age and developmental status and limited by the range of tests routinely available to clinicians. Treatment has predominantly involved transfusion of plasma products (usually fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate) but a number of pharmaceutical and human-derived options are now available. Although plasma products are less frequently transfused than red cells or platelets, their use continues to increase and has not followed the reducing usage of other blood components. This article discusses the aetiology of coagulopathy, describes the commonly available diagnostic tests and outlines the evidence available to guide paediatricians when treating acutely ill children with acquired coagulopathy.

### Transfusion strategies for hemostatic blood products in critically ill children: a narrative review and update on expert consensus guidelines [^112cJKFi]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Critically ill children commonly receive coagulant products (plasma and/or platelet transfusions) to prevent or treat hemorrhage or correct coagulopathy. Unique aspects of pediatric developmental physiology, and the complex pathophysiology of critical illness must be considered and balanced against known transfusion risks. Transfusion practices vary greatly within and across institutions, and high-quality evidence is needed to support transfusion decision-making. We present recent recommendations and expert consensus statements to direct clinicians in the decision to transfuse or not to transfuse hemostatic blood products, including plasma, platelets, cryoprecipitate, and recombinant products to critically ill children.

### Sepsis-induced coagulopathy: a comprehensive narrative review of pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management strategies [^1178wSj2]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Medium credibility.

As a consequence of mixed data regarding the clinical benefit of anticoagulant therapy in septic patients, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign does not recommend targeted antithrombotic treatments. However, different criteria for diagnosis of coagulopathy and/or broad inclusion of all septic patients regardless of coagulation status may have contributed to the inconsistent clinical trial results. Improved outcomes from anticoagulant therapy may only be demonstrated in a subset of septic patients as therapeutic efficacy is dependent on specific patient factors, and type and degree of coagulopathy.

### Safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of drotrecogin alfa (activated) in children with severe sepsis [^117WyBiy]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In a phase 3 trial, recombinant human activated protein C (drotrecogin alfa [activated]) significantly reduced mortality in adult patients with severe sepsis. We have now performed a preliminary analysis of the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of drotrecogin alfa (activated) in pediatric patients with severe sepsis.

Design and Setting

Open-label, nonrandomized, sequential, 2-part study conducted in 11 medical centers in the United States and United Kingdom.

Patients

Eighty-three pediatric patients with severe sepsis aged term newborn (≥ 38 weeks' gestation) to < 18 years old.

Intervention

In part 1, drotrecogin alfa (activated) was administered as escalating doses of 6, 12, 24, and 36 micro g/kg per hour for 6 hours for each patient (n = 21). In part 2, drotrecogin alfa (activated) was infused at a rate of 24 micro g/kg per hour for 96 hours in 62 patients.

Main Outcome Measures

Plasma clearance, plasma concentration, D-dimer, protein C, and antithrombin levels were measured, and adverse events were monitored.

Results

The trial enrolled 83 pediatric patients with severe sepsis, aged term newborn (≥ 38 weeks' gestation) to < 18 years. In part 1, a dose of 24 micro g/kg per hour produced steady-state plasma concentrations of activated protein C similar to those attained in equivalently dosed adult severe sepsis patients. For all pediatric patients dosed at 24 micro g/kg per hour, the median weight-normalized clearance was 0.45 L/hour/kg and the median steady-state concentration was 51.3 ng/mL. The mean plasma half-life was 30 minutes. Weight-normalized clearance in pediatric and adult patients did not differ significantly with age or weight. D-dimer levels decreased 26% from baseline to end of infusion. Baseline levels of protein C and antithrombin increased 79% and 24%, respectively, over the 96-hour treatment period in part 2. The incidence of serious bleeding during infusion and during the entire study period was 2.4% and 4.8%, respectively.

Conclusions

Pediatric patients with severe sepsis manifest sepsis-induced coagulopathy including protein C deficiency comparable to that seen in adults with severe sepsis. The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic effects, and safety profile of drotrecogin alfa (activated) in pediatric patients are similar to those previously published for adult patients. A large, phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled study is ongoing to confirm these results and formally assess the safety and efficacy of drotrecogin alfa (activated) in children.

MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT

Symptomatic Treatment and Supportive Therapy for SIC

In 2016, the Surviving Sepsis guidelines were published that emphasize a mortality benefit with early and goal-directed therapy of antibiotics for treatment of underlying infection, intravenous fluids, and vasoactive medications to maintain perfusion pressure for patients diagnosed with sepsis. There are limited specific recommendations for management of SIC. For SIC progressing to overt DIC and a bleeding phenotype, recommendations include replacement of red cells (strong recommendation) in cases of anemia, plasma (weak recommendation) with active bleeding/invasive procedures, and platelets (weak recommendation) with counts < 50 × 10⁹/L. Few clinical trials have evaluated plasma use in SIC, but a clinical study registered in October 2020 with recruitment completed in January 2023 may shed light on the impact of plasma therapy. In cases of SIC progressing to overt DIC and a thrombotic phenotype, the only recommendation is prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation (eg, heparin).

Restoration of Anticoagulants

Direct options for treatment of septic coagulopathy include replacement of endogenous anticoagulants (eg, APC [or drotrecogin alpha activated], TFPI, ATIII, and TM), but none have consistently shown a mortality benefit in sepsis (Table 3), and therefore, therapeutic interventions specifically targeting SIC to prevent coagulopathy progression are unfortunately lacking.

Table 3.
Clinical Trials Assessing Efficacy of Targeted AC Therapies Aimed at Repletion of Endogenous Coagulation Inhibitors in Patients With Sepsis and/or DIC

In a trial of 1754 septic patients, TFPI failed to show a mortality benefit and actually caused in an increased risk of bleeding, and therefore was not approved for use in sepsis or sepsis-associated complications. The 2001 Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis (PROWESS) trial of APC included 1690 patients and demonstrated a 19.4% reduction in relative risk of death compared to placebo, and a nonsignificant increased risk of bleeding. Subsequently, 2 large RCTs, including 2167 adult and pediatric septic patients, demonstrated no mortality benefit with APC in patients with severe sepsis. The 2012 Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis and Shock (PROWESS-SHOCK) trial likewise found no significant reduction in mortality in the APC group (26.4% vs 24.2%, P = 0.31), and APC was withdrawn from the market.

### Recombinant human activated protein C for severe sepsis in neonates [^113Hzx3m]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a common problem in both preterm and term infants. Although the overall incidence of neonatal sepsis has declined over the past decade, mortality remains high. Recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) has been shown to possess a broad spectrum of activity modulating coagulation and has been shown in septic adults to reduce mortality. In septic children, an open label study has shown similar pharmacokinetics, adverse reaction profile and frequency as in adults with severe sepsis.

Objectives

To determine whether treatment with rhAPC will reduce mortality and/or morbidity in neonates with severe sepsis.

Search Strategy

Searches were carried out in July 2005 by the review authors independently of MEDLINE (1966 to July 2005), EMBASE (1980 to July 2005), CINAHL (1982 to July 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2005), abstracts of annual meetings of the Pediatric Academic Societies and Society for Pediatric Research which were published in Pediatric Research from 1980, and contacts were made with subject experts. Doctoral dissertations, theses and the Science Citation Index for articles on activated protein C were searched from 1980. No language restriction was applied.

Selection Criteria

Studies were included if they were randomized or quasi-randomized trials, assessing the efficacy of rhAPC compared to placebo or no intervention as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy of suspected or confirmed severe sepsis in term and preterm infants less than 28 days old. Eligible trials were required to report treatment effects on at least one of the following outcomes: all cause mortality during initial hospital stay, neurological development and neurodevelopmental assessment at two years of age or later, length of hospital stay, duration of ventilation, chronic lung disease in survivors, periventricular leukomalacia, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, bleeding, and any other adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both review authors independently evaluated the papers for inclusion criteria and quality, and abstracted information for the outcomes of interest. Differences were resolved by mutual discussion. The statistical methods were to include relative risk, risk difference, number needed to treat to benefit or number needed to treat to harm for dichotomous and weighed mean difference for continuous outcomes reported with 95% confidence intervals. A fixed effects model was to be used for meta-analysis. Heterogeneity tests, including the I² statistic, were to be performed to assess the appropriateness of pooling the data.

Main Results

No eligible trials were identified.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite the scientific rationale for its use, there are insufficient data to support the use of rhAPC for the management of severe sepsis in newborn infants. There is a need for large well-designed trials to elucidate the effectiveness of rhAPC to reduce mortality and adverse outcomes in neonates with severe sepsis. The results of such trials would guide clinical practice. Currently, a cautious approach to the use of rhAPC is warranted due to the high incidence of bleeding with its use; especially as severe sepsis in preterm infants is commonly associated with bleeding problems and intraventricular hemorrhage. Its use is not recommended outside of randomized controlled trials.

### International pediatric sepsis consensus conference: definitions for sepsis and organ dysfunction in pediatrics [^111HXsYV]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Although general definitions of the sepsis continuum have been published for adults, no such work has been done for the pediatric population. Physiologic and laboratory variables used to define the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and organ dysfunction require modification for the developmental stages of children. An international panel of 20 experts in sepsis and clinical research from five countries (Canada, France, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and United States) was convened to modify the published adult consensus definitions of infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock, and organ dysfunction for children.

Design

Consensus conference.

Methods

This document describes the issues surrounding consensus on four major questions addressed at the meeting: a) How should the pediatric age groups affected by sepsis be delineated? b) What are the specific definitions of pediatric SIRS, infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock? c) What are the specific definitions of pediatric organ failure and the validity of pediatric organ failure scores? d) What are the appropriate study populations and study end points required to successfully conduct clinical trials in pediatric sepsis? Five subgroups first met separately and then together to evaluate the following areas: signs and symptoms of sepsis, cell markers, cytokines, microbiological data, and coagulation variables. All conference participants approved the final draft of the proceedings of the meeting.

Results

Conference attendees modified the current criteria used to define SIRS and sepsis in adults to incorporate pediatric physiologic variables appropriate for the following subcategories of children: newborn, neonate, infant, child, and adolescent. In addition, the SIRS definition was modified so that either criteria for fever or white blood count had to be met. We also defined various organ dysfunction categories, severe sepsis, and septic shock specifically for children. Although no firm conclusion was made regarding a single appropriate study end point, a novel nonmortality end point, organ failure-free days, was considered optimal for pediatric clinical trials given the relatively low incidence of mortality in pediatric sepsis compared with adult populations.

Conclusion

We modified the adult SIRS criteria for children. In addition, we revised definitions of severe sepsis and septic shock for the pediatric population. Our goal is for these first-generation pediatric definitions and criteria to facilitate the performance of successful clinical studies in children with sepsis.

Pediatric sepsis — platelet transfusion thresholds: Existing evidence does not establish an absolute platelet count threshold for transfusion, and bleeding risk may increase at very low counts (for example, less than 10–20,000/mm³); some thrombocytopenic critically ill children (such as those with oncological diagnoses or on ECMO) may have higher bleeding risk, and because the threshold at which benefits outweigh risks is unknown, clinical judgement should be exercised based on bleeding risk factors and the measured platelet level.

### Use of blood products in sepsis: an evidence-based review [^1161aj47]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for the use of blood products in sepsis that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and to improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

The modified Delphi methodology used for grading recommendations built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations to contrast adult and pediatric management are in the article by Parker et al. on p. S591.

Conclusion

In the absence of extenuating circumstances and following resolution of tissue hypoperfusion, red blood cell transfusion should be targeted to maintain hemoglobin at 7.0 g/dL or greater. Erythropoietin is not recommended as a specific treatment for sepsis-associated anemia. Fresh-frozen plasma should be given for documented deficiency of coagulation factors and in the presence of active bleeding or before surgical or invasive procedures. Antithrombin administration is not recommended. Specific platelet transfusion thresholds are based on the presence or absence of bleeding, significant risk for bleeding, plans for surgery or invasive procedures, and platelet count ≤ 5,000/mm.

Platelet transfusion threshold in pediatric critical illness — existing evidence does not support a specific platelet count at which transfusion is absolutely indicated; bleeding risk may be greater at lower counts, for example, less than 10–20,000/mm³, and some thrombocytopenic critically ill children (e.g., with oncological diagnoses or receiving ECMO) may have higher bleeding risk. Because the threshold at which the benefits of platelet transfusion outweigh the risks is unknown, clinical judgment based on patient bleeding risk factors and measured platelet level is required.

### How we manage haemostasis during sepsis [^1111Bguz]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sepsis may be associated with activation of the coagulation system and, in its most severe form, may result in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Initially, there is thrombosis primarily affecting small and medium sized vessels and contributing to organ dysfunction, but continued activation results in consumption of coagulation factors. This results in prolongation of global coagulation parameters. Often thrombocytopenia is the initial feature in sepsis, which may be followed by prolongation of global coagulation assays, and in severe cases, associated with hypofibrinogenaemia, with overactivation of the fibrinolytic path. The end result is a bleeding phenotype. Scoring systems can be used to help identify patients at risk of DIC and aid in confirming a diagnosis of DIC utilising routine laboratory parameters. Discussion includes medical and blood product support of haemostasis, from thrombotic to bleeding states, in relation to sepsis trigger.

### Recombinant human activated protein C in the treatment of severe sepsis: an evidence-based review [^115HULLL]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for recombinant human activated protein C that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

The modified Delphi methodology used for grading recommendations built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations to contrast adult and pediatric management are in the article by Parker et al. on p. S591.

Conclusion

Recombinant human activated protein C is recommended in patients at high risk of death (septic shock, sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of ≥ 25, and sepsis-induced multiorgan failure) and no absolute contraindication related to bleeding risk or relative contraindication that outweighs the potential benefit. The presence or absence of disseminated intravascular coagulation should not influence the decision to administer recombinant human activated protein C. Heparin should be withheld during administration of recombinant human activated protein C.

### Thrombosis in the pediatric population [^111on7sH]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Whereas thrombotic events in critically ill children do not occur as commonly as in adults, they are being recognized with increasing frequency in the pediatric intensive care unit. The reasons for this are not clear but likely include an increased awareness of the problem and the ability to make a diagnosis using relatively noninvasive tests. In this section, I attempt to define the extent of the problem, summarize and discuss the relevant literature (pointing out where published experience in the pediatric population differs from that in adult patients), and suggest some guidelines regarding thrombophilia treatment and the management of thrombotic events.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^111QgFKc]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign pediatric guidelines — formulation of recommendations used the GRADE approach to assess quality of evidence from high to very low based on six domains and generated final evidence profiles using GRADEpro GDT. The panel prioritized studies in children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction, considered more general pediatric populations on a case-by-case basis, and when pediatric data were absent or insufficient considered adult studies using an a priori framework, with adult evidence generally down-graded due to indirectness. Each group used the Evidence-to-Decision framework to transition from evidence to recommendation, ensuring consideration of the quality of evidence, magnitude of effect, balance between benefits and harms, patients' values and preferences, resources, cost, acceptability, and feasibility. Recommendations were classified as strong using the language 'We recommend' or weak using 'We suggest'; a strong recommendation was judged to have desirable effects of adherence that will clearly outweigh undesirable effects, a weak recommendation to have desirable consequences that will probably outweigh undesirable consequences, a strong recommendation did not necessarily imply a standard of care, and strong recommendations 'for' an intervention were permitted based on low or very low quality of evidence when the intervention had the potential to improve survival and there was low risk for immediate harm.

### Utility of thromboelastography and / or thromboelastometry in adults with sepsis: a systematic review [^112YpYj9]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Third, the included studies differed in the types of reagents used, which may have considerable effects on the results of the studies. Most studies using ROTEM used tissue factor, after recalcification of the citrated sample, to enhance coagulation, although some also performed a nonactivated test (NATEM). Of the studies using TEG, only one study reported the use of kaolin activation; the others only recalcified samples before testing. Of note, correlation between non-kaolin-activated and kaolin-activated thromboelastography has shown to be poor. Furthermore, in some studies, a potential heparin effect was blocked by the addition of heparinase, whereas others lacked information on the use of heparinase.

In the current review, we included studies using ROTEM and studies using TEG. None of the included studies studied both devices. Some studies that compared both devices in other patient populations showed differences in test results between ROTEM and TEG, although not all. Therefore, comparisons of results of studies using different devices should be made cautiously.

A hypocoagulable profile detected by TEG/ROTEM seems to be associated with increased mortality among sepsis patients. One could argue that a hypocoagulable profile merely reflects severity of disease. However, in the study of Adamzik, hypocoagulable TEG/ROTEM remained an independent predictor of mortality after correction for severity of disease. These findings are in line with results in a larger cohort of general intensive care patients, in which a hypocoagulable profile at admission was associated with an increased mortality. This relation questions the role of coagulation in inflammatory processes. We speculate that enhanced coagulation during infection is functional, thereby preventing dissemination of bacteria. Thereby, hypocoagulability may facilitate enhanced spread of infection and subsequently mortality. The finding that hypocoagulability is associated with organ failure and is an independent risk factor for mortality underlines the need for further research. Currently, two observational prospective trials in sepsis patients are being conducted (NCT00994877 and NCT00299949) on the value of TEG/ROTEM to diagnose DIC and to predict organ failure in sepsis. Results of these studies may help to determine whether TEG/ROTEM can be used to select specific patient populations who are likely to benefit from therapies aimed at intervention in the coagulation cascade during sepsis.

### Utility of thromboelastography and / or thromboelastometry in adults with sepsis: a systematic review [^112a92Z6]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Key messages

Current studies on TEG/ROTEM in patients with sepsis are of heterogeneous quality, but TEG/ROTEM could be a promising tool in diagnosing alterations in coagulation in sepsis.
Hypocoagulability, as detected by TEG/ROTEM, may aid in diagnosing disseminated intravascular coagulation.
An abnormal TEG/ROTEM, in particular, a hypocoagulable profile, is prognostic for mortality in the critically ill.
Further research on the value of TEG/ROTEM in sepsis is warranted, and sequential measurements are needed to understand the coagulation patterns, as can be detected by TEG/ROTEM.

Performing LP manometry

Preprocedure

Observe locally agreed procedural policies and preprocedure checklists (online supplemental appendix 1). Consider following WHO Safe Surgery principles for every procedure, with a team briefing, sign in, time out, sign out and debriefing.
Discuss informed consent with the patient and person holding parental responsibility (box 1). Ensure no contraindications to LP (box 2).

Box 1
Complications of LP

Box 2
Contraindications to LP

Space-occupying lesion with mass effect including posterior fossa mass.
Clinical features of raised ICP (consider proceeding, with caution, if neuroimaging excludes impairment of ICP circulation and following assessment by an experienced clinician). Pupillary dilatation (unilateral or bilateral). Reduced pupillary light reflex. Bradycardia. Hypertension. Altered breathing pattern. Decorticate/decerebrate posturing.
Thrombocytopaenia. Evidence is lacking to support specific LP platelet thresholds. Guidance from the British Society of Haematology suggests > 40×10⁹/L is acceptable (based largely on limited studies in stable children with haematological malignancy), but in the context of suspected meningitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation and shock or sepsis, a higher threshold of > 100×10⁹/L is advised.
Abnormal blood coagulation. A coagulation profile should be checked in patients with suspected increased risk of bleeding, for example, with a personal or family history of bleeding, in the context of sepsis and haematological disorders, as well as in suspected renal or liver failure. Discuss patients with abnormal coagulation (including those with a clinically suspected bleeding disorder but normal coagulation profile) and patients taking anticoagulant medication with a haematology/clotting specialist before LP.
Infection over or around LP site.
Chiari malformation (may be safe to proceed with review of neuroimaging).
Lumbar spine structural anomalies (eg, spina bifida).
Acute or focal neurological deficit (relative contraindication — consider neuroimaging first).
Respiratory insufficiency.
Deteriorating or fluctuating GCS, or GCS score of ≤ 8.
At presentation with Clinical evidence of systemic meningococcal disease. Shock. Seizures. Following initial treatment and stabilisation with assessment by an experienced clinician (and if required neuroimaging), it may later be appropriate to proceed with LP.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign pediatric sepsis — vitamin D and sepsis: No current data support that rapid acute correction of VDD is an effective treatment in septic shock or improves outcomes of septic children, and vitamin D levels are lowered by fluid resuscitation, which can confound the association with illness severity and disease complications. Although levels may be normalized via supplementation, a meta-analysis concluded rapid normalization is best achieved using loading therapy that considers disease status, baseline level, and patient weight, and a loading dose greater than 300,000 international units should be avoided outside of RCTs evaluating risk and benefit. Hypervitaminosis D is associated with hypercalcemia and other severe complications and vitamin D overdoses can be fatal, and measurement of 25(OH) D levels is not currently a standard component of sepsis care.

### External validation of the Phoenix sepsis score in children with suspected community-acquired sepsis [^114hDMK7]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Our cohort of children had fewer missing data than in the original Phoenix cohort, including most physiological variables and serum lactate. Coagulation variables, such as international normalized ratio and D-dimer, were missing in a high proportion of patients in both cohorts. Missing data were assumed to be normal and did not contribute to the overall Phoenix Sepsis Score. This assumption may be incorrect, as evidenced by the higher proportion of missing data in the cohort from low- and middle-resource settings in the original Phoenix cohort despite having higher in-hospital mortality.

The process followed by the sepsis definition task force in developing the Phoenix Sepsis Score and sepsis criteria was comprehensive and exhaustive; using a global survey of clinicians, a systematic review and meta-analysis, and a large international derivation and validation study. The definition was designed to reliably identify children with sepsis for the purposes of clinical care, benchmarking, quality improvement, epidemiology, and research. The task force did not intend the sepsis definition to be used for sepsis screening or early identification of children with suspected sepsis. The Phoenix criteria are therefore not intended to help determine when and in whom to initiate treatment for sepsis. Our data and that from the original Phoenix validation cohort support the use of the Phoenix criteria for benchmarking clinical care between populations, as a standard that can be used to report sepsis epidemiology, and as a method for comparing similar populations over time for quality improvement purposes. Our data and that from the original Phoenix validation highlight some limitations of the Phoenix sepsis criteria: (1) most children (> 95%) did not meet the Phoenix sepsis criteria, indicating a lack of discriminative ability for a large proportion of children hospitalized with suspected sepsis and an underestimate of the burden of suspected sepsis on the health care system; (2) the Phoenix sepsis criteria are determined as the worst score after the first 24 hours of hospitalization, limiting their utility for clinical care or research within the first 24 hours of hospitalization; and (3) the criteria did not identify nearly half of the children who died in hospital, indicating a lack of sensitivity and predictive ability for overall mortality. These limitations should be taken into consideration when applying the Phoenix Sepsis Score and sepsis criteria in clinical practice.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation in paediatrics [^115gzxMM]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in paediatrics is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although there have been several recent advances in the pathophysiology of DIC, most of these studies were done in adults. Since the haemostatic system is very different in early life and changes dramatically with age, creating a variety of challenges for the clinician, delay in the diagnosis of DIC can happen until overt DIC is evident. In this review article, we report the aetiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic tests and a management algorithm to guide paediatricians when treating patients with DIC.

### Effects of coagulopathy and its correction on time to source control and clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis [^116y6jo4]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Radiological intervention is often required for infection source control in sepsis, and correcting coagulopathy prior to procedures with bleeding risk is recommended. This study aimed to evaluate the impacts of correcting coagulopathy on time to intervention and on 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis undergoing abdominal radiological interventions.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study utilized prospectively collected sepsis registry from the emergency department of a tertiary hospital. Adult patients with sepsis or septic shock who underwent abdominal radiological intervention between January 2011 and December 2020 were included. Coagulopathy was defined as PT-INR > 1.5 or platelet count < 50,000/μL. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and secondary outcome included major bleeding complications, requiring transfusion, embolization or surgery. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify independent associations.

Results

Among the 597 patients analyzed, 161 (27.0%) had coagulopathy. Among these, 55 (34.2%) underwent correction prior to intervention. Patients who underwent correction had a significantly longer median time to intervention (15.3 vs. 6.0 h, P < 0.001) and higher 28-day mortality (41.8% vs. 22.6%, P = 0.02), but no reduction in major bleeding complications was achieved. In multivariable analysis, coagulopathy correction associated independently with a higher 28-day mortality rate (OR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.13–5.66, P = 0.03) but not with the incidence of major bleeding complications (OR 1.80; 95% CI, 0.83–3.90, P = 0.13).

Conclusions

In septic patients with coagulopathy undergoing abdominal radiological intervention, coagulopathy correction correlated with delayed source control and increased 28-day mortality, without reducing major bleeding complications.

### Coagulation abnormalities and management in hospitalized pediatric patients with COVID-19 [^113zBvqi]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The incidence and severity of coagulation abnormalities have not been extensively studied in pediatric populations with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Moreover, their association with an increased risk for thromboembolic events remains unclear, and there is a lack of evidence for optimal prophylactic antithrombotic management. The aim of our study was to present our experience in evaluation, management, and long-term outcomes of coagulation abnormalities in pediatric hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

Methods

A prospective study was performed in all children hospitalized for COVID-19 during a 6-month period focusing on patients' coagulation abnormalities, the normalization of the coagulation profile with or without anticoagulation prophylaxis and the clinical outcome of the disease.

Results

Two hundred twenty-three patients (median age: 11.4 months) were enrolled in the study. Coagulation abnormalities were detected in 92.4% of patients with increased D-dimer levels to be the most common abnormality detected in 84.3% of patients. Prophylactic anticoagulation was initiated only in 7 (3.1%) selected patients with severe COVID-19 and at least 2 risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and in all patients with previous history of VTE. Follow-up coagulation profile in 85 patients showed that changes over time had a tendency towards normalization irrespectively of the initiation of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. No thrombotic complications were observed 3 months upon discharge.

Conclusions

Although abnormal findings in coagulation profile were very common, they were not associated with risk for VTE even in severe cases. A trend of normalization early in the course of the disease was observed regardless of the use of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis.

### Enigmatic role of coagulopathy among sepsis survivors: a review of coagulation abnormalities and their possible link to chronic critical illness [^117P2Sbr]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

In a similar vein, antithrombin supplementation has been studied to improve outcomes in patients with sepsis-induced DIC. Antithrombin in an endogenous anticoagulant, inhibiting 80% of coagulation activities of thrombin and five different coagulation factors. High-dose supplementation has shown possible improved survival in patients with sepsis-induced DIC, but no survival differences in patients with sepsis without DIC. However, more recent studies have shown that specific patient populations with sepsis-induced DIC and very low antithrombin levels (< 43%) benefit from administration of antithrombin (AT), with significantly improved survival and without increased bleeding complications.

Interpretation of these clinical trials is complicated because the benefits of ameliorating coagulopathy must be balanced against the risk of weakening the host response to infection or causing hemorrhage. Furthermore, because sepsis is heterogeneous and the pathogenesis of coagulopathy is multifactorial, simultaneous treatments and/or a personalized algorithm may be needed. These treatment modalities may be more successful once a more complete picture of the progression of coagulopathy and DIC in critical illness is available. It is a fluctuating state of imbalance between procoagulation and antithrombosis and, to accurately treat a patient, we will need to better predict their coagulation state in real time. The use of a procoagulant or anticoagulant is more likely to harm the patient if used in a manner not tailored to the specific coagulopathy in real time. One potentially viable approach is to target the innate immune cells — namely neutrophils and monocytes — or cellular products that mediate immunothrombosis to mitigate progression to DIC and/or MOF. For example, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), chromatin-based antimicrobial structures released from neutrophils, are implicated in propagating immunothrombosis. In preclinical models and in vitro, inhibition of NET formation may be a promising option for therapeutic intervention.

Plasma exchange (PLEX) in pediatric septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction — 69) We suggest against using plasma exchange (PLEX) in children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction without thrombocytopenia-associated multiple organ failure (TAMOF) (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). 70) We cannot suggest for or against the use of PLEX in children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction with TAMOF. Evidence includes a meta-analysis of four small randomized controlled trials evaluating PLEX in adults (n = 128) and pediatric (n = 66) patients, with reduced mortality in adults (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42–0.96) but not in children (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.28–3.38). TAMOF is described as an inflammatory phenotype identified clinically by new-onset thrombocytopenia and evolving multiple organ dysfunction. Among children with sepsis and TAMOF, the largest study (n = 81) found lower 28-day mortality with PLEX by multivariate analysis (adjusted RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.23–0.90) and propensity score weighting (adjusted RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.22–0.97); a retrospective cohort from the Turkish TAMOF Network (n = 42) showed lower 28-day mortality versus no PLEX (27% vs 70%; p = 0.004); and a randomized study randomized 10 children reported restoration of ADAMTS-13 activity with greater survival (5/5 vs 1/5; p < 0.05) in those receiving PLEX.

### Thromboelastometry for the assessment of coagulation abnormalities in early and established adult sepsis: a prospective cohort study [^1139551Z]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Key thromboelastometric variables remained within reference ranges during the course of critically illness in patients with sepsis without adverse bleeding events.

- After resolution of the critical illness in patients with severe sepsis/septic shock, thromboelastometric variables exhibited shortened coagulation time, accelerated clot formation, and increased firmness of the formed blood clot when compared with values on admission. With increased severity of illness, these changes were more pronounced.

- Thromboelastometry, when performed in patients with established severe sepsis and septic shock, cannot reliably detect activation of coagulation in the sense of a hypercoagulable state, as suggested by in vitro or experimental studies.

### Coagulation studies in the newborn period… [^117JxyWD]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The term hemorrhagic disease of the newborn was introduced by Townsend1 in 1894 to include a variety of bleeding disorders which occur during this period of infancy unrelated to trauma, infection, or definite disease. The condition was differentiated from hemophilia. In 1910 Schwarz and Ottenberg2 reported a prolonged coagulation time in these cases, and two years later Whipple3 advanced the hypothesis that the condition was due to a lack of prothrombin. Very low values of this factor were reported by Gelston4 and later by Kugelmass et al. ,5 but in these studies very inaccurate methods were employed. In 1937 Brinkhous, Smith, and Warner6 with a two-stage technique showed that the defect of coagulation of normal newborn infants was due to a reduction of blood prothrombin. After this, independent publications from different parts of the world established the value of vitamin K in prophylaxis and treatment. ABALLÍ AJ, BANÚS VL, de LAMERENS S, ROZENGVAIG S.

### Human recombinant protein C for severe sepsis and septic shock in adult and paediatric patients [^111oCtE4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a common and frequently fatal condition. Human recombinant activated protein C (APC) has been introduced to reduce the high risk of death associated with severe sepsis or septic shock. This systematic review is an update of a Cochrane review originally published in 2007.

Objectives

We assessed the benefits and harms of APC for patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 6); MEDLINE (2010 to June 2012); EMBASE (2010 to June 2012); BIOSIS (1965 to June 2012); CINAHL (1982 to June 2012) and LILACS (1982 to June 2012). There was no language restriction.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of APC for severe sepsis or septic shock in adults and children. We excluded studies on neonates. We considered all-cause mortality at day 28 and at the end of study follow up, and hospital mortality as the primary outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently performed trial selection, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction in duplicate. We estimated relative risks (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. We measured statistical heterogeneity using the I(2) statistic. We used a random-effects model.

Main Results

We identified one new randomized clinical trial in this update which includes six randomized clinical trials involving 6781 participants in total, five randomized clinical trials in adult (N = 6307) and one randomized clinical trial in paediatric (N = 474) participants. All trials had high risk of bias and were sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry. APC compared with placebo did not significantly affect all-cause mortality at day 28 compared with placebo (780/3435 (22.7%) versus 767/3346 (22.9%); RR 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.16; I² = 56%). APC did not significantly affect in-hospital mortality (393/1767 (22.2%) versus 379/1710 (22.1%); RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.16; I² = 20%). APC was associated with an increased risk of serious bleeding (113/3424 (3.3%) versus 74/3343 (2.2%); RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.94; I(2) = 0%). APC did not significantly affect serious adverse events (463/3334 (13.9%) versus 439/3302 (13.2%); RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.18; I(2) = 0%). Trial sequential analyses showed that more trials do not seem to be needed for reliable conclusions regarding these outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated review found no evidence suggesting that APC should be used for treating patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. APC seems to be associated with a higher risk of bleeding. The drug company behind APC, Eli Lilly, has announced the discontinuation of all ongoing clinical trials using this drug for treating patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. APC should not be used for sepsis or septic shock outside randomized clinical trials.

Pediatric sepsis — prophylaxis: We suggest against the routine use of stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction, except for high-risk patients. Although routine stress-ulcer prophylaxis is not recommended, some high-risk patients may benefit and studies have supported benefit when the baseline rate of clinically important bleeding is approximately 13%. We suggest against routine deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis (mechanical or pharmacologic) in critically ill children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction, but potential benefits may outweigh risks and costs in specific populations.

The SIC score was designed for earlier identification of patients with coagulopathy who have an elevated risk of deterioration from nonovert to overt DIC, which explains its high sensitivity. Given that diagnosis of SIC using the SIC score preceded a diagnosis of overt DIC, once this patient subset is identified, they may be followed using the ISTH overt DIC score, which carries a higher specificity. A combination of the SIC score with the ISTH DIC score may allow for earlier detection of SIC and institution of therapy before progression to overt DIC.

### Four-day antithrombin therapy does not seem to attenuate hypercoagulability in patients suffering from sepsis [^112XMCeB]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis activates the coagulation system and frequently causes hypercoagulability, which is not detected by routine coagulation tests. A reliable method to evaluate hypercoagulability is thromboelastography (TEG), but this has not so far been used to investigate sepsis-induced hypercoagulability. Antithrombin (AT) in plasma of septic patients is decreased, and administration of AT may therefore reduce the acquired hypercoagulability. Not clear, however, is to what extent supraphysiologic plasma levels of AT decrease the acute hypercoagulability in septic patients. The present study investigates the coagulation profile of septic patients before and during four day high-dose AT therapy.

Methods

Patients with severe sepsis were randomly assigned to receive either 6,000 IU AT as a bolus infusion followed by a maintenance dose of 250 IU/hour over four days (n = 17) or placebo (n = 16). TEG, platelet count, plasma fibrinogen levels, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were assessed at baseline and daily during AT therapy.

Results

TEG showed a hypercoagulability in both groups at baseline, which was neither reversed by bolus or by maintenance doses of AT. The hypercoagulability was mainly caused by increased plasma fibrinogen, and to a lesser extent by platelets. Plasmatic coagulation as assessed by the prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time was similar in both groups, and did not change during the study period.

Conclusion

The current study shows a distinct hypercoagulability in patients suffering from severe sepsis, which was not reversed by high-dose AT treatment over four days. This finding supports recent data showing that modulation of coagulatory activation in septic patients by AT does not occur before one week of therapy.

### Clinical value of albumin-corrected anion gap combined with lactate dehydrogenase in predicting sepsis-associated liver injury in children: a single-center retrospective cohort study [^113v5jfZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to examine the predictive value of albumin-corrected anion gap (ACAG) for the early detection of pediatric sepsis-associated liver injury (SAIL).

Methods

A retrospective analysis was performed on clinical data of pediatric patients with sepsis who were admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) at Anhui Provincial Children's Hospital between January 2021 and February 2024. Patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of liver injury: 118 cases in the non-liver injury group and 30 cases in the liver injury group. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for SAIL in children. The predictive value of each independent risk factor for the early diagnosis of SAIL was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.

Results

In a group of 148 pediatric patients diagnosed with sepsis, 30 individuals, representing 20.27%, developed SAIL. The SAIL group exhibited a significantly higher mortality rate than the non-SAIL group (P < 0.05), with patients having abdominal infections as the primary infection site being more susceptible to SAIL. Significant differences were observed between the SAIL and non-SAIL groups in terms of albumin (ALB), platelet (PLT) count, ACAG, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), international normalized ratio (INR), fibrinogen concentration (FDP), prothrombin time (PT), thrombin time(TT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and D-dimer levels (P < 0.05). No significant differences were found between the two groups regarding age, sex, birth status, white blood cell count and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Cholinesterase(CHE) (P > 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified ACAG (OR = 1.017, 95% CI: 1.016–1.207, P = 0.021), LDH (OR = 1.037, 95% CI: 1.009–1.066, P = 0.009), intra-abdominal infection (OR = 5.450, 95% CI: 1.190–24.958, P = 0.029), and severe lactic acidosis (OR = 2.585, 95% CI: 1.129–5.922, P = 0.025) as independent risk factors for SAIL. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the combination of ACAG and LDH yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.906 (95% CI: 0.843–0.962) for predicting SAIL. At a cutoff value of 21.88, the sensitivity was 90.00% and the specificity was 82.20%.

Conclusion

ACAG, LDH, severe lactic acidosis, and abdominal infection were identified as independent predictors of sepsis-associated liver injury (SAIL) incidence in children, the combination of ACAG and LDH had a better predictive value than individual indicators.

### Enigmatic role of coagulopathy among sepsis survivors: a review of coagulation abnormalities and their possible link to chronic critical illness [^1141u3tz]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

While DIC is considered an independent predictor of mortality during critical illness and is associated with a 1.5-fold greater mortality rate in septic patients compared with those with less severe forms of coagulopathy, no single test is sufficient for detecting DIC. In the appropriate clinical setting, accurate diagnosis requires examining numerous laboratory tests, including platelet count, fibrin markers, fibrinogen, and prothrombin time (PT). Because of the simultaneous activation and downregulation of separate parts of the coagulation process during sepsis, timely monitoring of coagulation changes is important in the recognition and treatment of sepsis-induced coagulopathy and DIC. In current practice, thromboelastography (TEG) is the most efficient and advantageous measure of clotting function in real time. Specific indicators in TEG testing, such as R value, K time, α angle, maximum amplitude value and coagulation index, have been shown to correlate with the severity of the patient's sepsis by both Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores, and can better determine platelet functionality than traditional coagulation laboratories. Many studies have been conducted to evaluate the utility of TEG on clinical diagnosis of sepsis-induced coagulopathy. Among these, wide variation is seen with regard to detection of hypercoagulability and hypocoagulability, likely from non-uniform collection times, varying degrees of disease severity, and deviations in definitions. However, overall trends indicate that a hypocoagulable profile is associated with increased MOF, along with increased mortality in sepsis.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^117X3pfR]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric sepsis — stress-ulcer prophylaxis: The guideline states that 'Stress ulcer prophylaxis should not be routinely administered to children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction' and advises that 'individual patients should be assessed for the presence of risk factors of clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding' including 'multiple organ dysfunction', 'prolonged mechanical ventilation (> 48 hr)', 'coagulopathy, persistent shock', and 'treatment with corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents'. Supporting data note a meta-analysis 'of 1,836 adult patients' where 'pharmacological stress ulcer prophylaxis did not significantly change the risk of GI bleeding', but 'the risk of pneumonia was increased' with stress-ulcer prophylaxis versus none '(OR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.2–6.6)', and that benefit is suggested only when 'baseline rate of clinically important bleeding is approximately 13%'.

### Human protein C concentrate in the treatment of purpura fulminans: a retrospective analysis of safety and outcome in 94 pediatric patients [^112drzhe]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

In contrast, significant bleeding complications were not seen in our large group of pediatric patients and have also not been associated with the use of human, non-activated PC concentrate in adult studies so far.

As published previously, this study confirmed low plasma PC levels to be associated with negative outcome. In fact, even a difference as small as 1% in PC plasma activity at admission changed the odds of survival significantly. For a number of medical conditions, minimizing the amount of time from patient presentation to initiation of treatment represents an important consideration in the improvement of treatment outcomes. Analysis of a large, hospital-level database suggested that earlier treatment with activated PC is associated with a lower in-hospital mortality in patients (n = 1179) with severe sepsis. Another retrospective study, analyzing adults with severe sepsis and APC treatment found an increase in mortality from 33% if treated on the day of diagnosis to 40% if treatment was delayed by one day and to 52% if treatment was delayed by two days or more. In our analysis, the interval between admission to ICU and the commencement of PC replacement therapy was significantly longer in patients who died compared with those who survived, which may point towards the benefits of early therapy in this rapidly progressive condition.

During PC therapy, coagulatory and inflammatory markers may be important prognostic markers. The prevalence of ongoing coagulopathy, as reflected in a significantly more abnormal aPTT and prothrombin time, and in significantly lower fibrinogen levels at admission and during therapy, was higher in non-survivors compared with survivors. During therapy, but not at admission, platelets were found to be significantly lower in patients who did not survive, also pointing towards ongoing coagulopathy as a negative prognostic marker. Interestingly, although non-survivors showed lower PC plasma levels and higher incidence of coagulopathy, the inflammatory response in terms of CRP levels and leukocytosis was less marked in the non-survivors, which could imply a degree of immuno-paralysis in those patients.

Being a retrospective multi-center analysis, the limitations of this study are obvious: the lack of a control group and a prospective design makes it impossible to comment of the effects of PC on survival. The patients were treated in many different centers with a consequently large potential for intra-observer variability. On the other hand, the fact that even with so many different centers and protocols involved, the safety profile was still favorable in this unselected high-risk population is very encouraging.

### Sepsis-induced coagulopathy: a comprehensive narrative review of pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management strategies [^115YaDZf]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Physiological hemostasis is a balance between pro- and anticoagulant pathways, and in sepsis, this equilibrium is disturbed, resulting in systemic thrombin generation, impaired anticoagulant activity, and suppression of fibrinolysis, a condition termed sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC). SIC is a common complication, being present in 24% of patients with sepsis and 66% of patients with septic shock, and is often associated with poor clinical outcomes and high mortality. 1, 2 Recent preclinical and clinical studies have generated new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of SIC. In this article, we analyze the complex pathophysiology of SIC with a focus on the role of procoagulant innate immune signaling in hemostatic activation — tissue factor production, thrombin generation, endotheliopathy, and impaired antithrombotic functions. We also review clinical presentations of SIC, the diagnostic scoring system and laboratory tests, the current standard of care, and clinical trials evaluating the efficacies of anticoagulant therapies.

### Enigmatic role of coagulopathy among sepsis survivors: a review of coagulation abnormalities and their possible link to chronic critical illness [^113e5zCt]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Multiple scoring systems have attempted to standardize the diagnosis of DIC, but each has respective drawbacks, including broad applicability and questionable sensitivity. The most recent accepted diagnostic criteria are the ISTH overt DIC score, based on platelet counts, fibrin-related markers (D-dimer, and so on), PT and fibrinogen levels. This has been criticized for its detection of DIC in its later phases, and other guidelines have been proposed to diagnose DIC earlier in the disease course to better facilitate treatment, namely Japanese Association for Acute Medicine DIC score, and Japanese Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis DIC.

Unfortunately, there are no current therapeutic interventions guaranteed to reverse DIC and the mainstay of treatment depends on resolving the underlying pathophysiologic process. Because coagulopathy and microthrombotic disease are believed to contribute to organ dysfunction during sepsis, numerous clinical trials have investigated whether coagulation mediators could be effective therapeutic targets. Notable mentions include the Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis (PROWESS) group, evaluating APC. APC is an endogenous protein that has both antithrombotic and profibrinolytic properties, and originally showed promise with a significant mortality reduction, particularly in patients with DIC. Other studies showed APC reduced overt thrombotic events, although with an increase in clinically significant bleeding events. After increasing doubt in the efficacy of APC, and higher concerns for bleeding, an investigation into the risk/benefit profile of the drug was called for. The study, PROWESS-SHOCK, eventually proved no difference in 28-day survival and the drug was discontinued.

### Trauma induced clotting factor depletion in severely injured children: a single center observational study [^112uRJgP]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe trauma is one of the most commonly reported causes of mortality not only in adults, but especially during childhood and adolescence. Besides traumatic brain injury (TBI), severe bleeding is the leading cause of casualties in adult trauma patients, and accompanying coagulopathy on admission is clearly correlated to mortality (. Trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC) differs significantly from other forms of coagulation disorders such as disseminated intravascular coagulation. In recent years, the particular significance of TIC has also been confirmed for pediatric trauma patients in civilian and combat support hospitals. Hence, errors in the clinical management of bleeding remain a major issue. They account for the majority of potentially preventable deaths in both adult and pediatric trauma victims and are at least partially due to improper correction of devastating coagulopathies. In this context, early detection of TIC is still a challenge as routine coagulation tests such as prothrombin time (PT) have known limitations. Furthermore, though pathological PT values are predictive of an unfavorable outcome, they are not necessarily indicative of coagulopathy or bleeding in injured children.

These days it is known that traumatic coagulopathy is a multifactorial process, yet the underlying mechanisms leading to TIC are still not fully understood. However, dilution and/or consumption of clotting factors are an important driver in its development. An early study by Harrigan et al. demonstrated a depletion of some clotting factors for patients in severe hemorrhagic shock shortly after injury. In fact, several studies confirmed the decrease in coagulation factor levels or activity following severe multiple trauma in adult patients. Nevertheless, data about clotting factor profiles for injured children is currently sparse. In a recent study using a method called principal component analysis, Leeper et al. showed that the component representing global depletion of clotting factors is linked to mortality and early transfusion in children as well. However, there is still no direct evidence for the derangement of clotting factors and its potential distribution among the particular coagulation factors in a pediatric trauma cohort.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to further elucidate potential alterations in the soluble clotting factors at an early stage in order to form a rational basis for empiric coagulation therapy in severely injured children.

### Sepsis beyond bundles: contextualising paediatric care in resource-limited settings through situational analysis [^114jrQqc]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is a critical global health concern and disproportionately affects children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where healthcare resources are often limited. Sepsis is generally recognised as a clinical condition characterised by dysregulated host response to infection, leading to multi-organ dysfunction. Early detection of paediatric sepsis is particularly challenging due to the complexity of paediatric physiology, confounding presentations with other febrile illnesses, and the fact that presentation varies with age.

The Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) recently established paediatric sepsis criteria for children below the age of 18. The concept of 'bundles of care' for sepsis originated with the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) in 2002 and initially focused on reducing sepsis mortality in adult populations, but has since expanded to include paediatric patients. Over the past few decades, paediatric sepsis bundles have evolved significantly and have become a cornerstone in global efforts to improve early recognition and management of sepsis in children.

Paediatric sepsis bundles typically involve a series of time-sensitive interventions, including the prompt administration of antibiotics, fluid resuscitation and continuous monitoring of organ function. The goal is to initiate these interventions within the first hour of recognising sepsis — often called the 'golden hour'. A landmark 2020 publication from the SSCadvocated for globally standardised care practices and tailored recommendations to paediatric patients based on extensive international research. Further advancements came in 2024 with the SCCM's introduction of the Phoenix Sepsis Score, which offers refined respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation and neurologic dysfunction criteria. This score was designed to improve paediatric sepsis management, particularly in resource-limited settings, by triggering specific interventions when a score of two or more points is reached.

Global estimates suggest that paediatric sepsis can confer mortality rates of 9–20%and that despite overall improvements in sepsis care, these rates have worsened in resource-limited settings. Previous research in Sub-Saharan Africa shows that the mortality rate for paediatric sepsis in hospitals can exceed 10%, especially where timely and adequate treatment is lacking. These statistics have been borne out in Ghana as well, where a 1 year audit at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hosptial (KATH), a large tertiary care centre in the Ashanti region, revealed a 9% prevalence of paediatric sepsis among admitted patients and a mortality rate as high as 79%. Another study identified sepsis as the leading cause of death within the first 24 hours of admission to KATH's paediatric emergency unit (PEU).

### Utility of thromboelastography and / or thromboelastometry in adults with sepsis: a systematic review [^115SPrR5]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Coagulation abnormalities are frequent in sepsis. Conventional coagulation assays, however, have several limitations. A surge of interest exists in the use of point-of-care tests to diagnose hypo- and hypercoagulability in sepsis.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched from 1 January 1980 to 31 December 2012. The search was limited to adults, and language was limited to English. Reference lists of retrieved articles were hand-searched for additional studies. Ongoing trials were searched on http://www.controlled-trials.com and http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Studies addressing TEG/ROTEM measurements in adult patients with sepsis admitted to the ICU were considered eligible.

Results

Of 680 screened articles, 18 studies were included, of which two were randomized controlled trials, and 16 were observational cohort studies. In patients with sepsis, results show both hyper- and hypocoagulability, as well as TEG/ROTEM values that fell within reference values. Both hyper- and hypocoagulability were to some extent associated with diffuse intravascular coagulation. Compared with conventional coagulation tests, TEG/ROTEM can detect impaired fibrinolysis, which can possibly help to discriminate between sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). A hypocoagulable profile is associated with increased mortality. The value of TEG/ROTEM to identify patients with sepsis who could possibly benefit from therapies interfering with the coagulation system could not be assessed, because studies addressing this topic were limited.

Conclusion

TEG/ROTEM could be a promising tool in diagnosing alterations in coagulation in sepsis. Further research on the value of TEG/ROTEM in these patients is warranted. Given that coagulopathy is a dynamic process, sequential measurements are needed to understand the coagulation patterns in sepsis, as can be detected by TEG/ROTEM.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^11277nZG]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign pediatric sepsis — stress-ulcer prophylaxis — Stress ulcer prophylaxis should not be routinely administered to children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction, and individual patients should be assessed for risk factors for clinically important gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, including multiple organ dysfunction, prolonged mechanical ventilation (> 48 hr), coagulopathy, persistent shock, and treatment with corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents; the risk of GI bleeding is reduced by gastric feeding and early enteral nutrition could be a viable alternative to pharmacological prophylaxis; in adults receiving enteral nutrition, pharmacological stress-ulcer prophylaxis did not significantly change GI bleeding and increased pneumonia risk (OR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.2–6.6), with benefit supported when baseline clinically important bleeding is approximately 13%.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition position paper on the diagnosis and management of pediatric acute liver failure [^115tTzyU]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric acute liver failure — coagulopathy and bleeding management states that both prothrombin time (PT) and the international normalized ratio (INR) are elevated in PALF, yet abnormalities in these synthetic markers do not equate with bleeding risk because both procoagulant and anticoagulant proteins are reduced; clinically significant bleeding can occur. Initial management should look to improve the abnormality via administration of an age- and weight-appropriate dose of vitamin K therapy from 1 mg in infants to 10 mg in older adolescents. Oral vitamin K therapy should not be used to correct the INR in PALF; rather, subcutaneous administration should be used, while intramuscular and intravenous routes carry a Black Box warning for rare, but potentially serious side effects. Coagulopathy secondary to vitamin K deficiency should rapidly correct following repletion, and if coagulopathy persists, efforts to "correct" with fresh frozen plasma or other pro-coagulation products should generally be avoided because plasma transfusions transiently improve laboratory measures but have no proven benefit when given prophylactically and can instead contribute to volume overload; most centers will use plasma and/or platelet infusions before an invasive procedure or in the setting of life-threatening bleeding. Thromboelastography (TEG) is designed to incorporate all coagulation phases and has the promise to inform management decisions but requires additional study.

### ENHANCE: results of a global open-label trial of drotrecogin alfa (activated) in children with severe sepsis [^115i2oGM]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To gather additional 28-day all-cause mortality data and safety information for pediatric patients with severe sepsis who received drotrecogin alfa (activated) (DrotAA).

Design and Setting

Single-arm, open-label, multicentered study conducted in 59 study sites in 15 countries.

Patients

One-hundred eighty-eight children (term newborn to < 18 yrs old) with severe sepsis were consecutively enrolled in the study.

Intervention

Administration of DrotAA, 24 microg/kg/hr for 96 hrs.

Main Outcome Measures

Four-day and 28-day all-cause mortality, safety information, and protein C levels.

Results

One-hundred eighty-seven patients completed the study. The 4-day mortality rate was 7.0%, and the 28-day mortality rate was 13.4%. At baseline, 57.6% of patients were severely deficient in protein C (a level ≤ 40% of normal). There was a statistically significant association between increased 28-day mortality and decreased end-of-infusion protein C levels (p < .001), greater number of baseline organ dysfunctions (p < .001), and greater baseline ventilator use (p = .03). Bleeding was the most significant complication observed. Serious bleeding events (including anemia without a bleeding source) were experienced by 27.7% of patients (n = 52). Six of the serious bleeding events (3.2%) were considered related to administration of DrotAA. During infusion, serious bleeding events with an identified source of bleeding were experienced by 5.9% of patients (n = 11). Central nervous system bleeding was experienced by 2.7% (n = 5). Two of the intracranial hemorrhages were fatal and occurred postinfusion.

Conclusions

Without a placebo control, no efficacy conclusions are possible. Subgroups at higher risk of death were identified, and the change in protein C level from baseline was predictive of survival. The most significant complication observed was bleeding. Risk factors for serious bleeding appear to be multiple organ failure, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy.

### Serum levels of vitamin C and thiamin in children with suspected sepsis: a prospective observational cohort study [^115tN6fo]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this prospective observational study of children evaluated for sepsis, we observed that a substantial proportion of children had vitamin C levels below the normal range. Vitamin C levels correlated inversely with pSOFA scores and low levels were associated with greater odds of MODS. For thiamin serum levels, we failed to identify any consistent association with severity.

Vitamins have gained interest as potential adjunctive therapies in critically ill patients. A network meta-analysis in adults with sepsis indicated that high-dose vitamin C treatment was associated with decreased mortality, albeit with low certainty. In an animal model, vitamin C used in much higher doses than in previous RCTs was effective in mitigating sepsis-related organ dysfunction. In children, systematic reviews indicate a high safety profile. Our study was designed to characterize vitamin C and thiamin levels in a prospective cohort of children evaluated for sepsis, with different microbiological etiologies, age groups, comorbidities, and variable degrees of illness severity. Vitamin measurements were determined at admission to the ED or PICU to minimize the effect of critical illness-associated malnutrition on vitamin levels. Children with organ dysfunction in our cohort had even lower vitamin C levels compared to previous studies of general PICU patients which revealed overall decreases in micronutrients, and compared to adults with sepsis. Endotoxinemia during sepsis leads to widespread activation of immune and endothelial cells, platelets, and the coagulation system, all of which cause a dramatic increase in multiple oxidative mechanisms and contribute to vitamin C depletion.

Our study has several limitations. First, vitamin measurements were only obtained upon admission, and we were thus unable to longitudinally assess serum vitamin levels. Second, we did not obtain measures of skin-fold thickness, body mass indices, blood transfusions, or a detailed nutritional history of patients. The cohort represents a metropolitan pediatric population in a high-income country, and we did not collect information on eligible children who were not enrolled. Hence, the vitamin levels may not be generalizable to children in less-resourced settings who may be more prone to malnutrition. Third, although we observed associations between vitamin C levels and pSOFA, a causal link between organ dysfunction and consumption of vitamin C cannot be elucidated with our data. Notably, an association of low vitamin levels with greater odds of MODS does not necessarily justify vitamin supplementation, as levels may be directly affected by factors relating to critical illness and therapies, and may reflect adaptive rather than pathological mechanisms.

### International consensus criteria for pediatric sepsis and septic shock [^115TS66D]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Sepsis is a leading cause of death among children worldwide. Current pediatric-specific criteria for sepsis were published in 2005 based on expert opinion. In 2016, the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) defined sepsis as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, but it excluded children.

Objective

To update and evaluate criteria for sepsis and septic shock in children.

Evidence Review

The Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) convened a task force of 35 pediatric experts in critical care, emergency medicine, infectious diseases, general pediatrics, nursing, public health, and neonatology from 6 continents. Using evidence from an international survey, systematic review and meta-analysis, and a new organ dysfunction score developed based on more than 3 million electronic health record encounters from 10 sites on 4 continents, a modified Delphi consensus process was employed to develop criteria.

Findings

Based on survey data, most pediatric clinicians used sepsis to refer to infection with life-threatening organ dysfunction, which differed from prior pediatric sepsis criteria that used systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, which have poor predictive properties, and included the redundant term, severe sepsis. The SCCM task force recommends that sepsis in children be identified by a Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 points in children with suspected infection, which indicates potentially life-threatening dysfunction of the respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and/or neurological systems. Children with a Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 points had in-hospital mortality of 7.1% in higher-resource settings and 28.5% in lower-resource settings, more than 8 times that of children with suspected infection not meeting these criteria. Mortality was higher in children who had organ dysfunction in at least 1 of 4-respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and/or neurological-organ systems that was not the primary site of infection. Septic shock was defined as children with sepsis who had cardiovascular dysfunction, indicated by at least 1 cardiovascular point in the Phoenix Sepsis Score, which included severe hypotension for age, blood lactate exceeding 5 mmol/L, or need for vasoactive medication. Children with septic shock had an in-hospital mortality rate of 10.8% and 33.5% in higher- and lower-resource settings, respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

The Phoenix sepsis criteria for sepsis and septic shock in children were derived and validated by the international SCCM Pediatric Sepsis Definition Task Force using a large international database and survey, systematic review and meta-analysis, and modified Delphi consensus approach. A Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 identified potentially life-threatening organ dysfunction in children younger than 18 years with infection, and its use has the potential to improve clinical care, epidemiological assessment, and research in pediatric sepsis and septic shock around the world.

### Are children with SARS-CoV-2 infection at high risk for thrombosis? Viscoelastic testing and coagulation profiles in a case series of pediatric patients [^117J6auq]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

The coagulopathy of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is well documented in adults, with increases in D-dimer and prothrombin time found to be strong predictors of mortality, and anticoagulation shown to decrease this mortality. Viscoelastic parameters such as elevations in maximum clot firmness (MCF) on rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) have correlated with a hypercoagulable state in adults with SARS-CoV-2. We report our experience in children infected with SARS-CoV-2, with noted elevations in D-dimer and MCF on ROTEM (indicating hypercoagulability). Exploration of viscoelastic testing to provide additional laboratory-based evidence for pediatric-specific risk assessment for thromboprophylaxis in SARS-CoV-2 is warranted.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^113CMRNg]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Prophylaxis — We suggest against the routine use of stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction, except for high-risk patients (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence), and studies have supported benefit of stress ulcer prophylaxis when baseline rate of clinically important bleeding is approximately 13%. We suggest against routine deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis (mechanical or pharmacologic) in critically ill children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction, but potential benefits may outweigh risks and costs in specific populations (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).

Table 1. Determination of the quality of evidence — Quality ratings are based on underlying methodology, with High: systematic reviews and randomized clinical trials (RCTs); Moderate: downgraded RCTs or upgraded observational studies; Low: well-conducted prospective observational cohort studies; and Very low: downgraded observational cohort studies, case-control studies, case series or expert opinion or other evidence. Factors that may decrease strength include methodologic features of available RCTs suggesting high likelihood of bias, inconsistency of results including problems with subgroup analyses, indirectness of evidence, imprecision of results, and high likelihood of reporting bias. Factors that may increase strength include large magnitude of effect with direct evidence and relative risk > 2 with no plausible confounders, very large magnitude with relative risk > 5 and no threats to validity (by two levels), and a dose-response gradient.

### Sepsis-induced coagulopathy: a comprehensive narrative review of pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management strategies [^11247zpx]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Evidence supporting recombinant human soluble TM (rhTM or ART-123) and ATIII supplementation is also mixed. In a 2019 randomized clinical trial, rhTM demonstrated no significant reduction in 28-day mortality in patients diagnosed with coagulopathy. However, approximately 20% of patients in this trial no longer exhibited coagulopathy at the time of intervention. In 1998, a placebo-controlled randomized trial of ATIII supplementation in 42 septic patients found a 39% reduction in 30-day mortality, but the larger (n = 2314) multicenter phase 3 KyberSept trial in 2001 failed to show any significant reduction in 28-day mortality, and found an increased bleeding risk with concomitant prophylactic heparin administration. A subgroup analysis of the KyberSept trial in 2006 (Table 3) examined the effects of ATIII in septic patients and no heparin usage, and found improved mortality in patients with DIC compared to placebo treatment but not in patients without DIC. However, as a result of inconsistent mortality benefit in primary trials, neither rhTM nor ATIII is currently approved for use in sepsis or SIC in the United States.

In other clinical studies evaluating anticoagulant therapies for SIC and/or DIC, authors report in vivo evidence of reduced thrombin generation and improvement in coagulation parameters, suggesting potential therapeutic benefit specifically to septic patients with coagulopathy. A 2016 meta-analysis including 24 RCTs and 14,767 septic patients found less mortality with anticoagulant therapy in septic patients with DIC (relative risk, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62–0.85; P < .01), but not without (relative risk, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.92–1.02; P = 0.25), and specifically when DIC was confirmed by one of the major diagnostic scoring systems. In addition, a 2021 study found a 17.8% risk reduction in 28-day mortality with rhTM treatment in septic patients with coagulopathy, defined by severely low platelet counts and fibrinogen with prolonged PT-INR, and high D-dimer levels, an effect not seen in septic patients with mild-to-moderate changes in the above tests. Although evidence is mixed regarding anticoagulant therapy and mortality benefit in the sepsis population, secondary analysis studies (Table 3) and other systematic reviews/meta-analyses demonstrate improvement in coagulation parameters and mortality in patients with a certain degree of coagulopathy. This suggests the existence of an optimal coagulopathic phenotype in septic patients that might benefit from replacement of endogenous anticoagulants.

### Utility of thromboelastography and / or thromboelastometry in adults with sepsis: a systematic review [^116XrSFi]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Coagulation abnormalities are frequent in sepsis. Conventional coagulation assays, however, have several limitations. A surge of interest exists in the use of point-of-care tests to diagnose hypo- and hypercoagulability in sepsis.

We performed a systematic review of available literature to establish the value of rotational thromboelastography (TEG) and thromboelastometry (ROTEM) compared with standard coagulation tests to detect hyper- or hypocoagulability in sepsis patients. Furthermore, we assessed the value of TEG/ROTEM to identify sepsis patients likely to benefit from therapies that interfere with the coagulation system.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched from 1 January 1980 to 31 December 2012. The search was limited to adults, and language was limited to English. Reference lists of retrieved articles were hand-searched for additional studies. Ongoing trials were searched onand. Studies addressing TEG/ROTEM measurements in adult patients with sepsis admitted to the ICU were considered eligible.

Results

Of 680 screened articles, 18 studies were included, of which two were randomized controlled trials, and 16 were observational cohort studies. In patients with sepsis, results show both hyper- and hypocoagulability, as well as TEG/ROTEM values that fell within reference values. Both hyper- and hypocoagulability were to some extent associated with diffuse intravascular coagulation. Compared with conventional coagulation tests, TEG/ROTEM can detect impaired fibrinolysis, which can possibly help to discriminate between sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). A hypocoagulable profile is associated with increased mortality. The value of TEG/ROTEM to identify patients with sepsis who could possibly benefit from therapies interfering with the coagulation system could not be assessed, because studies addressing this topic were limited.

Conclusion

TEG/ROTEM could be a promising tool in diagnosing alterations in coagulation in sepsis. Further research on the value of TEG/ROTEM in these patients is warranted. Given that coagulopathy is a dynamic process, sequential measurements are needed to understand the coagulation patterns in sepsis, as can be detected by TEG/ROTEM.

### Thromboelastometry for the assessment of coagulation abnormalities in early and established adult sepsis: a prospective cohort study [^116qtGT7]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

The inflammatory response to an invading pathogen in sepsis leads to complex alterations in hemostasis by dysregulation of procoagulant and anticoagulant factors. Recent treatment options to correct these abnormalities in patients with sepsis and organ dysfunction have yielded conflicting results. Using thromboelastometry (ROTEM ®), we assessed the course of hemostatic alterations in patients with sepsis and related these alterations to the severity of organ dysfunction.

Methods

This prospective cohort study included 30 consecutive critically ill patients with sepsis admitted to a 30-bed multidisciplinary intensive care unit (ICU). Hemostasis was analyzed with routine clotting tests as well as thromboelastometry every 12 hours for the first 48 hours, and at discharge from the ICU. Organ dysfunction was quantified using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score.

Results

Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and SOFA scores at ICU admission were 52 ± 15 and 9 ± 4, respectively. During the ICU stay the clotting time decreased from 65 ± 8 seconds to 57 ± 5 seconds (P = 0.021) and clot formation time (CFT) from 97 ± 63 seconds to 63 ± 31 seconds (P = 0.017), whereas maximal clot firmness (MCF) increased from 62 ± 11 mm to 67 ± 9 mm (P = 0.035). Classification by SOFA score revealed that CFT was slower (P = 0.017) and MCF weaker (P = 0.005) in patients with more severe organ failure (SOFA ≥ 10, CFT 125 ± 76 seconds, and MCF 57 ± 11 mm) as compared with patients who had lower SOFA scores (SOFA < 10, CFT 69 ± 27, and MCF 68 ± 8). Along with increasing coagulation factor activity, the initially increased International Normalized Ratio (INR) and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) corrected over time.

Conclusions

Key variables of ROTEM ® remained within the reference ranges during the phase of critical illness in this cohort of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock without bleeding complications. Improved organ dysfunction upon discharge from the ICU was associated with shortened coagulation time, accelerated clot formation, and increased firmness of the formed blood clot when compared with values on admission. With increased severity of illness, changes of ROTEM ® variables were more pronounced.

### Clinical value of pediatric sepsis-induced coagulopathy score in diagnosis of sepsis-induced coagulopathy and prognosis in children [^113M2CwX]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In adults, sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) is diagnosed by the SIC score, known as sepsis-3. There is no pediatric SIC (pSIC) score at present.

Objectives

We proposed a pSIC scoring method and evaluated the diagnostic efficacy of the score in the diagnosis of SIC in children.

Patients/Methods

Patient data were retrospectively analyzed from Shanghai Children's Medical Center between February 2014 and January 2015. The pSIC score was modified from the SIC score. The area under ROC curve (AU-ROC) was used to compare the prognostic values of pSIC with other scores for pediatric sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) to arrive at a 28-day outcome.

Results and Conclusions

There were 54 patients in the pSIC group and 37 in the non-pSIC group. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis showed that the 28-day prognosis was better in the non-pSIC than in the pSIC group (p < .001). The AU-ROC of the pSIC score in predicting 28-day mortality in sepsis was 0.716, with the optimal cutoff value of > 3 inferior to that of pediatric sequential organ failure (0.716 vs. 0.921, p < .001). The AU-ROC of pSIC in predicting nonovert DIC was 0.845 and the optimal cutoff value was > 3. The AU-ROC of pSIC in predicting overt DIC was 0.901, with the best optimal cutoff value of > 4. The pSIC score can be used to diagnose SIC in children, screen potential nonovert DIC, and assess the severity of sepsis, organ dysfunction, and 28-day outcome in children.

### Antithrombin and activated protein C in pediatric sepsis: prospective observational study of outcome [^114d6sN8]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess antithrombin and activated protein C (aPC) levels in relation to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and severe outcomes in pediatric sepsis.

Design

Prospective, observational study conducted between April 2023 and October 2024. Coagulation profiles including conventional coagulation, antithrombin activity, and aPC were obtained at PICU admission.

Setting

PICU in the Vietnam National Children's Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam.

Subjects

PICU admissions, 1 month to 18 years old, with sepsis.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

One hundred thirty children (78 males; median age 7.5 mo) with mortality 23/130 (17.7%). The prevalence of overt DIC was 37 of 130 (28.5%). Nonsurvival at 28 days, compared with survival, was associated with hemorrhage and/or thrombosis at presentation, and higher number of dysfunctional organs, and overt DIC. Those with overt DIC, compared with not, had longer activated partial thromboplastin time, higher international normalized ratio and d -dimer, and lower antithrombin, and aPC. Activity of antithrombin and aPC correlated inversely with the Vasoactive-Inotropic Score in survivors (p = 0.002 and 0.009, respectively). Patients with a cutoff value for antithrombin less than 63.5% had a mortality risk with area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve 0.64, with sensitivity 0.51 and specificity 0.74, and positive predictive value 0.30. Regarding overt DIC, a cutoff value for antithrombin less than 55.5% had an AUROC 0.78, sensitivity 0.72 and specificity of 0.73, and positive predictive value 0.52.

Conclusions

In this observational study of pediatric sepsis patients, first 24-hour coagulation data in those who did not-survive to 28 days, vs. survivors showed an associated prior lower level of antithrombin in nonsurvivors. Furthermore, using the outcome of overt DIC and nonovert DIC in the first 72 hours, we found that lower levels of antithrombin or aPC are each associated with overt DIC and nonovert DIC in pediatric sepsis. Further validation work is needed in larger case series of pediatric sepsis.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign pediatric sepsis — deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis — We suggest against routine deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis (mechanical or pharmacologic) in critically ill children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction, but potential benefits may outweigh risks and costs in specific populations (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence); an open-label randomized controlled trial (RCT) of low molecular weight heparin to prevent central venous catheter (CVC)-associated thrombosis in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) was terminated early for poor recruitment, with 11 of 78 patients (14.1%) on reviparin vs 10 of 80 controls (12.5%) developing DVT (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.42–3.23), three adverse events (major bleed or death) occurring in controls, and no deaths due to venous thromboembolism; CVCs are the principal DVT risk factor in infants, older children may have risks including adolescence, obesity, cancer, and multiple medical conditions, especially renal and cardiac disease, and at present it is unknown whether certain high-risk pediatric sepsis populations benefit from DVT prophylaxis.

Pediatric sepsis empiric antimicrobial management — timing and reassessment: Most microbiological cultures show significant growth within 24 to 36 hours, so empiric treatment should be reevaluated after no more than 48 hours following initiation. If no pathogen is identified and bacterial/fungal infection is deemed unlikely, clinicians should stop empiric antimicrobial therapy to reduce unnecessary exposure. Decisions to continue, narrow, or stop therapy must often be made on the basis of clinician judgment and indirect clinical information, and complex patients should be discussed with pediatric infectious diseases and/or microbiology specialists to ensure likely pathogens are treated and that antimicrobials are stopped when no longer necessary.

### Distinct clinical phenotypes in paediatric cancer patients with sepsis are associated with different outcomes-an international multicentre retrospective study [^11618rwp]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Identifying phenotypes in sepsis patients may enable precision medicine approaches. However, the generalisability of these phenotypes to specific patient populations is unclear. Given that paediatric cancer patients with sepsis have different host response and pathogen profiles and higher mortality rates when compared to non-cancer patients, we determined whether unique, reproducible, and clinically-relevant sepsis phenotypes exist in this specific patient population.

Methods

We studied patients with underlying malignancies admitted with sepsis to one of 25 paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) participating in two large, multi-centre, observational cohorts from the European SCOTER study (n = 383 patients; study period between January 1, 2018 and January 1, 2020) and the U.S. Novel Data-Driven Sepsis Phenotypes in Children study (n = 1898 patients; study period between January 1, 2012 and January 1, 2018). We independently used latent class analysis (LCA) in both cohorts to identify phenotypes using demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from the first 24 h of PICU admission. We then tested the association of the phenotypes with clinical outcomes in both cohorts.

Findings

LCA identified two distinct phenotypes that were comparable across both cohorts. Phenotype 1 was characterised by lower serum bicarbonate and albumin, markedly increased lactate and hepatic, renal, and coagulation abnormalities when compared to phenotype 2. Patients with phenotype 1 had a higher 90-day mortality (European cohort 29.2% versus 13.4%, U.S. cohort 27.3% versus 11.4%, p < 0.001) and received more vasopressor and renal replacement therapy than patients with phenotype 2. After adjusting for severity of organ dysfunction, haematological cancer, prior stem cell transplantation and age, phenotype 1 was associated with an adjusted OR of death at 90-day of 1.9 (1.04–3.34) in the European cohort and 1.6 (1.2–2.2) in the U.S. cohort.

Interpretation

We identified two clinically-relevant sepsis phenotypes in paediatric cancer patients that are reproducible across two international, multicentre cohorts with prognostic implications. These results may guide further research regarding therapeutic approaches for these specific phenotypes.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^113FC57P]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Formulation and strength of recommendations for pediatric sepsis — GRADE assessed quality of evidence from high to very low based on six domains: 1) risk of bias, 2) inconsistency, 3) indirectness, 4) imprecision, 5) publication bias, and 6) assessment of the balance between benefit and harm, patients' values and preferences, cost and resources, and feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Pediatric studies were prioritized and evidence from adult studies was generally down-graded due to indirectness. Recommendations were classified as strong or weak using the language We recommend or We suggest, respectively; a strong recommendation in favor meant desirable effects of adherence will clearly outweigh the undesirable effects, whereas a weak recommendation in favor meant they will probably outweigh the undesirable consequences, with diminished confidence when evidence was low or benefits and risks were closely balanced. Additional guidance stated that a strong recommendation does not necessarily imply a standard of care and that strong recommendations for an intervention were permitted based on low or very low quality of evidence when the intervention had the potential to improve survival and there was low risk for immediate harm.

### Sepsis: personalization V protocolization? [^113H2WS4]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Crucially, every prospective study specifically addressing the question of antibiotic delay and outcome fails to show a temporal relationship between early antibiotics and improved survival. What support there is derives from heavily adjusted retrospective analyses of incomplete databases usually collected for other reasons. Even then, the findings are inconsistent. Reasons for delay in delivering antibiotic treatment have also not been ascertained and may be highly pertinent. For example, Filbin et al. recently reported that a third of patients presenting to an emergency department with septic shock had vague symptoms not specific to infection and this represents a previously unrecognized confounder. Notably, a recent paper surveying deaths in six US hospitals found sepsis was present in half the cases and a direct cause of death in a third, yet only 3.7% of the sepsis-associated deaths were adjudged definitely or moderately preventable.

There are other examples of a rigid, protocolized approach not yielding outcome dividends. Patients in three prospective multicentre studies assessing the Rivers Early Goal-Directed Therapy strategy failed to show any benefit over standard-of-care. Multicentre trials in African adults and children with sepsis showed worse outcomes when applying a Western-based protocolized approach to management, perhaps related to a logistic inability to deal with iatrogenic complications induced by the approach.

In summary, guidelines are valuable as an aide memoire, but the evidence that strict protocols that demand homogenized management result in outcome benefit is weak at best. Excessive delay is not warranted and, perhaps analogous to managing haemorrhage, the speed of response in an individual septic patient is likely best dictated by their severity. Logically, treatment should be tailored to meet the individual's needs and underlying comorbidities.

### Evaluation of modified pediatric sepsis-induced coagulopathy score in pediatric septic shock [^1165Dmv3]. Thrombosis Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) is highly prevalent and plays an important role in the pathophysiology of sepsis. However, validated assessment tools for pediatric SIC under the 2024 pediatric sepsis criteria remain lacking. This study aimed to develop and validate a modified pediatric SIC (pSIC) score based on the Phoenix Sepsis Score (PSS) and evaluate its diagnostic and prognostic utility in children.

Methods

This retrospective study enrolled pediatric patients with septic shock admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University between May 2015 and August 2023. A modified pSIC score was developed by replacing the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score with the PSS based on the existing adult SIC criteria.

Results

Among 432 pediatric patients with septic shock, those with elevated modified pSIC score demonstrated significantly worse baseline characteristics and higher risks of adverse outcomes. The modified pSIC score exhibited higher predictive value for 28-day mortality compared to previous scores and maintained good predictive ability and high sensitivity for overt DIC. Survival curves confirmed significantly higher 28-day mortality in the high pSIC group than in the low pSIC group (38.2% vs 12.8%, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

In this single-center cohort of pediatric septic shock patients, the modified pSIC score demonstrated good diagnostic and prognostic utility for sepsis-induced coagulopathy under updated sepsis criteria. However, its effectiveness still needs to be further validated in broader pediatric sepsis population.

### Coagulation and the surgical neonate [^113zLx7c]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Both coagulopathy and abnormal thrombosis can complicate the anesthetic and surgical management of neonatal patients; however, the patterns of bleeding and thrombosis in neonates differ from those in adults or older children. Severe coagulopathic bleeding most commonly occurs during heart surgery and almost certainly contributes to morbidity and mortality in this population. Such severe bleeding is rare during other surgery; the exception is babies presenting to the operating room with established coagulopathy secondary to severe sepsis. Alternatively, pathological thrombosis will mainly occur in association with indwelling vascular access devices or surgically created vascular shunts. There are important differences between the coagulation system in neonates and older patients. The implication of this is that therapies established in other patient groups will not be optimal for neonates without adaptation. While evidence from high-quality clinical trials is rarely available, an understanding of how coagulation in neonates differs can help to guide practice. This review will discuss important differences between the coagulation system of neonates and older patients and how these relate to newer models of coagulation. The emphasis will be on issues likely to impact on perioperative care. In particular, the management of severe bleeding, the manipulation of coagulation during heart surgery, and the management of coagulopathy in septic neonates will be discussed in detail.

### Utility of thromboelastography and / or thromboelastometry in adults with sepsis: a systematic review [^112FKVKZ]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Ability of TEG/ROTEM to detect sepsis-induced coagulopathy

In five studies, all TEG/ROTEM measurements in sepsis were within reference values. These studies included a total of 176 sepsis and severe sepsis patients. In seven studies, TEG/ROTEM revealed pathologic changes ranging from distinct hypercoagulability to predominantly hypocoagulable profiles. Four prospective observational studies, together including 214 patients, reported heterogeneous results with patients showing hyper- and hypocoagulability. Impaired fibrinolysis in sepsis patients was demonstrated in five different observational studies, with a total of 162 patients. Two of these studies reported increased lysis indices as the only abnormal ROTEM parameter in 30 and 39 patients with septic shock. In a small cohort of 16 patients with severe sepsis; patients were randomized to tight glycemic control or conventional glucose levels; strict regulation of glucose levels resulted in enhancement of fibrinolysis, as measured by lysis index with ROTEM.

Overall, if sepsis-induced coagulopathy was detected, the proportion of sepsis patients with sepsis-induced coagulopathy that was detected by TEG/ROTEM ranged from 43% to 100%.

Altogether, in the majority of studies, TEG/ROTEM was able to detect sepsis-induced coagulopathy. However, changes in parameters were heterogeneous, and study designs varied widely, with a lack of clarity in interpretation of test results. Based on this, the quality of evidence supporting the use of TEG/ROTEM to detect sepsis-induced coagulopathy is considered low.

Additional value of TEG/ROTEM in sepsis compared with standard coagulation tests

Studies designed to compare conventional coagulation tests directly with TEG/ROTEM for the detection of sepsis-induced coagulopathy were not retrieved.

However, two studies assessed the value of thromboelastography in the detection of DIC. A prospective pilot study in 28 sepsis patients showed that CFT, MCF, and α angle discriminated moderately between overt DIC and no DIC. ROC values were 0.815 (CI, 0.624 to 0.935) for CFT, 0.891 (CI, 0.715 to 0.975) for MCF, and 0.828 (CI, 0.639 to 0.943) for α angle. Combination of CFT, MCF, and α resulted in a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 75%, with a positive likelihood ratio of 4.0 and negative likelihood ratio of 0.0 for the diagnosis of DIC.

### Transforming sepsis management: AI-driven innovations in early detection and tailored therapies [^117PhQ3W]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical challenges

Clinical studies have demonstrated higher survival rates of septic shock associated with earlier administration of antibiotics, this emphasizes the importance of rapid intervention to decrease mortality and morbidity. Patient heterogeneity adds to this complexity, with individual responses to infection varying based on genetics and health status. For instance, patients with underlying diseases such as diabetes mellitus, immunodeficiency, autoimmune diseases, chronic lung, kidney, or liver diseases, and cancer, as well as individuals at the extremes of age including newborns and the elderly, are more susceptible to severe infections and the development of sepsis. Recent advances in sepsis research underscore the need for molecular stratification of these patients to tailor treatment strategies.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing concern globally that complicates sepsis treatment. In some countries, the emergence of resistant pathogens has severely limited treatment options, often leaving clinicians with few or no effective therapies. As a result, resistant infections significantly contribute to the mortality burden, accounting for an estimated 1.27 million deaths worldwide annually. Early diagnosis and individualized treatment are essential for improving outcomes, yet current approaches often fail to address the heterogeneity of patient responses.

In 2021, Critical Care Medicine and Intensive Care Medicine published new guidelines for sepsis management, called The Surviving Sepsis Campaign, offering clinicians state-of-the-art instructions for treating patients with sepsis or septic shock. The guidelines stress the importance of early identification and appropriate management in the initial hours after sepsis development. As mentioned before, timely intervention in sepsis care is crucial, as for each hour delay of proper treatment, mortality increases by 7.6% from the onset of hypotension. To this end, early administration of antimicrobials and adequate hemodynamic resuscitation using fluids and vasopressors depending on the patient's needs, ideally within one hour of recognition, is essential for patients with hypotension and sepsis. The sepsis management guidelines recommend early elimination of the infection focus, including empiric administration of a combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics and, when necessary, surgical intervention such as incision and drainage of abscesses. It is important to note that samples for microbial analysis should be taken prior to antibiotic administration to increase the diagnostic yield. Additional treatment strategies addressing vascular leakage and endothelial dysfunction are also under investigation to stabilize circulatory collapse in sepsis. Sepsis-induced coagulopathy further complicates management and has been linked to poor outcomes in multiple studies.

### Predictive value of laboratory indicators for in-hospital death in children with community-onset sepsis: a prospective observational study of 266 patients [^111q8N5r]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Study design and setting

This is a prospective observational study implemented on participants admitted to the PICUs of two tertiary care hospitals between November 2016 and January 2020 in Beijing.

Study population

Patients were included if they met the following criteria: (1) community-acquired sepsis; (2) age < 18 years; (3) admission to the PICU within 24 hours after sepsis diagnosis; (4) laboratory results were obtained within 24 hours of PICU arrival. Exclusion criteria were set as the following: (1) other chronic diseases: such as cancer; cardiovascular disease; genetic disorder; endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases; respiratory diseases; neurological diseases; autoimmune diseases or immunodeficiency; (2) severe congenital malformations and trauma; (3) congenital disease; (4) long-term medication history.

Data collection and laboratory assays

We collected data based on three aspects: (1) demographic characteristics: age and sex; (2) laboratory test results including: source of infection, haematological, infection markers, coagulation, liver and kidney function, blood lipid, cardiac enzymes, lymphocyte subsets, humoral immunity and arterial blood gas — these tests were performed in the clinical laboratory departments of the two hospitals according to standard protocols; (3) the primary study outcome was the in-hospital mortality (death during hospitalisation and follow-up ceased at discharge), and the secondary outcomes were the length of PICU stay, complications and organ failure. For those who had more than one result for a given laboratory test within 24 hours of PICU arrival, only the first value was included.

Definitions

In our study, the diagnosis of sepsis was based on the Pediatric Sepsis Consensus in 2015 and Surviving Sepsis Campaign International Guidelines in 2012: (1) temperature > 38.5°C or < 35°C; (2) tachycardia (a heart rate exceeding 2 SDs above normal age-related values, which may be absent in the hypothermic patient); (3) at least one of the following indications of altered organ function: altered mental status, hypoxaemia/(arterial oxygen pressure/fractional inspired oxygen < 300 mm Hg), increased serum lactate level (> 1 mmol/L) or bounding pulses. Other definitions of complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), septic shock and organ failure, are included in online supplemental table 1.

### Communication from the scientific and standardization committee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis on sepsis-induced coagulopathy in the management of sepsis [^114GtYRt]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a life-threatening complication in sepsis and other critical conditions. The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) released the diagnostic criteria for overt DIC in 2001. Since then, ISTH overt DIC has been used as the global standard criterion for a decompensated stage of DIC. Because detecting an earlier stage of DIC would be useful for therapeutic considerations, the scientific standardization committees of the ISTH introduced the sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) scoring system in 2019. The SIC scoring system is specifically designed to detect the compensated phase of DIC in sepsis, which can lead to overt DIC with disease progression. Studies examining the performance of the SIC scoring system have reported its usefulness over the past 5 years. The reported incidence of SIC was approximately 60% in patients with sepsis, which was twice as much as that of overt DIC. Almost all patients with overt DIC were diagnosed with SIC earlier. The reported mortality of SIC was ≥ 30% and, thus, can be used for patient selection for anticoagulant therapy. Despite the limited data, some continue to suggest the potential efficacy of anticoagulant therapy in patients with SIC. Although heparin, antithrombin, and thrombomodulin are the candidates for anticoagulation, none of them have proven to be effective with robust evidence, and future trials are warranted.

### Management of patients on antithrombotic therapy with severe infections: a joint clinical consensus statement of the ESC working group on thrombosis, the ESC working group on atherosclerosis and vascular biology, and the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis [^112RqVV9]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with severe infections and a pre-existing indication for antithrombotic therapy, i.e. antiplatelet agents, anticoagulant drugs, or their combinations, require integrated clinical counselling among coagulation, infectious disease, and cardiology specialists, due to sepsis-induced coagulopathy that frequently occurs. Bacterial and viral pathogens constitute an increasing threat to global public health, especially for patients with ongoing antithrombotic treatment who have a high risk of thrombotic recurrences and high susceptibility to severe infections with increased morbidity and mortality. Similarly, sepsis survivors are at increased risk for major vascular events. Coagulopathy, which often complicates severe infections, is associated with a high mortality and obligates clinicians to adjust antithrombotic drug type and dosing to avoid bleeding while preventing thrombotic complications. This clinical consensus statement reviews the best available evidence to provide expert opinion and statements on the management of patients hospitalized for severe bacterial or viral infections with a pre-existing indication for antithrombotic therapy (single or combined), in whom sepsis-induced coagulopathy is often observed. Balancing the risk of thrombosis and bleeding in these patients and preventing infections with vaccines, if available, are crucial to prevent events or improve outcomes and prognosis.

### Distinct clinical phenotypes in paediatric cancer patients with sepsis are associated with different outcomes-an international multicentre retrospective study [^117PuhX8]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Identifying phenotypes in sepsis patients may enable precision medicine approaches. However, the generalisability of these phenotypes to specific patient populations is unclear. Given that paediatric cancer patients with sepsis have different host response and pathogen profiles and higher mortality rates when compared to non-cancer patients, we determined whether unique, reproducible, and clinically-relevant sepsis phenotypes exist in this specific patient population.

Methods

We studied patients with underlying malignancies admitted with sepsis to one of 25 paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) participating in two large, multi-centre, observational cohorts from the European SCOTER study (n = 383 patients; study period between January 1, 2018 and January 1, 2020) and the U.S. Novel Data-Driven Sepsis Phenotypes in Children study (n = 1898 patients; study period between January 1, 2012 and January 1, 2018). We independently used latent class analysis (LCA) in both cohorts to identify phenotypes using demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from the first 24 h of PICU admission. We then tested the association of the phenotypes with clinical outcomes in both cohorts.

Findings

LCA identified two distinct phenotypes that were comparable across both cohorts. Phenotype 1 was characterised by lower serum bicarbonate and albumin, markedly increased lactate and hepatic, renal, and coagulation abnormalities when compared to phenotype 2. Patients with phenotype 1 had a higher 90-day mortality (European cohort 29.2% versus 13.4%, U.S. cohort 27.3% versus 11.4%, p < 0.001) and received more vasopressor and renal replacement therapy than patients with phenotype 2. After adjusting for severity of organ dysfunction, haematological cancer, prior stem cell transplantation and age, phenotype 1 was associated with an adjusted OR of death at 90-day of 1.9 (1.04–3.34) in the European cohort and 1.6 (1.2–2.2) in the U.S. cohort.

Interpretation

We identified two clinically-relevant sepsis phenotypes in paediatric cancer patients that are reproducible across two international, multicentre cohorts with prognostic implications. These results may guide further research regarding therapeutic approaches for these specific phenotypes.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF SIC

In Vivo Thrombin Generation

Thrombin or factor (F) IIa is a serine protease, converter of fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin, potent mediator of platelet activation, and strong potentiator of systemic coagulation via a series of positive feedback reactions, that serve to maintain its own production (Figure 1). The process of in vivo thrombin generation occurs through 3 phases: initiation, amplification, and propagation. The initiation phase starts on tissue factor (TF)–expressing cells such as monocytes, endothelial cells (EC), or platelets. – TF, a procoagulant glycoprotein, binds to and converts FVII to activated FVII (FVIIa). TF and FVII are essential coagulation proteins as their complete deficiency results in fatal perinatal bleeding. The extrinsic tenase complex (TF + FVIIa) then activates FX and FV to form the prothrombinase complex (FXa + FVa), which proteolytically cleaves prothrombin to thrombin. In the amplification phase, thrombin strongly induces platelet activation, which creates more surface area for further clotting reactions. Thrombin also cleaves circulating FVIII from its carrier, von Willebrand factor (vWF), and converts it to its active form (FVIIIa). Extrinsic tenase and activated FXI will activate FIX to FIXa, which complexes with FVIIIa on activated platelets to form the intrinsic tenase (FIXa + FVIIIa) and further generate FXa and amplify thrombin generation. In the final phase of propagation, persistent amounts of thrombin are generated on activated platelets for continued coagulation.

Figure 1.
Thrombin generation and propagation during sepsis. Thrombin is a powerful positive feedback signaler for its own propagation. Sepsis results in the release of PAMPs from microbial sources, or DAMPs from injured host cells, both of which lead to immune cell activation and TF expression from monocytes, endothelial cells, and neutrophils with subsequent thrombin generation. Moreover, activated NETs serve as polyanionic surface for further thrombin generation. Platelet degranulation, leukocyte TF expression, NET formation, and PLA formation propagate (dotted lines) thrombin generation leading to fibrin production and platelet consumption resulting in microvascular thrombosis. DAMPs indicates danger-associated molecular patterns; NETs, neutrophil extracellular traps; PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular patterns; PLA, platelet-leukocyte aggregate; PSGL-1, p-selection (CD62p) glycoprotein ligand-1; TF, tissue factor; vWF, von Willebrand factor; WPB, Weibel Palade body.

Diagnostic criteria

Neonatal sepsis: Reference literature:
Clinical diagnosis: there are clinical abnormal manifestations, and all the following conditions meet at the same time: ①more than 2 nonspecific blood examinations are positive; ②cerebrospinal fluid examination was purulent meningitis change; ③pathogenic bacteria DNA is detected in blood.
Definite diagnosis: clinical manifestations, any positive result of microorganism cultures.

Neonatal AKI: At present, according to the standards of AKI clinical practice guidelines issued by the Global Committee for Improving the Prognosis of Kidney Disease (KDIGO) in 2013, the diagnosis of neonatal AKI mainly depends on the change of serum creatinine (CR) and urine volume. (Table 1).

Table 1
Neonatal KDIGO (Kidney Diseases: Improving Global Outcomes) acute kidney injury definition

a Reference SCr is the lowest prior SCr measurement

Neonatal sepsis-related AKI: meet both the diagnostic criteria for sepsis and AKI and exclude other causes for AKI.

Fluid overload (FO): gain weight10% or more compared with admission weight.

CRRT treatment

Indications of CRRT: Neonatal sepsis-related AKI stage 0 with FO, or Cr, electrolyte disorder or internal environment change was not obvious after regular treatment of AKI stage 1 and above, and coagulation function was normal or nearly normal.

Contraindications of CRRT: (1) Gestational age < 34 weeks, or body weight < 2.0 kg, (2) Non sepsis, (3) Non AKI, (4) Hypotension: as for hypotension, CRRT should be initiated after the blood pressure rises, (5) Bleeding tendency: CRRT could be performed after the coagulation function was partially corrected, or anticoagulant application could be reduced according to the coagulation function of children, (6) Intracranial hemorrhage: especially grade 3 and grade 4 intracranial hemorrhage, (7) Bleeding of important organs in vivo: CRRT could only be performed after hemostasis, and local anticoagulation in vitro with citric acid was used for treatment.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign pediatric sepsis — deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis: The panel states, 'We suggest against routine deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis (mechanical or pharmacologic) in critically ill children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction, but potential benefits may outweigh risks and costs in specific populations (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence)'. Evidence cited includes an open-label RCT in the PICU where 'Eleven of 78 patients (14.1%) randomized to reviparin had DVT proven on venogram versus 10 of 80 controls (12.5%) (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.42–3.23)'. The document further notes that 'A subsequent systematic review found the quality of evidence to be low and that the efficacy of low molecular weight heparin in preventing CVC-associated thrombosis is unknown (503)', outlines risk factors by stating 'CVCs represent the principal risk factor for DVT in infants' and that 'the risk of DVT increases in adolescence, obesity, cancer, and in those with multiple medical conditions, especially renal and cardiac disease', and concludes that 'At present, it is unknown whether certain high-risk populations of children with sepsis may benefit from DVT prophylaxis'.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock [^113PfTKx]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for severe sepsis and septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

We used a modified Delphi methodology for grading recommendations, built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations were provided to contrast adult and pediatric management.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category and not by hierarchy, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition; appropriate diagnostic studies to ascertain causative organisms before starting antibiotics; early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy; reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate; a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response; source control with attention to the method that balances risks and benefits; equivalence of crystalloid and colloid resuscitation; aggressive fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure; vasopressor preference for norepinephrine and dopamine; cautious use of vasopressin pending further studies; avoiding low-dose dopamine administration for renal protection; consideration of dobutamine inotropic therapy in some clinical situations; avoidance of supranormal oxygen delivery as a goal of therapy; stress-dose steroid therapy for septic shock; use of recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and high risk for death; with resolution of tissue hypoperfusion and in the absence of coronary artery disease or acute hemorrhage, targeting a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL; appropriate use of fresh frozen plasma and platelets; a low tidal volume and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy for acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome; application of a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome; a semirecumbent bed position unless contraindicated; protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia, using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions/lightening; avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible; maintenance of blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization; equivalence of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration and intermittent hemodialysis; lack of utility of bicarbonate use for pH ≥ 7.15; use of deep vein thrombosis/stress ulcer prophylaxis; and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate. Pediatric considerations included a more likely need for intubation due to low functional residual capacity; more difficult intravenous access; fluid resuscitation based on weight with 40–60 mL/kg or higher needed; decreased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance as the most common hemodynamic profile; greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points; unsettled issue of high-dose steroids for therapy of septic shock; and greater risk of hypoglycemia with aggressive glucose control.

Conclusion

Evidence-based recommendations can be made regarding many aspects of the acute management of sepsis and septic shock that are hoped to translate into improved outcomes for the critically ill patient. The impact of these guidelines will be formally tested and guidelines updated annually and even more rapidly as some important new knowledge becomes as available.

### Enigmatic role of coagulopathy among sepsis survivors: a review of coagulation abnormalities and their possible link to chronic critical illness [^114qMUqj]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

There are sparse clinical data addressing the persistence of disordered coagulation in sepsis and its role in chronic critical illness. Coagulopathy in the absence of anticoagulant therapy and/or liver disease can be highly variable in sepsis, but it tends to be prolonged in patients in the intensive care unit with a length of stay greater than 14 days. These coagulation abnormalities tend to precede multisystem organ failure and persistence of these coagulation derangements can predict 28-day mortality. The studies evaluated in this review consistently link sepsis-associated coagulopathy to poor long-term outcomes and indicate that disordered coagulation is associated with unfavorable outcomes in chronic critical illness. However, the causative mechanism and the definitive link remain unclear. Longer follow-up and more granular data will be required to fully understand coagulopathy in the context of chronic critical illness.

### Outcome of early hemostatic intervention in children with sepsis and nonovert disseminated intravascular coagulation admitted to PICU: a randomized controlled trial [^112WNDB2]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Evaluation of the outcome of early hemostatic management of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in patients with severe sepsis/septic shock admitted to PICU, before the development of clinically overt disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.

Design

Prospective interventional, open label randomized controlled clinical trial.

Setting

PICU at Alexandria University Children's Hospital.

Patients

The study included 80 patients with proven severe sepsis/septic shock in nonovert disseminated intravascular coagulopathy stage. They were randomly assigned into two groups (group 1 and group 2).

Interventions

Specific intervention was applied for group 1 (plasma transfusion, low-dose unfractionated heparin, and tranexamic acid).

Measurements

All patients had assessment of Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 score, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score, inotropic score, routine laboratory, and hemostatic tests including fibrin degradation products and d-dimers. Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy risk assessment scores were calculated on daily basis.

Results

Mortality rate was significantly higher in group 2. Progression to overt disseminated intravascular coagulopathy was significantly more common among group 2 patients than group 1 (45% and 10%, respectively) (p < 0.0001). Disseminated intravascular coagulopathyRisk Assessment Scores were significantly higher on the second and fifth days among group 2 patients. The initial specific hemostatic intervention was the only significant predictor of survival and prevention of progression to overt disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that early use of a combination of fresh frozen plasma transfusion, low-dose heparin, and tranexamic acid in children with severe sepsis/septic shock in the "window of opportunity" before the development of overt disseminated intravascular coagulopathy stage was associated with better outcome for survival and prevention of progression to overt disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, with no increase in bleeding risk. Larger multicenter studies are needed to further prove this practice.

### Early recognition and emergency treatment of sepsis and septic shock in children [^113H6zcE]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis and septic shock in children results in improved outcomes. However, diagnosis is hampered by lack of specific diagnostic tests and relies on the recognition of the alterations of vital signs and protean systemic manifestations associated with infections, signs that mimic many critical illnesses. As a result, the early diagnosis of sepsis is usually presumptive and is based on the suspicion or presence of an infection in combination with the systemic changes. Suspicion should be heightened in vulnerable risk groups such as those with immune compromise due to underlying disease or medication use. Thus, on many occasions, treatment of sepsis is initiated on clinical suspicion pending the outcomes of ongoing evaluations and laboratory findings. What is of relevance to the emergency clinicians is the initial recognition, resuscitation, and treatment in the first few hours of presentation. To best accomplish these tasks, contemporary guidelines suggest that the use of a "recognition bundle" containing a trigger tool for rapid identification, a "resuscitation and stabilization bundle" to enable adherence to best practice, and a "performance bundle" to identify and overcome barriers to best practice be used. Although there are no universally acceptable tools to accomplish these tasks, the various iterations used in quality improvement initiatives have consistently demonstrated better care processes and outcomes. In this article, we outline the contemporary approach to sepsis in the first hours after presentation.

Liver biopsy — conditions warranting additional caution for bleeding risk: Several conditions are more definitely associated with enhanced risk of bleeding and therefore warrant additional caution, including factor VIII (FVIII) or IX (FIX) deficiency, von Willebrand's disease (vWD), cholestasis, renal failure or uremia, and ongoing sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Careful monitoring and correction when possible of these conditions is a key element, and patients with hemophilia and DIC are best handled in conjunction with hematology.

### Is lactate the new panacea for endothelial dysfunction? [^112q383Q]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Third, although more rescue starch boluses were given in the observation period (second 12 hours), suggesting that the effect of HSL is short-lived, less blood products were required, implicating a reduction in coagulopathy. The reason for this is unclear but may be related to less hemodilution and higher pH associated with HSL infusion.

The study by Somasetia and colleagues was a pilot study with sVCAM-1 as a primary surrogate outcome of limited clinical importance. Despite this, the authors made a substantial contribution to the important field of fluid resuscitation in sepsis, particularly in the pediatric population. The Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy (FEAST) study has already challenged the concept that large-volume fluid resuscitation is beneficial in sepsis, and this study suggests that by using HSL solution instead of standard fluid therapy, a smaller volume is required, and this could be associated with less coagulopathy while providing useful energetic substrate for vital organs, reduce inflammation, correct acidosis, and end up with a reasonable fluid balance avoiding the 'Michelin man' effect (increased interstitial fluid accumulation and peripheral edema). Although the FEAST trial concerned fluid resuscitation in bacterial sepsis and malaria, which have pathogeneses different from those of DHF, endothelial cell dysfunction is common to all. So one may agree with the authors: 'from a theoretical point of view, the optimal treatment should address both the cause (endothelial dysfunction) and consequence (hypovolemia)' of increased vascular permeability. This work thus may prompt trials of hypertonic lactate resuscitation in sepsis with the aim to restore vascular permeability. Nevertheless, one needs to take into account the potentially deleterious effects of lactate on immune function in sepsis.
