## Question

A 56-year-old woman with a history of recurrent pyogenic cholangitis presents with right upper quadrant pain, intermittent fever, and jaundice. Laboratory studies reveal elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin. Abdominal imaging demonstrates multiple intrahepatic stones (hepatolithiasis) with mild intrahepatic ductal dilatation. She has had two prior ERCPs for stone extraction, but residual stones remain in the left hepatic duct. The gastroenterology team is considering further management options.

According to current expert consensus guidelines, what is the recommended approach to management for this patient with hepatolithiasis and residual intrahepatic stones?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended management approach for a 56-year-old woman with recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, residual left-sided hepatolithiasis after two prior ERCPs, and ongoing symptoms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and risk stratification. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines say about hepatolithiasis and the need for a multidisciplinary approach. Next, I will examine endoscopic options, including cholangioscopy and intraductal lithotripsy, and their success rates. After that, I should consider percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy and when it is indicated. Then, I will evaluate surgical options, including hepatectomy and biliary-enteric bypass, and their outcomes. Finally, I will integrate these into a staged, patient-centered plan with contingencies for failure and recurrence prevention, and I will double-check that each step aligns with guideline-backed evidence and local expertise considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and risk framing. This patient has recurrent pyogenic cholangitis with residual intrahepatic stones in the left hepatic duct after two ERCPs, which places her at high risk for ongoing cholangitis, biliary strictures, and cholangiocarcinoma. Importantly, hepatolithiasis is a recognized risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma, so definitive clearance and correction of anatomy are critical to long-term outcomes [^4b7363fe] [^2c6efc3a].

> Next, I should review guideline direction. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check whether any single-modality approach is endorsed. The ASGE guideline explicitly recommends a multidisciplinary approach incorporating endoscopy, interventional radiology, and surgery for hepatolithiasis, reflecting the disease's complexity and the limitations of ERCP alone in this setting [^e34f41ec] [^682aae2b].

> I will now examine advanced endoscopic options. Wait, let me verify the role of cholangioscopy and intraductal lithotripsy. The ASGE guideline supports intraductal therapy, including electrohydraulic or laser lithotripsy, for large or difficult bile duct stones, and cholangioscopy-guided approaches have shown high success in difficult scenarios, including Mirizzi syndrome and intrahepatic stones, with success rates often exceeding conventional ERCP when stones are impacted or proximal [^abfefbf7] [^682aae2b]. But I should confirm feasibility in the left hepatic duct; cholangioscopy can access intrahepatic ducts and facilitate targeted lithotripsy, though success depends on stricture management and stone burden, and repeated sessions may be needed [^e15c63d0] [^3feed1bc].

> Let me consider percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy. I should double-check outcomes in recurrent pyogenic cholangitis. The ASGE guideline notes that in RPC, PTCS achieves clearance in approximately 85% of patients, and it is particularly useful when endoscopic access is limited or when there are peripheral intrahepatic stones and strictures that are difficult to traverse endoscopically [^9016f4cd]. Historically, PTCS has been a cornerstone for complex intrahepatic stone disease and remains a reasonable next step when ERCP fails or is not feasible, with the caveat of catheter-related morbidity and the need for serial procedures [^9016f4cd] [^e1646001].

> Now, I should review surgical options. Hepatectomy offers the highest likelihood of definitive clearance when disease is unilateral or segmental, with reported success rates around 98% in selected series, and it addresses both stones and strictures or atrophic parenchyma. However, I need to ensure liver reserve is adequate and that the stone distribution is amenable to resection, as bilateral disease or insufficient remnant volume may preclude this option [^621c3c11]. For diffuse disease or when resection is not feasible, biliary-enteric bypass such as hepaticojejunostomy can improve drainage and facilitate postoperative cholangioscopy for residual stones, though it does not remove the diseased segment and carries recurrence risk if strictures persist [^328b12b0] [^2c6efc3a].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of postoperative cholangioscopy. If a surgical approach is chosen, planned T-tube or access for postoperative cholangioscopy can be incorporated to manage anticipated residual stones, and structured POC protocols with stricture dilation and lithotripsy have been described, though much of this literature is lower quality and center-specific, so I should frame it as an adjunct rather than a standalone solution [^0af58b4a] [^6c3ede67].

> Let me synthesize a staged, multidisciplinary plan. Given two failed ERCPs and left-sided disease, I would favor a multidisciplinary conference to align endoscopic, interventional radiology, and surgical expertise. Initially, I thought to repeat ERCP with cholangioscopy one more time, but wait, I should correct that impulse; after two failures, the yield is low and the risk of nontherapeutic ERCP is nontrivial, so escalation is reasonable. A practical sequence is to attempt cholangioscopy-assisted intraductal lithotripsy if local expertise and anatomy permit, recognizing that stricture management will be essential; if this fails or is not feasible, proceed to PTCS for clearance; and if disease is localized to the left with parenchymal atrophy or fibrosis, consider left hepatectomy for definitive management, with contingency for biliary-enteric bypass if diffuse strictures or bilateral disease are present [^e34f41ec] [^682aae2b] [^9016f4cd] [^621c3c11].

> I need to ensure we address recurrence prevention and surveillance. Stricture management, whether by dilation or surgical correction, is critical because untreated strictures drive recurrence and cholangitis. Long-term follow-up with MRCP or ultrasound and liver tests is prudent to detect recurrence early, and patients should be counseled on symptoms of cholangitis and jaundice that warrant prompt evaluation [^4b7363fe] [^2c6efc3a].

> Finally, I should confirm that the recommendation strength aligns with guidelines. The ASGE recommendation for a multidisciplinary approach to hepatolithiasis is a conditional suggestion based on low-to-very low certainty evidence, so shared decision-making that incorporates patient preferences, local expertise, and comorbidities is essential. I should also note that while hepatectomy can reduce cancer risk in selected patients, there is insufficient evidence to recommend resection solely to prevent cholangiocarcinoma in all hepatolithiasis patients, reinforcing the need for individualized, anatomy-driven strategies [^e34f41ec] [^41415fa2].

For residual hepatolithiasis after failed ERCP, **multidisciplinary care** is essential [^e34f41ec], with percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy (PTCS) as the preferred next step for complex intrahepatic stones, achieving ~85% clearance [^9016f4cd] and enabling repeated sessions with lithotripsy and stricture management [^0af58b4a]. If PTCS is unavailable or fails, **hepatic resection** is indicated for unilateral disease with atrophy or stricture, offering durable clearance and reducing recurrence [^621c3c11] [^5359e162]. Postoperative cholangioscopy via T-tube or biliary-enteric access can treat residual stones [^0af58b4a] [^3feed1bc]. Antibiotics are used for cholangitis, and long-term surveillance with MRCP or ultrasound is recommended to detect recurrence [^notfound].

---

## Multidisciplinary approach

A **multidisciplinary team** comprising gastroenterologists, interventional radiologists, and hepatobiliary surgeons is essential for optimal outcomes [^e34f41ec]. This collaborative approach ensures comprehensive evaluation, individualized treatment planning, and access to advanced therapeutic modalities [^682aae2b].

---

## Percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy (PTCS)

PTCS is the **preferred minimally invasive approach** for residual hepatolithiasis, particularly when ERCP fails or is not feasible [^9016f4cd]. It involves creating a percutaneous tract into the biliary tree, allowing direct visualization and removal of stones using cholangioscopy and lithotripsy [^0af58b4a].

- **Success rate**: PTCS achieves stone clearance in approximately 85.3% of patients with recurrent pyogenic cholangitis [^9016f4cd].
- **Advantages**: PTCS allows repeated sessions, effective management of strictures, and removal of large or impacted stones [^0af58b4a].
- **Limitations**: PTCS requires patient tolerance of an external drain and carries risks of bleeding, infection, and bile leakage [^notfound].

---

## Surgical intervention

Surgical intervention is indicated for patients with **unilateral disease**, significant hepatic atrophy, or refractory strictures. Hepatic resection simultaneously removes stones, strictures, and diseased liver parenchyma, reducing recurrence and the risk of cholangiocarcinoma [^5359e162].

- **Success rate**: Hepatic resection achieves stone clearance in over 80% of patients with severe intrahepatic stone disease [^9016f4cd].
- **Indications**: Unilateral disease with atrophy, fibrosis, or suspicion of malignancy [^621c3c11].
- **Limitations**: Surgical morbidity, mortality, and the need for adequate hepatic reserve [^621c3c11].

---

## Postoperative cholangioscopy

Postoperative cholangioscopy via T-tube tract or biliary-enteric anastomosis is effective for **residual stones** after surgical intervention [^0af58c4a]. This approach allows direct visualization and removal of stones, with reported clearance rates of 60–90% [^e15c63d0].

---

## Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)

While ERCP remains a cornerstone for choledocholithiasis, its role in hepatolithiasis is limited by **difficulty accessing intrahepatic ducts** and lower success rates for residual stones [^95533156]. Advanced techniques such as balloon-assisted ERCP or cholangioscopy-assisted lithotripsy may improve outcomes in selected patients [^682aae2b].

---

## Antibiotic therapy and supportive care

Antibiotic therapy is essential for **managing acute cholangitis** and preventing recurrence. Supportive care, including hydration, nutritional support, and monitoring of liver function, is also critical [^11de8129].

---

## Long-term surveillance

Long-term surveillance with periodic imaging (MRCP or ultrasound) and liver function tests is recommended to detect **recurrence** early and guide timely intervention [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommended approach

| **Step** | **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Success rate** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Multidisciplinary evaluation | All patients | N/A |
| 2 | PTCS | Residual stones after failed ERCP | 85.3% [^9016f4cd] |
| 3 | Hepatic resection | Unilateral disease, atrophy, strictures | > 80% [^9016f4cd] |
| 4 | Postoperative cholangioscopy | Residual stones after surgery | 60–90% [^e15c63d0] |
| 5 | Antibiotic therapy | Acute cholangitis | N/A |
| 6 | Long-term surveillance | All patients | N/A |

---

The recommended approach for residual hepatolithiasis after failed ERCP is a **multidisciplinary strategy** prioritizing PTCS for complex intrahepatic stones, with surgical resection for unilateral disease or refractory strictures, and postoperative cholangioscopy for residual stones. Antibiotic therapy and long-term surveillance are essential to prevent recurrence and manage complications [^e34f41ec].

Complicated calculi management by POC

The management of hepatolithiasis is based upon complete removal of calculi, elimination of biliary strictures and reduction of calculus recurrence. In spite of advances in cholangioscopy, problems such as intrahepatic strictures, the presence of large and impacted calculi and unreached peripheral calculi are the major obstacles to success.

### Step-by-step strategy in the management of residual hepatolithiasis using post-operative cholangioscopy [^0af58b4a]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Hepatolithiasis is the presence of calculi within the intrahepatic bile duct specifically located proximal to the confluence of the left and right hepatic ducts. The ultimate goal of hepatolithiasis treatment is the complete removal of the stone, the correction of the associated strictures and the prevention of recurrent cholangitis. Although hepatectomy could effectively achieve the above goals, it can be restricted by the risk of insufficient residual liver volume, and has a 15.6% rate of residual hepatolithiasis. With improvements in minimally invasive surgery, post-operative cholangioscopy (POC), provides an additional option for hepatolithiasis treatment with higher clearance rate and fewer severe complications. POC is very safe, and can be performed repeatedly until full patient benefit is achieved. During POC three main steps are accomplished: first, the analysis of the residual hepatolithiasis distribution indirectly by imaging methods or directly endoscopic observation; second, the establishment of the surgical pathway to relieve the strictures; and third, the removal of the stone by a combination of different techniques such as simple basket extraction, mechanical fragmentation, electrohydraulic lithotripsy or laser lithotripsy, among others. In summary, a step-by-step strategy of POC should be put forward to standardize the procedures, especially when dealing with complicated residual hepatolithiasis. This review briefly summarizes the classification, management and complications of hepatolithiasis during the POC process.

Introduction

Hepatolithiasis, defined as intrahepatic duct calculi, is a benign bile disease with a challenging treatment and high recurrence.The prevalence of hepatolithiasis is persistently high, especially in East Asian countries, including China, Korea, Malaysia and Indonesia. Bile stasis, repeated infection and biliary ascariasis are considered important risk factors.Hepatolithiasis may be complicated by biliary strictures, liver abscess, liver cirrhosis and cholangiocarcinoma.Although the current understanding of the disease has increased globally, there is still an urgent need for treatments in both the East and West.

In general, the ultimate goal of treating hepatolithiasis is the clearance of calculi, the correction of strictures, the removal of lesions and the restoration of bile drainage.The most efficient treatment for patients with hepatolithiasis remains unclear. With improved medical technology, it has been reported that various therapeutic measures are available for the management of hepatolithiasis, including surgical treatments, endoscopic approaches, liver transplantation, chemical bile duct embolization (CBDE) and a combination of these. – Generally, hepatectomy seems to be the optimal treatment, reducing the risk of recurrent intrahepatic calculi and cholangitis by removing the calculi and lesions simultaneously.However, hepatectomy is applied primarily for patients with calculi distributed on one side of the diseased hepatic lobe or segment with atrophy, fibrosis or cirrhosis, and it is not suitable when intrahepatic biliary calculi are present in both hepatic lobes.It also goes against the ideal of maximum retention of normal liver tissue. Owing to these limitations, the reported complete clearance is low and the incidence of residual bile duct calculi in patients is still high.

In recent years, new endoscopic procedures, such as post-operative cholangioscopy (POC), percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy (PTCS), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and direct peroral cholangioscopy have been proven efficient in the treatment of residual hepatolithiasis with/without surgery.POC provides an attractive option for complicated indications. The procedures of POC have been shown to be simple and safe, and result in fewer complications, especially in the treatment of recurrent/peripheral calculi and indeterminate strictures. At our hepatolithiasis treatment centre in China, we successfully treat >3000 POC cases each year. In this review, we aim to briefly summarize the POC-related techniques used in the management of residual hepatolithiasis.

Step-by-step strategy of POC

Hepatic resection has been the prior choice for the treatment of hepatolithiasis, because resection removes not only the calculi but also the associated pathologic lesions. Unfortunately, application of partial hepatic resection is difficult when the calculi is not confined to one segment or lobe of the liver. Hence, partial resection is usually accompanied by choledocholithotomy/choledochojejunostomy and subsequent T-tube placement to allow POC therapy.

To better regulate the cholangioscopic operation, we put forward a step-by-step strategy to treat residual hepatolithiasis (Figure 4). Efficient pre-operative preparations promote successful POC. During Stage 1, diagnosis by multiple imaging methods (US/EUS, CT, MRCP, etc.) and observation by cholangioscopy (POC, PTCS, ERCP, etc.) are required to evaluate residual hepatolithiasis, including the function of papillary, the diameter of each bile duct, location of calculi, the number of calculi and the maximum size of calculus, which is used for strategy choice. It is imperative to ensure the maturation of the T-tube track to avoid bile leakage; at least 4 weeks for patients in general condition, and 12 weeks for patients with diabetes mellitus or malnutrition. Before a session of POC, pre-operative preparation is conducted in a similar manner as for an ERCP.Patients are given pethidine (50 mg) by intramuscular injection and positioned supine. When the calculi are located in the left lobe, the right lateral decubitus is appropriate for angle manipulation. If it is located in the right lobe, the opposite is recommended.

Figure 4. 
Flow chart of step-by-step strategy for management of hepatolithiasis under post-operative cholangioscopy (POC). Three stages are established for the management of hepatolithiasis. Stage 1 consists of the imaging methods and POC for analysing the calculi situation and making a strategy choice. Stage 2 aims to relieve strictured bile ducts. Stage 3 is to remove the calculi by a combination of: irrigation/suction of saline solution under different pressure, extraction with a basket, lithotripsy via laser or hydroelectric, clamping through biopsy forceps.

### Step-by-step strategy in the management of residual hepatolithiasis using post-operative cholangioscopy [^5359e162]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Management of hepatolithiasis

A reasonable treatment is required to resolve long-standing cholangitis, reduce the recurrence of hepatolithiasis and avoid the later development of cholangiocarcinoma.Surgical procedures are considered to be preponderant in the treatment of unilateral hepatolithiasis with atrophy or fibrosis.When combined with other improved supplementary measures, it could be more precise and efficacious than hepatectomy. Three-dimensional visualization technology has guided hepatic segment resection, achieving accurate pre-operative diagnosis and higher complete stone clearance rates.Robotic liver resection reduces blood loss and shortens hospital stays compared with the traditional open approach.However, the complexity and variability of the hepatic anatomy in complicated hepatolithiasis increases surgery-related complications.

Although intra-operative cholangioscopy promotes the rate of clearance, it is impossible to attain full calculi clearance during the operation because of the limited resection range during hepatectomy and the long periods of anaesthesia.Patients with poor general condition are not able to withstand the surgery. Therefore, endoscopy causes less injury in the treatment of hepatolithiasis in cases of high surgical risk and previous biliary operations.Intra-/post-operative POC is associated with reductions in the rates of residual stones and re-operation.PTCS is a reasonable alternative or supplementary therapy for hepatolithiasis when a partial hepatectomy is not indicated, especially with dilatated bile ducts.ERCP and peroral cholangioscopy have played an important role in common bile duct (CBD) stones; in a similar manner the traditional mother–daughter system has helped to non-invasively diagnose and manage stones within the bile duct tree. In terminal hepatolithiasis there is severe liver failure, for which a healthy donor liver is required.Though surgical techniques and peri-operative management could fully meet the needs of liver transplantation, only 27 successful cases have been reported in four centres since 2002.CBDE has been experimentally proved to be a potentially effective therapeutic approach for treating and preventing the recurrence of hepatolithiasis.It is rarely used in clinical practice, except for two cases reported in 2008.

History and procedure of POC in treating hepatolithiasis

In the 1940s, cholangioscopy was first introduced; its use was popularized in the following decades.Direct endoscopic view of the biliary tree first occurred when an endoscopist examined a patient with choledochoduodenostomy.Since then, cholangioscopy was utilized for patients with calculi located within the intrahepatic bile ducts.

POC has been reported to be a safe and simple procedure that is useful in the treatment of intrahepatic stones.As a minimally invasive technique, cholangioscopy gradually evolved from the rigid to the soft, and from fibre-optic scope to electronic scope. It has a higher rate of biliary calculi removal and lower rate of recurrence and complications. POC is well-suited for patients without full clearance of calculi during surgery,and the general procedure is as follows. After the cholangioscope (CHF-V, Olympus, Japan; ECN-1530, PENTAX, Tokyo, Japan) is introduced into bile ducts through the sinus, the examination of CBD and intrahepatic bile ducts is conducted to differentiate the normal, dilatated and strictured lumens (Figure 1(a–c)), to confirm the mucosal condition of the stem and branch tracks (Figure 1(a) and (d)), and to evaluate the distribution, quantity, size and characters of calculi (Figure 1(e)). A comet tail sign often indicates impacted stones (Figure 1(f)). Then, hepatolithiasis is managed by repeated irrigation, basket extraction, lithotripsy and so on through the accessory sinus of the cholangioscope. The reported success rate of POC for residual stone removal ranges from 60 to 90% for intrahepatic duct calculi. Kong and colleagues reported 2882 POC sessions performed on 986 patients with residual bile duct stones from 1980 to 2008, resulting in no mortalities, 28 failures, 13 complications and 95.5% clearance of cases.

Figure 1. 
Endoscopic examination of intrahepatic bile ducts. Normal bile ducts (a), dilatated bile ducts (b) and strictured bile ducts (c) were seen under cholangioscopy. Inflammatory mucosa (d) was often shown after removal of calculi due to cholangitis. Two types of complicated calculi were present, including obvious impacted stones (e) and hidden stones in the form of a comet tail sign (f).

### ASGE guideline on the role of endoscopy in the evaluation and management of choledocholithiasis [^f5c846aa]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2019). High credibility.

ASGE guideline—operative timing and special scenarios recommends that same-admission cholecystectomy is recommended for patients with mild gallstone pancreatitis. We suggest that pre-operative or post operative ERCP or laparoscopic treatment be performed for patients at high risk of choledocholithiasis or positive intraoperative cholangiopancreatography depending on local surgical and endoscopic expertise. For patients with Mirizzi syndrome, per-oral cholangioscopic therapy may be an alternative to surgical management depending on local expertise; however, gallbladder resection is needed regardless of strategy. For hepatolithiasis we suggest a multidisciplinary approach including endoscopy, interventional radiology, and surgery. Plastic and covered metal stents may facilitate removal of difficult choledocholithiasis but require planned exchange or removal.

### Updated guideline on the management of common bile duct stones (CBDS) [^f00e70b4]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Common bile duct stones (CBDS) are estimated to be present in 10-20% of individuals with symptomatic gallstones. They can result in a number of health problems, including pain, jaundice, infection and acute pancreatitis. A variety of imaging modalities can be employed to identify the condition, while management of confirmed cases of CBDS may involve endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, surgery and radiological methods of stone extraction. Clinicians are therefore confronted with a number of potentially valid options to diagnose and treat individuals with suspected CBDS. The British Society of Gastroenterology first published a guideline on the management of CBDS in 2008. Since then a number of developments in management have occurred along with further systematic reviews of the available evidence. The following recommendations reflect these changes and provide updated guidance to healthcare professionals who are involved in the care of adult patients with suspected or proven CBDS. It is not a protocol and the recommendations contained within should not replace individual clinical judgement.

In patients with T-tube drainage, the fixation is released from the nape, and the T-tube is slowly pulled out to avoid track eversion. The cholangioscope is introduced into the bile ducts through the tracks, and an examination of CBD and intrahepatic bile ducts is conducted to confirm the mucosal condition of the stem and branch tracks and to re-evaluate the distribution, quantity and size of the calculi. In patients with choledochojejunostomy, the cholangioscope is introduced into the afferent loop of the jejunum, and the anastomotic stoma of choledochojejunostomy is confirmed. The same procedure is performed in patients with choledocholithotomy. Persistent irrigation with saline solution is needed to ensure a clear view. If there are strictures in the intrahepatic bile ducts, repeated dilatation and a long period of stenting for drainage should be performed in the next stage. If there are no strictures, the management of calculi is considered. When dealing with the calculi, it is imperative to first irrigate with saline and suction to pull muddy or finely divided calculi out through the sinus, or push them out through duodenal papilla or anastomotic stoma. Subsequently, baskets or grasping forceps are inserted through the accessory sinus of the cholangioscope to remove calculi, the diameter of which is shorter than that of the T-tube track. Third, large or impacted calculi are fragmented by introducing a probe for lithotripsy, and then fragments are extracted by basket through the sinus or pushed into the enteric cavity from the duodenal papilla or the anastomotic stoma. If lithotripsy fails, biopsy forceps are considered for clamping the tough surface to facilitate the follow-up lithotripsy. Repeated manipulations and combinations of the above multiple approaches in the procedure increases the rate of clearance. POC operational methods in management of residual hepatolithiasis are summarized in Table 1, according to the size, property and impaction of the calculi. A catheter is placed when repeated procedures (at least 1 week interval) are required.Antibody and transamin are generally used post-lithotripsy in cholangioscopy if there is poor-condition mucosa to prevent cholangitis and haemorrhage.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for Mirizzi syndrome and hepatolithiasis—recommendations and key data: For patients with Mirizzi syndrome, peroral cholangioscopic therapy may be an alternative to surgical management depending on local expertise; however, gallbladder resection is needed regardless of strategy. For hepatolithiasis we suggest a multidisciplinary approach including endoscopy, interventional radiology, and surgery. Approximately .3% to 1.4% of patients will develop Mirizzi syndrome; in a recent cohort, conventional ERCP techniques were successful in only 40% of patients (8/20), and the addition of cholangioscopy-guided holmium laser enabled endoscopic clearance in the remaining 60% (12/20); larger series revealed a success rate of 75% to 91% for cholangioscopy-guided intraductal approaches to treat Mirizzi syndrome; even after cholecystectomy 10% may develop subsequent biliary problems.

993. Recurrence of cholangitis. Results Most patients in the liver resection group had stones localized to the left side. The overall success rate in this group was 98. 0%. The chance of biliary sepsis at 5 years after resection was 13. 3%. Percutaneous choledochoscopy has been widely used for the treatment of complex hepatolithiasis. The rate of recurrence of stones or symptoms remains high, especially for those with intrahepatic strictures.

1-5 In a selected group of patients undergoing liver resection, the result was promising. 6-9 Most surgeons would advocate resection if the diseased liver was localized to the left side, if it was atrophic, or if there was a suspicion of superimposed malignancy. We report herein on a series of patients with hepatolithiasis who were treated with LR. They were compared and contrasted with patients whose intrahepatic stones were treated primarily by stone removal via percutaneous choledochoscopy. The selection criteria, patient characteristics, treatment results, and especially the long-term outcomes were analyzed. On the basis of these results, the treatment strategy for patients with complex hepatolithiasis can be modified. Between January 1, 1989, and September 30, 2003, in the Department of Surgery, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong, LR was performed on 52 patients who presented with hepatolithiasis related to recurrent pyogenic cholangitis.

All patients with a preoperative diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma associated with intrahepatic stones were excluded from this analysis. Cholangitis or other biliary sepsis occurring during the follow-up period was regarded as an unfavorable event. Patients requiring another operation or procedure to remove stones were also regarded as having had an unfavorable outcome. This was analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method. The test statistics for equality of recurrence distribution were analyzed with the log-rank test. The characteristics of patients in the LR and SR groups are shown in Table 2. Most of them presented with cholangitis, pancreatitis, or liver abscess. Among the 52 patients who underwent laparotomy for LR, only 19 had not had any previous biliary operations, as compared with 67 of 149 in the SR group. Two patients were found to have cholangiocarcinoma in the resected specimens. The complications after LR are shown in Table 3.

The overall complication rate was
44. 2%. The in-hospital mortality rate was 3. 8%. Apart from exploration of the common bile ducts, 2 patients had sphincteroplasty and 3 patients had hepaticojejunostomy performed concomitantly. In the SR group, 3 patients were diagnosed as having cholangiocarcinoma during the choledochoscopic examinations and 4 other patients died in the hospital after the procedure. Two patients in the LR group and 13 patients in the SR group defaulted on their follow-ups within 6 months of their discharge. For those without and with stricture, the chance of such an occurrence at 5 years was 26. 4% and
43. 2%, respectively. Five other patients in the SR group subsequently developed cholangiocarcinoma during follow-up. The overall incidence of cholangiocarcinoma in all patients was 10 of 174 patients. Recurrent pyogenic hepatolithiasis is characterized by its natural course of recurrent cholangitis.

ASGE guideline—Strength of recommendation (GRADE) is labeled as either strong or conditional, with standard wording and practical implications by audience. The recommendations are labeled as either “strong” or “conditional” according to the GRADE approach, and the words “the guideline panel recommend” are used for strong recommendations and “suggest” for conditional recommendations. For patients: Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not for strong recommendations, whereas most individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not for conditional recommendations. For clinicians: Most individuals should receive the intervention and formal decision aids are not likely to be needed for strong recommendations, whereas for conditional recommendations different choices will be appropriate for individual patients, clinicians must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with his or her values and preferences, and decision aids may be useful. For policymakers: The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations and adherence could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator for strong recommendations, whereas conditional recommendations mean policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

### Clinical spotlight review for the management of choledocholithiasis [^95533156]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Pre-operative choledocholithiasis management—If choledocholithiasis is confirmed pre-operatively, options for clearance of the common bile duct (CBD) include endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) before cholecystectomy or common bile duct exploration with cholecystectomy; ERCP is highly sensitive and specific and therapeutic to clear stones, with a success rate of approximately 80–90% for ductal clearance. Reasons for failure include large or impacted stones, duodenal diverticula, altered gastric or duodenal anatomy and intrahepatic stones, and risks include pancreatitis (1.3–6.7%), infection (0.6–5%), hemorrhage (0.3–2%), perforation (0.1–1%) and mortality (up to 1%). Following biliary clearance with ERCP, it is generally recommended to proceed with subsequent cholecystectomy to prevent recurrent symptomatic cholelithiasis which occurs in approximately 20% of patients. However, in patients with advanced comorbidities who are at significantly high risk for operative intervention, ERCP with sphincterotomy without further intervention can also be considered definitive therapy, as there has been no statistical difference in mortality.

### ASGE guideline on the role of endoscopy in the evaluation and management of choledocholithiasis [^e8de0b79]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Each year choledocholithiasis results in biliary obstruction, cholangitis, and pancreatitis in a significant number of patients. The primary treatment, ERCP, is minimally invasive but associated with adverse events in 6% to 15%. This American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) Standard of Practice (SOP) Guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the endoscopic evaluation and treatment of choledocholithiasis. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was used to rigorously review and synthesize the contemporary literature regarding the following topics: EUS versus MRCP for diagnosis, the role of early ERCP in gallstone pancreatitis, endoscopic papillary dilation after sphincterotomy versus sphincterotomy alone for large bile duct stones, and impact of ERCP-guided intraductal therapy for large and difficult choledocholithiasis. Comprehensive systematic reviews were also performed to assess the following: same-admission cholecystectomy for gallstone pancreatitis, clinical predictors of choledocholithiasis, optimal timing of ERCP vis-à-vis cholecystectomy, management of Mirizzi syndrome and hepatolithiasis, and biliary stent therapy for choledocholithiasis. Core clinical questions were derived using an iterative process by the ASGE SOP Committee. This body developed all recommendations founded on the certainty of the evidence, balance of risks and harms, consideration of stakeholder preferences, resource utilization, and cost-effectiveness.

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^01850f43]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Optimal management of acute biliary disease should include an assessment for possible choledocholithiasis (CBDS). Various diagnostic guidelines have been developed by expert bodies for this purpose, but uncertainties remain about their performance in wider practice.

Methods

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus for studies on adult populations published in English language between 2000 and August 2024. All studies pertaining to the performance of diagnostic guidelines developed or adopted by regional, national, or international professional bodies are considered, but we excluded diagnostic tools or scoring systems developed locally with limited scopes, such as those employed by a single institution or a group of related institutions. We extracted or derived performance measures in the forms of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative and performed meta-analysis using a multilevel random effects model to calculate pooled sensitivity and specificity for the reviewed guidelines and summarized their performance using summary ROC curves and AUCs. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the PROBAST risk of bias and applicability tool. This study is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024581409).

Findings

Of 1892 records identified, 31 studies were eligible with data available, all of which had a low to moderate risk of overall bias. All studies focused on one or more of three international guidelines, namely the ASGE guidelines in 2010, the revised ASGE guidelines in 2019, and the ESGE guidelines in 2019. For distinguishing patients at high risk for CBDS from those not at high risk, ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines have pooled sensitivities of 65% (CI: [57,73]), 63% (CI: [53,73]), and 62% (CI: [50,74]) and pooled specificities of 57% (CI: [48,66]), 75% (CI: [65,83]), and 82% (CI: [71,90]), respectively. For distinguishing patients at low risk for CBDS from those at greater than low risk, ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines have pooled sensitivities of 97% (CI: [92,99]), 95% (CI: [90,98]), and 84% (CI: [70,93]) and pooled specificities of 7% (CI: [3,18]), 11% (CI: [7,18]), and 15% (CI: [8,28]), respectively. Overall, the AUCs for ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines are 0.65, 0.74, and 0.73, respectively.

Conclusion

ASGE 2019 and ESGE guidelines have comparable performance, with their key strength being the ability to rule out CBDS in low-risk patients, allowing these patients to proceed with cholecystectomy without additional workup. All guidelines have limited specificity in identifying patients at high risk for CBDS and cannot reliably select patients for upfront ERCP.

To capture unpublished studies, Google Scholar and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched, and due to database constraints only the first 200 citations from Google Scholar were collected with only English language citations included. For PICO questions 2 and 3 only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the primary analyses, whereas randomized controlled and observational cohort studies were included for PICO questions 1 and 4. Meta-analyses used random effects models with summary metrics selected by PICO, including overall diagnostic odds ratio (OR) for PICO 1, risk ratios for PICO 2, summary OR for PICO 3, and pooled proportions for PICO 4; heterogeneity was quantified by the I^2 statistic and evaluated by sensitivity analyses, and funnel plots and analyses stratified by study design were used to evaluate for publication bias and influence of study quality. The certainty in the body of evidence was assessed following the GRADE approach based on domains including risk of bias of individual studies, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness of the evidence, and risk of publication bias, and the certainty was categorized into 4 levels ranging from very low to high. During an in-person meeting, the panel developed recommendations based on the certainty in the evidence, the overall balance of benefits and harms, and values and preferences associated with the decision.

ABSTRACT

Background

Optimal management of acute biliary disease should include an assessment for possible choledocholithiasis (CBDS). Various diagnostic guidelines have been developed by expert bodies for this purpose, but uncertainties remain about their performance in wider practice.

Methods

For this systematic review and meta‐analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus for studies on adult populations published in English language between 2000 and August 2024. All studies pertaining to the performance of diagnostic guidelines developed or adopted by regional, national, or international professional bodies are considered, but we excluded diagnostic tools or scoring systems developed locally with limited scopes, such as those employed by a single institution or a group of related institutions. We extracted or derived performance measures in the forms of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative and performed meta‐analysis using a multilevel random effects model to calculate pooled sensitivity and specificity for the reviewed guidelines and summarized their performance using summary ROC curves and AUCs. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the PROBAST risk of bias and applicability tool. This study is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024581409).

### Contemporary management of common bile duct stone: what you need to know [^f9f59b9a]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Choledocholithiasis is a common presentation of symptomatic cholelithiasis encountered by the acute care surgeon. There is a wide spectrum of variation in management of this disease due to evolutions in laparoscopic and endoscopic techniques. Intricacies in management are related to the timing of diagnosis as well as locally available imaging modalities, surgical expertise, and ancillary advanced endoscopy and interventional radiological support. While individual patient demographics and institutional characteristics will determine management of choledocholithiasis, it is incumbent for the treating surgeon to be well versed in all manners of therapy currently available. The objective of this review is to provide an evidence-based summary of the contemporary management of choledocholithiasis.

### Balloon endoscopy-assisted endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for hepatolithiasis in patients with hepaticojejunostomy [^95ee6fb5]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Hepatolithiasis, stones in the intrahepatic bile ducts, can cause cholangitis, liver abscess, or obstructive jaundice, and guidelines recommend treatment including endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD), or surgery PTBD was widely performed as a first-line non-surgical treatment for hepatolithiasis but there was a concern in impairing activity of daily life and risk of early adverse events including bleeding. A recent study suggested comparative effectiveness of ERCP and PTBD, and ERCP is now a treatment option for hepatolithiasis in clinical practice.

ERCP in patients with surgically altered anatomy (SAA), however, is technically challenging. Balloon endoscopy-assisted ERCP (BE-ERCP) is an emerging procedure for this population and previous studies reported its effectiveness and safety. However, the clinical evidence is still limited to date regarding feasibility of BE-ERCP for hepatolithiasis in patients with SAA. Considering a low clearance rate of hepatolithiasis via ERCP even in patients with normal anatomy, effectiveness and safety of BE-ERCP needs to be validated in this cohort. Furthermore, clinical outcomes of BE-ERCP could be different between patients who underwent surgery in their childhood and adulthood due to different etiology (congenital biliary dilation or malignancy), as well as gastrointestinal reconstruction (Roux-en-Y or Billroth-II).

Therefore, we conducted the current study to elucidate clinical outcomes and risk factors for failed complete stone removal via BE-ERCP for hepatolithiasis after hepaticojejunostomy (HJS).

Regarding specific circumstances for choledocholithiasis, more specifically with respect to patients with acute cholangitis, EASL 2016 guidelines recommend to perform early laparoscopic cholecystectomy within 72 hours after preoperative ERCP for choledocholithiasis in patients with simultaneous gallbladder and bile duct stones.

2 Methods

2.1 Search Strategy

We have established our inclusion and exclusion criteria in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 checklist, with the review protocol registered at PROSPERO (CRD42024581409). On 22 August 2024, HK searched three healthcare‐related databases, the names, date coverages, and search strategies, which are as presented in Table 1. We imported and organized the search results in Rayyan, with which duplicated results were automatically removed. Two reviewers (HK and FF) independently screened titles and abstracts of all the studies retrieved to identify those which evaluated the guidelines in terms of diagnostic performance for a full text review. Discordances between HK and SF were resolved by consensus, or with adjudication by AM if a consensus could not be reached.

TABLE 1 
Summary of literature search.

Next, HK performed a full text review of each screened study to (i) determine if the study was to be included or excluded and to (ii) extract data using a proforma if the study was included (see below). Decisions for inclusion or exclusion were independently verified by AM with disagreement resolved by consensus. HK also carried out a “snowball” search of the reference lists of the included studies to identify additional relevant studies; these additional studies were subjected to the same verification process by AM before the final inclusion.

2.2 Study Selection Criteria

In this review, we considered diagnostic guidelines identified by the search if they were developed or adopted by regional, national, or international (defined as at least state, provincial, or equivalent level) professional bodies or expert panels; specifically, we excluded diagnostic tools, algorithms, or scoring systems which were based on limited populations such as those devised and used locally by single institutions, due to uncertainties about their generalizability. Studies that used the diagnostic guidelines for patient selection but focused on outcomes other than performance of the guidelines were excluded. For example, we excluded studies primarily comparing the performance of MRCP or EUS on patients stratified as intermediate risk of CBDS using the guidelines.

For inclusion, the studies were required to report the diagnostic performance in terms of true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) to allow the construction of the 2 × 2 error matrix, or provide sufficient data for their derivation if these measures were not directly reported. Studies published as abstracts only were excluded. Non‐English language studies were excluded, unless official English versions were available.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults (...) [^3aca242b]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Jaundice occurs when the serum bilirubin level exceeds 3 mg per dL. It can be difficult to detect by physical examination alone. 1 Acute jaundice is often an indicator of significant underlying disease and occurs secondary to intra- and extrahepatic etiologies. A retrospective study of more than 700 individuals found that most cases of acute jaundice in adults are caused by intrahepatic disorders, including viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and drug-induced liver injury. The remaining 45% of acute jaundice cases are extrahepatic and include gallstone disease, hemolysis, and malignancy. 2 This article provides a systematic approach to the diagnosis of jaundice in adults and reviews common etiologies of hyperbilirubinemia. An algorithm for the evaluation of jaundice in adults is provided in Figure 1.
3. 4, 6 Jaundice occurs when there are disruptions along this metabolic pathway, causing an increase in unconjugated bilirubin or conjugated bilirubin. History and Physical Examination The initial workup of jaundice should focus on the history and physical examination to help clarify the diagnosis. A detailed alcohol and drug use history can help identify intrahepatic disorders such as alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, chronic liver disease, or drug-induced liver injury. A focused review of systems is important. For example, fever and prodromal viral symptoms can precede acute viral hepatitis, fever can be associated with underlying sepsis, and weight loss can be associated with underlying malignancy. 7 Fractionated bilirubinemia is required to differentiate between conjugated and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

A complete blood count with a peripheral blood smear can help identify hemolysis and evaluate for anemia of chronic disease and thrombocytopenia, which is common in decompensated cirrhosis. Elevated alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels can indicate hepatocellular damage. However, levels may be normal in chronic liver disease. In such cases, there may not be enough normal liver parenchymal tissue to release elevated levels of these enzymes. 7 Protein, albumin, and prothrombin time or international normalized ratio are associated with liver synthetic function. Low levels of protein and albumin, or elevated prothrombin time or international normalized ratio, indicate decreased synthetic function and hepatic decompensation.

If the jaundice etiology is unknown after the initial laboratory evaluation, it is necessary to perform additional tests including hepatitis panels and autoimmune panels, such as antinuclear, smooth muscle, and liver-kidney microsomal antibodies.
3. Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia INCREASED BILIRUBIN PRODUCTION Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is usually a result of too much bilirubin presented to the conjugating machinery. Increased red blood cell breakdown may be caused by red blood cell membrane disorders, 9 red blood cell enzyme disorders, 10 hemoglobin disorders, 11 autoimmune red blood cell destruction, 12 or some cancers. The excess turnover of red blood cells results in increased heme metabolism, producing large amounts of bilirubin that overwhelm the conjugating machinery, leading to decreased excretion and clinical jaundice.

This article is only available in the PDF format. Download the PDF to view the article, as well as its associated figures and tables. While visiting surgical clinics in Japan and Hong Kong 2 years ago and again in 1960, I was impressed by the marked differences in the clinical and pathologic features of diseases of the biliary tract among the Japanese and among the Hong Kong Chinese from those of diseases of the same structures among patients of the United States. Although in some cases of recurrent pyogenic cholangitis with and without bile-pigment ductal stones the symptoms are somewhat similar to those seen in Western people with chronic recurring cholecystitis, in other cases the difference is marked. In such cases there are crisis-like attacks of such severity that shock-like reactions develop quickly, and unless surgical decompression of the biliary tract is done immediately, the patient not infrequently dies.

The clinical picture and the laboratory findings in these cases are so typical, according to McFadzean, that the diagnoses can be made readily. Walters W. CHOLANGIOHEPATITIS OR RECURRENT PYOGENIC CHOLANGITIS WITH INTRAHEPATIC AND EXTRAHEPATIC BILE-PIGMENT STONES. JAMA. 1961; 178: 934–935. doi:

### ASGE guideline on the role of endoscopy in the evaluation and management of choledocholithiasis [^a8391d0b]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2019). High credibility.

ASGE guideline—diagnostic and initial management for choledocholithiasis states that in patients with intermediate risk (10%-50%) of choledocholithiasis, we suggest either endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) given high specificity; consider factors including patient preference, local expertise, and availability. In patients with gallstone pancreatitis without cholangitis or biliary obstruction/choledocholithiasis, we recommend against urgent (<48 hours) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). In patients with large choledocholithiasis, we suggest performing large-balloon dilation after sphincterotomy rather than endoscopic sphincterotomy alone. For patients with large and difficult choledocholithiasis, we suggest intraductal therapy or conventional therapy with papillary dilation. This may be impacted by local expertise, cost, and patient and physician preferences.

4 Discussion

In this systematic review, we have identified 6 diagnostic guidelines predicting CBDS in patients with acute biliary presentation. Of these, there is sufficient data in the literature for the meta‐analysis of the original ASGE guidelines in 2010, the revised ASGE guidelines in 2019, and the ESGE guidelines. All three guidelines stratify patients into high, intermediate, or low risk categories for CBDS, and are similar in their management recommendations.

When the guidelines are used to distinguish patients at low risk for CBDS from those at greater than low risk, both iterations of ASGE guidelines have excellent pooled sensitivities of 95%–97% for CBDS, while that of the ESGE guidelines is lower at 84%. The observed difference may reflect the inclusion of patients older than 55 as intermediate risk in both ASGE but not the ESGE guidelines, even though age was found to be a nonspecific and minimally predictive criterion in a meta‐analysis of predictor performance by Wang et al. These high sensitivities can be utilized to advantage clinically, because a low‐risk classification can reliably rule out most CBDS and allow low‐risk individuals to proceed to cholecystectomy without additional investigations. At this diagnostic threshold, all guidelines have poor specificities for CBDS from 7% to 15% only, resulting in many patients classified as at least intermediate risk thus prompting for additional investigations.

### Clinical spotlight review for the management of choledocholithiasis [^71aff330]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Choledocholithiasis is a common presentation of symptomatic cholelithiasis that can result in biliary obstruction, cholangitis, and pancreatitis. A systematic English literature search was conducted in PubMed to determine the appropriate management strategies for choledocholithiasis. The following clinical spotlight review is meant to critically review the available evidence and provide recommendations for the work-up, investigations as well as the endoscopic, surgical and percutaneous techniques in the management of choledocholithiasis.

### Choledocholithiasis (...) [^a5093d65]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Baiu I, Hawn MT. Choledocholithiasis. JAMA. 2018; 320:

1506. doi:
10. 1001/jama.
2018. 11812 Choledocholithiasis occurs when a gallstone blocks the common bile duct and bile cannot flow past it, instead backing up into the liver. The gallbladder is a pouch the size of a lime that sits under the liver and stores bile. Bile is produced by the liver and helps with digestion of fat. Sometimes the cholesterol in bile can deposit and form thick crystals or stones. These stones can get stuck in the gallbladder, in the duct that goes from the gallbladder to the large bile duct, or in the large duct that goes from the liver and gallbladder to the bowel. Patients often have right-sided abdominal pain and may have yellowing of the skin or eyes. Patients may also experience clay-colored stools and dark urine.

If the stone is stuck in the common bile duct in such a way that the enzymes from the pancreas also cannot flow to the small intestine, it can lead to gallstone pancreatitis, which can cause right, middle, and left upper abdominal pain; nausea; and vomiting. If the gallbladder becomes inflamed, it can lead to acute cholecystitis. If there is an infection of the ducts through which the bile flows, it leads to cholangitis. Both of these can cause right-sided abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever. The diagnosis is made by performing a patient history, physical examination, blood tests, and imaging of the abdomen. Treatment depends on the location of the blockage and what problems develop because of it. Choledocholithiasis requires a gastroenterologist to extract the stone. This is usually done with heavy sedation, not general anesthesia.

A long tube with a camera is introduced through the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and into the small bowel. The point where the bile duct opens into the small bowel is then identified and the stone is pulled out. This procedure is called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Gallstone pancreatitis is usually treated with hydration through intravenous fluids and pain medication. Acute cholecystitis is treated with antibiotics and surgery. Cholangitis is treated with antibiotics and removal of the stone caught in the duct. All of these conditions require surgical removal of the gallbladder to prevent future attacks. A blocked stone usually causes pain, nausea, and vomiting. Lack of pain in the presence of jaundice and abnormal liver tests should raise concern for other disease processes such as hepatitis or, less frequently, bile duct or pancreatic cancer.

ASGE guideline—GRADE quality of evidence categories define four levels with linked research implications as follows: High—We are confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect, and further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of the effect. Moderate—We are moderately confident in the estimate of the effect; the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different, and further research is likely to have an impact on our confidence in the estimate of the effect and may change the estimate. Low—Our confidence in the estimate of the effect is limited; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect, and further research is very likely to have an impact on our confidence in the estimate of the effect and is likely to change the estimate. Very low—We have very little confidence in the estimate of the effect; the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of the effect, and any estimate of the effect is very uncertain.

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^be3013ec]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Overall, ASGE 2019 and ESGE guidelines have similar performances and limitations with only minor differences in how they balance between sensitivity and specificity. Both perform better than ASGE 2010 guidelines, but neither is clearly superior with similar AUCs. In clinical practice, we believe the main value of the guidelines lies in their ability to rule out CBDS. For example, patients without any ASGE 2019 criteria (i.e. abnormal liver function, CBD > 6 mm, age > 55) have very low rate of CBDS and can proceed to cholecystectomy without additional workup. On the other hand, the guidelines have only modest specificity when used to identify patients at high risk for CBDS. Although the guidelines can help limit ERCP to a smaller group of patients if used as intended, the nontherapeutic ERCP rate is still arguably too high resulting in an undesirable number of nontherapeutic ERCP with its attending risks of ERCP‐related complications such as pancreatitis or perforation. A more refined strategy is therefore indicated.

With all guidelines, a substantial proportion of patients are expected to fall into the intermediate risk category, but there remains a debate on how these patients are best managed. Although much research effort has previously focused on comparing MRCP and EUS in this patient group, both ASGE and ESGE expert panels have deemed the evidence to be of low to moderate quality only, citing a lack of data on cost‐effectiveness and other logistical considerations. To optimize the management of these patients, further research in these deficient areas is required. Moreover, alternative imaging techniques such as abbreviated MRCP or novel tools such as machine learning have potentials to become disruptors to or even possible replacement for existing treatment paradigms, with additional avenues for improvement. For instance, Steinway et al. have demonstrated superior AUC with machine learning when compared to ASGE 2019 and ESGE guidelines in a proof‐of‐concept study.

### Indication and procedure for treatment of hepatolithiasis (...) [^328b12b0]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Decision tree for treatment of hepatolithiasis. In the case of primary hepatolithiasis, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy should be performed first for cholesterol stones, hepatectomy should be performed first for bilirubin calcium stones located in the left or right intrahepatic duct, and percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopic lithotripsy should performed first for stones located in the bilateral intrahepatic duct and recurrent stones. Between 1971 and 1985, 17 patients had stones located in the left or right intrahepatic duct, and 25 patients had stones located in the bilateral intrahepatic duct. From 1986 through 2000, 32 patients had stones located in the left or right intrahepatic duct, and 15 patients had stones located in the bilateral intrahepatic duct.

The rate of residual stones after surgical and nonsurgical treatment was 41% in 1971 through 1985, but decreased to 11% in 1986 through 2000. As ultrasonography and computed tomography have come into wider use, it has become possible to not only identify the location of hepatic stones but also assess these stones qualitatively. , have improved. 2 Furthermore, noninvasive treatments, such as percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopic lithotripsy and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, have been established. 3 However, postoperative residual and recurrent stones occur in 20% of treated patients. 1 To decrease residual and recurrence rates, it will be necessary to accurately diagnose the complex pathologic features of hepatolithiasis and select the most effective treatment for each type of hepatolithiasis. Patients ranged in age from 20 to 72 years, with a mean age of 56. 9 years.

Sixty-eight patients had previously undergone 1 or more biliary procedures. We classified the 89 patients with hepatolithiasis by pathologic types. Based on the location of stones in the hepatic bile duct, patients were grouped into the following types: intrahepatic, extrahepatic, and both. All patients underwent surgical or nonsurgical intervention, and the presence of hepatolithiasis was confirmed. In terms of the treatment procedures, 34 patients underwent hepatectomy; 36, cholangioenterostomy; 12, T-tube insertion; and 7, PTCSL. Intraoperative cholangioscopy was routinely used instead of intraoperative cholangiography for visualizing the residual stones, ductal strictures, and tumors. Postoperative cholangiography and cholangioscopy were routinely performed to detect residual stones.

The rates of residual stones after treatment were higher in 1971 through 1985 than in 1986 through 2000. Compared with cholangioenterostomy, hepatectomy demonstrated a lower rate of residual stones. Cholangioenterostomy or PTCSL was performed more frequently for R or LR type hepatolithiasis than L type hepatolithiasis. Thus, the incidence of residual stones was lower in the L type than in the LR type or in the R type. 6 Second, choledochojejunostomy is indicated when intrahepatic stones are seen in both lobes and residual stones are expected to remain even though extensive lithotripsy has been performed. 4 To facilitate postoperative natural stone elimination, the T tube is placed in the common bile duct, or a retrograde transhepatic biliary drainage tube is inserted into an area of the bile duct where residual stones are found. 3.

### EAES rapid guideline: updated systematic review, network meta-analysis, CINeMA and GRADE assessment, and evidence-informed European recommendations on the management of common bile duct stones [^e7e2b14c]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Choledocholithiasis presents in a considerable proportion of patients with gallbladder disease. There are several management options, including preoperative or intraoperative endoscopic cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE).

Objective

To develop evidence-informed, interdisciplinary, European recommendations on the management of common bile duct stones in the context of intact gallbladder with a clinical decision to intervene to both the gallbladder and the common bile duct stones.

Methods

We updated a systematic review and network meta-analysis of LCBDE, preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative ERCP. We formed evidence summaries using the GRADE and the CINeMA methodology, and a panel of general surgeons, gastroenterologists, and a patient representative contributed to the development of a GRADE evidence-to-decision framework to select among multiple interventions.

Results

The panel reached unanimous consensus on the first Delphi round. We suggest LCBDE over preoperative, intraoperative, or postoperative ERCP, when surgical experience and expertise are available; intraoperative ERCP over LCBDE, preoperative or postoperative ERCP, when this is logistically feasible in a given healthcare setting; and preoperative ERCP over LCBDE or postoperative ERCP, when intraoperative ERCP is not feasible and there is insufficient experience or expertise with LCBDE (weak recommendation). The evidence summaries and decision aids are available on the platform MAGICapp ( https://app.magicapp.org/#/guideline/nJ5zyL ).

Conclusion

We developed a rapid guideline on the management of common bile duct stones in line with latest methodological standards. It can be used by healthcare professionals and other stakeholders to inform clinical and policy decisions.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^6e36b1bd]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The diagnostic evaluation and treatment of patients with gallbladder stones and abdominal pain are subject to change. The symptom criteria for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis differ across international guidelines. Although biliary colic is frequently resolved after cholecystectomy, non-biliary symptoms persist in up to 40 per cent of patients. This review guides surgeons on how to tailor diagnosis and treatment in patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis.

### National adherence to the ASGE-SAGES guidelines for managing suspected choledocholithiasis: an EAST multicenter study [^a7b78079]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons provide guidelines for managing suspected common bile duct (CBD) stones. We sought to evaluate adherence to the guidelines among patients with choledocholithiasis and/or acute biliary pancreatitis (ABP) and to evaluate the ability of these guidelines to predict choledocholithiasis.

Methods

We prospectively identified patients undergoing same-admission cholecystectomy for choledocholithiasis and/or ABP from 2016 to 2019 at 12 United States medical centers. Predictors of suspected CBD stones were very strong (CBD stone on ultrasound; bilirubin >4 mg/dL), strong (CBD > 6 mm; bilirubin ≥1.8 to ≤4 mg/dL), or moderate (abnormal liver function tests other than bilirubin; age >55 years; ABP). Patients were grouped by probability of CBD stones: high (any very strong or both strong predictors), low (no predictors), or intermediate (any other predictor combination). The management of each probability group was compared with the recommended management in the guidelines.

Results

The cohort was comprised of 844 patients. High-probability patients had 64.3% (n = 238/370) deviation from guidelines, intermediate-probability patients had 29% (n = 132/455) deviation, and low-probability patients had 78.9% (n = 15/19) deviation. Acute biliary pancreatitis increased the odds of deviation for the high- (odds ratio [OR], 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-2.8; p = 0.03) and intermediate-probability groups (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.07-2.42; p = 0.02). Age older than 55 years (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.4-3.43; p < 0.001) also increased the odds of deviation for the intermediate group. A CBD greater than 6 mm predicted choledocholithiasis in the high (adjusted OR (aOR), 2.16; 95% CI, 1.17-3.97; p = 0.01) and intermediate group (aOR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.59-4.86; p < 0.001). Any very strong predictor (aOR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.76-3.37; p < 0.0001) and both strong predictors predicted choledocholithiasis (aOR, 2; 95% CI, 1.35-2.96; p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Almost 45% of patients with suspected CBD stones were managed discordantly from the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons guidelines. We believe these guidelines warrant revision to better reflect the ability of the clinical variables at predicting choledocholithiasis.

### Radiological biliary intervention for stone disease [^dce1a733]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gallstones are crystalized particles composed mainly of cholesterol and sometimes bilirubin, typically developing in the gallbladder. Choledocholithiasis is the presence of those calculi (stones) in the common bile duct (CBD). It is the primary cause of non-malignant bile duct obstruction. The formation of gallstones is influenced by various clinical conditions and factors, including bile composition, gallbladder motility, genetics, obesity, female sex, and age [-]. The most common etiological factor for choledocholithiasis is the migration of gallbladder stones to the CBD and intrahepatic ducts through the cystic duct. This occurs in approximately 3-15% of patients who undergo cholecystectomy. Another common cause of choledocholithiasis is inadequate bile drainage due to obstructions, such as postsurgical bile duct strictures, which can lead to acute cholangitis or other inflammatory conditions. Hepatolithiasis is the formation of stones in the intrahepatic biliary tract. This condition is often recurrent and requires multiple therapeutic interventions. Treatment for choledocholithiasis is necessary for symptomatic patients, and is recommended for asymptomatic patients given the risk of serious complications, such as cholangitis, obstructive jaundice (which can lead to secondary biliary cirrhosis), and pancreatitis.

### Residual choledocholithiasis after choledocholithotomy T-tube drainage: what is the best intervention strategy? [^de8ac104]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The indwelling nasobiliary drainage should be taken to avoid bending of the bile duct due to T tube traction. The drainage tube is placed in the left intrahepatic bile duct to fully drain and decompress the bile so that the T tube can be removed as soon as possible postoperative. T tube removal time and nasobiliary duct retention time still need to be further clinically studied in such patients after surgery in order to maximize the benefits of patients without complications such as bile leakage.

The T tube drainage time and hospital stay in the ERCP group were significantly shorter than those in the CDS group. The following reasons are considered. T-tube cholangiography was performed at one week after choledocholithotomy, and if there were residual stones in the common bile duct, ERCP surgery was performed immediately. After ERCP treatment, the opening of the duodenal papilla was opened through EST to lead to a smooth flow, and the pressure of the biliary tract was reduced. After ERCP stone removal, complications such as impaired drainage, blockage, and secondary to acute cholangitis do not need to be considered. As bile is drained and excreted normally after ERCP, the patient's physical fitness and appetite improve and accelerate the maturation of the T-tube sinus tract.

Table 1 
Brief summary of updated consensus recommendations for screening, diagnosis, and management of CF‐related liver disease.

If any abnormalities are found on screening, further evaluation and monitoring for progression is recommended in the second set of recommendations (Table 1). Note, that previously if lab variables were elevated to >1.5–2 times the ULN additional evaluation was recommended; however, the newest guidelines recommend evaluation if there are elevations of any amount that persist over 3–6 months. Lab evaluation is expanded and elastography and other imaging modalities should be obtained. The type of evaluation and frequency varies based on if CF hepatobiliary involvement (CFHBI) or advanced CFLD (aCFLD) is present.

CFHBI refers to having one (or more) of the following without features of advanced CFLD: hepatomegaly, liver fibrosis (Metavir score <F4), increased liver stiffness by elastography, hepatic steatosis, focal biliary cirrhosis, cholestasis, persistent (>3–6 months) elevated serum liver function tests (any level above ULN), abnormal liver imaging, cholelithiasis, sclerosing cholangitis, or hepatolithiasis. Once CFHBI is identified, monitoring and progression is unchanged apart from elastography annually.

aCFLD is defined as having one (or more) of the following: nodular liver, advanced fibrosis (Metavir score of F4), multilobular cirrhosis with or without portal hypertension, or noncirrhotic portal hypertension. Esophageal variceal management is per the most relevant currently published guidelines in adults, however, there is insufficient evidence for or against surveillance in children.

The final set of recommendations relates to treatment, managed in consultation with a gastroenterologist. Key points to note are a recommendation against use of ursodeoxycholic acid as no study has demonstrated use prevents development of aCFLD or liver transplantation. However, there are also no studies evaluating discontinuation. Recommendations for CFTR modulator use (which vary by clinical status), surgical interventions, treatment of varices, and transplantation are included in Table 1.

### Clinical spotlight review for the management of choledocholithiasis [^a22304d9]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Choledocholithiasis—epidemiology and presentation—has a prevalence of approximately 10–15% of patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis. The clinical presentation can range from completely asymptomatic to biliary colic and symptoms of obstructive jaundice, such as pruritus, dark urine and acholic stools, and although up to a third of patients with common bile duct (CBD) stones will pass them spontaneously without intervention, the majority of patients will require endoscopic and/or surgical intervention.

Moreover, given the myriads of interventions available, from endoscopic to percutaneous to surgical, there is an unmet need to understand the best sequencing of these procedures. For instance, in cases where ERCP fails, should one immediately resort to PTC, or consider alternate endoscopic strategies? Decision algorithms, formulated on the basis of solid evidence, can guide clinicians through such conundrums.

Another frontier is the cost-effectiveness of these percutaneous strategies. As healthcare economics becomes increasingly pivotal, understanding the cost dynamics of these interventions, both direct and indirect (such as hospitalization days saved, or complications averted), can offer valuable insights for healthcare stakeholders.

In conclusion, while the current horizon of percutaneous treatments for biliary stones paints an optimistic picture, the onus is on the scientific community to continually refine, validate and innovate. Through a collaborative approach, bridging clinical acumen, patient insights and technological prowess, we can envisage a future where biliary stone management is not just clinically effective, but also patient-centric, safe, and economically viable.

### Management of gallstone pancreatitis: a review [^8736aace]. JAMA Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Gallstone pancreatitis (GSP) is the leading cause of acute pancreatitis, accounting for approximately 50% of cases. Without appropriate and timely treatment, patients are at increased risk of disease progression and recurrence. While there is increasing consensus among guidelines for the management of mild GSP, adherence to these guidelines remains poor. In addition, there is minimal evidence to guide clinicians in the treatment of moderately severe and severe pancreatitis.

Observations

The management of GSP continues to evolve and is dependent on severity of acute pancreatitis and concomitant biliary diagnoses. Across the spectrum of severity, there is evidence that goal-directed, moderate fluid resuscitation decreases the risk of fluid overload and mortality compared with aggressive resuscitation. Patients with isolated, mild GSP should undergo same-admission cholecystectomy; early cholecystectomy within 48 hours of admission has been supported by several randomized clinical trials. Cholecystectomy should be delayed for patients with severe disease; for severe and moderately severe disease, the optimal timing remains unclear. Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is only useful for patients with suspected cholangitis or biliary obstruction, although the concomitance of these conditions in patients with GSP is rare. Modality of evaluation of the common bile duct to rule out concomitant choledocholithiasis varies and should be tailored to level of concern based on objective measures, such as laboratory results and imaging findings. Among these modalities, intraoperative cholangiography is associated with reduced length of stay and decreased use of ERCP. However, the benefit of routine intraoperative cholangiography remains in question.

Conclusions and Relevance

Treatment of GSP is dependent on disease severity, which can be difficult to assess. A comprehensive review of clinically relevant evidence and recommendations on GSP severity grading, fluid resuscitation, timing of cholecystectomy, need for ERCP, and evaluation and management of persistent choledocholithiasis can help guide clinicians in diagnosis and management.

### Guidelines on the management of common bile duct stones (CBDS) [^ab3cbd43]. Gut (2008). Low credibility.

The last 30 years have seen major developments in the management of gallstone-related disease, which in the United States alone costs over 6 billion dollars per annum to treat. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has become a widely available and routine procedure, whilst open cholecystectomy has largely been replaced by a laparoscopic approach, which may or may not include laparoscopic exploration of the common bile duct (LCBDE). In addition, new imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance cholangiography (MR) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) offer the opportunity to accurately visualise the biliary system without instrumentation of the ducts. As a consequence clinicians are now faced with a number of potentially valid options for managing patients with suspected CBDS. It is with this in mind that the following guidelines have been written.

### A novel approach with holmium laser ablation for endoscopic management of intrahepatic biliary stricture [^4b7363fe]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hepatolithiasis is a common biliary disorder found in Asian population, with an incidence rate ranging from 2 to 25% in Southeastern Asia. Hepatolithiasis, characterized by intrabiliary stone formation, results in bile stasis, and sometimes recurrent cholangitis. Patients suffering from the disease also bear high risk of stone recurrence even after surgical treatment, mainly due to unsolved etiological problems such as anatomical biliary stricture or transient portal bacteremia. Additionally, hepatolithiasis is also an established risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma with very poor prognosis. Therefore, the high incidence, the severe symptoms, and the common recurrence altogether contribute to a heavy disease burden on the society and a low quality of life for the patients.

Current principles for hepatolithiasis management include stone clearance, biliary stricture removal, proper bile drainage, and resection of severely involved liver, aiming to reduce the postoperative recurrence rate. A variety of methods have been practiced for clinical hepatolithiasis management. One major approach is hepatic resection, which simultaneously resolves the problems of intrahepatic stones and biliary stricture by en-bloc surgical removal. Hepatic resection could also benefit the patients with reduced risks of cholangiocarcinoma, because the technique allows for complete removal of the liver parenchyma with the potential of carcinogenesis. Another approach is endoscopic removal of intrahepatic stone, featured by minimally invasive lithotomy that significantly enhances postoperative recovery and reduces hospital stay. The endoscopic lithotomy procedure could be achieved by either choledochoscopy via an exploratory incision into the common bile duct or cholangioscopy via percutaneous transhepatic approach [,–]. In particular, the patients with recurrent hepatolithiasis, who might have complicated surgical history or insufficient liver remnant, are usually unable to tolerate another major hepatic resection due to severe adhesion or possible postoperative liver function failure. Endoscopic approach proposes an opportunity to cure hepatolithiasis for those “inoperable” patients, but cannot properly resolve biliary stricture without additional interventional techniques.

Currently, only a few methods are available for biliary stricture management, including biliary stent, balloon dilation, radiofrequency ablation, and biliary scraper. However, the recurrent rate of hepatolithiasis remains high. Effective management strategy in endoscopic approach for biliary stricture is still required. Here we propose an innovative approach using a holmium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Ho:YAG) surgical laser, a widely used technique in lithotripsy, for stricture ablation and complete stone clearance in endoscopic lithotomy.

Conclusion—choledocholithiasis is a commonly encountered diagnosis for general surgeons, and management decisions hinge on the probability of choledocholithiasis based on clinical presentation and investigations, the timing of presentation in relation to laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and the availability of technology and expertise of surgeons, endoscopists and interventional radiologists; regardless, the surgeon must be familiar with all possible options at their disposal for managing the patient presenting with choledocholithiasis.

### Technical aspects of bile duct evaluation and exploration: an update [^ca5dbebc]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Consensus guidelines recommend patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis and suspected choledocholithiasis have common bile duct exploration (CBDE) at the time of cholecystectomy to prevent downstream problems. Despite superiority of single-stage cholecystectomy with CBDE, 2-stage precholecystectomy/postcholecystectomy with endoscopic clearance of the duct is commonly practiced. This is related to inadequate training in minimally invasive techniques, lack of technical support for efficient and safe CBDE, and surgeons' inexperience with complex biliary pathologic condition. This article provides a framework for evaluating and treating patients with CBD pathologic condition with an emphasis on technical aspects of CBDE and preoperative planning and preparation.

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e427ab5c]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Background

Acute biliary disease is a common surgical problem. Choledocholithiasis, the presence of gallstone in common bile duct (CBDS), complicates 5%–20% of these presentations, potentially leading to increased morbidity and increased treatment complexity. CBDS can be identified with high accuracy with either endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) prior to definitive treatment with cholecystectomy or during cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiography (IOC), but neither is routinely employed: In this case of ERCP, this is because it carries a risk of potentially serious adverse events such as pancreatitis and is usually performed on patients with high pretest probability. In the case of IOC, factors precluding its routine use include increased operation time, increased cost, and radiation exposure for both patients and staff. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are alternative modalities for diagnosing CBDS, with comparable diagnostic performance but without the issues associated with ERCP or IOC. Yet, these modalities are resource‐intensive, have limited availability, and may result in increased length of stay and additional financial costs.

Optimal management of acute biliary disease should incorporate an assessment for CBDS risk to select patients at elevated CBDS risk for these additional investigations (ERCP, IOC, MRCP, or EUS) while allowing patients at low risk to forego them safely. Over the years, various diagnostic guidelines have been proposed for this purpose, including those by the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) and the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE). However, these guidelines are based on opinions from the expert panel drawing on low to moderate quality evidence only and are developed with their specific locality in mind. Uncertainties remain as to how these guidelines perform in wider, worldwide practice, and which of these, if any, represents the most performant strategy for stratifying CBDS risk.

The goal of this systematic review is to examine and compare the diagnostic performance of various published guidelines in the evaluation of CBDS.

1988. 01400250116023. • Acute cholangitis due to intrahepatic stones is frequently associated with biliary sepsis. Emergency surgery for these high-risk patients is usually associated with a high mortality. Therefore, we recommend nonoperative methods for the management of this acute disease. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and drainage combined with antibiotic and fluid treatment was used successfully in the management of 41 patients with acute pyogenic cholangitis due to intrahepatic stones. The general condition of these patients improved after treatment with PTCD. Repeated cholangiography should be performed so that the entire biliary tree and lesions can be viewed.

Elective surgery or removal of the stone through the sinus tract via PTCD was performed when the patients' general condition improved following emergency PTCD. Therefore, we recommend PTCD over emergency surgery in the treatment of acute septic intrahepatic stones. Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^56d57e4c]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Symptom criteria in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis

Quality assessment of 14 international guidelines on cholecystolithiasis showed that only five guidelines were suitable for clinical practice, as most recommendations were based on a low level of evidence. For example, the definition of symptomatic gallstone disease and the indication for cholecystectomy are poorly described. Most guidelines advocate cholecystectomy in patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis or biliary colic,. The issue is, however, that both conditions are ill defined.

Table 1 summarizes guidelines and criteria sets for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis. Most guidelines refer to the Rome criteria to define symptomatic gallstone disease: pain in severe attacks, in the epigastrium or upper right quadrant, and lasting 15–30 min or longer. The Association of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland commission guidefrom 2016 slightly modified these criteria to epigastric or upper right abdominal pain, frequently with radiation to the back, lasting from several minutes to hours, and often occurring during the night. The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tracthas similar criteria (temporary epigastric or upper right abdominal pain, radiation to the right flank or back, and nausea), whereas the European Association for the Study of the Liverhas reported more than 10 criteria. The various symptoms and criteria reported in these guidelines illustrate the lack of consensus among healthcare professionals.

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^db857c18]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

This systematic review has two main limitations. First, the included studies have drawn on different patient sources which can be broadly divided into three categories: (i) patients with acute biliary presentation identified via multiple records, (ii) patients who have undergone ERCP or EUS identified from endoscopic database, and (iii) patients with certain clinical diagnosis such as pancreatitis. It is conceivable that patients from different sources may have different underlying characteristics, with perhaps the most important example being possible higher pretest probabilities for CBDS when patients were drawn from the ERCP database. However, we argue that this is unlikely to affect the outcome of the meta‐analysis because sensitivity and specificity, the two measures we have focused on, are intrinsic to the guidelines and are prevalence‐invariant. Moreover, although there is between‐study heterogeneity particularly with respect to the ASGE 2010 guidelines, our sensitivity analysis suggests the impact is small in magnitude; for instance, in the worst case of ASGE 2010, its AUC has changed from 0.65 to 0.71 only after excluding outliers. Second, we have opted to test the guideline similarity using the likelihood ratio test because included studies are shared between the guidelines making the data dependent. Although this test has indicated that the guidelines are dissimilar, we would like to note that (i) likelihood testing is inherently anticonservative and may overstate the dissimilarities and (ii) the absolute differences in AUCs between the guidelines, even if they exist, are small and likely of little clinical import. For the above reasons, we assert that these limitations are unlikely to materially impact our key observations or the overall conclusions we draw from them.

In summary, the ASGE 2019 and ESGE guidelines have comparable performance, with their key strength being the ability to rule out CBDS in low‐risk patients allowing these patients to proceed with cholecystectomy without additional workup. Both guidelines have only limited ability to identify patients at high risk for CBDS; therefore, using the guidelines to select patients for upfront ERCP is probably inappropriate. Both guidelines classify sizable proportions of patients as intermediate risk for whom management consensus is lacking and further research is required.
