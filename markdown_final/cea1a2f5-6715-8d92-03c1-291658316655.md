## Question

What is the cause of diplopia weakness on the left side of face with difficulty, smiling and chewing, and diminished, left word, gaze with left corneal reflex impairment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the cause of diplopia, left facial weakness with difficulty smiling and chewing, diminished left corneal reflex, and left gaze difficulty. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the neuroanatomic localization of the involved cranial nerves. Then, I should verify the most likely etiologies that explain this constellation, prioritizing by prevalence and danger. Next, I will outline the immediate diagnostic workup, including what to order now versus what to defer. Finally, I will consider initial management pathways and red flags that mandate urgent escalation, making sure I double-check each inference against the literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and its localization. Diplopia plus impaired ocular motility points to extraocular muscle or cranial nerve involvement, while difficulty smiling and chewing reflect left facial nerve (CN VII) motor weakness; a diminished left corneal reflex implicates either the left trigeminal (CN V) sensory afferent or the left facial nerve efferent limb, and "left word, gaze" likely reflects a left gaze palsy from abducens (CN VI) involvement, so collectively this suggests a left CN VI and VII process with possible CN V involvement, which anatomically co-travel in the pons and cavernous sinus regions [^18e24da5] [^8edb7bdc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the differential that fits this pattern. The leading considerations include a brainstem pontine lesion (ischemic stroke, demyelination, or neoplasm), a cavernous sinus process (infection, inflammation, or mass), a multiple cranial neuropathy such as from meningitis or carcinomatous meningitis, and less likely but important entities like botulism or myasthenia gravis that can produce fluctuating cranial nerve dysfunction; given the combination of CN VI and VII with possible CN V involvement, a pontine or cavernous localization is most parsimonious, and the acute vascular or inflammatory etiologies rise to the top of the list [^18e24da5] [^8edb7bdc] [^69985900] [^2232e156].

> Wait, let me verify the anatomic plausibility of a pontine lesion explaining both CN VI and VII. The abducens nucleus and fascicle lie in the dorsal pons near the facial nerve fascicle, so a pontine infarct or demyelinating plaque can produce a conjugate horizontal gaze palsy with ipsilateral facial weakness; a classic example is an eight-and-a-half syndrome (one-and-a-half plus facial nucleus/fascicle involvement), which matches combined horizontal gaze and facial palsy on the same side, and the corneal reflex can be diminished if the facial efferent pathway is involved or if trigeminal sensory input is compromised by nearby pontine tegmental involvement [^3c4252b4] [^18e24da5].

> I need to check cavernous sinus etiologies next. CN III, IV, V1–V2, VI, and sympathetic fibers traverse the cavernous sinus, so a lesion there can produce multiple cranial neuropathies; however, isolated CN VI and VII with corneal reflex change is less typical than a full cavernous sinus syndrome, but partial or early presentations do occur, particularly with inflammatory or neoplastic processes at the clivus or cavernous sinus, so I should keep this in mind if the deficit evolves or if pain, proptosis, or sympathetic signs emerge [^c460d229] [^8edb7bdc].

> Let me consider systemic or neuromuscular causes carefully. Botulism can cause a descending, symmetric cranial neuropathy with diplopia, ptosis, facial weakness, and dysphagia, and should be suspected with exposure risks or compatible progression; myasthenia gravis can mimic cranial nerve palsies with fatigable ptosis and ophthalmoplegia, but corneal reflex is typically preserved, so a diminished corneal reflex argues more strongly for a peripheral nerve or brainstem process rather than pure neuromuscular junction disease, though I should confirm with bedside fatigue testing and acetylcholine receptor antibodies if suspicion persists [^69985900] [^2232e156].

> Next, I should review the immediate diagnostic workup. I need to ensure we do not miss a stroke or mass. Emergent brain MRI with DWI and contrast is the highest-yield test to distinguish ischemia, demyelination, and structural lesions in the pons or cavernous sinus; if MRI is unavailable, CT angiography can screen for large-vessel occlusion or aneurysm, but MRI is preferred for brainstem and cranial nerve assessment. I should also order CBC, metabolic panel, ESR/CRP, and consider infectious or inflammatory serologies guided by history, and if meningitis is suspected, lumbar puncture with CSF analysis is indicated after imaging excludes mass effect [^18e24da5] [^8edb7bdc].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical for ischemia? I should double-check for red flags that push me toward alternative etiologies. Subacute progression over weeks, severe pain, systemic B symptoms, or multiple cranial neuropathies should prompt evaluation for carcinomatous meningitis, granulomatous disease, or infection; in those scenarios, contrast-enhanced MRI of brain and spine, CSF cytology, and targeted serologies or cultures are appropriate, and early neurology consultation is warranted to coordinate testing and management [^8edb7bdc].

> I will now examine initial management pathways contingent on the most likely diagnosis. If acute pontine ischemic stroke is confirmed, standard stroke protocols apply, including reperfusion eligibility, antiplatelet therapy, risk factor modification, and rehabilitation; if a demyelinating process such as multiple sclerosis is identified, high-dose IV methylprednisolone is first-line; if a cavernous sinus mass or infiltrative process is found, biopsy and disease-specific therapy are indicated; if botulism is suspected, immediate public health notification and antitoxin administration are critical; if no structural lesion is found and myasthenia gravis remains plausible, acetylcholine receptor antibody testing and edrophonium or ice testing can be pursued, with initiation of immunotherapy if confirmed [^6838ffac] [^8eac6324] [^69985900] [^2232e156].

> Hold on, I should verify supportive measures that apply regardless of etiology. Eye care is essential to prevent exposure keratopathy from facial weakness and impaired corneal reflex: lubricating drops, ointment at night, moisture chambers, and taping the lid closed if lagophthalmos is present are standard; prism or occlusion can temporarily manage diplopia while the underlying cause is treated, and physical therapy for facial rehabilitation can aid recovery once the acute process is controlled [^c5f54c6c] [^3fde85da] [^2cd1ef8a].

> Let me reconsider the original phrasing "diminished, left word, gaze". I initially thought this might imply aphasia, but that would be a cortical localization mismatch for this brainstem cranial nerve syndrome; more plausibly, it reflects a left gaze palsy from abducens involvement with difficulty moving the eyes to the left, which fits the pontine localization and aligns with the other findings, so I should keep the localization anchored to CN VI and VII with possible CN V involvement rather than cortical language areas [^18e24da5] [^3c4252b4].

> In summary, I need to ensure the diagnostic sequence remains tight: emergent MRI with DWI and contrast to evaluate pons and cavernous sinus, targeted labs and CSF as indicated, and early specialty input. The most likely causes are acute pontine ischemia, demyelination, or a cavernous sinus process, with botulism and myasthenia gravis as important differentials if the course or ancillary features suggest them. Management hinges on the identified etiology, with stroke and infection protocols prioritized when applicable and supportive cranial nerve care instituted promptly [^18e24da5] [^8edb7bdc] [^69985900] [^2232e156].

The most likely cause of **left diplopia, facial weakness, and impaired corneal reflex** is a **left pontine lesion** (e.g. ischemic stroke or demyelination) involving the abducens nucleus/fascicle (CN VI), facial nerve fascicle (CN VII), and descending sympathetic fibers, producing a one-and-a-half syndrome with facial palsy and Horner syndrome [^3c4252b4] [^44c63e4c]. Other considerations include **cavernous sinus lesion** (e.g. thrombosis, aneurysm, or tumor) compressing CN VI, CN VII, and trigeminal ophthalmic branch (CN V1), or **myasthenia gravis** causing fluctuating ocular and facial weakness with preserved corneal reflex [^2232e156]. Immediate **MRI brain with contrast** is essential to localize and identify the cause, with urgent neurology consultation and stroke protocols if indicated [^18e24da5].

---

## Anatomical localization and clinical correlation

The combination of **diplopia, facial weakness, and impaired corneal reflex** suggests involvement of multiple cranial nerves and brainstem structures:

| **Symptom** | **Involved cranial nerve(s)** | **Anatomical localization** |
|-|-|-|
| Diplopia (horizontal) | Abducens nerve (CN VI) | - Dorsal pons (abducens nucleus/fascicle) <br/> - Cavernous sinus |
| Facial weakness (smiling, chewing) | Facial nerve (CN VII) | - Ventral pons (facial nerve fascicle) <br/> - Cavernous sinus |
| Impaired corneal reflex | Trigeminal nerve (CN V1 sensory) and facial nerve (CN VII motor) | - Dorsal pons (spinal trigeminal nucleus) <br/> - Cavernous sinus |

---

## Differential diagnosis

Based on the anatomical localization, the following **etiologies** are considered:

---

### Pontine lesion (most likely)

- **Ischemic stroke**: Involving the dorsal pons, affecting the abducens nucleus/fascicle, facial nerve fascicle, and descending sympathetic fibers, causing one-and-a-half syndrome with facial palsy and Horner syndrome [^3c4252b4] [^44c63e4c].
- **Demyelinating disease**: Multiple sclerosis or clinically isolated syndrome causing demyelination in the pons, leading to multiple cranial nerve involvement [^8eac6324].
- **Brainstem tumor**: Intrinsic pontine glioma or metastasis compressing cranial nerve nuclei and fascicles [^notfound].

---

### Cavernous sinus lesion

- **Cavernous sinus thrombosis**: Thrombosis compressing CN VI, CN VII, and CN V1, causing ophthalmoplegia, facial pain, and impaired corneal reflex [^c460d229].
- **Internal carotid artery aneurysm**: Aneurysmal compression of cranial nerves within the cavernous sinus [^notfound].
- **Neoplasm**: Pituitary adenoma, meningioma, or metastasis invading the cavernous sinus [^c460d229].

---

### Neuromuscular junction disorder

Myasthenia gravis causes fluctuating ocular and facial weakness; however, the **corneal reflex is typically preserved**, making it less likely in this scenario [^2232e156].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic diagnostic approach** is essential:

- **MRI brain with contrast**: Essential to identify ischemic stroke, demyelination, tumor, or cavernous sinus pathology [^18e24da5].
- **MRA or CTA**: To evaluate for vascular anomalies such as aneurysm or thrombosis.
- **Lumbar puncture**: If demyelination or infection is suspected, analyze CSF for oligoclonal bands, IgG index, and cytology [^6a18bdf2].
- **Electrophysiological studies**: Repetitive nerve stimulation or single-fiber EMG if myasthenia gravis is suspected [^2232e156].

---

## Management

Management depends on the **underlying etiology**:

- **Ischemic stroke**: Immediate stroke protocol, thrombolysis if eligible, and secondary prevention [^6838ffac].
- **Demyelinating disease**: High-dose intravenous corticosteroids and disease-modifying therapy [^8eac6324].
- **Cavernous sinus thrombosis**: Anticoagulation and management of underlying infection or inflammatory process [^notfound].
- **Neoplasm**: Surgical resection, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy based on tumor type and stage [^notfound].
- **Myasthenia gravis**: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, immunosuppressive therapy, and thymectomy if indicated [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely cause of left diplopia, facial weakness, and impaired corneal reflex is a **left pontine lesion** (ischemic stroke or demyelination) involving CN VI, CN VII, and descending sympathetic fibers. Alternative considerations include a cavernous sinus lesion or myasthenia gravis. Immediate **MRI brain with contrast** and urgent neurology consultation are critical for accurate diagnosis and timely management.

### Subacute horizontal diplopia, jaw dystonia, and laryngospasm [^6a18bdf2]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 61-year-old White woman presented with horizontal binocular diplopia, progressive trismus with jaw pain, and jaw spasms causing tongue biting over 5 weeks. The trismus worsened to the point that she could only eat pureed food and had severe weight loss. She also experienced intermittent pressure headache over the left temporal area, loss of taste, and sometimes metallic taste. Her medical history included depression treated with duloxetine, a left ovarian cyst, a thyroid nodule, and shingles over the left eyelid 2 months earlier. She had never smoked, and her family history was unremarkable. On examination, she had severe horizontal gaze restriction of both eyes with preserved vertical gaze and mild bilateral ptosis but normal pupillary response. Limited mouth opening and intermittent jaw spasms were also observed. The rest of the cranial nerves were intact. She had full motor power and no sensory deficit. Reflexes were decreased in the lower extremities, and plantar response was down-going bilaterally. She had mild left hemiataxia on finger-to-nose testing, dysdiadochokinesia, and heel-to-shin dysmetria.

Brain and spine MRIs, CSF analysis, and extensive blood tests were obtained. An examination of the brain MRI revealed T2-hyperintense lesions in the dorsal pons and medulla with no associated enhancement or restricted diffusion (Figure 1, A and B). The spine MRI was unremarkable. CSF analysis showed no white cells (normal, 0–5/µL) but showed mildly elevated protein, 70 mg/dL (normal, 0–35 mg/dL), and 4 oligoclonal bands that were unmatched with serum (normal range, 0–1). CSF Gram stain, VZV IgG, HSV PCR, VDRL, IgG index, and cytology showed negative results. Blood test showed negative results for ACE, aquaporin-4 (AQP4), and interferon-gamma release assay. She was found to have a low thiamine level, suspected to result from difficulty eating due to jaw-opening dystonia.

### Clinical reasoning: progressive headache and diplopia in an 89-year-old man [^5eed58fb]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

An 89-year-old man presented with a 3-year history of chronic daily headaches that significantly worsened over the past 4 months. Initially episodic, the left-sided headaches became continuous and were accompanied by systemic symptoms such as weight loss and elevated inflammatory markers, specifically C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Over subsequent weeks, the neurologic examination revealed new-onset left-sided ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and marked visual acuity loss. This article explores the differential diagnosis for such a complex clinical presentation and highlights how a systematic diagnostic approach can guide clinicians toward the correct diagnosis.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^50d22092]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult strabismus — natural history and treatment rationale indicate that onset in adults is usually in the third to fourth decade of life but sometimes much later in males, and if generalized it may involve bulbar, limb, and respiratory muscles with risk of life-threatening respiratory failure. Fifty percent of patients with myasthenia present with ocular symptoms only, and 50% to 80% of these patients develop generalized systemic myasthenia within a few years. Minimizing extraocular motility impairment, diplopia, and compensatory head position that can affect visual function, quality of life, and its socioeconomic consequences warrant treatment.

Case presentation

Demographics and past medical history

This was 65-year-old Asian man, independent with instrumental activities of daily living. He was a non-smoker and a teetotaller. He was diagnosed 1 year ago with cervical spondylosis with no residual deficits. He did not have a history of headaches nor a history of psychiatric disorders.

First admission to hospital (Dec 2018)

The patient initially presented in December 2018 to our local hospital with symptoms of headache, left hemiparesis and left hemisensory deficit occurring intermittently for 3 days. There was transient diplopia on downward gaze. These symptoms would fluctuate during the day. There were no fevers, head injuries, seizures, nor neck trauma.

The patient's vital signs on admission showed a blood pressure (BP) of 115/64 mmHg with a regular heart rate (HR) of 68 beats per minute (bpm). He was apyrexial throughout admission. Physical examination showed a new onset left-sided facial droop with left-sided upper limb weakness of Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 4 out of 5 and reduced sensation to pinprick over the left face, upper and lower limbs. Both eyes were unable to abduct fully and developed compensatory bidirectional nystagmus during abduction. The remaining cranial nerves examination showed no other deficits. There were no cortical signs - there was no visual field loss, no aphasia, no dysarthria, no dysphasia nor hemineglect. His tone and reflexes were normal and the Babinski's reflexes were normal bilaterally.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^c73709a0]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — clinical overview from the abstract describes that Bell's palsy is the most common acute mono-neuropathy and the most common diagnosis associated with facial nerve weakness/paralysis; it is a rapid unilateral facial nerve paresis (weakness) or paralysis (complete loss of movement) of unknown cause that leads to partial or complete inability to voluntarily move facial muscles on the affected side; although typically self-limited, it may cause significant temporary oral incompetence and inability to close the eye with potential eye injury; many available diagnostic tests are of questionable benefit, and misdiagnosis or unnecessary delay in diagnosis are concerns.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^38b99a2c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — patient follow-up: Clinicians should reassess or refer to a facial nerve specialist those Bell's palsy patients with (1) new or worsening neurologic findings at any point, (2) ocular symptoms developing at any point, or (3) incomplete facial recovery 3 months after initial symptom onset. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, Level of confidence in evidence: High, Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm, and Policy level: Recommendation. Rationale includes that based on the natural history of Bell's palsy most patients will show complete recovery 3 months after onset, that failure to recover completely within 3 months warrants reevaluation to reconsider the initial diagnosis, and that the 3-month timeframe is an appropriate window to identify other causes.

### A 53-year-old man with a 16-year history of asymmetrical proximal muscle weakness, facial muscle weakness, and scapular winging [^9f4b6ca6]. Brain Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 CASE PRESENTATION

A 53‐year‐old previously healthy man developed difficulty in climbing stairs and getting to stand at 37 years old. Carrying heavy objects and swallowing solids became difficult 5 and 11 years later, respectively. He became nonambulant at age 50 years after a surgery for bilateral hip fractures. There was no family history of neuromuscular disease or history of consanguinity. Physical examination showed predominantly proximal muscle weakness in the lower extremities, scoring 3 out of 5 by the Medical Research Council score. The upper limb weakness was mild and asymmetrical. There were bilateral scapular winging and facial muscle weakness, predominantly on the left side. He had nasal speech, decreased gag reflex, and palatal and tongue muscle weakness but no ophthalmoplegia or ptosis. Serum creatine kinase (CK) was 246 U/L (normal 22–171 U/L). Electromyography showed myopathic changes. Muscle MRI was not performed (Box 1).

### Clinical reasoning: a 43-year-old man with subacute onset of vision disturbances, jaw spasms, and balance and sleep difficulties [^6dbc8b61]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Section 1

A 43-year-old man, with previous left testicular torsion, presented with 2 weeks of imbalance, gait incoordination, double and blurred vision, vertigo, and right lower extremity weakness. He denied confusion, disorientation, or associated memory issues. Observed eye movement abnormalities and ataxia on initial evaluation, and elevated white cell count and protein in the CSF, led to a Miller Fisher syndrome diagnosis. He was treated with IVIg, accompanied by improvement in vertigo. Eight weeks later, diplopia and oscillopsia occurred, and he had jaw opening difficulties and clenching episodes (trismus) and hypersialorrhea. He required pureed diet and subsequently gastrostomy tube for nutrition. He developed severe daytime hypersomnolence and sleep-related complex motor behaviors, with violent, thrashing limb movements and screaming and shouting vocalizations. He was briefly hospitalized after a possible isolated seizure, though never confirmed (EEG did not reveal epileptiform discharges). Sixteen weeks into his illness, he developed choking episodes, nocturnal stridor, and hypoxia. He was hospitalized again. He developed acute respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation.

On examination, he had horizontal plane ophthalmoplegia (not overcome with vestibular ocular reflex), esotropia, jerk see-saw vertical nystagmus (Video 1), and superimposed opsoclonic bursts (Video 2). He experienced mixed flaccid hyperkinetic dysarthria and jaw-closing dystonia (Video 2). He experienced oral phase and pharyngeal dysphagia. He was wheelchair bound, only taking steps with a walker and maximum assistance. He had moderate upper extremity dysmetria (minimal in the lower extremities) and normal limb tone and strength. Jaw jerk and deep tendon reflexes were brisk, and sensory examination was normal. Hoffman and Babinski signs were negative. A left inguinal mass was detected. Episodic shortness of breath accompanied by cyanosis (laryngospasm) was noted. Tracheostomy placement precluded polysomnographic studies.

Questions for Considerations:

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^002b5cc9]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Oculomotor palsy — background, incidence, and risk factors — The annual incidence of acquired 3rd nerve palsy is approximately 4 per 100,000; patients with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes are at greater risk of vasculopathic 3rd nerve palsy, and elderly patients with symptoms of scalp or temporal tenderness or jaw claudication are at risk for 3rd nerve palsy due to giant cell arteritis; diplopia, loss of binocular vision, compensatory head position, and reconstruction of alignment all warrant treatment consideration.

Methods and results

Clinical assessment

A 63-year-old man emergently referred himself after waking up with double vision and a sense that the environment was moving, an unsteady gait, dizziness, and a mild headache. He had no history of visual or ocular motor dysfunction and strabismus and reported normal vision in both eyes. Neuroophthalmological assessment (Fig. 1 A) showed a rightward head tilt and a mild skew deviation with left eye hypertropia upon cover testing, consistent with a rightward ocular tilt reaction. There was a tonic horizontal misalignment: esodeviation with right eye turning inwards, greater in distance and upgaze, but without associated abduction deficit, consistent with non-paretic esotropia. Limited upgaze could be partly overcome by vertical vestibular-ocular reflex testing, suggesting a supranuclear etiology.

### Bell's palsy: diagnosis and management… [^dc3564e0]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Bell's palsy is an idiopathic, acute peripheral-nerve palsy involving the facial nerve, which supplies all the muscles of facial expression. The facial nerve also contains parasympathetic fibers to the lacrimal and salivary glands, as well as limited sensory fibers supplying taste to the anterior two thirds of the tongue. Clinical Presentation Patients with Bell's palsy typically complain of weakness or complete paralysis of all the muscles on one side of the face. The facial creases and nasolabial fold disappear, the forehead unfurrows, and the corner of the mouth droops. The eyelids will not close and the lower lid sags; on attempted closure, the eye rolls upward. Eye irritation often results from lack of lubrication and constant exposure. Tear production decreases; however, the eye may appear to tear excessively because of loss of lid control, which allows tears to spill freely from the eye.

Food and saliva can pool in the affected side of the mouth and may spill out from the corner. Patients often complain of a feeling of numbness from the paralysis, but facial sensation is preserved. Etiology and Differential Diagnosis Bell's palsy is believed to be caused by inflammation of the facial nerve at the geniculate ganglion, which leads to compression and possible ischemia and demyelination. This ganglion lies in the facial canal at the junction of the labyrinthine and tympanic segments, where the nerve curves sharply toward the stylomastoid foramen. Polyneuropathies will more often affect both facial nerves. Tumors will present with a more insidious onset of symptoms over weeks or months. Central nervous system lesions can also cause facial nerve palsy.

However, some motor neurons to the forehead cross sides at the level of the brainstem, so the fibers in the facial nerve going to the forehead come from both cerebral hemispheres. Supranuclear lesions affecting the facial nerve will not paralyze the forehead on the affected side, resulting in a unilateral facial paralysis with forehead sparing. Often, there will be at least some weakness of extremities on the affected side as well. Table 1 1, 6–8 summarizes the differential diagnosis of Bell's palsy.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^70c1d582]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Oculomotor palsy — patient population and clinical objectives — The patient population is adults with strabismus caused by oculomotor palsy; clinical objectives are to determine the etiology of the 3rd nerve palsy, counsel the patient on the diagnosis and treatment options, provide goal-directed management of strabismus (reconstruction, binocular vision, or reduction of diplopia), and inform the patient's other health care providers of the diagnosis and treatment plan.

### Clinical reasoning: a 73-year-old man with progressive proximal muscle weakness and binocular diplopia [^910d8b4b]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Progressive weakness and diplopia have a wide differential diagnosis, which can be narrowed by obtaining a detailed history and performing a careful physical examination. It is essential to determine whether these 2 symptoms are due to a single, unifying process or separate processes. We review the case of a 73-year-old man with progressive proximal lower than upper extremity weakness, followed by binocular horizontal diplopia. Clinical history, with attention to rate of progression and associated symptomatology, guided our diagnostic approach and final diagnosis.

### Clinical reasoning: a 51-year-old woman with diplopia and headache [^bfcca7d2]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

A 51-year-old woman presented with a pressure-like headache behind her right eye and horizontal diplopia. On examination, she was unable to abduct or adduct the right eye but had intact vertical eye movements. Her deficits could not be overcome using the oculocephalic reflex. Imaging initially was interpreted as optic neuritis, but on careful review with radiology, a diffuse enhancing hyperintense signal within the orbital apex confirmed an orbital infiltrate. The focus of this case study is to review the localization approach for diplopia and build a differential diagnosis for orbital processes. Another key point is the importance of relying on the physical examination as the guide to a patient's management rather than imaging findings, which can often be misleading.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^c5f54c6c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — strong recommendations (Action Statements) specify that the development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians should assess the patient using history and physical examination to exclude identifiable causes in acute-onset unilateral facial paresis or paralysis; clinicians should prescribe oral steroids within 72 hours of symptom onset for Bell's palsy patients 16 years and older; clinicians should not prescribe oral antiviral therapy alone for patients with new-onset Bell's palsy; and clinicians should implement eye protection for Bell's palsy patients with impaired eye closure.

### Concomitant abducens and facial nerve palsies following blunt head trauma associated with bone fracture [^3e009425]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A 22-year-old man was referred for horizontal diplopia that worsened on left gaze. He had been admitted for a head trauma caused by a traffic accident. Brain CT scan showed a longitudinal fracture of the left temporal bone with extension to the left carotid canal and central skull base, including sphenoid lateral wall and roof, and left orbit medial wall non-displaced fracture. Prism cover test revealed 20 prism diopters of esotropia and abduction limitation in the left eye. Hess screening test results were compatible with left abducens nerve paralysis. Symptoms suggesting complete lower motor neuron palsy of the left facial nerve, such as unilateral facial drooping, inability to raise the eyebrow and difficulty closing the eye, were present. As there was no improvement in facial paralysis, the patient received surgical intervention using a transmastoidal approach. Three months postoperatively, prism cover test showed orthotropia, however, the facial nerve palsy persisted.

### Hemisensory loss in myasthenia gravis [^c8532b6b]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 73-year-old white man presents with left-sided ptosis and diplopia in the absence of ophthalmoplegia, with left hemibody paresthesia. He reports intermittent dysphagia and dizziness for 1 month and diarrhoea for 2 months. Serum and electrodiagnostic studies confirmed the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. This case highlights the non-classic presentation of myasthenia gravis in the absence of ophthalmoplegia with a unique unexplained hemisensory deficit.

### A rare differential diagnosis in dysphagia: wound botulism [^d3bb9741]. The Laryngoscope (2006). Low credibility.

The incidence of wound botulism is increasing dramatically among intravenous drug users. Efficient intensive care and early treatment with antitoxin is essential to avoid lethal courses. The clinical picture of botulism is of descending, symmetric, flaccid paralysis. Early symptoms include cranial nerve palsies resulting in blurred vision and diplopia, difficulty in focusing, ptosis, facial weakness, dysphagia, dysphonia, and dysarthria. Because patients presenting with dysarthria and dysphagia will often be seen by an ear, nose and throat specialist initially, this rare but upcoming neurologic disease must be considered in the differential diagnoses.

Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) clinical assessment — Diagnosis is based on both the clinical presentation and a detailed history and physical examination. Typical symptoms include neck stiffness; pain in the cervical, thoracic or lumbar vertebral area; subjective hearing symptoms; visual disturbances; and vertigo. Headaches are frequently reported after childbirth, but only a minority may be attributed to PDPH. Headache may be worse with coughing or a Valsalva maneuver, and visual disturbances may be associated with cranial nerve palsy, with the abducens and facial nerve most affected, typically accompanied with diplopia and facial weakness.

Progression

Over the next 18 months, she reported more prominent diplopia with occasional blurred vision, as well as frequent dystonic posturing, particularly of the left hand. She suffered extreme fatigue with variable confusion and irritability, exacerbated by chronic headaches. In addition, she developed widespread arthralgia. There was a marked decline in her handwriting, which became progressively smaller and more illegible.

On examination, she had a markedly ataxic gait and worsening coordination. Upper limb examination showed cogwheeling reinforced by synkinesis, and mild dysdiadochokinesis. Reflexes and muscle bulk remained largely intact. A speech and language therapist felt that her fluctuating slurred speech with mild word-finding problems was a 'Parkinsonian-like dysarthria'; there was also dysfunctional coordination of swallowing. The patient reported her speech and swallowing worsened with tiredness or anxiety. Her depression deepened, with frequent mood swings and agitation.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^4e387aa6]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Oculomotor palsy — disease definition and clinical features — is also known as a 3rd nerve palsy and is the second most common cranial neuropathy; patients usually present with diplopia from misalignment that has both a horizontal and vertical component and sometimes with difficulty reading secondary to accommodative deficiency, and the presentation is an incomitant deviation with ptosis and extraocular muscle paresis that typically leaves the eye abducted, infraducted, and incyclotorted due to preserved lateral rectus and superior oblique function; the pupil may or may not be involved, which should be noted to help direct evaluation, and aberrant re-innervation is more common with prior trauma or a compressive lesion but can also occur with other etiologies.

Conclusion

BFP is a disturbing condition for the affected patient and contrary to UFP, it is generally attributable to a specific cause. Associated aetiologies are various and differential diagnosis is challenging. If a correct diagnosis is formulated, possibilities to recover are elevated and directly correlated to the initiation of appropriate treatment. Physicians should rule out all possible causes before claiming a BFP as idiopathic.

### Clinical reasoning: a young woman with rapidly progressive weakness and paresthesia [^be19e2e5]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

A 24-year-old Middle Eastern woman presented with a 2-month history of rapidly progressive asymmetric weakness and paresthesia that began in her left lower extremity and progressed to involve both legs and arms. It was associated with overflow urinary incontinence and significant weight loss. In addition, she complained of a constant occipital headache that worsened in the supine position and was associated with photophobia, tinnitus, nausea, vomiting, and horizontal binocular diplopia. She also had signs of meningismus, decreased left facial sensation, and right sensorineural hearing loss. Because multifocal localization suggests a wide variety of possible differential diagnoses, this study expands on the differential of a subacute multifocal process while highlighting the importance of identifying appropriate risk factors and performing a relevant yet focused diagnostic workup.

### Progressive bilateral facial weakness [^b9132d2e]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

A 72-year-old man presented with sudden onset of right-sided facial muscle weakness and slurred speech and a 3-day history of fevers, myalgia and sore throat. There was no hyperacusis, change in taste or lacrimation. His history included untreated hepatitis C diagnosed 10 years before, but quiescent at his annual liver review 8 weeks before presentation. He smoked cannabis intermittently but there was no recent alcohol or other drug abuse. There was a history of promiscuity with female partners.

On examination, he was alert and orientated. His blood pressure was elevated at 159/86 mm Hg but other vital signs and general examination were normal. Neurological examination showed a severe right-sided lower motor facial weakness with Bell's phenomenon (see online). The remaining cranial nerve examination was normal, including eye movements, pupillary responses, facial sensation, hearing, taste and otoscopy. There was mild left hip flexion weakness but preserved deep tendon reflexes. There was reduced sensation to temperature in a glove-and-stocking pattern; joint-position sense, light touch and pain sensation were intact. There was mild gait instability on walking tandem.

His condition progressed rapidly and on day 2 of admission he developed left-sided facial weakness (figure 1) with bilateral, proximal lower limb weakness. His paraesthesias were more painful. His lower limb deep tendon reflexes were no longer present (see online). Spirometry remained normal. He was transferred to a high dependency unit for ongoing monitoring.

### Bell palsy: rapid evidence review [^592a4238]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Bell's palsy:

- **Definition**: Bell's palsy, also known as idiopathic facial paralysis, is an acute-onset, isolated, unilateral, lower motor neurone facial weakness/paralysis.
- **Pathophysiology**: The exact cause of Bell's palsy is unknown; however, reactivation of herpes virus at the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve has been postulated.
- **Disease course**: The likely vascular distension, inflammation, and edema with ischemia of the facial nerve results in Bell's palsy, which presents with clinical manifestations of unilateral weakness/paralysis of upper and lower facial muscles, drooping of ipsilateral eyelids, dry eye due to inability to close eyes completely, epiphora, drooping of the corner of the mouth, ipsilateral impaired/loss of taste sensation, difficulty in eating, dribbling of saliva, altered sensation on the affected side of the face, pain in or behind the ear, hyperacusis on the affected side if stapedius muscle is involved. Spontaneous complete recovery occurs in 70–75% of untreated patients.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Bell's palsy is not associated with an increased risk of mortality.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^646b2989]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult strabismus — superior oblique muscle palsy background notes that superior oblique muscle palsy is one of the common types of vertical strabismus seen in adults, and annual incidence has been reported to be 6.3 cases per 100,000 people with a higher incidence among males than females; risk factors include head trauma and increasing age (in age-related decompensation of congenital weakness). In long-standing and presumed congenital superior oblique palsy (SOP), patients may experience no diplopia or intermittent diplopia and a long-standing effective compensatory head position minimizes diplopia awareness; based on later-decade presentations, the natural history of presumed congenital SOP is deterioration in some cases. Treatment is warranted for diplopia, compensatory head position sometimes associated with neck pain, and asthenopia.

### A case of ocular cardiac reflex in a child with blunt ocular trauma [^208d9fdd]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

An 11-year-old boy re-presented with refractory vomiting 18h after blunt facial and head trauma. Initial CT of the brain performed at his first visit was normal. He was found to have a heart rate of 56bpm (age appropriate 65-100bpm) with a blood pressure 90/60mmHg. Physical examination revealed an injected sclera and limited vertical movement of the left eye. Neurological examination revealed no focal deficits, but a Glasgow Coma Scale of 14, with mild confusion, depressed mental status and diplopia on upward gaze. Performing upward gaze extra ocular movements exacerbated the patient's bradycardia and confirmed the presence of the oculocardiac reflex. High-resolution CT of orbits demonstrated a left orbital floor fracture with entrapment of the left inferior rectus muscle. Surgical correction resolved his bradycardia.

### Intracranial causes of ophthalmoplegia: the visual reflex pathways [^18e24da5]. Radiographics (2013). Low credibility.

The gathering of visual information is a complex process that relies on concerted movements of the eyes, and cranial nerves II-VIII are at least partially involved in the visual system. The cranial nerves do not function in isolation, however, and there are multiple higher-order cortical centers that have input into the cranial nerves to coordinate eye movement. Among the functions of the cortical reflex pathways are (a) controlling vertical and horizontal gaze in response to vestibular input to keep the eyes focused on an object as the head moves through space, and (b) controlling rapid, coordinated eye movement to a new visual target (saccades). There are also reflex pathways connecting the cranial nerves involved in vision that produce consensual blinking of the eyes in response to corneal stimulation of one eye and consensual pupillary constriction in response to light input on one pupil. A variety of intracranial pathologic conditions, including benign and malignant neoplasms, infection, trauma, autoimmune diseases, vascular anomalies, degenerative diseases, and inherited-congenital disorders, can disrupt the cranial nerves and visual reflex pathways. This disruption can manifest in myriad ways-for example, as extraocular muscle paresis, afferent pupillary defect, oculosympathetic paresis (Horner syndrome), internuclear ophthalmoplegia, dorsal midbrain (Parinaud) syndrome, or loss of the corneal reflex. Knowledge of the function and anatomy of the cranial nerves and visual reflex pathways, coupled with selection of the proper magnetic resonance pulse sequence, will allow the radiologist to order appropriate imaging of the involved cranial nerve or visual reflex pathway based on the patient's symptoms and thereby play an essential role in establishing the diagnosis and planning appropriate therapy.

Objective

Bell's palsy, named after the Scottish anatomist, Sir Charles Bell, is the most common acute mono-neuropathy, or disorder affecting a single nerve, and is the most common diagnosis associated with facial nerve weakness/paralysis. Bell's palsy is a rapid unilateral facial nerve paresis (weakness) or paralysis (complete loss of movement) of unknown cause. The condition leads to the partial or complete inability to voluntarily move facial muscles on the affected side of the face. Although typically self-limited, the facial paresis/paralysis that occurs in Bell's palsy may cause significant temporary oral incompetence and an inability to close the eyelid, leading to potential eye injury. Additional long-term poor outcomes do occur and can be devastating to the patient. Treatments are generally designed to improve facial function and facilitate recovery. There are myriad treatment options for Bell's palsy, and some controversy exists regarding the effectiveness of several of these options, and there are consequent variations in care. In addition, numerous diagnostic tests available are used in the evaluation of patients with Bell's palsy. Many of these tests are of questionable benefit in Bell's palsy. Furthermore, while patients with Bell's palsy enter the health care system with facial paresis/paralysis as a primary complaint, not all patients with facial paresis/paralysis have Bell's palsy. It is a concern that patients with alternative underlying etiologies may be misdiagnosed or have unnecessary delay in diagnosis. All of these quality concerns provide an important opportunity for improvement in the diagnosis and management of patients with Bell's palsy.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve the accuracy of diagnosis for Bell's palsy, to improve the quality of care and outcomes for patients with Bell's palsy, and to decrease harmful variations in the evaluation and management of Bell's palsy. This guideline addresses these needs by encouraging accurate and efficient diagnosis and treatment and, when applicable, facilitating patient follow-up to address the management of long-term sequelae or evaluation of new or worsening symptoms not indicative of Bell's palsy. The guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with Bell's palsy. The target population is inclusive of both adults and children presenting with Bell's palsy. ACTION STATEMENTS: The development group made a strong recommendation that (a) clinicians should assess the patient using history and physical examination to exclude identifiable causes of facial paresis or paralysis in patients presenting with acute-onset unilateral facial paresis or paralysis, (b) clinicians should prescribe oral steroids within 72 hours of symptom onset for Bell's palsy patients 16 years and older, (c) clinicians should not prescribe oral antiviral therapy alone for patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, and (d) clinicians should implement eye protection for Bell's palsy patients with impaired eye closure. The panel made recommendations that (a) clinicians should not obtain routine laboratory testing in patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, (b) clinicians should not routinely perform diagnostic imaging for patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, (c) clinicians should not perform electrodiagnostic testing in Bell's palsy patients with incomplete facial paralysis, and (d) clinicians should reassess or refer to a facial nerve specialist those Bell's palsy patients with (1) new or worsening neurologic findings at any point, (2) ocular symptoms developing at any point, or (3) incomplete facial recovery 3 months after initial symptom onset. The development group provided the following options: (a) clinicians may offer oral antiviral therapy in addition to oral steroids within 72 hours of symptom onset for patients with Bell's palsy, and (b) clinicians may offer electrodiagnostic testing to Bell's palsy patients with complete facial paralysis. The development group offered the following no recommendations: (a) no recommendation can be made regarding surgical decompression for patients with Bell's palsy, (b) no recommendation can be made regarding the effect of acupuncture in patients with Bell's palsy, and (c) no recommendation can be made regarding the effect of physical therapy in patients with Bell's palsy.

Facial nerve palsy has a broad differential diagnosis and possible psychological and anatomical consequences. A thorough investigation must be performed to determine the cause of the palsy and to direct treatment. If no cause can be found, therapy with prednisone with or without an antiviral medication can be considered and begun as early as possible after onset of symptoms. Resolution and time to recovery vary with etiology, but overall prognosis is good.

His usual frequency of headaches was nearly daily for the past year which came in waves of headaches lasting 10–20 min for a total duration of 2–3 h, with symptoms of nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, bilateral eyelid swelling and sweating.

During physical examination, his BP was 119/67 mmHg, his HR was 64 bpm and regular. He remained apyrexial throughout admission. He was found to have a right partial ptosis with anisocoria. The right conjunctiva was injected. His right pupil was 2 mm and left pupil was 3 mm, and there was a slight elevation of his right lower eyelid with delayed pupillary dilatation in dim light (Fig. 3). He had binocular diplopia without ophthalmoplegia at bilateral lateral gaze without any nystagmus. There was no skew deviation of the eyes. He was dysarthric. He had decreased motor power of MRC grade 4 out of 5 involving the entire right upper and lower limbs. There was a right-sided facial droop; with a loss of sensation over the right side of the face, the entire upper and lower limbs to modalities of pinprick, temperature and fine touch. The tongue was central with equal movement of the uvulae. His tone was decreased over the right upper and lower limbs. There was no pronator drift and the Babinski's reflexes were plantar bilaterally.

The patient was placed back on aspirin and clopidogrel as his CYP2C19 genome tests showed that he was a normal metabolizer of clopidogrel. An urgent CT angiography (CTA) from the arch of the aorta to the Circle of Willis did not reveal any dissections, aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations, nor findings consistent with temporal arteritis (Fig. 4). No cranial infarction nor intracranial haemorrhage was seen at that time. He had persistent neurological deficits after the CT angiogram. His electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with neither evidence of acute coronary syndrome, atrial fibrillation, nor arrhythmias. His serum sodium, potassium and white blood cell counts were all within normal limits. A serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate was not performed as there was no symptoms of jaw claudication nor polymyalgia rheumatica; the patient's blood haemoglobin was 13.2 g/dL.

### Blood, brain and binocular vision [^3c4252b4]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A man aged 51 years presented with sudden onset, horizontal, binocular, double vision and right facial weakness. Ocular motility examination demonstrated a right horizontal gaze palsy pattern in keeping with a one-and-a-half syndrome. Since this was associated with a concomitant, ipsilateral, lower motor neuron (LMN) facial (VIIth) cranial nerve palsy, he had acquired an eight-and-a-half syndrome. Diffusion-weighted MRI confirmed a small infarcted area in the pons of the brainstem which correlated with anatomical location of the horizontal gaze centre and VIIth cranial nerve fasciculus. As a result of this presentation, further investigations uncovered a hitherto undiagnosed blood dyscrasia-namely polycythaemia vera. Regular venesection was started which resulted in complete resolution of his ocular motility dysfunction and an improvement of his LMN facial nerve palsy.

### Isolated facial diplegia in Guillain-Barrésyndrome: bifacial weakness with paresthesias [^4664b610]. Muscle & Nerve (2015). Low credibility.

Bifacial weakness with paresthesias (BFP) is a subtype of Guillain-Barré syndrome defined by rapidly progressive bilateral facial weakness in the absence of other cranial neuropathies, ataxia, or limb weakness. Many patients also complain of distal limb paresthesias and display diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes. BFP is a localized form of Guillain-Barré syndrome and is thought to be caused exclusively by demyelinating- rather than axonal-type neuropathy. Patients with BFP do not display anti-ganglioside IgG antibodies. Since it is rare, many physicians are unfamiliar with BFP, as bilateral facial weakness is more commonly associated with sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, or meningeal pathology. Many patients diagnosed with bilateral Bell palsy may instead have BFP. In this review, we highlight the clinical features of BFP and outline diagnostic criteria.

Case presentation

History

A 67-year-old gentleman with undiagnosed dyslipidemia and hypertension presented with difficulty in walking and painless diplopia for 1 week. He noticed the symptoms after waking up from sleep.

He denied any head trauma, headache, nausea, or vomiting. There were no associated sensory, motor, speech, and vertigo symptoms. There was no family history of cerebral vascular accident or ischaemic heart disease. His ocular history was insignificant, with no previous ocular surgery. He had never undergone any medical check-up.

Physical examination

The vital sign showed elevated blood pressure (175/89 mmHg) with normal random blood sugar (6.7 mmol/L). Visual acuity with a pinhole was 6/10 OD (right eye) and 6/15 OS (left eye). Both pupils were round and equal in size (3mm) with a sluggish direct light reflex. The swinging light test showed no relative afferent pupillary defect.

On primary gaze, eyes were central on Hirschberg light reflex test. There was no ptosis, proptosis, or abnormal head posture. Assessment of extraocular muscle motility revealed a horizontal abducting nystagmus in the right eye in right gaze and left eye was unable to adduct beyond the midline on dextroversion. Besides that, there was a limitation in elevation in both eyes, with normal depression.(Fig. 1) He experienced diplopia only in dextroversion, dextroelevation and dextrodepression. He was unable to converge, hence light-near dissociation could not be elicited. Slit-lamp examination showed cataract in both eyes. Otherwise, his anterior and posterior segments were normal in both eyes.

Fig. 1
In the 9 diagnostic positions of gaze, left eye unable to adduct beyond the midline with right eye abduction nystagmus and marked upgaze limitation

Moving on to neurological examination, the patient was alert and conscious with a full Glasgow Coma Scale. His speech was clear, coherent, and relevant. Besides the abnormal ocular motility, other cranial nerves were all intact. The sensory and motor function of all 4 limbs were full and of normal tone. Proprioception and plantar reflex were unremarkable. However, he had bilateral appendicular ataxia in both upper and lower limbs worse in the left side. He was frequently falling towards the left side on tandem gait assessment.

She had two uncomplicated pregnancies and gave birth to two unaffected children (Fig. 2B). She was diagnosed with congenital bilateral facial nerve diplegia at birth and presented with feeding difficulties during infancy, but no additional information about perinatal period or early childhood was available. Velopharyngoplasty for submucous cleft soft palate was performed at age 9 years. Since the age of 18 years, she experienced chronic headache and episodes of bilateral upper extremities weakness and pain. She was referred to the clinical genetics department because of syndromic congenital facial diplegia. Physical examination revealed short stature [147 cm (−3 SD), Weight 49 kg (−0.5 SD), Fronto-occipital head circumference 52.3 cm (−2 DS)], hand muscle atrophy, and craniofacial dysmorphisms including retrognathia, strabismus, and posteriorly rotated ears with large ear lobes. Hypernasal speech was also noted. The neurological examination showed bilateral facial diplegia without any other cranial nerve involvement, mild distal muscle weakness in all limbs, weak deep tendon reflexes in the upper limbs, in the absence of cerebellar or sensory impairment. She had normal intellectual capacity.

Case presentation

A 32-year old gentleman presented to the ophthalmic accident and emergency department with a four-day history of worsening horizontal and vertical diplopia. He denied any other ophthalmic or neurological symptoms at presentation. Other than a recent mild coryzal illness he was fit and well. He had no significant past ocular or medical history and took no regular medications.

Ocular examination within the accident and emergency department showed a one-millimetre ptosis of the left upper lid, with limitation of left ocular movements in all directions of gaze. Right ocular movements were full. The remainder of the ocular and cranial nerve examination was normal. Eye movement testing showed a -2/-3 reduction in left ocular movements in all directions of gaze, with an associated +2 over-action in the corresponding right ocular movements. Figure 1 shows the Hess chart recorded at presentation.

A CT scan of his head with contrast showed no abnormality and the patient was transferred to the regional neurosciences centre for further investigation where the patient was found to be ataxic on heel to toe walk and the deep tendon reflexes were absent. Further investigation including an MRI, serology, lumbar puncture and Tensilon test were normal. Anti GQ1b IgG antibodies were positive with a significant titre by laboratory reference range, confirming the clinical diagnosis of Miller Fisher syndrome. With conservative management the patient's signs and symptoms resolved spontaneously within five weeks of presentation, leaving no permanent sequelae.

Background

A 37-year-old Brazilian man was admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital for evaluation of left-sided facial numbness, left-sided ataxia, dizziness, and vertigo. Seven weeks prior to admission, he reported numbness of the left oral cavity and tongue after a dental procedure. Three weeks prior to presentation, he developed left-sided incoordination with dizziness and vertigo. One week later, he noticed difficulty using a box cutter at work and presented to the emergency department for evaluation. A CT scan without contrast revealed no abnormalities and he was discharged home. Three days prior to admission, the patient developed diplopia. Cranial MRI revealed a 1.6 cm irregular enhancing mass in the left middle cerebellar peduncle. Neurologic examination was significant for diminished sensation over the left face to pinprick, left-sided dysmetria, and mild lateral instability of the trunk while walking.

Investigations

MRI, lumbar puncture, CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, needle biopsy of the lymph node, and paraneoplastic antibodies.

Diagnosis

Possible paraneoplastic demyelination.

Management

Orchiectomy, adjuvant radiation, and corticosteroids.

### Binocular diplopia. A practical approach [^bb197bb3]. The Neurologist (2005). Low credibility.

Among other possible causes, binocular diplopia can be caused by thyroid eye disease, multiple sclerosis, Wernicke's encephalopathy, botulism, extraocular muscle entrapment, progressive external ophthalmoplegia, IgG4-related ophthalmic disease, complication of eye surgery, vitamin E deficiency, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, myasthenia gravis, trochlear nerve palsy, abducens nerve palsy, intracranial hypertension, oculomotor nerve palsy, orbital cellulitis, orbital fracture, nasopharyngeal cancer, maxillary sinus carcinoma, temporal arteritis, orbital mass and acute ischemic stroke. In addition, binocular diplopia can be caused by medications such as temozolomide, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide, gabapentin, flecainide, rufinamide and lacosamide ER.

### Noncoding variants alter GATA2 expression in rhombomere 4 motor neurons and cause dominant hereditary congenital facial paresis [^13e3eebd]. Nature Genetics (2023). High credibility.

HCFP1 facial weakness is a neurogenic disorder

We examined a subset of participants to determine whether SNVs and duplications resulted in similar phenotypes. Among the 37 variant-positive participants with detailed phenotypic documentation, 2 were clinically unaffected and 4 had mild weakness but considered themselves unaffected (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). These six individuals all harbor SNVs, suggesting that SNVs can cause a milder phenotype. Among the 35 participants with visible facial weakness, 83% (29 of 35) had bilateral weakness, which was typically asymmetrical with regard to both sidedness and upper versus lower face, and facial nerves (cranial nerve VII) were hypoplastic on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; Fig. 2a–q). Electromyography, nerve conduction studies, blink studies, acoustic stapedial reflex testing and auditory brainstem response studies were consistent with facial nerve neuropathy in the seven participants tested (Supplementary Clinical Note and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Thus, HCFP1 is neurogenicand both SNVs and duplications cause nonsyndromic, mild-to-moderate severity CFP, supporting a shared neurodevelopmental mechanism.

### Ophthalmic grading of facial paralysis: need for a closer look [^ca943713]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Very many variations of facial grading systems have been developed, but none address the ophthalmic complications of facial nerve weakness adequately. The important priorities for ophthalmic surgeon are protecting the ocular surface, maintaining sight and peripheral vision, as well as improving the cosmesis of periocular area. The absence of a universally agreed grading system on the ophthalmic plastic complications of facial nerve paralysis is an obstacle to standardised treatment. It is time for clinicians to recognise this need.

### Acquired bilateral facial palsy: a systematic review on aetiologies and management [^2cd1ef8a]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients without a history of head trauma or iatrogenic BFP, must be interviewed about recent travels, risky behaviours, tick bite, autoimmune, previous known autoimmune, metabolic and oncologic disorders. Afterwards, a complete physical exam, blood tests and autoimmune tests should be performed in all cases. If neurological signs and symptoms are present, neurology consultation is needed and CSF analysis required according to the specialist consultation. Serology for common infectious diseases that can cause BFP (see Table 1) should be ruled out in all patients and if infectious screening is positive, proper medical treatment must be administered. ENT consultation is recommended in all cases especially to investigate vestibulo-cochlear function.

Since some pathologies (such as neoplasm or temporal bone infections) may present with rapidly progressive symptoms and lead in short time to a poor prognosis, in our opinion it is necessary to perform all cited exams in all patients with no associated or nonspecific symptoms. When all the above-mentioned work up is inconclusive, before diagnosing a BFP as idiopathic, we suggest performing at least a contrast-enhanced brain MRI, which could exclude neoplastic or vascular disorders. A better understanding of the causes leads to a high rate of recovery from BFP (complete bilateral recovery in more than 60% of cases, with most patients improving within 3 months from the palsy onset).

BFP treatment strictly depends on correct diagnosis. Infectious causes may benefit from antibiotics or antivirals, Bell palsy or autoimmune causes may need steroids or Immunoglobulins. Additionally, regardless of specific aetiology, physical therapy by a speech therapist or a physiotherapist can be effective in helping patients to recover strength and relearn specific movements such as eye closure and smile, limiting long term impairment such as the development of synkinesis. When paralysis is congenital or results from physical disruption (i.e. traumatic or iatrogenic) of the facial nerve, or when conservative treatment fails, surgical intervention may be warranted. The dominant concern in upper facial paralysis is impaired eye closure, which can predispose the eye to corneal exposure and threaten vision. In the lower face, loss of oral competence and the ability to smile are primary concerns. Notably, the role of facial nerve decompression in acute stages for patients with complete idiopathic or posttraumatic paralysis (e.g. in Bell palsy and Melkersson–Rosenthal syndrome) is gaining increasing importance.

### A decade-long dance with diplopia: unraveling the enigma of recurrent 6th nerve palsy… [^ffee37a4]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation: A 39-year-old farmer presented with recurrent diplopia attributed to 6th nerve palsy, with eight episodes over 14 years. Despite systemic steroid treatment, the symptoms recurred every 12–18 months. Clinical examination revealed right eye abduction impairment; -, no other abnormalities were detected. Magnetic resonance imaging indicated rhinosinusitis, and the results of the autoimmune antibody test were negative. Case Presentation: A 39-year-old farmer presented with recurrent diplopia attributed to 6th nerve palsy, with eight episodes over 14 years. Despite systemic steroid treatment, the symptoms recurred every 12–18 months. Clinical examination revealed right eye abduction impairment; -, no other abnormalities were detected. Magnetic resonance imaging indicated rhinosinusitis, and the results of the autoimmune antibody test were negative.

During the previous episode, the patient sought medical attention with the chief complaint of acute-onset double vision persisting for 10 days. No significant concurrent medical or surgical issues were reported, aside from a recurrent history of diplopia, and treatment during previous occurrences involving systemic steroid administration, resulting in the complete resolution of symptoms. Recurrence typically manifest within 12–18 months of treatment. Clinical examination revealed that the patient could not abduct the right eye, whereas the remaining ocular and systemic examinations yielded normal results. Notably, there were no signs of myasthenia gravis, ptosis, and pain on the movement of the eyeballs, decreased visual acuity, trauma, red eyes, headache, focal neurological deficits, or meningeal or cerebellar abnormalities. Brain MRI revealed no abnormalities, except for the presence of rhinosinusitis.

The literature suggests that benign recurrent 6th nerve palsy in children is rare, and recurrences are rarer. 3, 4 This condition typically occurs following viral illnesses, infections, and immunization involving attenuated live vaccinations. This may be related to a structural lesion or an inflammatory process. 1 The etiological diagnosis of diplopia is a clinical challenge. 4 Binocular diplopia is referred to in the literature as the most common type, and there are several etiological mechanisms of binocular diplopia, including orbital disorders, extra-ocular muscle disorders, neuromuscular junction dysfunction, and primary or secondary visual cortex diseases. 4 In conclusion, the case of a 39-year-old male farmer with recurrent diplopia attributed to 6th nerve palsy highlights the diagnostic challenges and complexities of managing this rare condition.

Case 3

A 20-year-old woman without any significant past medical history, developed a sudden onset dizziness after she had been administrated the second dose BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine 2 days ago. Three days later, the patient developed limitation of his right eye movement in lateral gaze, binocular diplopia, headache, and right facial muscle weakness. Physical examination revealed both right sided facial palsy and right lateral rectus palsy. Patient had no history of neck stiffness, photophobia, phonophobia, upper respiratory tract infection, trauma, or any other trigger within last 6 months. Cerebrospinal fluid basic parameters (protein, cellularity, and glucose levels) were normal. Both CSF viral pathogen PCR panel and culture were negative. Cranial MRI, which was performed 10 days after the vaccination, demonstrated vivid and non-nodular gadolinium enhancement in the labyrinth portion of the right facial nerve, extending into the right geniculate ganglion (Figure 3). Laboratory studies including complete blood count displayed no abnormality. High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1gr/day for 10 days) was started promptly. The patient showed excellent response to the IV treatment and full symptomatic recovery was achieved.

### Extraocular cranial nerve palsies in children [^9c2a582d]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Visual disturbances resulting from acute nerve paralysis of the muscles controlling eye movements can be challenging to evaluate in the pediatric population. Children may not be capable of describing symptoms or providing an adequate history. Therefore, it is important to have an understanding of the anatomical course of the extraocular cranial nerves and clinical manifestations of their dysfunction. We report 2 cases of extraocular cranial nerve palsies and, in addition to an anatomical review, discuss the common etiologies of paralysis and the importance of ophthalmological and neurological follow-up to ensure optimal long-term visual function.

### Association between multiple sclerosis and the symptoms of vertigo and facial nerve palsy [^8eac6324]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with vertigo and facial nerve palsy as initial symptoms are rarely diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. A 43-year-old woman presented to our department with symptoms of vertigo and right facial nerve palsy (Yanagihara 16-point system [total score, 40] or House- Brackmann grade IV [obvious facial weakness]). On the day of the visit, she presented with right eye abduction, left eye adduction, and complaints of diplopia. Based on magnetic resonance imaging findings, she was diagnosed with clinically isolated syndrome, which is an early manifestation of multiple sclerosis. She was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone. Otolaryngologists often suspect Hunt's syndrome in patients who present with facial nerve palsy combined with vertigo. However, herein, we report our experience with an extremely rare case of a patient with atypical nystagmus symptoms, eye movement disorder, and diplopia secondary to facial palsy and vertigo, who presented with a clinical course different from that of Hunt's syndrome.

### White-eyed orbital blowout fracture with oculocardiac reflex secondary to extraocular entrapment in a pediatric patient [^4806d360]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

White-eyed orbital blowout fractures in the pediatric population can present with acute onset diplopia, ophthalmalgia, and abnormal duction. These findings are attributed to the tendency of younger bone to break and reapproximate owing to greater elasticity. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as the greenstick fracture, increases the risk of entrapment of surrounding soft tissue structures in orbital floor fractures. Further concern arises in the presence of an oculocardiac reflex, which requires urgent intervention to prevent serious bradycardia. Prolonged entrapment can go unnoticed and result in irreversible ischemic damage to entrapped tissues. This case discusses the presentation 16-year-old female who sustained a left sided, white-eyed blowout fracture from a face-first ground level fall. On admission, she displayed restrictive strabismus and mild periorbital edema around the left eye. Vertical gaze was restricted when looking inferiorly on the affected side. With sustained upward gaze, her heart rate decreased from 99 to 81 beats per minute. High-resolution non-contrast computed tomography scans of the head showed entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle and periorbital fat. Liberation of entrapped tissues with reduction of bony segments was performed urgently, utilizing a MEDPOR® Titan 3D orbital floor plate and secured with two screws. The patient had an uneventful postoperative period and showed considerable improvements in periorbital edema, duction, and ophthalmalgia on the affected side. In addition, the oculocardiac reflex could no longer be elicited on prolonged upward gaze. Mild and improving paresthesia was noted in the maxillary distribution of the left trigeminal nerve. Sensory deficits like this are the result of fracture communication with the infraorbital canal, which may cause irritation of the infraorbital nerve responsible for sensation by the maxillary division. By postoperative week 7, she had complete resolution of periorbital edema, indiscernible duction abnormalities, and complete healing of surgical incision sites, and an oculocardiac reflex could not be elicited.

### Bilateral facial paralysis: case presentation and discussion of differential diagnosis [^7d905138]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Bilateral facial paralysis is a rare condition and therefore represents a diagnostic challenge. We report the case of a 34-year-old healthy woman with sequential bilateral facial paralysis as a sole manifestation of sarcoidosis. She initially presented with an isolated left sided Bell's palsy without any symptoms to suggest alternative diagnoses. Within a month there was progression to peripheral facial paresis on the contra lateral side, prompting a diagnosis of Lyme disease. Her physical examination and chest x-ray did not reveal any clinical evidence of sarcoidosis. After failing to respond to an empiric trial of intravenous ceftriaxone for a presumptive diagnosis of Lyme disease, computed tomography scan of the chest was ordered which demonstrated bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Bronchoscopic biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The patient then made a complete recovery on steroid therapy. We discuss the differential diagnosis of facial diplegia and focus on the clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of neurosarcoidosis.

### Bell's palsy in children (bellPIC): protocol for a multicentre, placebo-controlled randomized trial [^23808309]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Bell's palsy, also known as acute idiopathic lower motor neurone facial paralysis, is characterized by sudden onset paralysis or weakness of the muscles to one side of the face controlled by the facial nerve. Bell's palsy is an idiopathic, presumed immune mediated phenomenon, possibly with an infection as the inciting event. In addition to the muscles of facial expression, the affected seventh cranial nerve in Bell's palsy also supplies the taste buds to the anterior two thirds of the tongue, muscles associated with hearing, and the salivary and lacrimal glands. The early effect of Bell's palsy is an inability to fully close the mouth and eye on the affected side of the face, causing difficulties in eating and speaking, corneal drying and erosion. Later symptoms can include pain around the ear sometimes extending to the back of head/neck, altered taste, synkinesis (involuntary facial movements), facial spasm, facial contracture, dysfunctional lacrimation (corneal drying and/or crocodile tears) and noise intolerance. The resulting impairment of oral competence, verbal communication and social interaction, can contribute to significant emotional distress during Bell's palsy.

Case report

A 43-year-old right-handed Nigerian man was referred to our centre with rapidly progressive neurological decline over a 19-month period. He presented initially in March 2011 with weight loss of 20 kg over 3 months. Two months later, he developed progressive confusion, fatigue, erectile difficulties, urinary urgency and incontinence. In March 2012, he suffered from recurrent episodes of slurred speech and right-sided weakness, lasting 30 min. At his local hospital, a non-contrast MRI head was normal, but an echocardiogram identified a restrictive cardiomyopathy and he was started on aspirin. The episodes were initially every 2 weeks but increased in frequency over time. In June 2012, he developed new left-sided hearing difficulties. By October 2012, he had developed painless paraesthesia in both feet.

There was no relevant past medical history. His father had suffered from weight loss, erectile dysfunction and renal problems, and died of a myocardial infarction in his 60s. His mother died in her 50s of unknown cause. Of his four siblings, the oldest brother died at age 14 but no clear cause was established. His sister had developed deafness in her 40s.

Cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal examination was unremarkable. Screening cognitive testing demonstrated anterograde memory difficulties, and impairment of attention and concentration; the MMSE score was 21/30. He had horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus and a brisk jaw jerk, but cranial nerve examination was otherwise normal. Neuro-ophthalmological assessment was normal. Examination of the limbs revealed increased tone and brisk reflexes in the upper and lower limbs and mild bilateral heel-shin ataxia.

### Asymmetric type F botulism with cranial nerve demyelination [^5ca92c9a]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The Patient

While traveling in Connecticut, a man from North Carolina in his mid-60s was admitted to a community hospital for new onset of diplopia, vertigo, truncal ataxia, and vomiting. Approximately 10 days before admission, the patient had been prescribed doxycycline for sinusitis. The physical examination at admission was notable for dilated, asymmetric (5 mm on the right and 4 mm on the left), sluggishly reactive pupils; cranial nerve IV palsy; bilateral proptosis (right more than left); bilateral peripheral facial weakness; and proximal left upper extremity weakness. Routine blood test results and imaging studies of head, brain, and orbits were unremarkable.

During hospital day 1, the patient experienced hypophonia, complete ophthalmoplegia, bilateral ptosis (right more than left), pupils unresponsive to light, dysphagia, and bilateral limb-girdle muscular weakness. His cognition remained intact, and no sensory deficits were documented. Cerebrospinal fluid contained 4 leukocytes/mm 3, 70 mg glucose/dL, and 43 mg protein/dL; bacterial cultures were negative. Serum was negative for IgG and IgM against Borrelia burgdorferi, and rapid plasma reagin test results were negative. Test results for antibody levels against Campylobacter spp. and gangliosides (anti-GQ1b IgG) were negative.

On hospital day 2, the patient had difficulty breathing and bulbar signs progressed, followed by descending extremity weakness (left more than right) and areflexia. A diagnosis of Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), a variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome, was considered, and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin was begun.

The Connecticut Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were contacted for a botulism consultation. Botulinum antitoxin was not administered at that time because asymmetric neurologic deficits and lack of exposure to injection-drug use or home-preserved foods made botulism unlikely. Respiratory paralysis progressed, and on hospital day 3 the patient required mechanical ventilation. A diagnosis of botulism was reconsidered; however, antitoxin was not administered because an alternative diagnosis (MFS) was still likely. Serum was collected on hospital day 5 and sent to CDC for botulism testing; a stool sample was collected on hospital day 14 after resolution of ileus. Neurologic improvement was first noted on hospital day 7, consisting of improved upper-extremity strength. On hospital day 14, weaning from mechanical ventilation was complete.

### Clinical reasoning: a 60-year-old woman with rapidly progressive muscle weakness and ophthalmoparesis [^a2d98011]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

The clinical assessment of patients with proximal muscle weakness represents a frequent yet intricate challenge. We present the case of a 60-year-old woman who experienced a progressive, symmetrical weakness in proximal limbs and bulbar muscles over 6 months. Notable clinical findings included bilateral ophthalmoparesis; widespread muscle atrophy; and pronounced weakness in craniobulbar, cervical, and proximal muscles, more severe than in distal ones. We elucidate a methodical diagnostic approach, focusing on constructing a comprehensive differential diagnosis and identifying potential causes of proximal muscle weakness. Special emphasis is placed on exploring the etiologies in cases presenting with both progressive muscle weakness and ophthalmoparesis. We further describe the role of muscle biopsy results and their integration with genetic testing outcomes.

Results

The index patient (II-2) and his affected sister (II-1) were from a consanguineous family where parents are second cousins (Fig. 1 a). The patient II-2 was born with syndactyly of the third and fourth fingers of both hands and the second and third toes of both feet. He also had pes cavus of both feet (Fig. 2 d–f). He started walking by age of 1 1 / 2, and his walking became clumsy at the age of three. By the age of four, he also had difficulty in pronouncing consonants. He was noted to display poor pencil grasp at the age of eight, and later received a diagnosis of dyspraxia with hypotonia. In addition, he had visual abnormalities with bilateral dilated pupils (unreactive to light) at the age of two, and had a history of photophobia dating back to the age of three. Over the years, the patient developed symptoms of slowness of swallowing, choking on food, blurred and double vision, imbalance, dragging his legs, easy fatigue, and weakness. These symptoms, particularly his gait, speech, and eyelid drop, were worse in the evening. The patient currently wears ankle foot to support his walking. On examination, he had obvious strabismus, gaze-evoked nystagmus to the left, as well as on up-gaze, and he had broken pursuit movements. He has a tonic pupil not reactive to light or accommodation. His fundi were normal. The rest of cranial nerve examination was normal. Power in lower limbs was Grade 4/5 throughout. Distal weakness in wrist extension was at 4/5, and finger extension and flexion were at 3/5. He displayed symmetrical hypo-reflexia with bilateral extensor plantars; however, his coordination was normal. Sensory examination showed that he had a patchy pin-prick loss in a glove and stocking distribution. Blood tests were negative for acetylcholine receptor antibodies, anti-MUSK antibody, and anti-voltage gated calcium channel antibody. The creatine kinase level and metabolic testing were normal. Electromyography and nerve conduction study of both patients were performed, and showed moderately severe axonal sensory-motor neuropathy (Table 1). There was no evidence of defect at the neuromuscular junction. There were mild chronic neurogenic changes on sampling the left orbicularis oculi. MRI of his head and whole spine showed mature damage in periaqueductal grey matter of upper tegmentum, and the prominence of the central canal at T7/8 level and the cord was mildly thinned throughout, but was otherwise normal (Fig. 4). Muscle biopsy showed marked neurogenic atrophy with prominent internal nuclei and appearance of necklace fibres (Fig. 3).

### Botulinum toxin for aberrant facial nerve regeneration: double-blind, placebo-controlled trial using subjective endpoints [^eacdeae9]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Aberrant facial nerve regeneration syndrome is systematically studied by constructing a subjective questionnaire organized into pertinent domains (impairment of quality of life, social interactions, perception of self-appearance, visual function, and perception of problem severity) and by physical assessment of degree of involuntary palpebral fissure closure during routine facial movements using videotaping and a physicians' grading scale.

Methods

The videotape measurements of corneal light reflex to upper lid margin distance and vertical palpebral distance were made during adynamic and active facial expression. Thirty-six patients were studied (six in an open-label pilot study design and 30 in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial). Botulinum toxin type A injections consistently suppressed the degree of involuntary eyelid movement associated with smiling, chewing, and puckering by each measurement and in both study designs.

Results

In all subjective morbidity domains, improvement was demonstrated in the double-blind study design (quality of life, p < 0.05; social interaction, p < 0.001; personal appearance, p < 0.001; peripheral visual impairment, p < 0.01; and perception of severity, p < 0.05). Correlation between degrees of physical impairment was significant but low comparing degree of subjective impairment to direct videotaped measurements. Correlation was more significant comparing subjective scores to the physicians' grading scale assessment of degree of physical impairment.

Conclusions

Impairment in quality of life, social interactions, and self-assessment of appearance closely reflected the nature of the morbidity associated with palpebral fissure asymmetry associated with aberrant facial nerve regeneration. The physicians' grading scale best reflected subjective morbidity over direct videotaped measurements.

A 59-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of left hemicranial headaches with ptosis and binocular diplopia. Clinical evaluation found left third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with mydriasis and ptosis. An MRI showed an enhancing lesion at the clivus with infiltration of left cavernous sinus. A trans-sphenoidal biopsy was performed, leading to diagnosis of metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent treatment and achieved clinical improvement.

Conclusions

In middle-aged men, it is important to include metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma in the differential diagnosis of cavernous sinus syndrome, even in the absence of primary tumor diagnosis.

### Multifocal demyelinating motor neuropathy and hamartoma syndrome associated with a de novomutation [^f4dc7a50]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

A 29-year-old patient had been born to nonconsanguineous Caucasian parents. Delayed motor development and speech were reported with facial asymmetry at 7 years of age. He developed focal weakness involving his right eye movements, his face, and contralateral extremities in the following years. By age 20, multiple livid papules and keloid scars appeared on his chest and he had bowel problems and learning difficulties.

Examination at age 29 revealed a large scaphocephalic head (macrocephaly), asymmetric face, and crowded teeth. The patient had upper thoracic scoliosis. Right oculomotor palsy, complete right-sided and partial left-sided facial palsy, and left-sided tongue atrophy were noted. He had nasal speech. There was both proximal and distal flaccid paresis in the left upper limb, with atrophy and areflexia. In the right arm, he had proximal flexor weakness but preserved distal grip strength. The right leg was short with pes cavus and hammertoes along with distal motor weakness and atrophy. The left leg showed no wasting and only mildly decreased strength in foot extensors. Knee jerk reflexes were brisk bilaterally, but ankle jerk reflexes were absent. Sensory examination was normal. There was no cerebellar ataxia, but he had learning difficulties.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of stroke rehabilitation [^6838ffac]. VA/DoD (2024). High credibility.

Sidebar 3: Stroke education topics — Stroke signs and symptoms are presented as BE FAST, detailing Balance (sudden difficulty with balance or coordination, dizziness, vertigo), Eyes (sudden blurred, double, or loss of vision in one or both eyes), Face (sudden facial droop/weakness on one side), Arm (sudden weakness in one arm), and Speech (slurred speech, inability to speak, or difficulty understanding speech); for Time, "If any of these symptoms occur, call 911. Time is critical for stroke". Common causes include ischemic stroke (80–90% of all strokes) with heart conditions such as atrial fibrillation, atherosclerosis of the large arteries in the neck and brain, and small vessel disease, and hemorrhagic stroke (10–20% of all strokes) with high blood pressure (hypertension), vascular malformations (aneurysm, cavernous malformation, fistula), and amyloid angiopathy. Listed stroke risk factors are high blood pressure (hypertension), high blood sugar (diabetes mellitus), high cholesterol (hyperlipidemia), heart conditions (atrial fibrillation, heart failure), tobacco/nicotine (smoking, vaping, chewing), history of previous stroke, and age, ethnicity, sex, race, socioeconomic status. Additional education topics include nutrition; physical activity and falls prevention; continuum of care options/follow-up after discharge; inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation; therapy at home; adjustment and coping after stroke; and primary care follow-up.

### The spectrum and differential diagnosis of acquired ocular motor nerve palsies: a clinical study of 502 patients [^8edb7bdc]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

One fifth of our patients with CNP VI had additional lesions of CN II (6.2%), CN V (9.5%) or CN VII (7.6%). This is easily explained by the anatomical proximity of the second and fifth cranial nerve close to the cavernous sinus and intraorbitally. 34.4% of the causes were located here. However, the percentage of causes was significantly higher at 31.3% in the brainstem and the roots and nearby meninges. The other causes were mainly systemic diseases (18.8%) such as MS, pseudotumor cerebri and myasthenia gravis. The well-known anatomical proximity of the sixth and seventh cranial nerves is the inner facial knee, which runs around the abducens nucleus. A quarter of the causes were located there. Due to the early intraosseous disappearance of CN VII, only a short anatomical proximity remains after leaving the brainstem. Therefore, 43.8% of the patients with CNP VI and VII suffered from meningitis, radiculitis, meningeosis carcinomatosa or neoplasm at the clivus.

A limitation of our study is the obvious referral bias, due to a patient population which is specific to an emergency room which is devoted to neurological patients. For example, the etiologies of OMNP in an ophthalmologic clinic may differ from neurological departments. Furthermore, in our study, due to the retrospectively collected data, a follow-up analysis was only possible in an insufficient number of patients, which is why we excluded these data from the study. Therefore, in individual cases it may be possible that patients who were initially classified as idiopathic or diabetogenic, might be reclassified a few months later. Data regarding individual symptoms (such as pathological corneal reflex) were often not complete and are not presented in this paper.

### Unilateral facial palsy in Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS): a rare occurrence [^7d818bd8]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is a postinfectious, autoimmune disorder which, apart from limb weakness, is characterised by cranial nerve involvement. Bilateral facial nerve palsy is the most common pattern of cranial nerve involvement in GBS. However, unilateral facial palsy, although uncommon, can be seen in GBS. We report a rare case of unilateral facial palsy in GBS and importance of electrophysiological tests including blink study in such cases has been emphasised.

### Acquired bilateral facial palsy: a systematic review on aetiologies and management [^510fd01d]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Both treated and untreated patients were included for the data analysis. Articles reporting information on a previously published case series or whose full-text versions were not available were excluded. A further manual check of the references included in the articles was performed and the final number of articles included in the present review was defined. The flowchart of the selection process is described in Fig. 1.

The general results regarding information on patient's characteristics, clinical presentation and aetiology were extracted from the articles and recorded on an Excel database.

After the review of the included studies, only full-text articles reporting the diagnostic work-up, the management, and the prognosis (complete, partial or no recovery) of the facial paralysis for each patient were considered for further specific data analysis. Regarding the grade of facial palsy, the highest grade reached throughout the clinical course was reported as facial score at clinical presentation. There was no funding source for this study.

### Möbius syndrome redefined: a syndrome of rhombencephalic maldevelopment [^e525eb72]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the variable clinical picture of Möbius syndrome (MIM no. 157900) and to further understand the pathogenesis of the disorder.

Methods

A standardized questionnaire was submitted to 37 Dutch patients with Möbius syndrome. All underwent standardized neurologic examination with special attention to cranial nerve functions, motor skills, and facial and limb anomalies.

Results

Of 37 patients with facial paresis, 97% had bilateral and 3% had unilateral ocular abduction weakness. Further analysis showed isolated abducens nerve palsy in 9%, a conjugated horizontal gaze paresis in 48%, features of Duane retraction syndrome in 34%, and congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles in 9%. Other signs included lingual involvement (77%), dysfunction of palate and pharynx (56%), general motor disability (88%), poor coordination (83%), and respiratory abnormalities (19%).

Conclusion

Möbius syndrome is more than a cranial nerve or nuclear developmental disorder. It is a syndrome of rhombencephalic maldevelopment involving predominantly motor nuclei and axons, as well as traversing long tracts. The authors also noted gaze palsies, Duane retraction syndrome, feeding and respiratory problems, and poor motor development, suggesting a regional developmental disorder.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^01b725c2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Natural history and therapies — most patients with Bell's palsy show some recovery without intervention within 2 to 3 weeks after onset of symptoms and completely recover within 3 to 4 months; even without treatment, facial function is completely restored in approximately 70% of patients with complete paralysis within 6 months and as high as 94% of patients with incomplete paralysis, with as many as 30% not recovering completely; corticosteroids and antiviral medications are the most commonly used medical therapies, and the benefit of surgical decompression of the facial nerve remains relatively controversial.

### A conflicting case of ophthalmoparesis… [^5f273931]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

A 37-year-old Asian nonsmoking man with no known medical or drug history presented with an insidious onset of left-eye ptosis and subsequent painless vertical diplopia for 1 year. He did not complain of headaches, facial numbness, dysarthria, facial droop, dysphagia, or limb weakness or numbness. There was no history of joint pain or constitutional symptoms. Neurological examination revealed a nonfatigable partial left-eyelid ptosis, left-eye hypotropia at primary position, and impaired left eye supraduction with a nonreactive left pupil on direct and consensual light reflexes. There were no other cranial nerve deficits. Limb reflexes, motor testing, and sensory testing results were normal, and the plantar responses were flexor. Cheng N.
