## Question

Which post-discharge COVID-19 patients from MICHELLE are the right candidates for rivaroxaban, and what benefit and safety were observed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which post-discharge COVID-19 patients from the MICHELLE trial are the right candidates for rivaroxaban, and what benefit and safety were observed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact inclusion and exclusion criteria used in MICHELLE. Then, I should verify the intervention details and duration. Next, I will examine the primary efficacy and safety outcomes and their statistical significance. After that, I need to consider external validation of the risk stratification tool and how generalizable the results are. Finally, I will integrate guideline positions and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with caveats about bleeding risk and renal function.

> Let me first confirm the trial design and population so I don't misstate eligibility. MICHELLE was an open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled trial in Brazil that enrolled patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who were at increased risk of venous thromboembolism, defined by an IMPROVE VTE score of 4 or more, or a score of 2–3 with a D-dimer greater than 500 ng/mL, and excluded those with severe renal failure, active bleeding, or another indication for anticoagulation, among other criteria [^cb741f28] [^cffbb2b3].

> Wait, let me verify the intervention specifics before discussing outcomes. The active arm received rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily for 35 days initiated at discharge, while the control arm received no anticoagulation beyond standard in-hospital prophylaxis; all patients had received standard-dose heparin thromboprophylaxis during hospitalization, which is important context for interpreting post-discharge effects [^cb741f28] [^cffbb2b3].

> I will now examine the primary efficacy outcome and its components. The composite primary endpoint at day 35 included symptomatic or fatal VTE, asymptomatic VTE on screening ultrasound or CT pulmonary angiography, symptomatic arterial thromboembolism, and cardiovascular death; it occurred in 3.14% with rivaroxaban versus 9.43% with no anticoagulation, yielding a relative risk of 0.33 with a 95% CI of 0.12–0.90 and a statistically significant P value of 0.0293, indicating a 67% relative risk reduction [^cb741f28] [^cffbb2b3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical relevance without looking at key subcomponents. Symptomatic VTE and fatal VTE were markedly reduced with rivaroxaban versus no anticoagulation, and the composite of symptomatic VTE, myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death also favored rivaroxaban, reinforcing that the benefit signal is clinically meaningful in this high-risk cohort [^cffbb2b3].

> Next, I should review safety, especially major bleeding. I need to ensure we don't overstate safety. In MICHELLE, there were zero major bleeding events in either arm, which is reassuring in this carefully selected population, though minor bleeding and allergic reactions were infrequent and balanced, supporting a favorable safety profile in patients at low bleeding risk [^cb741f28] [^cffbb2b3].

> Let me consider the risk stratification tool and its external validity, because candidate selection hinges on it. The IMPROVE VTE score, with or without D-dimer incorporation, has been externally validated in large COVID-19 cohorts and performed reasonably well at identifying high-risk patients, and MICHELLE prospectively used this approach to enrich for those most likely to benefit, which strengthens the applicability of the trial's inclusion criteria to similar patients [^1187ac0d] [^b052a18a].

> But wait, what if the baseline risk outside a trial is too low to justify prophylaxis. Observational data suggest that among unselected COVID-19 discharges, roughly 25–26% would meet MICHELLE eligibility, and in such cohorts the observed 35-day composite event rate is low, around 1.2%, which is substantially lower than the 9.4% seen in MICHELLE's control group; this implies that the absolute benefit of rivaroxaban is greatest in the enriched, high-risk population identified by IMPROVE with elevated D-dimer, and smaller in broader, lower-risk groups [^78759140] [^5072f016] [^b9f3bd08].

> I should double-check guideline positions to ensure my synthesis aligns with consensus. Initially, ASH issued a conditional recommendation against routine post-discharge prophylaxis due to very low certainty evidence, emphasizing individualized assessment; however, more recent guidance from ISTH advises considering prophylactic-dose rivaroxaban for approximately 30 days post-discharge in selected high-risk patients, reflecting the emergence of MICHELLE and related data, while CHEST continues to endorse an individualized approach rather than routine use [^7d6175ce] [^1fa9570b] [^dbe0aa03].

> Let me synthesize the right candidates and the magnitude of benefit. The right patients are those discharged after COVID-19 hospitalization with an IMPROVE VTE score of 4 or higher, or a score of 2–3 with D-dimer greater than 500 ng/mL, who have no contraindications to anticoagulation, adequate renal function, and low bleeding risk; in this group, rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for 35 days reduced a composite of major thromboembolic events and cardiovascular death by about two-thirds, with an absolute risk reduction near 6% and no major bleeding observed in the trial, translating to a number needed to treat around 16–17 in this high-risk stratum [^cb741f28] [^cffbb2b3].

> I need to ensure practical caveats are explicit. Patients with severe renal impairment, active bleeding, recent major surgery, thrombocytopenia, or other high bleeding risk features were excluded and should generally not receive extended rivaroxaban; renal dosing adjustments are required for creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min, and drug–drug interactions with strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors or inducers should be screened before prescribing [^cb741f28] [^d3b7989d].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line. Post-discharge rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for 35 days is appropriate for COVID-19 patients who meet MICHELLE's high-risk criteria and have low bleeding risk, offering substantial relative and meaningful absolute reductions in thromboembolic events and cardiovascular death without excess major bleeding in the trial; it is not indicated for routine use in all COVID-19 discharges, and decisions should be individualized using IMPROVE-based risk stratification and bleeding assessment [^cb741f28] [^cffbb2b3] [^1fa9570b].

---

The right patients for post-discharge rivaroxaban in MICHELLE are those with **high thrombotic risk** (IMPROVE VTE score ≥ 4 or 2–3 with D-dimer > 500 ng/mL) [^cb741f28] and **low bleeding risk** (no recent bleeding, severe renal impairment, or active malignancy) [^ba51a188]. Rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for 35 days reduced the composite of symptomatic/fatal VTE, arterial thromboembolism, and cardiovascular death by 67% (3% vs 9%; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.12–0.90) [^cb741f28] with **no major bleeding** in either arm, supporting a favorable benefit–risk profile in this selected group [^536f16cd].

---

## Patient selection criteria in the MICHELLE trial

The MICHELLE trial enrolled patients with **high thrombotic risk** using the IMPROVE VTE score [^cb741f28] and D-dimer, and excluded those with **high bleeding risk** [^0209cef0]:

| **Inclusion criteria** | **Exclusion criteria** |
|-|-|
| Hospitalized with COVID-19 | Severe renal failure (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) |
| IMPROVE VTE score ≥ 4 or 2–3 with D-dimer > 500 ng/mL | Active bleeding or high bleeding risk |
| Received standard in-hospital thromboprophylaxis | Contraindications to anticoagulation |
| Ready for discharge | Active malignancy or recent major surgery |

---

These criteria define a population with **elevated thrombotic risk** and **acceptable bleeding risk**, aligning with the trial's benefit–risk signal [^cb741f28].

---

## Clinical benefits observed in the MICHELLE trial

The MICHELLE trial demonstrated **significant clinical benefits** with rivaroxaban:

- **Primary efficacy outcome**: Composite of symptomatic/fatal VTE, arterial thromboembolism, and cardiovascular death at day 35 was 3% with rivaroxaban vs 9% with no anticoagulation (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.12–0.90; p = 0.029) [^cb741f28].
- **Symptomatic VTE**: 0.63% vs 5.03% (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02–0.99) [^cffbb2b3].
- **Cardiovascular death**: 0% vs 1.89% (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01–0.87) [^cffbb2b3].
- **Major bleeding**: 0% in both groups, indicating no excess bleeding with rivaroxaban [^cb741f28].

---

## Safety profile of rivaroxaban in the MICHELLE trial

Rivaroxaban showed a **favorable safety profile** in MICHELLE:

- **Major bleeding**: 0% in both arms [^cb741f28].
- **Clinically relevant non-major bleeding**: 1.3% with rivaroxaban vs 0.6% with no anticoagulation (not statistically significant) [^cffbb2b3].
- **Allergic reactions**: 1% in the rivaroxaban group, mild and self-limited [^cb741f28].

---

## Generalizability and clinical applicability

The MICHELLE results apply to patients matching the trial's risk profile; **real-world data** show that about 25% of COVID-19 discharges meet these criteria, yet only 13% receive post-discharge prophylaxis, indicating a care gap [^78759140] [^5072f016]. Guidelines advise **individualized risk–benefit assessment** using validated tools and shared decision-making [^7d6175ce] [^dbe0aa03].

---

## Comparison with other studies and guidelines

- **ACTIV-4c**: Apixaban 2.5 mg BID for 30 days did not reduce thrombotic events vs placebo, likely due to lower baseline risk and underpowering [^fd07e2a5] [^59ebfdfd].
- **PREVENT-HD**: Rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for 35 days in nonhospitalized COVID-19 did not reduce events, again reflecting low baseline risk and underpowering [^dc65165d] [^68945e71].
- **ISTH 2024**: Recommends considering prophylactic-dose rivaroxaban for ~30 days post-discharge in selected high-risk patients hospitalized for COVID-19 [^1fa9570b].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

Clinicians should consider rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for 35 days post-discharge in COVID-19 patients with **high thrombotic risk** (IMPROVE ≥ 4 or 2–3 with D-dimer > 500 ng/mL) and **low bleeding risk** (no recent bleeding, severe renal impairment, or active malignancy) [^cb741f28] [^ba51a188]. Use **shared decision-making** to discuss benefits, risks, and adherence, and monitor for bleeding and renal function during therapy [^7d6175ce].

---

The MICHELLE trial supports **extended rivaroxaban prophylaxis** for carefully selected, high-risk, low-bleeding-risk COVID-19 patients after discharge, with a 67% reduction in major thromboembolic events and no excess major bleeding, informing a targeted, evidence-based practice [^cb741f28] [^536f16cd].

### Rivaroxaban versus no anticoagulation for post-discharge thromboprophylaxis after hospitalisation for COVID-19 (MICHELLE): an open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial [^cb741f28]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 are at risk for thrombotic events after discharge; the role of extended thromboprophylaxis in this population is unknown.

Methods

In this open-label, multicentre, randomised trial conducted at 14 centres in Brazil, patients hospitalised with COVID-19 at increased risk for venous thromboembolism (International Medical Prevention Registry on Venous Thromboembolism [IMPROVE] venous thromboembolism [VTE] score of ≥4 or 2-3 with a D-dimer >500 ng/mL) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive, at hospital discharge, rivaroxaban 10 mg/day or no anticoagulation for 35 days. The primary efficacy outcome in an intention-to-treat analysis was a composite of symptomatic or fatal venous thromboembolism, asymptomatic venous thromboembolism on bilateral lower-limb venous ultrasound and CT pulmonary angiogram, symptomatic arterial thromboembolism, and cardiovascular death at day 35. Adjudication was blinded. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. The primary and safety analyses were carried out in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04662684.

Findings

From Oct 8, 2020, to June 29, 2021, 997 patients were screened. Of these patients, 677 did not meet eligibility criteria; the remaining 320 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive rivaroxaban (n=160 [50%]) or no anticoagulation (n=160 [50%]). All patients received thromboprophylaxis with standard doses of heparin during hospitalisation. 165 (52%) patients were in the intensive care unit while hospitalised. 197 (62%) patients had an IMPROVE score of 2-3 and elevated D-dimer levels and 121 (38%) had a score of 4 or more. Two patients (one in each group) were lost to follow-up due to withdrawal of consent and not included in the intention-to-treat primary analysis. The primary efficacy outcome occurred in five (3%) of 159 patients assigned to rivaroxaban and 15 (9%) of 159 patients assigned to no anticoagulation (relative risk 0·33, 95% CI 0·12-0·90; p=0·0293). No major bleeding occurred in either study group. Allergic reactions occurred in two (1%) patients in the rivaroxaban group.

Interpretation

In patients at high risk discharged after hospitalisation due to COVID-19, thromboprophylaxis with rivaroxaban 10 mg/day for 35 days improved clinical outcomes compared with no extended thromboprophylaxis.

Background A recent randomized trial, the MICHELLE trial, demonstrated improved posthospital outcomes with a 35-day course of prophylactic rivaroxaban for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at high risk of venous thromboembolism. We explored how often these findings may apply to an unselected clinical population of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods and Results Using a 35-hospital retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized between March 7, 2020, and January 23, 2021, with COVID-19 (MI-COVID19 database), we quantified the percentage of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who would be eligible for rivaroxaban at discharge per MICHELLE trial criteria and report clinical event rates. The main clinical outcome was derived from the MICHELLE trial and included a composite of symptomatic venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolus-related death, nonhemorrhagic stroke, and cardiovascular death at 35days. Multiple sensitivity analyses tested different eligibility and exclusion criteria definitions to determine the effect on eligibility for postdischarge anticoagulation prophylaxis. Of 2016 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who survived to discharge and did not have another indication for anticoagulation, 25.9% (n=523) would be eligible for postdischarge thromboprophylaxis per the MICHELLE trial criteria (range, 2.9%-39.4% on sensitivity analysis). Of the 416 who had discharge anticoagulant data collected, only 13.2% (55/416) were actually prescribed a new anticoagulant at discharge. Of patients eligible for rivaroxaban per the MICHELLE trial, the composite clinical outcome occurred in 1.2% (6/519); similar outcome rates were 5.7% and 0.63% in the MICHELLE trial's control (no anticoagulation) and intervention (rivaroxaban) groups, respectively. Symptomatic venous thromboembolism events and all-cause mortality were 6.2% (32/519) and 5.66% in the MI-COVID19 and MICHELLE trial control cohorts, respectively. Conclusions Across 35 hospitals in Michigan, ≈1 in 4 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 would qualify for posthospital thromboprophylaxis. With only 13% of patients actually receiving postdischarge prophylaxis, there is a potential opportunity for improvement in care.

### Commentary on the 2021 ASH guidelines on use of anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19 being discharged from the hospital [^7cdf4192]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

The third issue, however, is paramount because current guideline panels must be able to incorporate rapidly evolving high-quality data in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. Randomized clinical trials conducted during a pandemic should follow the high-quality standards generally used in clinical research. However, the urgent need for assessing new treatments requires leveraging more efficient and innovative research processes to address new challenges in conducting clinical research. In light of these principles, the MICHELLE trial was conducted in 14 centers in Brazil in ∼9 months. It showed that the patients at high risk for thrombotic complications (defined as having an IMPROVE VTE score of 4 or more or a score of 2 or 3 with elevated DD) and low risk of bleeding who received thromboprophylaxis with rivaroxaban 10 mg once per day for 35 days vs no anticoagulation had a 67% relative risk reduction in the primary outcome. The primary outcome was a composite of major thromboembolic events and cardiovascular death.Importantly, no major bleeding events were seen with this strategy.Therefore, these results illustrate that despite having a relatively small sample size, the antithrombotic sweet spot for post-discharge thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19 was found by using the right study design, by carefully selecting the population, and by making an appropriate choice of antithrombotic regimen. Given this contemporary and randomized evidence to guide the care of patients with COVID-19, it is surprising to see that this background work in identifying a population with high risk of thrombosis using a validated VTE RAM and primary results of the MICHELLE trial was not incorporated into the 2021 ASH guidelines for post-discharge extended anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19, especially during a pandemic in which high-quality evidence is desperately needed.

### Rivaroxaban versus no anticoagulation for post-discharge thromboprophylaxis after hospitalisation for COVID-19 (MICHELLE): an open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial [^cffbb2b3]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study MICHELLE was published by Eduardo Ramacciotti and colleagues in 2022 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the MICHELLE study, the trial question was: what is the role of rivaroxaban in patients at high risk for VTE discharged after hospitalization due to COVID-19? In the MICHELLE study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the MICHELLE study, the population was: 318 patients (127 female, 191 male). The inclusion criteria were patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at increased risk for VTE. The key exclusion criteria were IMPROVE-VTE score < 4 and D-dimer within normal range, severe renal failure, indication for anticoagulation therapy, contraindications to anticoagulation. In the MICHELLE study, the interventions were: n=159 rivaroxaban (10 mg/day for 35 days) n=159 no anticoagulation (regular follow-up for 35 days). In the MICHELLE study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in symptomatic or fatal VTE, asymptomatic VTE on bilateral lower-limb venous ultrasound and CT pulmonary angiogram, symptomatic arterial thromboembolism, and cardiovascular death at day 35 (3.14% vs. 9.43%; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.9). In the MICHELLE study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in symptomatic and fatal VTE (0.63% vs. 5.03%; RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.99) No significant difference in symptomatic VTE and all-cause mortality (2.52% vs. 5.66%; RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.41) Significant decrease in symptomatic VTE, myocardial infarction stroke, cardiovascular death (0.63% vs. 5.66%; RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.87). In the MICHELLE study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in clinically relevant non-major bleeding, other bleeding. In the MICHELLE study, the conclusion was: in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at increased risk for VTE, rivaroxaban was superior to no anticoagulation with respect to symptomatic or fatal VTE, asymptomatic VTE on bilateral lower-limb venous ultrasound and CT pulmonary angiogram, symptomatic arterial thromboembolism, and cardiovascular death at day 35.

### Medically ill hospitalized patients for COVID-19 THrombosis extended prophyLaxis with rivaroxaban thErapy: rationale and design of the MICHELLE trial [^0209cef0]. American Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The devastating Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is associated with a high prothrombotic state. It is unclear if the coagulation abnormalities occur because of the direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 or indirectly by the cytokine storm and endothelial damage or by a combination of mechanisms. There is a clear indication of in-hospital pharmacological thromboprophylaxis for every patient with COVID-19 after bleed risk assessment. However, there is much debate regarding the best dosage regimen, and there is no consensus on the role of extended thromboprophylaxis.

Design

This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily for 35 ± 4 days versus no intervention after hospital discharge in COVID-19 patients who were at increased risk for VTE and have received standard parenteral VTE prophylaxis during hospitalization. The composite efficacy endpoint is a combination of symptomatic VTE, VTE-related death, VTE detected by bilateral lower limbs venous duplex scan and computed tomography pulmonary angiogram on day 35 ± 4 posthospital discharge and symptomatic arterial thromboembolism (myocardial infarction, nonhemorrhagic stroke, major adverse limb events, and cardiovascular death) up to day 35 ± 4 posthospital discharge. The key safety outcome is the incidence of major bleeding according to ISTH criteria.

Summary

The MICHELLE trial is expected to provide high-quality evidence around the role of extended thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19 and will help guide medical decisions in clinical practice. 1 .

### Eligibility for posthospitalization venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study [^1b68ff7d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study should be considered in the context of limitations. First, we did not collect all the outcomes collected in the MICHELLE trial, and the primary purpose of MI‐COVID19 was not to obtain outcome data. In addition, some outcomes included patient‐reported outcomes, which requires patients for ascertainment and may affect the validity and reliability of outcomes. For these reasons, outcome ascertainment was limited. Most MICHELLE trial outcomes were rare, with the exception of asymptomatic VTE, which is not routinely assessed in clinical practice. Similarly, our eligibility and exclusion definitions were not identical to those used in the MICHELLE trial, and our methods for operationalizing definitions (eg, ascertaining IMPROVE scores) could skew our reporting of patients eligible for rivaroxaban. Third, our study represents 2020 care in the state of Michigan, much of it during hospital surge/crisis times. This likely skews our mortality data higher than it would be in 2021 (or beyond) when more COVID‐19 therapeutics were available. It also represents a population of patients who were infected with the original COVID‐19 virus, not the highly infectious Delta variant that was predominant in the United States in 2021. Finally, our study is retrospective and limited by the usual restrictions created by relying on medical record documentation and physician‐ and patient‐reported outcome capture. Study strengths include the collection of data on a diverse, real‐life study population, the ability to evaluate eligibility criteria across a host of sensitivity analyses, and a large study population. All of our outcomes include patient‐reported data, and we collected outcomes through 60 days, allowing us to be more confident in our analyses.

In conclusion, we found that, by MICHELLE trial criteria, ≈1 in 4 patients hospitalized with COVID‐19 would be eligible for rivaroxaban at discharge. That number likely varies based on how eligibility and exclusion criteria are operationalized. Regardless, with only 13% of patients actually receiving postdischarge prophylaxis, there is a potential opportunity for improvement in care.

### American Society of Hematology living guidelines on use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis for patients with COVID-19: executive summary [^ba51a188]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

In terms of potential harms, postdischarge anticoagulation may have little to no effect on major bleeding in patients with COVID-19 (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 0.18-22.04; corresponding to 3 more [from 2 fewer to 59 more] major bleeds per 1000 patients) and probably has little to effect on major bleeding in other patients being discharged (indirect evidence: OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.33-3.27; corresponding to 4 more [from 2 fewer to 125 more] per 1000 patients).

Conclusions for this recommendation

The panel judged the benefits of postdischarge outpatient thromboprophylaxis to be trivial in terms of absolute effects on all critical outcomes. This judgment was based primarily on the low baseline risk estimates for thrombotic events after hospital discharge. Meanwhile, the risk of major bleeding was also judged to be of trivial magnitude, based on low baseline risk estimates along with indirect evidence from patient without COVID-19.Of note, patients with high bleed risk characteristics were excluded from the Medically Ill Hospitalized Patients for COVID–Thrombosis Extended Prophylaxis with Rivaroxaban Therapy (MICHELLE) trial (eg, recent bleeding, recent major surgery, known coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis, prior ICH, recent gastroduodenal ulcer, and thrombocytopenia active cancer) and the ACTIV-4c trial (eg, recent intracranial bleed, stroke or neurosurgery, recent major surgery, inherited or acquired bleeding disorder, and thrombocytopenia).

On balance, the panel judged that the undesirable potential major bleeding complications outweighed the potential benefits, particularly considering the low baseline risk of postdischarge VTE. The panel emphasized the importance of an individualized decision for each patient based on an assessment of thrombosis and bleeding risk. This thrombosis risk assessment may include the use of externally validated RAMs such as the IMPROVE-DD risk score, which was used in the MICHELLE trial to identify patients at potentially higher thrombotic risk for study inclusion. No RAMs for bleeding have been validated in patients with COVID-19.

### Eligibility for posthospitalization venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study [^8bd0d36d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Primary Outcome

Our primary outcome of interest was the proportion of patients hospitalized with COVID‐19 (who survived to discharge, were not previously on anticoagulants, and were not diagnosed with VTE during hospitalization) who would be eligible to receive postdischarge VTE prophylaxis with rivaroxaban, according to the MICHELLE trial eligibility/exclusion criteria.

Patients were considered eligible for rivaroxaban if they had an elevated risk for VTE defined using an adaptation of the IMPROVE (International Medical Prevention Registry on Venous Thromboembolism) score, also used in the Medically Ill Patient Assessment of Rivaroxaban versus Placebo in Reducing Post‐Discharge Venous Thrombo‐Embolism Risk trial.Specifically, patients were considered to have an elevated risk for VTE if they had an IMPROVE score ≥4 or an IMPROVE score of 2 to 3 and a D‐dimer ≥1 time the upper limit of normal (ULN) at that hospital. Because of different D‐dimer tests at each hospital, we used 1×ULN as a surrogate for the trial criteria of >500 ng/mL. Other D‐dimer thresholds were studied in the sensitivity analyses, described below. Table 1 shows how each element of the IMPROVE score was operationalized in the MI‐COVID19 cohort. For patients missing a D‐dimer score, D‐dimers were imputed (see description below). Because they may have had a contraindication to anticoagulation that we were unable to assess, we excluded patients who received no anticoagulants during hospitalization. Additional MICHELLE trial exclusions and how they were operationalized are shown in Table 2.

Additional Trial Exclusions and Operationalization

Secondary Outcomes

Our secondary outcomes attempted to mirror MICHELLE trial outcomes (Table S2). The main secondary outcome was a composite of symptomatic VTE, pulmonary embolism–related death, nonhemorrhagic stroke, and cardiovascular death at 35 days. Unlike the MICHELLE trial, we did not have 35‐day outcome data on symptomatic arterial thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, major adverse limb events, or asymptomatic VTE detected via Doppler venous ultrasound scan or computed tomography angiogram in the MI‐COVID19 registry. For the composite clinical outcome, we truncate outcomes at 35 days to be consistent with MICHELLE trial. Secondarily, we also report 60‐day outcomes. Additional secondary outcomes, consistent with the MICHELLE trial, include the combined outcome of symptomatic VTE and all‐cause mortality at 35 days.

### Eligibility for posthospitalization venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study [^b9f3bd08]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

A recent randomized trial, the MICHELLE trial, demonstrated improved posthospital outcomes with a 35‐day course of prophylactic rivaroxaban for patients hospitalized with COVID‐19 at high risk of venous thromboembolism. We explored how often these findings may apply to an unselected clinical population of patients hospitalized with COVID‐19.

Methods and Results

Using a 35‐hospital retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized between March 7, 2020, and January 23, 2021, with COVID‐19 (MI‐COVID19 database), we quantified the percentage of hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 who would be eligible for rivaroxaban at discharge per MICHELLE trial criteria and report clinical event rates. The main clinical outcome was derived from the MICHELLE trial and included a composite of symptomatic venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolus‐related death, nonhemorrhagic stroke, and cardiovascular death at 35 days. Multiple sensitivity analyses tested different eligibility and exclusion criteria definitions to determine the effect on eligibility for postdischarge anticoagulation prophylaxis. Of 2016 patients hospitalized with COVID‐19 who survived to discharge and did not have another indication for anticoagulation, 25.9% (n=523) would be eligible for postdischarge thromboprophylaxis per the MICHELLE trial criteria (range, 2.9%–39.4% on sensitivity analysis). Of the 416 who had discharge anticoagulant data collected, only 13.2% (55/416) were actually prescribed a new anticoagulant at discharge. Of patients eligible for rivaroxaban per the MICHELLE trial, the composite clinical outcome occurred in 1.2% (6/519); similar outcome rates were 5.7% and 0.63% in the MICHELLE trial's control (no anticoagulation) and intervention (rivaroxaban) groups, respectively. Symptomatic venous thromboembolism events and all‐cause mortality were 6.2% (32/519) and 5.66% in the MI‐COVID19 and MICHELLE trial control cohorts, respectively.

Conclusions

Across 35 hospitals in Michigan, ≈1 in 4 patients hospitalized with COVID‐19 would qualify for posthospital thromboprophylaxis. With only 13% of patients actually receiving postdischarge prophylaxis, there is a potential opportunity for improvement in care.

### Benefit-risk of rivaroxaban for extended thromboprophylaxis after hospitalization for medical illness: pooled analysis from MAGELLAN and MARINER [^2b056413]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The current COVID‐19 pandemic has resulted in a surge of hospitalizations of medically ill patients worldwide. The disease appears to be associated with a coagulopathy that increases the likelihood of both arterial and venous thrombotic events.A significant portion of hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 with viral pneumonia have elevated D‐dimer at baseline, which has been associated with more severe disease and poor outcomes including mortality.Extended thromboprophylaxis with rivaroxaban has been shown to be superior to standard dose in‐hospital enoxaparin in the subgroup of patients with infectious disease as the cause for hospitalization with the most common infection being pneumonia,and with those with elevated D‐dimer.Taken together with the results of this pooled analysis, these data would suggest that extended thromboprophylaxis with a direct oral Factor Xa inhibitor postdischarge might be of particular use in limiting thrombotic complications associated with COVID‐19. Although the anticoagulation coronavirus (ACTION) trialin a hospitalized COVID‐19 population using elevated D‐dimer criteria did not detect a clinical benefit of in‐hospital plus extended treatment dose thromboprophylaxis with rivaroxaban given for 30 days (20 mg daily) compared with standard of care in‐hospital thromboprophylaxis, the Medically Ill Hospitalized Patients for COVID‐19 Thrombosis Extended Prophylaxis with Rivaroxaban Therapy (MICHELLE) trial(ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04662684), using the same postdischarge randomization design and enrichment criteria as the MARINER trial, did reveal a significant 67% relative risk reduction (9.43%–3.14%, relative risk, 0.33 [95% CI 0.12–0.90], P =0.029) of major and fatal venous and arterial thromboembolic events favoring rivaroxaban 10 mg daily over no anticoagulation at Day 35 post–hospital discharge.The COVID‐19 Post‐hospital Thrombosis Prevention Trial: An Adaptive, Multicenter, Prospective, Randomized Platform Trial Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Antithrombotic Strategies in Patients With COVID‐19 Following Hospital Discharge (ACTIV‐4C) trial is evaluating the benefit–risk of thromboprophylaxis using apixaban 2.5 mg given for 30 days after hospital discharge in 5320 patients with COVID‐19 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04650087).

### Benefit-risk assessment of rivaroxaban for extended thromboprophylaxis after hospitalization for medical illness [^536f16cd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The benefit–risk evaluation was conducted using an established, structured approach used in several cardiovascular benefit–risk assessments.Because stakeholders differ in their perceptions of the clinical importance of benefit and risk outcomes, multiple benefit–risk pairs were evaluated including those that are considered fatal and irreversible (Table 2), as commonly used during regulatory review.In all pairs, the events prevented exceed the events caused, and the NNH is greater than the NNT, representing a favorable benefit–risk profile for the rivaroxaban prophylaxis. The small increased risk of major bleeding was driven by bleeding events that were neither fatal nor involved a critical anatomical site.

The coronavirus pandemic has complicated thromboprophylaxis strategies in acutely ill medical patients who are hospitalized with COVID‐19. Recent evidence suggested that an important predictor of poor outcomes including major thromboembolism and mortality in patients with COVID‐19 is the development of a severe coagulopathy manifested among other markers by a marked elevation of D‐dimer.The recent MICHELLE (Medically Ill Hospitalized Patients for COVID‐19 Thrombosis Extended Prophylaxis With Rivaroxaban Therapy) trial evaluated rivaroxaban at the 10 mg dose versus no anticoagulation for postdischarge thromboprophylaxis after hospitalization for COVID‐19. The trial selected a high‐risk population using the MARINER inclusion criteria. The composite of major thromboembolism and cardiovascular death occurred in 5 (3%) of 159 patients assigned to rivaroxaban 10 mg daily and 15 (9%) of 159 patients not anticoagulated (relative risk, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.12–0.90]; P =0.0293), with no major bleeding in either treatment group.

### Eligibility for posthospitalization venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study [^5072f016]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this cohort of >2200 patients hospitalized with COVID‐19 in 35 Michigan hospitals, we found 25.9% of patients met the MICHELLE trial's eligibility criteria for receiving posthospital thromboprophylaxis. In our study, 1.2% of patients eligible for posthospital rivaroxaban thromboprophylaxis, per the MICHELLE trial, experienced the composite clinical outcome at 35 days, with 7.9% experiencing symptomatic VTE or all‐cause mortality.

When deciding whether to prescribe rivaroxaban thromboprophylaxis at discharge for patients hospitalized with COVID‐19, clinicians should consider the MICHELLE trial eligibility criteria, which focused on patients at potentially high risk for VTE after discharge. In our analysis, we found ≈1 in 4 patients discharged with COVID‐19 would qualify for rivaroxaban thromboprophylaxis at discharge based on the MICHELLE trial eligibility and exclusion criteria. The largest exclusions were short hospital stays, lack of receipt of prophylactic anticoagulation during hospitalization (much of which may have been inappropriate),and low IMPROVE scores. When broader eligibility/exclusion criteria were used and patients with active cancer, shock, and inpatient use of treatment‐dose anticoagulation were considered eligible, up to 39.4% of patients would be eligible for rivaroxaban. Thus, the MICHELLE trial results may apply to many patients hospitalized with COVID‐19. That only 13.2% of patients eligible per MICHELLE trial criteria received prophylactic anticoagulation implies an opportunity for improvement. Given the many exclusions in the MICHELLE trial meant to reduce unnecessary bleeding risk, clinicians must thoughtfully estimate and weight both thrombotic and bleeding risk in the posthospital period when determining if rivaroxaban thromboprophylaxis is appropriate for an individual patient.

### Eligibility for posthospitalization venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study [^3f021b1f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Between March 7, 2020, and January 23, 2021, a total of 2294 patients in the MI‐COVID19 database hospitalized with COVID‐19 at 35 hospitals in Michigan survived until discharge. Of those patients, 242 were on anticoagulants before hospitalization and 36 were diagnosed with a VTE during hospitalization, leaving 2016 patients who could potentially be eligible for new anticoagulant use at discharge.

After exclusions consistent with the MICHELLE trial (Figure 1 provides a detailed flow diagram), 523 patients (25.9% of 2016 patients) were eligible for rivaroxaban. Of the 416 who had discharge anticoagulant data collected, only 13.2% (55/416) were actually prescribed a new anticoagulant at discharge. Compared with patients in the MICHELLE trial, patients potentially eligible for rivaroxaban in MI‐COVID19 were older (median age, 69 versus 56–58 years), less likely to have spent time in an intensive care unit (30% versus 50%–54%), and had a shorter median length of stay (7 versus 8 days); detailed patient characteristics can be found in Table 3. On sensitivity analyses, the proportion of patients eligible for rivaroxaban at discharge varied from 2.9% to 39.4%, depending on how exclusion and eligibility criteria were operationalized (Figure 2 and Table S3).

### Eligibility for posthospitalization venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study [^6619b314]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Hospitalization and COVID‐19 infection are both key risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, there are conflicting observational data on the burden of posthospital VTE among patients hospitalized for COVID‐19, with incidence ranging from 0.6% to 4.8% after discharge, depending on the population studied and follow‐up time.,,Multiple randomized clinical trials,,,have explored the role of extended thromboprophylaxis with low‐dose, direct‐acting oral anticoagulants (including rivaroxaban) in patients without COVID‐19, with some showing a net benefit.

A recent randomized trial, the MICHELLE trial, showed an improvement in their composite 35‐day outcome (ie, symptomatic or fatal VTE, asymptomatic VTE, symptomatic arterial thromboembolism [myocardial infarction, nonhemorrhagic stroke, and major adverse limb event], and cardiovascular death) and in a composite outcome of symptomatic VTE, myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death in patients hospitalized with COVID‐19 who were at high risk of VTE and discharged on prophylactic dosing of rivaroxaban (10 mg/d).However, individual components of the MICHELLE trial's primary outcome (eg, symptomatic VTE) were no different. In addition, posthospital VTE rates from observational data sets have been highly variable (0.2%–14.8%),,,and the practice of posthospital thromboprophylaxis had not been broadly adopted before the COVID‐19 pandemic.As with all clinical trials, it remains unclear how generalizable the clinical trial population and results are to an unselected population of patients.

To help interpret how the MICHELLE trial results might apply to a broad clinical population, we used a 35‐hospital retrospective database to identify how many patients with COVID‐19 should potentially be prescribed rivaroxaban at discharge.

### Eligibility for posthospitalization venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study [^3583aa2f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

In regards to clinical event rates, we found our composite clinical outcomes to be numerically lower than those found in the MICHELLE trial control groups, yet similar to meta‐analytic estimates among patients with COVID‐19 and seminal observational studies before COVID‐19.Notably, we did not routinely perform diagnostic imaging on patients who were asymptomatic and therefore did not collect data on asymptomatic VTE, a large driver of high event numbers for the MICHELLE trial. The fact that we found only 3 additional VTEs (0.6%) at 60 (versus 35) days suggests that asymptomatic VTEs detected at routine screening may not progress to symptomatic VTE in the posthospitalized medically ill population. Notably, we found that the MICHELLE trial's main secondary outcome of symptomatic VTE and all‐cause mortality appeared similar in our cohort to that seen in the trial's control group and higher than what was seen in the MICHELLE trial's rivaroxaban group. Ongoing trials (eg, Accelerating COVID‐19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccine‐4c and Helping Alleviate the Longer‐Term Consequences of COVID‐19) are underway to better understand the potential benefits of postdischarge VTE prophylaxis of apixaban in patients hospitalized with COVID‐19. Future work should seek to evaluate the cost‐effectiveness and number needed to treat with postdischarge rivaroxaban to improve outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID‐19.

### Impact of thromboprophylaxis on hospital acquired thrombosis following discharge in patients admitted with COVID-19: multicentre observational study in the UK [^1bdd5f82]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Medium credibility.

The MICHELLE trial was an open labelled multicentre randomized trial of post‐discharge extended thromboprophylaxis in COVID‐19 inpatients where 320 patients were randomized to receive rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for 35 days versus no anticoagulation (160 patients in each arm).All patients received standard doses of heparin thromboprophylaxis during hospitalization. This study included a high thrombotic risk population (IMPROVE VTE score of ≥4 or a score of 2–3 with D dimer >500 ng/mL). Only 159 patients in each arm of the study were included in the intention‐to‐treat primary analysis due to loss of follow‐up. Symptomatic or fatal VTE and/or arterial thrombosis occurred in 3% of rivaroxaban arm versus 9% of no anticoagulation (relative risk 0.33, 95% CI 0.12–0.90; p = 0.029). No major bleeding occurred in either study group.In contrast to the present study, in the MICHELLE trial there was a significant reduction in symptomatic VTE in patients who received rivaroxaban at discharge with no fatal VTE(1/159 [0.63%] vs. 8/159 [5·03%] with 3/8 fatal events). Compared to the MICHELLE trial where rivaroxaban 10 mg was given for 35 days in the thromboprophylaxis group,rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran or LMWH were all used as thromboprophylaxis in the present study, and duration varied from 7 days to 56 days with a median 28 days. The MICHELLE trial concluded that inpatients with cardiovascular risk factors, advanced age, intensive care unit stay, or an IMPROVE VTE score of 4 or more or a score of 2 or 3 plus elevated D‐dimers (>2X ULN) or an IMPROVE‐DD VTE score of ≥4 are at high thrombotic risk in the post‐discharge period and may benefit from post discharge thromboprophylaxis.However, except increasing age and smoking status, we failed to identify other significant factors that are associated with increased risk of post discharge VTE. Interestingly, we did not find a link between raised D dimer and risk of post discharge VTE. At discharge 83.5% (811/971) and 87.3% (848/971) patients had raised D‐dimer in the thromboprophylaxis and no thromboprophylaxis group respectively with no difference between the two. The elevated D‐ dimers suggest ongoing inflammatory response post‐discharge in COVID‐19 patients. This is further supported by the raised C reactive protein levels in 75.2% (730/971) versus 77.1% (749/971) in the two groups. Neither study found significant difference in the major bleeding rates in patients receiving thromboprophylaxis versus no thromboprophylaxis.

The percentage of patients discharged alive from a COVID‐19 hospitalization (who were not on anticoagulants before hospitalization or developed a venous thromboembolism during hospitalization) who would be eligible for rivaroxaban at discharge is shown. Each bar represents a different sensitivity analysis. The bar marked with an arrow most closely resembles the Medically Ill Hospitalized Patients for COVID‐19 THrombosis Extended ProphyLaxis With Rivaroxaban ThErapy (MICHELLE) trial. The colors reflect the D‐dimer cutoff for eligibility for rivaroxaban at discharge for patients with an IMPROVE (International Medical Prevention Registry on Venous Thromboembolism) score of 2 to 3. The most broadly inclusive category does NOT exclude shock, active malignancy, or patients who received therapeutic anticoagulation during hospitalization (which are exclusions for the MICHELLE trial). ICU indicates intensive care unit; and ULN, upper limit of normal.

Of 523 patients eligible for rivaroxaban per the MICHELLE trial, 4 were missing outcome data. In the remaining 519 patients, the composite 35‐day outcome occurred in 1.2% (6/519; Table 4). The secondary outcome of symptomatic VTE plus all cause‐mortality at 35 days occurred in 6.2% (32/519). Within 60 days, the composite clinical outcome occurred in 2.9% (15/519) of patients eligible for rivaroxaban, whereas the secondary outcome of symptomatic VTE plus all‐cause mortality occurred in 7.9% (41/519). Symptomatic VTE at 60 days occurred in 1.6% (8/519).

### Prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of VTE in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^d1a4d390]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

CHEST guideline—postdischarge anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19: Our search identified no study reporting incidence of VTE or major bleeding after hospital discharge in patients with COVID-19. Anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis up to 45 days after discharge reduces the risk of VTE following hospital admission (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.44-0.83) but increases the risk of major bleeding (RR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.42-2.91). However, in the MARINER trial of 12,069 patients at risk of VTE as per modified IMPROVE score, rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for 45 days after hospital discharge did not reduce symptomatic VTE. Assuming that patients with COVID-19 incur the same risk of bleeding as patients without COVID-19 at high risk of VTE (ie, 0.7% at 35 days after discharge without extended thromboprophylaxis in patients at low risk of bleeding), the panel suggests that extended thromboprophylaxis would result in a net benefit in patients with COVID-19 at low bleeding risk, if the risk of symptomatic VTE would be above 1.8% at 35 to 42 days after hospital discharge.

### Risk of posthospital venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 varies by SARS-CoV-2 period and vaccination status [^b052a18a]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical risk factors associated with post hospital VTE in patients with COVID-19 include advanced age, previous VTE, intensive care unit stay, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease.Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 variant and vaccination status may be independent risk factors for post hospital VTE in patients with COVID-19. Although there are no prospectively validated risk assessment models in patients with COVID-19, the IMPROVE VTE score has been externally validated in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The MICHELLE trial used the IMPROVE VTE score and D-dimer levels to identify high-risk patients with COVID-19 following hospitalization and randomized them to prophylactic oral anticoagulation or placebo for 35 days.The reduction in major and fatal thromboembolic events in patients on anticoagulation was driven by a reduction in asymptomatic, symptomatic, and fatal pulmonary emboli. However, the trial was conducted during the period before the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant predominance and widespread COVID-19 vaccination.

There are limitations to our findings. Residual confounding may persist despite multivariable modeling given the retrospective nature of our analysis. In addition, we excluded patients with a history of VTE, potentially impacting post hospital VTE incidence. D-dimer testing was not routinely performed in patients admitted to the hospital; therefore, we may have not identified all subjects at high risk of post hospital VTE using a more dynamic risk assessment. The strengths of our study included evaluation of only symptomatic events and a large diverse cohort with a relatively high vaccination rate, allowing cross group comparisons of an infrequent event.

Our data support continued re evaluation of the risks and benefits of antithrombotic treatments with ongoing surges of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants. We await the publication of ongoing randomized clinical trials (XACT [NCT04640181], ACTIV-4c [NCT04650087], HEAL-COVID [NCT04801940] and others) to assess the benefit of extending thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19 post-hospital discharge. Prospective clinical trials are needed to validate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 variant and vaccination status on the incidence of posthospital VTE, and whether this is reduced by extended thromboprophylaxis.

Lancet 2022;399:50–59.

Critically Ill Patients

The most important intervention in critically ill patients is high-quality, multidisciplinary supportive care. Specific to COVID-19, the mainstays of therapy remain glucocorticoids and probably secondary immune modulation. A multiplatform trial of full-dose anticoagulation suggested probable harm among patients receiving life support at the time of randomization.

On the totality of the evidence, it seems appropriate to stop full-dose anticoagulation and replace it with thromboprophylaxis for patients transferred to the ICU with organ failure.

### Anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients-an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^19b6f08a]. Thrombosis Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Thromboembolic events are common complications of COVID-19. Clinical study results on safety and efficacy of anticoagulation in COVID-19 are controversial.

Material and Methods

This report updates our systematic review and random-effects meta-analysis on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing standard prophylactic anticoagulation and intermediate or therapeutic anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients. We searched eligible studies for the update up to 4 February 2022 by weekly monitoring of RCTs in the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register. Certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

Results

For this update we included five new trials; a total of 13 RCTs with 7364 patients. Certainty of evidence was very low to low. We are uncertain whether low-dose prophylactic anticoagulation is favoured over placebo or no anticoagulation in the outpatient- or post-discharge-setting. In hospitalized patients with moderate and severe COVID-19, intermediate-dose anticoagulation may have little or no effect on thrombotic events or death (RR 1.03, 95 % CI 0.86-1.24), but may increase severe bleeding non-significantly (RR 1.48, 95 % CI 0.53-4.15). Therapeutic-dose anticoagulation may decrease thrombotic events or deaths in hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19 (RR 0.64, 95 % CI 0.38-1.07; fixed-effect model RR 0.72, 95 % CI 0.57-0.91), but may have little or no effect in patients with severe disease (RR 0.98, 95 % CI 0.86-1.12). With therapeutic-dose anticoagulation, the risk of major bleeding may increase regardless of COVID-19 severity (RR 1.78, 95 % CI 1.15-2.74).

Conclusions

Hospitalized, moderately ill COVID-19 patients may benefit from therapeutic-dose anticoagulation, while critically ill patients may not. Risk of major bleeding must be considered.

### Randomized study of rivaroxaban vs placebo on disease progression and symptoms resolution in high-risk adults with mild coronavirus disease 2019 [^aae686d8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In adults with mild COVID-19 at high risk for severe disease, administration of rivaroxaban for 21 days did not reduce progression to moderate or severe disease compared with placebo. We did observe a higher proportion of asymptomatic participants at day 28 after rivaroxaban treatment. The incidence of hospitalization was low in both groups, but more cases of COVID-19 pneumonia and vascular events were observed in placebo compared with rivaroxaban recipients. Rivaroxaban was well tolerated with few AEs and minor bleeding events related to the drug.

We enrolled high-risk adults who presented with mild disease during the first week of their illness to intervene, as the disease is thought to transition from the active viral replication phase to the inflammatory phase, and before disease progressed. Rivaroxaban does not possess direct antiviral or antiinflammatory properties but it may mitigate the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 replication and inflammation. We posited that rivaroxaban could prevent COVID-19–associated VTE and microthrombi in the lungs and other organs that have been theorized to cause COVID-19 symptoms and progression. This could potentially explain the observation that more participants achieved asymptomatic status. It appears that the observed differences between groups occurred after day 14 of the study and in participants who had longer time from onset of symptoms to randomization. We postulate that the persistence of symptoms after the second week of illness may be the result of microthrombi against which rivaroxaban is exerting a positive effect. It is possible that administration of rivaroxaban during mild disease and within the first 2 weeks of illness was too early, as a major shift to a proinflammatory and coagulopathy state occurs when disease transitions from mild to moderate. We did not collect blood for biomarkers such as D-dimer in this community-based study. However, such examination should be considered in future studies to aid in potentially identifying a population that would most benefit from prophylactic anticoagulant. The daily dose of 10 mg rivaroxaban for 21 days may have been insufficient. The selection was based on the indication for VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill patients (10 mg daily for 31–39 days after hospital discharge) and a safety profile suitable for remote monitoring in our study. Fatigue, cough, anosmia, and ageusia appeared less frequently in the rivaroxaban group at day 28. Whether rivaroxaban could benefit long-term COVID-19 symptoms is unknown and should be further investigated.

### Commentary on the 2021 ASH guidelines on use of anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19 being discharged from the hospital [^1187ac0d]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

The second issue (delineated in the seminal work by McGinn et al) concerns the use of clinical decision rules and notes that external validation of these rules need not be prospective, but it should include multiple settings that incorporate a broad spectrum of patients; indeed, this can most likely be achieved by using retrospective study designs. The IMPROVE-DD VTE RAM has undergone 2 large external validation studies with nearly 19 000 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 by using the original model cutoff: a score of 4 or more predicted a high risk of VTE among the group of inpatients who had COVID-19. It has also shown reasonable discrimination, with an area under the curve of ∼0.70.In another external validation study, the RAM was a strong and independent predictor of thrombosis and mortality in those patients classified as high risk of VTE.In the largest prospective post-discharge registry encompassing nearly 5000 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the IMPROVE-DD VTE model using a cutoff score of 4 was an independent predictor of post-discharge thromboembolic outcomes and mortality (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-2.14).Most importantly, the IMPROVE VTE RAM using a cutoff score of 4 or more or a score of 2 or 3 with elevated DD was used prospectively in the seminal extended post-discharge clinical randomized trial of inpatients with COVID-19—the MICHELLE trial—to select an inpatient group with COVID-19 who were at high risk for thromboembolism and cardiovascular mortality.It is clear from these data that the IMPROVE VTE RAM or its derivative incorporating elevated DD is not only the most extensively validated thrombotic tool in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, but it can also be used prospectively to identify a group of inpatients with COVID-19 at high risk of thrombosis who benefited from extended post-hospital discharge thromboprophylaxis (Table 2).

Results

For this update we included fourteen new RCTs and a total of 27 RCTs with 16,789 patients. Certainty of evidence ranged from very low to high depending on outcome and comparison. Standard thromboprophylaxis with low dose anticoagulation may have little or no effect for COVID-19 outpatients compared to no anticoagulation. In inpatients with moderate or severe COVID-19, intermediate dose anticoagulation may decrease any thrombotic events or death, but may increase major bleeding compared to standard thromboprophylaxis. Therapeutic dose anticoagulation decreases thrombotic events or deaths in inpatients with moderate COVID-19, but probably has little or no effect in patients with severe COVID-19 compared to standard thromboprophylaxis with low or intermediate dose anticoagulation. With therapeutic dose anticoagulation, the risk of major bleeding probably increases regardless of COVID-19 severity. We are uncertain on the effect of thromboprophylaxis with low dose anticoagulation compared to no anticoagulation in the post-discharge setting.

Conclusions

Hospitalized, moderately-ill COVID-19 patients may benefit from intermediate or therapeutic dose anticoagulation, while critically ill patients may not. Risk of major bleeding must be considered.

Regarding medical management for COVID-19 infection, more specifically with respect to thromboprophylaxis, hospitalized patients, choice of agent, ISTH 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating prophylactic-dose rivaroxaban for approximately 30 days post-discharge to reduce the risk of major thromboembolism in selected high-risk patients hospitalized for COVID-19.

### Rivaroxaban for prevention of thrombotic events, hospitalization, and death in outpatients with COVID-19: a randomized clinical trial [^68945e71]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

We observed a discordance in the point estimate favoring the placebo in the intention-to-treat analysis and rivaroxaban in the safety analysis. This difference was driven largely by an excess of hospitalizations in the rivaroxaban group compared with placebo (21 versus 17) in the intention-to-treat analysis, whereas hospitalization was less frequent in the 2 groups in the safety analysis population (11 versus 15, respectively). We postulate that this observation was likely play of chance in the context of a lower-than-expected event rate and a disproportionate number of patients assigned to rivaroxaban not receiving or taking study medication before experiencing clinical deterioration requiring hospitalization compared with patients assigned to placebo (10 versus 2). This imbalance highlights the challenges and limitations of conducting a randomized controlled trial remotely during the pandemic with an associated impact on medication supply chains and delivery services.

Similar to other trials, – PREVENT-HD observed a low frequency of symptomatic VTE, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, and non-CNS systemic arterial embolism. Although events were marginally less frequent in the rivaroxaban group, the nominal number of events and the post hoc exploratory nature of this descriptive analysis preclude interpretation of a treatment benefit of rivaroxaban, and the number of events is insufficient to recommend thromboprophylaxis to nonhospitalized patients with symptomatic COVID-19.Furthermore, in the context of such a low rate of thrombosis, a difference in the frequency of such events with rivaroxaban is unlikely to be clinically meaningful. Of note, all symptomatic VTE and arterial events occurred from the start of the trial in August 2020 to the summer of 2021, an interval dominated by the original strain and the alpha variant. Further investigation in select high-risk outpatients with COVID-19 may be warranted on the basis of rivaroxaban being well tolerated in this trial and othersand the prevention of clinical thrombosis being recognized as a patient safety priority.

### Rivaroxaban to prevent major clinical outcomes in non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19: the CARE-COALITION VIII randomised clinical trial [^582502b6]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 progression is associated with an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis. Randomised trials have demonstrated that anticoagulants reduce the risk of thromboembolism in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, but a benefit of routine anticoagulation has not been demonstrated in the outpatient setting.

Methods

We conducted a randomised, open-label, controlled, multicentre study, evaluating the use of rivaroxaban in mild or moderate COVID-19 patients. Adults ≥18 years old, with probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, presenting within ≤7 days from symptom onset with no clear indication for hospitalization, plus at least 2 risk factors for complication, were randomised 1:1 either to rivaroxaban 10 mg OD for 14 days or to routine care. The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of venous thromboembolic events, need of mechanical ventilation, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, acute limb ischemia, or death due to COVID-19 during the first 30 days. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04757857.

Findings

Enrollment was prematurely stopped due to sustained reduction in new COVID-19 cases. From September 29th, 2020, through May 23rd, 2022, 660 patients were randomised (median age 61 [Q1-Q3 47-69], 55.7% women). There was no significant difference between rivaroxaban and control in the primary efficacy endpoint (4.3% [14/327] vs 5.8% [19/330], RR 0.74; 95% CI: 0.38-1.46). There was no major bleeding in the control group and 1 in the rivaroxaban group.

Interpretation

On light of these findings no decision can be made about the utility of rivaroxaban to improve outcomes in outpatients with COVID-19. Metanalyses data provide no evidence of a benefit of anticoagulant prophylaxis in outpatients with COVID-19. These findings were the result of an underpowered study, therefore should be interpreted with caution.

### Rivaroxaban to prevent major clinical outcomes in non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19: the CARE-COALITION VIII randomised clinical trial [^6c35b43c]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this open-label, multicenter, randomised trial, rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily for 14 days did not significantly reduce the risk of VTE, requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation, MACE (acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or acute limb ischemia), or out-of-hospital death, as compared with routine care in symptomatic non-hospitalised patients. The efficacy evidence of antithrombotic therapy in different COVID-19 scenarios has been conflicting, which might be due to different anticoagulants, dosing regimens, administration routes, severity of the disease, and time of initiation and duration of treatment.

Rivaroxaban has not been adequately evaluated in outpatients with COVID-19. One study has been completed but the results have not yet been released and others are currently recruiting or have been terminated due to difficulties in patient recruitment. Two trials were prematurely stopped due to low event rates,, and did not shown a benefit of either rivaroxabanor apixaban.Adherence rate in CARE is lower than in some other COVID-19 trials, particularly those conducted in the hospital setting. Several outpatient trials have reported similarly low adherence (e.g. Ananworanich et al. 2021reported 72.4% adherence to rivaroxaban).

Table 2. 
External validation or prognostic use of the IMPROVE-DD VTE score to identify hospitalized patients who have COVID-19 and a high risk of thrombosis in the post-discharge period

With regard to the second issue, we have clear evidence at this point that COVID-19 in hospitalized patients produces a severe COVID-19–specific coagulopathy manifested by dysregulated thrombin generation much more than a bleeding diathesis.A review of the evidence tables for the article reveals an overall low certainty in the evidence, which is consistent with data that come mostly from observational studies.However, the evidence tables reveal (in absolute terms) the benefits of 5 fewer deaths and 4 fewer VTE events per 1000 inpatients with COVID-19 who have a post-discharge antithrombotic strategy vs 1 more major bleed per 1000 patients.The panel judged that both benefits and harms of post-discharge thromboprophylaxis were trivial, based on a defined estimated incidence of fewer than 5 events per 1000 patients. However, the clinical severity of efficacy and safety pairings should be taken into account when evaluating an overall antithrombotic strategy during the development of guidelines. Indeed, in previous antithrombotic guidelines, 5 fewer deaths per 1000 patients from an antithrombotic strategy have been judged as nontrivial and clinically meaningful, and they also form the entire basis of why we give in-hospital thromboprophylaxis.

National Institutes of Health (February 11, 2021)—Outpatient: “For nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19, anticoagulants and antiplatelet therapy should not be initiated for the prevention of VTE or arterial thrombosis unless the patient has other indications for the therapy or is participating in a clinical trial.” In-hospital noncritically ill and critically ill: “Hospitalized nonpregnant adults with COVID-19 should receive prophylactic dose anticoagulation.” Postdischarge: “Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 should not routinely be discharged from the hospital while on VTE prophylaxis. Continuing anticoagulation with a US Food and Drug Administration-approved regimen for extended VTE prophylaxis after hospital discharge can be considered for patients who are at low risk for bleeding and high risk for VTE.”

Efficacy and Exploratory Outcomes in the 2 Study Groups During the 35-Day Treatment Phase in the Intention-to-Treat Population

Figure 2. 
Kaplan-Meier plot of time to the first occurrence of the primary efficacy outcome of symptomatic venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, non–central nervous system systemic arterial embolization, hospitalization, or death in the intention-to-treat (A) and safety (B) populations. Primary efficacy events accrued at a higher rate in the earlier period of follow-up, with almost all the events occurring before 25 days after randomization. Randomization date is considered day 1, and follow-up time is relative to the randomization date. P value (2 sided) for rivaroxaban vs placebo is from the log-rank test, stratified by the time from a positive COVID-19 test to randomization (at 1–5 days and at 6–14 days), with treatment as the only covariate. HR indicates hazard ratio.

In the safety population, which excluded patients who never received study medication, the primary efficacy outcome, evaluated in a prespecified sensitivity analysis at day 35, occurred in 2.0% in the rivaroxaban group and 2.7% in the placebo group (HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.35–1.58]; P =0.44; Figure 2). All-cause mortality (1 patient assigned to rivaroxaban and 1 assigned to placebo) and all-cause hospitalization events (1.8% in the rivaroxaban group versus 2.5% in the placebo group) were not significantly different.

With respect to the primary efficacy outcome, there were no significant interactions between subgroups and trial regimen. Specifically, there was no significant interaction (P interaction =0.51) between randomization strata days 1 to 5 (HR, 1.37 [95% CI, 0.63–2.98]) and days 6 to 14 (HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.32–2.44]) for the primary outcome of a composite of symptomatic VTE, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, non-CNS systemic arterial embolism, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality up to day 35.

Data Collection

Experienced, professional abstractors for other Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan collaborative quality initiatives were retrained to collect data on patients with COVID‐19 for MI‐COVID19.Using standardized data templates and detailed data dictionaries, abstractors collected demographic data, comorbidities, daily anticoagulant use, daily COVID‐19 therapy, laboratory data, and stability data (eg, respiratory support).

Patient outcomes, including date outcome occurred, were collected prospectively up to 60 days after hospitalization via medical record review and a postdischarge patient telephone call. To assess patient outcomes, abstractors reviewed the medical record 60 days following discharge to determine whether the patient was deceased. If so, and, if available, cause(s) of death and date of death were abstracted. If no data were available or the patient appeared to be alive 60 days following discharge, the patient was contacted by telephone up to 3 times to obtain additional outcome data, including whether the patient had been diagnosed with a VTE or stroke since hospital discharge. If the telephone respondent noted the patient had died since hospitalization, he/she was asked cause and date of death. To assess VTE events, abstractors reviewed the medical record 60 days following discharge to determine whether there was a confirmed or suspected deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism noted in the medical record and, if so, collect related imaging results and event dates. All data were entered into the MI‐COVID19 registry using a structured data collection template. Full definitions of patient outcomes and how they related to MICHELLE trial outcomes are shown in Table S2. As disparities attributable to patient demographics may exist, we report data on sex, race, and ethnicity obtained from the medical record and categorized as noted in Data S1.

### Rivaroxaban for prevention of thrombotic events, hospitalization, and death in outpatients with COVID-19: a randomized clinical trial [^a7c58f8a]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Although the incidence of venous and arterial thrombosis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 exceeds that of those not requiring hospitalization (16% versus 1.4%), – a growing majority of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) do not require hospital admission.Increased viral infectivity, shifting demographics of infected patients toward younger ages, widespread vaccine availability, and increasing therapies for mitigating disease severity favor a shift in the burden of COVID-19 to the outpatient setting.Accordingly, the large denominator of patients with COVID-19 not requiring initial hospitalization comprises a substantial population potentially vulnerable to thrombotic complications, including venous thromboembolism (VTE), myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke.

In addition to potentially life-threatening macrovascular complications, microvascular thrombosis has been hypothesized to contribute to clinical deterioration, hospitalization, and death in patients with COVID-19, including outpatients. – In a cohort of 4297 patients admitted with COVID-19, prophylactic anticoagulation within 24 hours of hospitalization was associated with a 4.4% absolute risk reduction in 30-day mortality.To date, randomized controlled trials of prehospitalization prophylactic anticoagulation have terminated early without showing benefit for prevention of thrombosis or clinical deterioration. –

The PREVENT-HD trial (A Study of Rivaroxaban to Reduce the Risk of Major Venous and Arterial Thrombotic Events, Hospitalization and Death in Medically Ill Outpatients With Acute, Symptomatic Coronavirus Disease 2019 [COVID-19] Infection) was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of prophylactic-dose (10 mg) rivaroxaban daily for the prevention of venous and arterial thrombosis, hospitalization, and death in high-risk outpatients with symptomatic COVID-19.

### Effectiveness and safety of extended thromboprophylaxis in post-discharge patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^eb5a3b79]. Thrombosis Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The effect of extended thromboprophylaxis in improving the prognosis of adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after discharge remains debatable. This meta-analysis was aimed to determine the advantages and disadvantages of extended thromboprophylaxis in these patients.

Methods

Different databases such as PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched for studies that evaluated the effects of extended thromboprophylaxis in post-discharge patients with COVID-19 until 13 June 2022. The primary efficacy outcome was defined by the composite outcome of thromboembolism and all-cause mortality, and the safety outcome was defined by bleeding events. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of efficacy and safety outcomes were calculated using fixed- or random-effects model. Interaction analysis was performed to assess and compare observational studies and randomised controlled trials (RCTs). A sensitivity analysis was performed after excluding studies of poor quality.

Results

Eight studies involving 10,148 patients were included. The results confirmed that extended thromboprophylaxis, primarily prophylactic use of anticoagulants for <35 days, was significantly associated with reduced composite outcome in high-risk post-discharge patients with COVID-19 (OR: 0.52; 95 % CI: 0.41-0.67, P = 0.000). Interaction analysis revealed that the effect estimates were consistent between the RCT and observational studies (P interaction = 0.310). Furthermore, extended thromboprophylaxis did not increase the risk of major bleeding events (OR: 1.64; 95 % CI: 0.95-2.82, P = 0.075).

Conclusion

In post-discharge patients with COVID-19 at high risk of thromboembolism, extended thromboprophylaxis, primarily prophylactic use of anticoagulants for <35 days, can significantly reduce the risk of thrombosis and all-cause mortality without increasing the risk of major bleeding events.

### Rivaroxaban to prevent major clinical outcomes in non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19: the CARE-COALITION VIII randomised clinical trial [^f21a732b]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections are characterised by a high prevalence of thrombotic complications.Disease progression is accompanied by elevated blood levels of inflammatory and coagulation activation markers but these measures cannot reliably identify those at highest risk of thromboembolism and related complications. In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, intensified compared with prophylactic anticoagulation reduces the risk of thromboembolism but increases the risk of bleeding, and has an uncertain net benefit.,,,

Anticoagulation is less well studied in outpatients with COVID-19. Small randomized trials completed to date have been inconclusiveand whether prophylaxis with rivaroxaban started in the early phase of COVID-19 might prevent adverse outcomes in this population is unknown.

We designed the CARE (C OVID A ntithrombotic R ivaroxaban E valuation) randomised controlled trial (RCT) to assess whether early treatment with rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily (OD) for 14 days in outpatients with mild or moderate COVID-19 decreases the risk of major thrombotic outcomes, hospitalisation requiring mechanical ventilation, and death within 30 days from randomisation.

### To prophylax or not, and how much and how long? Controversies in VTE prevention for medical inpatients, including COVID-19 inpatients [^7078ed2b]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2022). Medium credibility.

The field of thromboprophylaxis for acutely ill medical patients, including those hospitalized for COVID-19, is rapidly evolving both in the inpatient setting and the immediate post-hospital discharge period. Recent data reveal the importance of incorporating holistic thromboembolic outcomes that encompass both venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial thromboembolism, as thromboprophylaxis with low-dose direct oral anticoagulants has been shown to reduce major and fatal vascular events, especially against a background of dual pathway inhibition with aspirin. In addition, recent post hoc analyses from randomized trial data have established 5 key bleeding-risk factors that, if removed, reveal a low-bleeding- risk medically ill population and, conversely, key individual risk factors, such as advanced age, a past history of cancer or VTE, an elevated D-dimer, or the use of a validated VTE risk score-the IMPROVE VTE score using established cutoffs-to predict a high-VTE-risk medically ill population that benefits from extended postdischarge thromboprophylaxis. Last, thromboprophylaxis of a high-thrombotic-risk subset of medically ill patients, those with COVID-19, is rapidly evolving, both during hospitalization and post discharge. This article reviews 3 controversial topics in the thromboprophylaxis of hospitalized acutely ill medical patients: (1) clinical relevance of key efficacy and safety outcomes incorporated into randomized trials but not incorporated into relevant antithrombotic guidelines on the topic, (2) the use of individual risk factors or risk models of low-bleeding-risk and high-thrombotic-risk subgroups of medically ill inpatients that benefit from extended thromboprophylaxis, and (3) thromboprophylaxis of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, including extended postdischarge thromboprophylaxis.

### Commentary on the 2021 ASH guidelines on use of anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19 being discharged from the hospital [^79441152]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

With regard to the first issue, defining which hospitalized patients with COVID-19 would benefit from a post-discharge thromboprophylactic strategy is critical for assessing the potential benefits of such a strategy. From a clinical perspective, the authors’ recommendation against using anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19 who are being discharged from the hospital should reflect the fact that routine use of such a strategy should be avoided in hospitalized patients who have COVID-19, but this begs the question of which patients at high risk of thrombosis might benefit from this strategy. This was indeed the key issue with similar recommendations from the 2018 ASH Guidelines on post-discharge thromboprophylaxis in medically ill patients who did not have COVID 19. Those guidelines failed to incorporate clinical data that supported medically ill patients who had high risk of thrombosis and low risk of bleeding (including those with pneumonia and sepsis) who clearly benefited from extended post-discharge thromboprophylaxis. This led to the regulatory approval of 2 direct oral anticoagulants, betrixaban and rivaroxaban, for this indication.

The authors state that no (thrombotic) risk assessment models (RAMs) have been specifically derived or prospectively validated in patients with COVID-19. In addition, they include the International Medical Prevention Registry on Venous Thromboembolism-DD (IMPROVE-DD) venous thromboembolism (VTE) RAM (which is a refinement of the well-validated IMPROVE VTE RAM that incorporates elevated D-dimers) in an RAM for hospitalized patients who do not have COVID that has been externally validated in patients with COVID-19.However, the authors’ views have several flaws. The original weighted and scored IMPROVE-DD VTE RAM was derived in a population of hospitalized medically ill patients who had viral and other pneumonias (of which the COVID-19 population is a subset) and who had a similar median hospital length of stay of 4.5 days.

### Effect of thromboprophylaxis on clinical outcomes after COVID-19 hospitalization [^fd07e2a5]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 have an increased incidence of thromboembolism. The role of extended thromboprophylaxis after hospital discharge is unclear.

Objective

To determine whether anticoagulation is superior to placebo in reducing death and thromboembolic complications among patients discharged after COVID-19 hospitalization.

Design

Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04650087).

Setting

Done during 2021 to 2022 among 127 U.S. hospitals.

Participants

Adults aged 18 years or older hospitalized with COVID-19 for 48 hours or more and ready for discharge, excluding those with a requirement for, or contraindication to, anticoagulation.

Intervention

2.5 mg of apixaban versus placebo twice daily for 30 days.

Measurements

The primary efficacy end point was a 30-day composite of death, arterial thromboembolism, and venous thromboembolism. The primary safety end points were 30-day major bleeding and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding.

Results

Enrollment was terminated early, after 1217 participants were randomly assigned, because of a lower than anticipated event rate and a declining rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Median age was 54 years, 50.4% were women, 26.5% were Black, and 16.7% were Hispanic; 30.7% had a World Health Organization severity score of 5 or greater, and 11.0% had an International Medical Prevention Registry on Venous Thromboembolism risk prediction score of greater than 4. Incidence of the primary end point was 2.13% (95% CI, 1.14 to 3.62) in the apixaban group and 2.31% (CI, 1.27 to 3.84) in the placebo group. Major bleeding occurred in 2 (0.4%) and 1 (0.2%) and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 3 (0.6%) and 6 (1.1%) apixaban-treated and placebo-treated participants, respectively. By day 30, thirty-six (3.0%) participants were lost to follow-up, and 8.5% of apixaban and 11.9% of placebo participants permanently discontinued the study drug treatment.

Limitations

The introduction of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines decreased the risk for hospitalization and death. Study enrollment spanned the peaks of the Delta and Omicron variants in the United States, which influenced illness severity.

Conclusion

The incidence of death or thromboembolism was low in this cohort of patients discharged after hospitalization with COVID-19. Because of early enrollment termination, the results were imprecise and the study was inconclusive.

### Good practice statements for antithrombotic therapy in the management of COVID-19: guidance from the SSC of the ISTH [^da8c3d27]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the emergence of high quality randomized trial data with the use of antithrombotic agents to reduce the risk of thromboembolism, end-organ failure, and possibly mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), questions still remain as to optimal patient selection for these strategies, the use of antithrombotics in outpatient settings and in-hospital settings (including critical care units), thromboprophylaxis in special patient populations, and the management of acute thrombosis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In October 2021, the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) formed a multidisciplinary and international panel of content experts, two patient representatives, and a methodologist to develop recommendations on treatment with anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents for COVID-19 patients. The ISTH Guideline panel discussed additional topics to be well suited to a non-Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) for Good Practice Statements (GPS) to support good clinical care in the antithrombotic management of COVID-19 patients in various clinical settings. The GPS panel agreed on 17 GPS: 3 in the outpatient (pre-hospital) setting, 12 in the hospital setting both in non-critical care (ward) as well as intensive care unit settings, and 2 in the immediate post-hospital discharge setting based on limited evidence or expert opinion that supports net clinical benefit in enacting the statements provided. The antithrombotic therapies discussed in these GPS should be available in low- and middle-income countries.

CHEST guideline—post‑discharge VTE prophylaxis after COVID-19 hospitalization highlights limited evidence and differing society positions: “Bikdeli et al note that there are no data in this population, although they state that it would be reasonable to take an individualized approach in each patient after risk stratifying for both thrombosis and bleeding risk.” The Italian Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis “recommends prophylaxis throughout the hospitalization and for an additional 7 to 10 days post-discharge,” whereas the American Society of Hematology “recommends following current guidelines, which recommend against extended duration prophylaxis in hospitalized medical patients.” The panel aligns with not extending routinely because “the post-discharge VTE and major bleeding rates in COVID-19 patients are currently unknown.”

### Rivaroxaban for prevention of thrombotic events, hospitalization, and death in outpatients with COVID-19: a randomized clinical trial [^dc65165d]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is associated with heightened risks of venous and arterial thrombosis and hospitalization due to respiratory failure. To assess whether prophylactic anticoagulation can safely reduce the frequency of venous and arterial thrombosis, hospitalization, and death in nonhospitalized patients with symptomatic COVID-19 and at least one thrombosis risk factor, we conducted the PREVENT-HD double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial (A Study of Rivaroxaban to Reduce the Risk of Major Venous and Arterial Thrombotic Events, Hospitalization and Death in Medically Ill Outpatients With Acute, Symptomatic COVID-19] Infection).

Methods

PREVENT-HD was conducted between August 2020 and April 2022 at 14 US integrated health care delivery networks. A virtual trial design used remote informed consent and clinical monitoring and facilitated data collection through electronic health record integration with a cloud-based research platform. Nonhospitalized patients with symptomatic COVID-19 and at least one thrombosis risk factor were enrolled and randomly assigned to either 10 mg of oral rivaroxaban or placebo daily for 35 days. The primary efficacy outcome was time to first occurrence of a composite of symptomatic venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, non-central nervous system systemic arterial embolism, hospitalization, or death through day 35. The principal safety end point was International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis critical-site or fatal bleeding. The last study visit was on day 49.

Results

The study was terminated prematurely because of enrollment challenges and a lower-than-expected blinded pooled event rate. A total of 1284 patients underwent randomization with complete accrual of primary events through May 2022. No patients were lost to follow-up. The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 22 of 641 in the rivaroxaban group and 19 of 643 in the placebo group (3.4% versus 3.0%; hazard ratio, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.63-2.15]; P =0.63). No patient in either group experienced critical-site or fatal bleeding. One patient receiving rivaroxaban had a major bleed.

Conclusions

The study was terminated prematurely after enrollment of 32% of planned accrual because of recruitment challenges and lower-than-expected event rate. Rivaroxaban prescribed for 35 days in nonhospitalized patients with symptomatic COVID-19 at risk for thrombosis did not appear to reduce a composite end point of venous and arterial thrombotic events, hospitalization, and death.

### COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and antithrombotic agents-lessons after 1 year [^4b9b3868]. The Lancet: Haematology (2021). High credibility.

COVID-19 is associated with a high incidence of thrombotic complications, which can be explained by the complex and unique interplay between coronaviruses and endothelial cells, the local and systemic inflammatory response, and the coagulation system. Empirically, an intensified dose of thrombosis prophylaxis is being used in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and several guidelines on this topic have been published, although the insufficiency of high quality and direct evidence has led to weak recommendations. In this Viewpoint we summarise the pathophysiology of COVID-19 coagulopathy in the context of patients who are ambulant, admitted to hospital, and critically ill or non-critically ill, and those post-discharge from hospital. We also review data from randomised controlled trials in the past year of antithrombotic therapy in patients who are critically ill. These data provide the first high-quality evidence on optimal use of antithrombotic therapy in patients with COVID-19. Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is not routinely recommended for patients who are ambulant and post-discharge. A first ever trial in non-critically ill patients who were admitted to hospital has shown that a therapeutic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin might improve clinical outcomes in this population. In critically ill patients, this same treatment does not improve outcomes and prophylactic dose anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis is recommended. In the upcoming months we expect numerous data from the ongoing antithrombotic COVID-19 studies to guide clinicians at different stages of the disease.

### Sex-, race-and ethnicity-based differences in thromboembolic events among adults hospitalized with COVID-19 [^144ee444]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The risk of both VTE and ATE appears to remain elevated despite the use of prophylactic anticoagulant therapy.Retrospective studies suggest that antithrombotic therapy may be associated with improved outcomes.However, the most appropriate antithrombotic regimen to treat patients hospitalized with COVID‐19 remains poorly defined. Most patients in our study were treated with some form of prophylactic or therapeutic dose anticoagulant agent; despite this, the rate of clinical VTE and ATE remained elevated, with rates at, or slightly above, those seen in prior randomized trials of patients without COVID‐19. In the APEX (Acute Medically Ill VTE Prevention With Extended Duration Betrixaban Study) trial, the rate of deep vein thrombosis/PE was 5.3% in patients receiving extended prophylaxis with betrixaban, an oral Xa inhibitor. However, most VTE cases were asymptomatic and found on screening, in contrast to our study, where screening was not required and events were diagnosed at the discretion of the treating clinician.The rate of ATE (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) in APEX was 2.4% in betrixaban group.In the MARNIER (Medically Ill Patient Assessment of Rivaroxaban Versus Placebo in Reducing Post‐Discharge Venous Thrombo‐Embolism Risk) trial, the 45‐day rate of VTE was 0.83% in patients receiving extended thromboprophylaxis with rivaroxaban and 1.1% in patients not receiving extended thromboprophylaxis.Importantly, only symptomatic VTE events were included.The rate of ATE (myocardial infarction or stroke) was 0.52% in rivaroxaban arm and 0.65% in the placebo arm.Our findings among COVID‐19 demonstrate thromboembolic event rates that are similar to, or slightly higher than, these trials. However, our findings remain much lower than other published smaller studies of patients with COVID‐19, which likely means that the real risk of thromboembolism among patients with COVID‐19 may not be as high as once previously thought.In addition, rates of VTE were similar across races and ethnicities in both trials, which may indicate a difference between medically ill cohorts in the trials and patients with COVID‐19.

### Effect of thromboprophylaxis on clinical outcomes after COVID-19 hospitalization [^59ebfdfd]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The study ACTIV-4C was published by Tracy Y Wang and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Ann Intern Med. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the ACTIV-4C study, the trial question was: what is the effect of thromboprophylaxis in patients discharged after COVID-19 hospitalization? In the ACTIV-4C study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ACTIV-4C study, the population was: 1217 patients (614 female, 603 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 for ≥ 48 hours and ready for discharge. The key exclusion criteria were existing indication for either therapeutic or prophylactic dose anticoagulation at hospital discharge; contraindication to antithrombotic therapy; inherited or active acquired bleeding disorder. In the ACTIV-4C study, the interventions were: n=610 apixaban (a dose of 2.5 mg BID for 30 days) n=607 placebo (matching placebo BID for 30 days). In the ACTIV-4C study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in composite of death, arterial thromboembolism, and VTE at day 30 (2.13% vs. 2.31%; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.95). In the ACTIV-4C study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in arterial thromboembolism (0.16% vs. 0.49%; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.18) No significant difference in death from all causes (1.31% vs. 1.48%; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.28) No significant difference in composite of death, arterial thromboembolism, and VTE at day 90 (3.11% vs. 2.8%; RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.12). In the ACTIV-4C study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in serious adverse events, major bleeding and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. In the ACTIV-4C study, the conclusion was: in adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 for ≥ 48 hours and ready for discharge, apixaban was not superior to placebo with respect to the composite of death, arterial thromboembolism, and VTE at day 30.

### Rationale and design for the study of rivaroxaban to reduce thrombotic events, hospitalization and death in outpatients with COVID-19: the PREVENT-HD study [^8681be77]. American Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 is associated with both venous and arterial thrombotic complications. While prophylactic anticoagulation is now widely recommended for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the effectiveness and safety of thromboprophylaxis in outpatients with COVID-19 has not been established.

Study Design

PREVENT-HD is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, pragmatic, event-driven phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in symptomatic outpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 at risk for thrombotic events, hospitalization, and death. Several challenges posed by the pandemic have necessitated innovative approaches to clinical trial design, start-up, and conduct. Participants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by time from COVID-19 confirmation, to either rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily or placebo for 35 days. The primary efficacy end point is a composite of symptomatic venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, non-central nervous system systemic embolization, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality. The primary safety end point is fatal and critical site bleeding according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis definition. Enrollment began in August 2020 and is expected to enroll approximately 4,000 participants to yield the required number of end point events.

Conclusions

PREVENT-HD is a pragmatic trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of the direct oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban in the outpatient setting to reduce major venous and arterial thrombotic events, hospitalization, and mortality associated with COVID-19.

### Prevention and management of thrombosis in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [^650d2931]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2022). High credibility.

A proportion of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop moderate or severe COVID-19, with an increased risk of thromboembolic complications. The inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause an acute-phase response and endothelial dysfunction, which contribute to COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, the clinical and laboratory features of which differ in some respects from those of classic disseminated intravascular coagulation. Understanding of the pathophysiology of thrombosis in COVID-19 is needed to develop approaches to management and prevention, with implications for short-term and long-term health outcomes. Evidence is emerging to support treatment decisions in patients with COVID-19, but many questions remain about the optimum approach to management. In this Viewpoint, we provide a summary of the pathophysiology of thrombosis and associated laboratory and clinical findings, and highlight key considerations in the management of coagulopathy in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19, including coagulation assessment, identification of thromboembolic complications, and use of antithrombotic prophylaxis and therapeutic anticoagulation. We await the results of trials that are underway to establish the safety and benefits of prolonged thromboprophylaxis after hospital discharge.

### Outpatient and inpatient anticoagulation therapy and the risk for hospital admission and death among COVID-19 patients [^43488071]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

At the time of this publication, multiple randomized trials are examining the use of anticoagulation in COVID-19. A recently published open-label clinical trial randomized 615 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with elevated D-dimer into receiving therapeutic anticoagulation while hospitalized followed by rivaroxaban for 30 days versus prophylactic anticoagulation while hospitalized only. There was increased bleeding among patients randomized to therapeutic anticoagulation with no improvement in outcomes. In another clinical trial, 600 COVID-19 intensive care unit patients were randomized to escalated prophylactic anticoagulation versus prophylactic anticoagulation. There was no difference in clinical outcomes between the two groups. Even more recently, two new articles published results of randomized controlled trials for anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients. One article based on data of 2219 non critically ill COVID-19 patients showed improved outcomes with therapeutic anticoagulation compared to prophylactic or escalated dose anticoagulation. The caveat was that 20% of the patients in the intervention arm did not receive therapeutic anticoagulation versus 26% of the patients in the control arm received escalated prophylactic anticoagulation. The second article was based on data of 1089 critically ill COVID-19 patients, did not show a difference in outcomes between patients randomized to therapeutic anticoagulation versus the control arm. Again, the caveat was that 22% of patients in the intervention arm did not receive therapeutic anticoagulation and 51% of patients in the control arm received escalated prophylactic anticoagulation. Results are awaited for other trials examining anticoagulant use among COVID-19 outpatients. In due course, these trials will provide rigorous evidence regarding the benefits of anticoagulant therapy in the context of COVID-19 and insights regarding the optimal anticoagulant type, dosage, and duration of therapy.

Unfortunately, many patients with an indication for anticoagulation are not receiving therapy. In a study of almost 100,000 veterans with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, only 49% were on anticoagulation even after the introduction of DOAC. Similar results were observed among a cohort of Medicare patients. Even if patients were prescribed anticoagulation, suboptimal adherence to anticoagulation use exposes patients to a higher risk of thrombotic events, as noted in a study of more than half a million atrial fibrillation patients. Our study demonstrates that, in addition to reducing the risk for thrombotic complications of atrial fibrillation, OPAC reduces the risk for hospital admission in those diagnosed with COVID-19. This finding can help improve adherence of patients eligible for anticoagulation to their medications as a public health approach to minimize COVID-19 hospitalization as we, unfortunately, approach the next pandemic surge.

### Benefit-risk of rivaroxaban for extended thromboprophylaxis after hospitalization for medical illness: pooled analysis from MAGELLAN and MARINER [^374de9e6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Our analysis has some limitations. The analysis was post hoc, and the selection of patients for inclusion from the MAGELLAN study was done after randomization. However, the treatment groups from the individual studies, as well as the pooled population, were comparable for demographic and baseline clinical characteristics (Table 1). Despite a sample size of >16 000 patients, the analysis could neither confirm nor exclude a clinically important effect for reducing death from all causes. The observed relative risk reduction for all‐cause mortality was 10%. This result is similar to the relative risk reduction in all‐cause mortality observed in patients with atrial fibrillation who are given direct oral anticoagulants for preventing stroke and systemic embolism.Our results are not generalizable to patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency (CrCl <50 mL/min), which represents ≈35% of hospitalized medical patients.Further research is needed to improve the benefit–risk of thromboprophylaxis in this subgroup of patients. A recent analysis of the MAGELLAN study suggests that a positive benefit–risk profile can be achieved in a subset of these patients with appropriate patient selection.An additional limitation to generalizability is that patient selection in the MARINER trial included an assessment of plasma D‐dimer, which may not be routine practice in all hospitals, although it has been validated as an important biomarker in hospitalized patients with COVID‐19.Furthermore, our analysis assumes that major or fatal thromboembolic outcomes and critical‐site or fatal bleeding outcomes are weighted equally, and different patients may have different values and preferences for these outcomes, which may influence the decision to give extended thromboprophylaxis. The NNH values used in our benefit–risk assessment are based on observed differences in bleeding (Table 3), which were not statistically significant, and it is possible that these differences reflect chance variation and not a true increased risk with rivaroxaban. Finally, our analysis did not include nonfatal or noncritical site major bleeding or nonmajor bleeding in the benefit–risk assessment, and these outcomes may also be relevant for some patients or clinicians in assessing benefit–risk.

Regarding specific circumstances for cancer-associated thrombosis, more specifically with respect to patients with COVID-19 infection, ITAC 2022 guidelines recommend to avoid prescribing post-discharge thromboprophylaxis in patients with cancer and COVID-19.

### Thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19: a brief update to the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^a05b49bb]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

COVID-19–associated thrombosis background and scope: Within the first few months of the COVID-19 global pandemic, it was recognized that patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 often exhibited markers of a hypercoagulable state and had an increased incidence of VTE, and reports documented significantly elevated D-dimer levels that were associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Based upon the limited, low-quality evidence suggesting patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had a higher risk of thrombosis than similarly ill patients without COVID-19, societal guidelines were uniform in their recommendation that all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia receive pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis in the absence of a contraindication. Over the past 15 months, randomized controlled trials have emerged focusing on optimal dosing in both moderately ill hospitalized (non-ICU) and critically ill (ICU) patients, and the update provides guidance focused on prevention of thrombosis in hospitalized patients while stating it is not updating guidance related to pre- or posthospital prophylaxis, diagnosis, or treatment.

### Rivaroxaban for prevention of thrombotic events, hospitalization, and death in outpatients with COVID-19: a randomized clinical trial [^5cda88c7]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

PREVENT-HD used an innovative virtual trial design that enhanced patient engagement, enabled remote informed consent and clinical monitoring, and facilitated comprehensive data collection through electronic health record integration with a cloud-based research platform. The virtual consent platform promoted enrollment of a more ethnically and racially inclusive study population, with nearly 30% of patients being non-White. The trial also demonstrated the feasibility of completely remote monitoring for efficacy and safety outcomes, including the use of telemedicine to eliminate the need for in-person visits and laboratory testing and direct delivery of study drugs to patients by a central pharmacy. This trial design enabled follow-up in 100% of patients through day 49 in the midst of myriad pandemic logistical challenges.

Similar to most published trials of thromboprophylaxis in outpatients with symptomatic COVID-19, – PREVENT-HD observed a lower-than-expected event rate and did not demonstrate a benefit for prevention of symptomatic VTE and arterial thrombosis, all-cause hospitalization, and death. In a study of 243 outpatients with COVID-19, sulodexide, an oral mixture of glycosaminoglycans (low-molecular-weight heparin and dermatan sulfate), decreased the need for hospitalization.Although thromboinflammation was suggested as a final common pathway for clinical deterioration early in the pandemic,, subsequent data support non–thrombosis-based cardiovascular diseases, such as heart failure and sepsis as greater contributors to morbidity and mortality. A reduction in thrombosis, clinical deterioration, and death in patients with COVID-19 has also been explained by more widespread implementation of corticosteroids, monoclonal antibodies, and antiviral agents, as well as nearly 70% of the population being fully vaccinated. – Underenrollment, as encountered in other similar trials, also likely contributed to the inability to detect a benefit of anticoagulation. – Finally, although half of the trial population was enrolled within the first 5 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, a significant benefit may have been restricted to the interval immediately after symptom onset and therefore may have been missed in PREVENT-HD and other studies.

### Thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19: a brief update to the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^e33a6790]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Early societal guidelines regarding thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19 outline setting-specific use of unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). The Global COVID-19 Thrombosis Collaborative Group states that outpatient pharmacologic prophylaxis should be reserved for those at highest risk, lists prophylactic daily LMWH or subcutaneous UFH bid for in-hospital care, and indicates that individualized risk stratification should be followed by consideration of extended prophylaxis (for up to 45 d) for patients with elevated VTE risk and low bleeding risk. The International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis specifies in noncritically ill inpatients that routine thromboprophylaxis with standard dose UFH or LMWH should be used after bleed risk assessment, with intermediate dose LMWH that may also be considered; for critically ill patients, routine prophylactic dose UFH or LMWH should be used and intermediate dose LMWH can also be considered in high-risk patients, and extended postdischarge thromboprophylaxis should be considered for all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who meet high VTE risk criteria. The Chest Guideline and Expert Panel Report recommends current standard dose anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis over intermediate or full treatment dosing for hospitalized patients with acute illness with COVID-19, suggests the same approach in critically ill patients, and recommends inpatient thromboprophylaxis only over inpatient plus extended thromboprophylaxis after hospital discharge. The VAS-European Independent Foundation in Angiology/Vascular Medicine lists routine thromboprophylaxis with weight-adjusted intermediate doses of LMWH (unless contraindication) for hospitalized care and calls for evaluation of VTE risk before hospital discharge using the IMPROVE-D-dimer score with prolonged postdischarge thromboprophylaxis with rivaroxaban, betrixaban, or LMWH. The World Health Organization notes that, without an established indication for higher dose anticoagulation, it suggests administering standard thromboprophylaxis dosing of anticoagulation rather than therapeutic or intermediate dosing in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

### American Society of Hematology living guidelines on the use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19: July 2021 update on postdischarge thromboprophylaxis [^d6e30bea]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

What are others saying and what is new in these guidelines?

There are multiple other guidance documents on the use of anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19. These include the 2020 CHEST COVID-19 Guidelines, Anticoagulation Forum interim clinical guidance, International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) Scientific and Standardization Committee (SSC) COVID-19 clinical guidance, National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 treatment guidelines, and American College of Cardiology (ACC) clinical guidance.

Major differences between the current ASH guidelines and these other documents include use in ASH guidelines of high-quality systematic reviews and ED frameworks, which increase transparency, along with the use of marker states to estimate the relative importance to patients of key outcomes of treatment. The present ASH guideline is also unique in its “living” format, though other guidance documents may also be updated.

All 5 of these other guidance documents do not recommend routine use of postdischarge pharmacological thromboprophylaxis after hospitalization for COVID-19–related illness. However, given the lack of high-quality evidence, they all suggest that an individualized decision be made taking into account the patient’s thrombosis risk factors and bleeding risk at the time of discharge.

The CHEST guideline suggests that postdischarge thromboprophylaxis would result in net clinical benefit only if the risk of symptomatic VTE were found to be >1.8% within 35 to 42 days after release from the hospital.Meanwhile, the ISTH guidance document suggests that postdischarge thromboprophylaxis be considered for all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who meet high-risk VTE criteria, including advanced age, ICU admission, cancer, prior VTE history, thrombophilia, severe immobility, elevated D-dimer, or an IMPROVE VTE score of 4 or more.The guidance from AC Forum, NIH, and ACC all suggest that postdischarge prophylaxis be considered in light of thrombotic risk, bleeding risk, and access to medication.

At the time of this writing, there have been no published randomized trials examining the efficacy and safety of postdischarge thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing or recently completed clinical studies examining this question.These prospective studies include the MICHELLE (registered at, as NCT04662684)and ACTIV-4c trials (NCT04650087),which examine the use of prophylactic-intensity direct oral anticoagulants.

### Anticoagulant treatment regimens in patients with COVID-19: a meta-analysis [^45890975]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This meta‐analysis comprises 10 trials (over 5,000 patients) comparing higher‐dose with prophylactic‐dose anticoagulation in patients hospitalized with COVID‐19.

In the overall study population, higher‐dose anticoagulation was not associated with lower mortality compared with prophylactic‐dose anticoagulation. This key finding is consistent with current guidelines, which do not recommend routine administration of greater than prophylactic doses of anticoagulation in patients hospitalized with COVID‐19.Similarly, a recently published meta‐analysis including seven trials showed no survival benefit with higher‐dose anticoagulation.Our analyses included 3 additional trials and could confirm previous findings. Higher‐dose anticoagulation decreased the risk of venous thromboembolism and increased the risk of major bleeding to a similar extent. These counteracting effects appear to cancel each other out in terms of all‐cause death. Figure 4 summarizes the main outcomes of this study. Of note, these results are only applicable for a population that largely excluded patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy or patients with increased risk of bleeding. All trials except for the HESACOVID and XCOVID‐19 trials explicitly excluded patients with a low platelet count (< 50,000 or < 100,000/µL). The net benefit of higher‐dose anticoagulation in these relevant groups of patients remains unknown.

Figure 4 
Summary of key outcomes of the overall analysis. Net adverse clinical events are a composite of death, venous thromboembolism, and major bleeding. CI, confidence interval. [Colour figure can be viewed at]

Rivaroxaban was used as the preferred anticoagulant agent in the ACTION trial, which showed a numerically higher risk of death with therapeutic‐dose anticoagulation compared with prophylactic anticoagulation (Figure 1). Rivaroxaban is a small molecule with a distribution volume exceeding that of heparin,,potentially allowing it to better access lung tissue and prevent alveolar thrombosis. Further, rivaroxaban is easier to use in the outpatient setting because of its oral administration but is therefore mostly limited to noncritically ill patients. However, it does not share the same pleiotropic effects of heparin, which have been postulated to add to the benefits of heparin. It is unclear whether this finding reflects a clinical difference between anticoagulant treatment with rivaroxaban and LMWH in patients with COVID‐19.

Conclusions and future directions—The authors note that “current evidence supports that the rates of VTE are higher in these patients, at least in the ICU.” They state, “At this time, we believe critically ill patients should still receive standard thromboprophylaxis for VTE, and moderately ill patients with a low bleeding risk might benefit from therapeutic heparin.” They further add, “We see no role for intermediate dose thromboprophylaxis in either setting.”

### Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis in a patient with COVID [^645006e9]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

According to American College of Chest Physicians current guidelines, treatment of NBTE with heparin or LMWH is preferred over no anticoagulation, in addition to treating the underlying condition.Newer studies have suggested that heparin or LWMH would be preferred in cases of malignancy-associated NBTE, while Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) agonists like warfarin may be preferred in antiphospholipid syndrome-associated NBTE.Multiple recent cases documented the failure of DOACs in treating NBTE.No studies have compared the efficacy of different anticoagulation strategies for NBTE to date. A prospective multicentre trial is required to study the efficacy of the various anticoagulant regimens for NBTE, and whether these therapies should be tailored for patients with versus without underlying malignancy. The optimal treatment of the hypercoagulable state in patients with COVID-19 remains unclear. Multiple trials revealed that in certain populations, full-dose anticoagulation led to reduced major thromboembolic events and other major events in a patient hospitalised with COVID-19.However, in trials dealing with outpatient anticoagulation for patients with COVID-19, the ACTION trial revealed no benefit for an extended 30-day full anticoagulation compared with in-hospital anticoagulation only.However, the MICHELLE trial reported that in patients with high risk, thromboprophylaxis with low-dose rivaroxaban reduced thrombotic events compared with those discharged with no thromboprophylaxis.In our case, the patient had incidental COVID-19 without any of the typical symptoms and no studies compared DOACs to warfarin or LMWH in COVID-19 patients. Our patient was initially treated with apixaban for PE, with the resolution of AV mass and PE but developed large aortic root vegetation/thrombus, leading us to switch to warfarin. Patient was not interested in LWMH treatment. Apixaban is not approved by FDA for arterial thrombosis/thromboembolic or left ventricular thrombus. Although apixaban was successfully used for the treatment of NBTE in a recent COVID-19 NBTE case report.Excision of the vegetation may have a role in some patients who do not have advanced malignancy.Lifelong anticoagulation is usually recommended in patients with cancer due to the reported recurrence of NBTE in patients taken off anticoagulation.The duration of anticoagulation for patients with COVID-19-associated hypercoagulable state and thrombosis is not well studied.

### American Society of Hematology living guidelines on the use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19: July 2021 update on postdischarge thromboprophylaxis [^27152c13]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19-related acute illness is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals in decisions about the use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19 who do not have confirmed or suspected VTE.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel, including 3 patient representatives, and applied strategies to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline development process, including performing systematic evidence reviews (up to March 2021). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The panel used the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel agreed on 1 additional recommendation. The panel issued a conditional recommendation against the use of outpatient anticoagulant prophylaxis in patients with COVID-19 who are discharged from the hospital and who do not have suspected or confirmed VTE or another indication for anticoagulation.

Conclusions

This recommendation was based on very low certainty in the evidence, underscoring the need for high-quality randomized controlled trials assessing the role of postdischarge thromboprophylaxis. Other key research priorities include better evidence on assessing risk of thrombosis and bleeding outcomes in patients with COVID-19 after hospital discharge.

VENOUS THROMBOSIS DURING COVID-19 IN THE GENERAL POPULATION

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) [deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE)] is one of the major complications of COVID-19 infection. Data on the incidence of VTE are conflicting and depend on the disease severity, the study design and the presence or not of rigorous VTE screening. In most studies, the overall incidence for VTE ranges from 7.0% to 14.1% (7.9%–22.9% for DVT and 3.5%–13.7% for PE, for non-ICU and ICU patients, respectively). VTE is associated with 1.37-fold increased mortality and 2.5-fold increased risk of ICU admission.

In general, there is no benefit to prescribing anticoagulation for outpatients. Prophylactic anticoagulation is superior to no anticoagulation in hospitalized patients and should only be given after an assessment of the bleeding risk. For specific patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, therapeutic dose anticoagulation resulted in 1.27 times more organ support–free days compared with usual thromboprophylaxis and a reduction in all-cause mortality, mechanical ventilation and ICU admission. The benefit was more evident in the high D-dimer cohort (male patients with comorbidities). For critically ill patients (ICU) the prophylactic dose was more beneficial and safer. At discharge, recovered patients present a higher risk of PE and DVT (HR 3.16 and 2.55, respectively), but thromboprophylaxis is recommended only for high risk patients. Diagnosed VTE is treated according to the general guidelines. There is no consensus on the duration of therapy (3–6 or even 12 months).

### Bosentan for high-risk outpatients with COVID-19 infection: a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial [^16c3cb3e]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In our study, the cumulative incidence of thromboembolic events was 8.7% in the placebo group (one symptomatic and eight asymptomatic events). In the bosentan group, only one asymptomatic DVT was found. The first experiences with COVID-19 as investigated in retrospective and then prospective studies revealed the incidence of thromboembolic events was 15%–85% in ICU or non-ICU wards.Later, it was shown that the risk of hospital-related venous thromboembolic events persists in COVID-19 patients from the time of admission until 90 days post-discharge.

In a prospective and single-center study in non-ICU hospitalized patients, the incidence of asymptomatic DVT was reported as approximately 15% despite routine thromboprophylaxis.In another study, the prevalence of asymptomatic DVT was 19% in the first days of hospitalization in randomly selected COVID-19 patients in general wards despite the routine administration of thromboprophylaxis.In a brief report drafted on the findings of an observational study, 163 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in general wards or ICUs were followed up for 30 days. The cumulative incidence of symptomatic post-discharge thrombosis (including arterial and venous events) at day 30 following discharge was 2.5% in that study.

### Eligibility for posthospitalization venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study [^db2eb9c8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Patient Population and Sampling

Our primary cohort of interest was adults hospitalized for COVID‐19 from March 7, 2020, to January 23, 2021. Patients were excluded if pregnant, aged <18 years, discharged “against medical advice,” assigned comfort care on hospitalization, or transferred from another hospital. For patients with multiple hospitalizations, the first was included. For all analyses, patients who died during hospitalization were excluded. In addition, we excluded patients who were on anticoagulants before admission or were diagnosed with a VTE during hospitalization as there is no equipoise as to whether to anticoagulate those patients on discharge.

On the basis of available data collection resources, some MI‐COVID19 hospitals were able to include all patients with COVID‐19 who were hospitalized during the study time period. Other hospitals (eg, those with high volumes) used a pseudo‐random sampling process to select cases. Pseudo‐randomization involved sorting potentially eligible discharges by timestamp of discharge and reviewing patients for inclusion in ascending order on the basis of the minute in which they were discharged and including patients until they reached abstractor capacity.

### Post-discharge prophylaxis with rivaroxaban reduces fatal and major Thromboembolic events in medically Ill Patients [^d46bc6ba]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hospitalized acutely ill medical patients are at risk for fatal and major thromboembolic events. Whether use of extended-duration primary thromboprophylaxis can prevent such events is unknown.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether extended-duration rivaroxaban reduces the risk of venous and arterial fatal and major thromboembolic events without significantly increasing major bleeding in acutely ill medical patients after discharge.

Methods

MARINER (A Study of Rivaroxaban [JNJ-39039039] on the Venous Thromboembolic Risk in Post-Hospital Discharge Patients) studied acutely ill medical patients with additional risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Medically ill patients with a baseline creatinine clearance ≥50 ml/min were randomized in a double-blind fashion to rivaroxaban 10 mg or placebo daily at hospital discharge for 45 days. Exploratory efficacy analyses were performed with the intent-to-treat population including all data through day 45. Time-to-event curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A blinded independent committee adjudicated all clinical events.

Results

In total, 4,909 patients were assigned to rivaroxaban and 4,913 patients to placebo. The mean age was 67.8 years, 55.5% were men, mean baseline creatinine clearance was 87.8 ml/min, and mean duration of hospitalization was 6.7 days. The pre-specified composite efficacy endpoint (symptomatic VTE, myocardial infarction, nonhemorrhagic stroke, and cardiovascular death) occurred in 1.28% and 1.77% of patients in the rivaroxaban and placebo groups, respectively (hazard ratio: 0.72; 95% confidence interval: 0.52 to 1.00; p = 0.049), whereas major bleeding occurred in 0.27% and 0.18% of patients in the rivaroxaban and placebo groups, respectively (hazard ratio: 1.44; 95% confidence interval: 0.62 to 3.37; p = 0.398).

Conclusions

Extended-duration rivaroxaban in hospitalized medically ill patients resulted in a 28% reduction in fatal and major thromboembolic events without a significant increase in major bleeding.

### American Society of Hematology living guidelines on the use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19: July 2021 update on postdischarge thromboprophylaxis [^7d6175ce]. Blood Advances (2022). High credibility.

ASH living guideline—postdischarge thromboprophylaxis after COVID-19 hospitalization: The ASH guideline panel suggests that outpatient anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis not be used for patients with COVID-19 who are discharged from the hospital and do not have suspected or confirmed VTE or another indication for anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects). An individualized assessment of the patient’s risk of thrombosis and bleeding and shared decision making are important, prospectively validated risk assessment models after hospital discharge are not available, and postdischarge thromboprophylaxis may be reasonable in patients judged to be at high risk of thrombosis and low risk of bleeding. Evidence of benefits was very uncertain: postdischarge prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation may reduce mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-0.83), corresponding to 5 fewer (from 7 fewer to 2 fewer) deaths per 1000 patients; it may reduce PE (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.46-1.25), corresponding to 1 fewer (from 3 fewer to 1 more) per 1000 patients; it may reduce VTE (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.46-1.25), corresponding to 4 fewer (from 9 fewer to 4 more) VTEs per 1000 patients; and it may reduce readmission (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.41-2.05), corresponding to 5 fewer (from 35 fewer to 57 more) readmissions per 1000 patients; no benefit was observed for DVT, ischemic stroke, and ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Harms evidence indicated potential increases in major bleeding from indirect data (relative risk, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.33-3.27), corresponding to 4 more (from 1 more to 9 more) per 1000 at lower bleeding risk and to 13 more (from 4 more to 27 more) per 1000 at higher bleeding risk, while direct COVID-19 data were very uncertain (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.86-2.67), corresponding to 1 more (from 0 to 2 more) major bleeding episodes per 1000 patients.

Benefits.

The evidence was very uncertain for all of the considered outcomes leading to the following interpretation. Postdischarge prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation may reduce the risk of mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-0.83), which corresponds to 5 fewer (from 7 fewer to 2 fewer) deaths per 1000 patients; very low certainty. Postdischarge prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation may reduce the risk of PE (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.46-1.25), which corresponds to 1 fewer (from 3 fewer to 1 more) PEs per 1000 patients; very low certainty. Postdischarge prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation may reduce the risk of VTE (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.46-1.25), which corresponds to 4 fewer (from 9 fewer to 4 more) VTEs per 1000 patients; very low certainty. Postdischarge prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation may reduce the risk of readmission (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.41-2.05), which corresponds to 5 fewer (from 35 fewer to 57 more) readmissions per 1000 patients; very low certainty. No benefit or harm was observed for the outcomes of DVT, ischemic stroke, and ST-elevation myocardial infarction in terms of absolute effect, but there was very low certainty in the evidence.

Harms and burden.

Indirect evidence from acutely ill patients who do not have COVID-19 indicated that postdischarge prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation after hospitalization may increase the risk of major bleeding (relative risk, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.33-3.27), but the evidence is uncertain; this corresponds to 4 more (from 1 more to 9 more) major bleeding episodes per 1000 patients at lower risk of bleeding, and to 13 more (from 4 more to 27 more) major bleeding episodes per 1000 patients at higher risk of bleeding; low certainty. Direct evidence from patients acutely ill with COVID-19 indicates that postdischarge prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation may increase the risk of major bleeding but the evidence is very uncertain (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.86-2.67). This result corresponds to 1 more (from 0 to 2 more) major bleeding episode per 1000 patients; very low certainty.

### Rivaroxaban for thromboprophylaxis after hospitalization for medical illness [^043b75b9]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study MARINER was published by Spyropoulos AC and colleagues in 2018 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Pulmonary embolism and Deep vein thrombosis. In the MARINER study, the trial question was: what is the effect of rivaroxaban in medically ill patients who were at an increased risk for VTE on the basis of a modified International Medical Prevention Registry on VTE score of ≥ 4? In the MARINER study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the MARINER study, the population was: 12019 patients (5735 female, 6284 male). The inclusion criteria were medically ill patients who were at an increased risk of VTE on the basis of a modified International Medical Prevention Registry on VTE score of ≥ 4 or a score of 2 or 3 plus a plasma D-dimer level of > 2 times the upper limit of the normal range assigned at hospital discharge. The key exclusion criteria were anticoagulant or dual antiplatelet therapy, active cancer, history of recent bleeding (within 3 months), or a high risk of bleeding, or other contraindications to rivaroxaban. In the MARINER study, the interventions were: n=6007 rivaroxaban (a dose of 10 mg, with the dose adjusted for renal insufficiency for 45 days) n=6012 placebo (for 45 days). In the MARINER study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in symptomatic VTE or death due to VTE (0.83% vs. 1.1%; HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.09). In the MARINER study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in symptomatic nonfatal VTE (0.18% vs. 0.42%; HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.89). In the MARINER study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. significant differences in major bleeding (0.28% vs. 0.15%; HR 1.88, 95% CI 0.84-4.23). In the MARINER study, the conclusion was: in medically ill patients who were at an increased risk of VTE on the basis of a modified International Medical Prevention Registry on VTE score of ≥ 4 or a score of 2 or 3 plus a plasma D-dimer level of > 2 times the upper limit of the normal range assigned at hospital discharge, rivaroxaban was not superior to placebo with respect to symptomatic VTE or death due to VTE.

Recommendation 12—For acutely ill hospitalized COVID-19 patients with proximal DVT or PE, we suggest initial parenteral anticoagulation with therapeutic weight adjusted LMWH or IV UFH, noting that the use of LMWH will limit staff exposure and avoid the potential for heparin pseudo-resistance. In patients without any drug-to-drug interactions, we suggest initial oral anticoagulation with apixaban or rivaroxaban; dabigatran and edoxaban can be used after initial parenteral anticoagulation, and vitamin K antagonist therapy can be used after overlap with initial parenteral anticoagulation.

### Prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of VTE in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^d3b7989d]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

COVID-19 acute VTE treatment evidence and DOAC considerations—Our literature search did not identify any randomized trials assessing the efficacy and safety of anticoagulants for the treatment of acute VTE in hospitalized or critically ill COVID-19 patients. A recent study enrolled 12 consecutive patients on DOACs who were hospitalized with severe COVID-19 and, on average, C-trough levels were six times higher during hospitalization than in the prehospitalization period; additionally, DOACs are contraindicated in patients with severe (eg, creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) renal failure. Given reasons including that many of these patients require administration of inhibitors or inducers of P-glycoprotein or strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes and that GI dysfunction is a common problem in the critically ill patient, the panel endorsed that in critically ill COVID-19 patients with proximal DVT or PE, parenteral anticoagulation might be preferred to oral anticoagulant therapy.

### American Society of Hematology living guidelines on the use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19: July 2021 update on postdischarge thromboprophylaxis [^8a46e734]. Blood Advances (2022). High credibility.

COVID-19 venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk and postdischarge context—among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 5% to 15% may develop critical illness requiring intensive care support, and VTE occurs in up to 8% and 23% of acutely ill and critically ill patients, respectively. In non–COVID-19 medical inpatients, most hospitalization-related thrombotic events occur after discharge, with heightened VTE risk extending until at least 1 month after discharge, and available COVID-19 data suggest postdischarge VTE in COVID-19 patients generally range from 0.5% to 1.5% and appears similar to or lower than the non–COVID-19 population. Several clinical risk factors have been found to be independently associated with postdischarge VTE after COVID-19, including advanced age, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and there are no RAMs specifically derived or prospectively validated in patients with COVID-19 thus far. The 2018 ASH guidelines recommended against postdischarge prophylaxis in medically ill patients who did not have COVID-19 owing to low absolute benefit with increased bleeding risk, and the relative risks and benefits of postdischarge thromboprophylaxis remain uncertain in this population.

CHEST guideline—COVID-19 recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) despite anticoagulation—highlights an evidence gap and provides conditional management suggestions. The panel notes 'Our literature search did not identify any randomized trials assessing the efficacy and safety of different anticoagulation regimens for the management of recurrent VTE despite anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19' and 'There are no randomized trials or prospective cohort studies that have evaluated management of patients with recurrent VTE despite anticoagulation.' It advises that 'Important factors to consider include compliance, adequate absorption of DOACs, and absence of potential drug-to-drug interactions,' and that 'There are no studies assessing the treatment of recurrent VTE despite anticoagulation with DOACs.' Indirect data include 'recurrent VTE of 9% [95% CI, 2 to 25]' with therapeutic weight-adjusted low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) after vitamin K antagonist failure, and dose escalation to '125% and 130%' with reported '8.6% (6 of 70; 95% CI, 4.0-17.5)' recurrent VTE and '4.3% (3 of 70; 95% CI, 1.5-11.9)' major bleeding when 'receiving increased dose (125% to 130%) of LMWH.' Based on these comparisons, the panel states 'we expect the net benefit of increasing the dose of LMWH by 25% to 30%... and switching to LMWH in patients failing oral anticoagulation with a DOAC or vitamin K antagonist,' and issues recommendations: 'we suggest increasing the dose of LMWH by 25% to 30%' for recurrent VTE on therapeutic weight adjusted LMWH with documented compliance, and for VTE on apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or vitamin K antagonist in range, 'we suggest switching treatment to therapeutic weight-adjusted LMWH.'

COVID-19 VTE treatment—outpatients with proximal DVT or PE and no drug-to-drug interactions: We recommend apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban or edoxaban. Initial parenteral anticoagulation is needed before dabigatran and edoxaban. For patients not treated with a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), we suggest vitamin K antagonists over LMWH, and parenteral anticoagulation needs to be overlapped with vitamin K antagonists.

### American Society of Hematology living guidelines on the use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19: July 2021 update on postdischarge thromboprophylaxis [^437c4773]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

In non–COVID-19 medical inpatients, most hospitalization-related thrombotic events occur after discharge; heightened VTE risk may extend until at least 1 month after discharge.Several risk assessment models (RAMs) in patients without COVID-19 have been developed to assess the risk of VTE after hospitalization.However, randomized trials of postdischarge prophylaxis in patients without COVID-19 have not shown a substantial absolute benefit in VTE reduction, and the 2018 ASH guidelines recommended against postdischarge prophylaxis in medically ill patients who did not have COVID-19, owing to a low absolute benefit offset by an increase in bleeding risk. 26,-

There is a belief that patients with COVID-19 may have a higher risk of VTE after discharge than patients without COVID-19. However, available COVID-19–specific estimates do not bear this out. Although there remains considerable uncertainty, published estimates of postdischarge VTE in COVID-19 patients generally range from 0.5% to 1.5%,comparable to the baseline risk of postdischarge VTE in the non-COVID-19 population. Several clinical risk factors have been found to be independently associated with postdischarge VTE after COVID-19, including advanced age, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission.However, there are no RAMs that have been specifically derived and prospectively validated in patients with COVID-19 thus far, although non-COVID RAMs have been externally validated in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and the COVID-thromboembolism score was derived specifically from patients with COVID-19 with concomitant malignancy.Moreover, although the recent CORE-19 registry demonstrated a reduction in the composite outcome of VTE, arterial thromboembolism (ATE), and all-cause mortality with postdischarge anticoagulation, there remains a paucity of high-quality prospective and randomized data. As such, the relative risks and benefits of postdischarge thromboprophylaxis remain uncertain in this population. In this living guideline update, the role of postdischarge thromboprophylaxis after hospitalization for COVID-19 is addressed.

Description of the target populations

The target population included patients discharged from the hospital after admission for COVID-19–related illness.

### Thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19: a brief update to the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^522d66cb]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Critically ill COVID-19—therapeutic vs standard-dose anticoagulation: In critically ill patients with COVID-19, we suggest current standard dose anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis (with UFH or LMWH) over therapeutic dose anticoagulation (Conditional Recommendation, Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). The panel notes that although the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is likely lower on therapeutic anticoagulation (absolute risk reduction, approximately 5%), the risk of major bleeding is higher (absolute risk increase, approximately 1%-2%), and there is no effect on mortality. For mortality assessment, six trials were included and the ACTION trial incorporated a small critically ill subset (n = 39), with no significant mortality difference between therapeutic and thromboprophylaxis groups (RR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.91-1.15]). Trial data also report mechanical ventilation requirements in HEP-COVID of 10/38 (26.3%) in the therapeutic group vs 8/35 (22.9%) with thromboprophylaxis.

Summary of recommendations

Recommendation 3

The ASH guideline panel suggests that outpatient anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis not be used for patients with COVID-19 who are being discharged from the hospital and do not have suspected or confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) or another indication for anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕◯◯◯).

Remarks:

An individualized assessment of the patient’s risk of thrombosis and bleeding and shared decision making are important when deciding on whether to use postdischarge thromboprophylaxis. Prospectively validated risk assessment models to estimate thrombotic and bleeding risk in COVID-19 patients after hospital discharge are not available.
The panel acknowledged that postdischarge thromboprophylaxis may be reasonable for patients judged to be at high risk of thrombosis and low risk of bleeding.

Background

Hospitalization for acute medical illness is a common risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE), with most such events occurring after hospital discharge.Meanwhile, there is a high incidence of thrombotic complications in patients hospitalized for COVID-19–related acute illness or critical illness.However, there are limited reports regarding rates of VTE after discharge for patients who have been hospitalized for COVID-19.Thus, there has been much interest in establishing whether postdischarge pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in this population is warranted.

These guidelines are based on systematic reviews of evidence conducted under the direction of the McMaster University GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluations) Centre with international collaborators. This is an update of the previous American Society of Hematology (ASH) guideline published in February 2021and focuses on the role of thromboprophylaxis for patients discharged from the hospital after COVID-19. The panel followed best practice for guideline development recommended by the Institute of Medicine and the Guidelines International Network (GIN).The panel used the GRADE approachto assess the certainty of the evidence and formulate recommendations. The recommendation is listed in Table 1.

Table 1. 
Recommendations

Values and preferences

The guideline panel identified all-cause mortality, pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and major bleeding as critical outcomes and placed a high value on avoiding these outcomes with the interventions assessed.
Panel members noted that there was possible uncertainty and variability in the relative value that patients place on avoiding major bleeding events compared with reducing thrombotic events.

### Universal clinical decision support tool for thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: post hoc analysis of the IMPROVE-DD cluster randomized trial [^47fe38ed]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Inpatient and extended postdischarge thromboprophylaxis of COVID-19 patients remains suboptimal despite antithrombotic guidelines.

Objectives

To determine whether a novel electronic health record-agnostic clinical decision support (CDS) tool incorporating the International Medical Prevention Registry on Venous Thromboembolism plus D-dimer (IMPROVE-DD) venous thromboembolism (VTE) scores increases appropriate inpatient and extended postdischarge thromboprophylaxis and improves outcomes in COVID-19 inpatients.

Methods

This post hoc analysis of the IMPROVE-DD cluster randomized trial evaluated thromboprophylaxis CDS among COVID-19 inpatients at 4 New York hospitals between December 21, 2020, and January 21, 2022. Hospitals were randomized 1:1 to CDS (intervention, n = 2) vs no CDS (usual care, n = 2). The primary outcome was rate of appropriate thromboprophylaxis. Secondary outcomes included rates of major thromboembolism, all-cause and VTE-related readmissions and death, major bleeding (MB), and all-cause mortality 30 days after discharge.

Results

Two thousand four hundred fifty-two COVID-19 inpatients were analyzed (CDS, 1355; no CDS, 1097). Mean age was 73.7 ± 9.37 years; 50.1% of participants were male. CDS adoption was 96.8% (intervention group). CDS was associated with increased appropriate at-discharge extended thromboprophylaxis (42.6% vs 28.8%; odds ratio [OR], 1.83; 95% CI, 1.39-2.41; P < .001). CDS was associated with reduced VTE (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.39-0.75; P < .001), arterial thromboembolism (OR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.01-0.81; P = .01), total thromboembolism (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.36-0.69; P < .001), and 30-day all-cause readmission/death (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62-0.99; P = .04). There were no differences in MB, VTE-related readmissions/death, or all-cause mortality.

Conclusion

Electronic health record-agnostic CDS incorporating IMPROVE-DD VTE scores had high adoption, was associated with increased appropriate at-discharge extended thromboprophylaxis, and reduced thromboembolism and all-cause readmission/death without increasing MB in COVID-19 inpatients.

### Extended thromboprophylaxis in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at time of discharge is not associated with improvement in quality of life [^298370e2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The long-term effects of COVID-19, known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), impair quality of life (QoL). This secondary analysis of the ACTIV-4c clinical trial evaluates the specific effects of extended thromboprophylaxis with apixaban on individual QoL domains, assessed by EQ-5D-5L index, in patients discharged after COVID-19 hospitalization.

Methods

ACTIV-4c study was a prospective randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. We enrolled 1,217 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at 107 U.S. hospitals between February 2021 and June 2022. Participants were randomized to apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily or placebo for 30 days post-discharge. QoL was assessed using EQ-5D-5L index at 2, 30, and 90 days post-discharge, evaluating five domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Data were analyzed using chi-square tests and proportional odds models adjusted for multiple variables.

Results

Of 1,217 participants, 610 received apixaban and 607 received placebo. By 2 days post-discharge, 43.5% of apixaban and 45.0% of placebo recipients reported moderate impairment in one or more EQ-5D-5L domains, particularly usual activities (33.0%). At 30 days, moderate impairment persisted in 30.8% of apixaban and 33.4% of placebo recipients, improving most in the usual activities domain (17.4%). At 90 days, 31.5% of apixaban and 28.5% of placebo recipients reported moderate impairment. Extended thromboprophylaxis with apixaban was not associated with significant improvements in any EQ-5D-5L domains at 30 or 90 days.

Conclusions

Extended thromboprophylaxis with apixaban after COVID-19 hospitalization does not improve QoL. The high prevalence of QoL impairment highlights the need for targeted interventions for PASC.

### Prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of VTE in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^965aacd6]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

CHEST guideline—acutely ill hospitalized COVID-19: In acutely ill hospitalized patients with COVID-19, we recommend current standard dose anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis over intermediate (LMWH BID or increased weight-based dosing) or full treatment dosing, per existing guidelines. Although there has been some concern for increased risk of VTE in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, there is insufficient data to justify increased intensity anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis in the absence of randomized controlled trials.

### Benefit-risk of rivaroxaban for extended thromboprophylaxis after hospitalization for medical illness: pooled analysis from MAGELLAN and MARINER [^f9eb59ce]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background Thromboprophylaxis extended after hospital discharge in medically ill patients currently is not recommended by practice guidelines because of uncertainty about the benefit for preventing major or fatal thromboembolic events, and the risk of bleeding. Methods and Results We assessed the benefit and risk of thromboprophylaxis with rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily extended for 25 to 45 days after hospitalization for preventing major thromboembolism in medically ill patients using the pooled data in 16 496 patients from 2 randomized trials, MARINER (Medically Ill Patient Assessment of Rivaroxaban Versus Placebo in Reducing Post-Discharge Venous Thrombo-Embolism Risk) and MAGELLAN (Multicenter, randomized, parallel-group efficacy and safety study for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in hospitalized medically ill patients comparing rivaroxaban with enoxaparin). The data from the MARINER trial were pooled with the data from the MAGELLAN trial in patients who were free of thrombotic or bleeding events up to the last dose of enoxaparin/placebo and who continued in the outpatient phase of thromboprophylaxis. The composite outcome of major thromboembolic events (symptomatic deep vein thrombosis, nonfatal pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and nonhemorrhagic stroke) and all-cause mortality was used to assess benefit and was compared with the risk of the composite of fatal and critical site bleeding. The incidence of the composite efficacy outcome was 1.80% (148 of 8222 patients) in the rivaroxaban group, compared with 2.31% (191 of 8274 patients in the placebo group) (HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.63-0.97], P =0.024). Fatal or critical site bleeding events were infrequent and occurred in <0.1% of patients in both groups (rivaroxaban 0.09%; placebo 0.04%; HR, 2.36; P =0.214). Conclusions The results suggest a benefit for reducing major thromboembolic outcomes (number needed to treat: 197), with a favorable trade-off to fatal or critical site bleeding (number needed to harm: 2045).

CHEST guideline—outpatient COVID-19 with proximal DVT/PE: For outpatient patients without drug–drug interactions, the panel states “we recommend apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban or edoxaban,” notes that “Initial parenteral anticoagulation is needed before dabigatran and edoxaban,” and for those not treated with a DOAC, “we suggest vitamin K antagonists over LMWH,” with the requirement that “Parenteral anticoagulation needs to be overlapped with vitamin K antagonists.”

### Benefit-risk of rivaroxaban for extended thromboprophylaxis after hospitalization for medical illness: pooled analysis from MAGELLAN and MARINER [^7f01bbb4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Pooled Analysis

The analyses using the pooled data were defined post hoc. To test the hypothesis that thromboprophylaxis given after hospital discharge using 10 mg of rivaroxaban once daily can reduce fatal and major thromboembolic outcomes without substantially increasing critical site or fatal bleeding, we pooled patient‐level data from the outpatient portion of the MAGELLAN trial (≈25 days of treatment) with the data from the MARINER trial (45 days of treatment). For the MAGELLAN trial, we included all patients who were alive and free from a thromboembolic or bleeding event up to the last dose of enoxaparin or matching placebo (ie, the in‐hospital phase), and who continued in the outpatient, placebo‐controlled phase of the trial. For the MARINER trial, we included all patients within the prerandomization stratum for a CrCl≥50 mL/min; these patients were randomized to receive 10 mg rivaroxaban once daily or placebo (Figure 1).We did not include patients within the stratum for a CrCl<50 mL/min, who were randomized to receive either 7.5 mg of rivaroxaban or placebo, because the 7.5‐mg dose was ineffectiveand is not licensed for clinical use for the primary prevention of venous thromboembolism.

MAGELLAN indicates Multicenter, randomized, parallel‐group efficacy and safety study for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in hospitalized medically ill patients comparing rivaroxaban with enoxaparin; and MARINER, Medically Ill Patient Assessment of Rivaroxaban Versus Placebo in Reducing Post‐Discharge Venous Thrombo‐Embolism Risk.

Efficacy outcomes for the pooled analyses included the composite of symptomatic deep‐vein thrombosis, nonfatal pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, nonhemorrhagic stroke, and all‐cause mortality. All‐cause mortality was also evaluated separately. Bleeding outcomes included fatal or critical site bleeding. There were no important adverse events other than bleeding.

The population for the pooled analysis was derived from the safety population for each study, which included all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication. For the efficacy analyses, the postdischarge period was defined as the period from 1 day after the last dose of enoxaparin (or matching placebo for subjects in rivaroxaban group) to Day 35 (+6) for patients in the MAGELLAN trial, and the period from randomization to Day 45 for patients in the MARINER trial.

### American Society of Hematology living guidelines on the use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19: July 2021 update on postdischarge thromboprophylaxis [^26337ca3]. Blood Advances (2022). High credibility.

American Society of Hematology living guidelines—postdischarge thromboprophylaxis for COVID-19: The panel judged both benefits and harms to be trivial in absolute terms, with very low certainty for a trivial mortality benefit and venous thromboembolism (VTE) reduction, and less uncertainty about increased major bleeding; overall, undesirable consequences outweighed desirable ones, so the panel suggests that postdischarge thromboprophylaxis not be used.
