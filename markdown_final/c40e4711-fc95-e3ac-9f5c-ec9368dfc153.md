## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a treatment algorithm for type 1 diabetes mellitus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and staging. Then, I should verify foundational principles of insulin therapy and dosing. Next, I will examine glucose monitoring and education. After that, I need to consider technology-enabled options like CGM, pumps, and automated insulin delivery. I will then review adjunctive therapies and special populations, followed by inpatient and hypoglycemia management. Finally, I should outline follow-up, reassessment, and how to individualize care, while double-checking areas where misclassification or outdated practices might mislead us.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and staging, because misclassification derails everything downstream. In adults with unclear diabetes type, I should not jump to conclusions; instead, I should consider a trial of noninsulin therapy and defer C-peptide testing until after more than 3 years of disease, while monitoring closely for deterioration that would prompt insulin initiation, and I should remember that DKA can occur in type 2 diabetes as well, so it is not pathognomonic for type 1 diabetes [^1167jJyE] [^1139QLA6]. Hold on, I should verify autoantibody testing indications: ADA recommends standardized islet autoantibodies when phenotypic features overlap with T1D, such as younger age at diagnosis, unintentional weight loss, ketoacidosis, or short time to insulin, and I should also consider presymptomatic staging where multiple autoantibodies confer escalating 5-year risks of symptomatic T1D, which guides surveillance and potential prevention strategies [^113K3tqa] [^113DKC3A].

> Next, I should review foundational insulin therapy principles, and I need to ensure I state this clearly: all patients with T1D require insulin, and physiologic basal–bolus regimens are standard of care to replace absent endogenous insulin and prevent DKA and catabolism, with insulin analogs preferred over human insulins to reduce hypoglycemia risk and improve pharmacokinetics [^115dH2RA] [^117Pbtp3]. Wait, let me verify dosing anchors: typical total daily insulin in metabolically stable adults is about 0.5 units/kg/day, roughly half basal and half prandial, with ranges from 0.4–1.0 units/kg/day depending on insulin sensitivity, activity, and illness, and I should remember that requirements rise during puberty, menses, and intercurrent illness [^1127sg8M].

> I will now examine glucose monitoring and education, because without these, even the best insulin regimen underperforms. CGM is recommended early for most adults with T1D to improve time in range and quality of life and reduce hypoglycemia, and if CGM is not available, structured SMBG with frequent checks is essential; education on carbohydrate counting, sick-day rules, and activity-based adjustments is mandatory and should be reinforced regularly [^115dH2RA] [^112KrFgn]. Hold on, I should verify that both real-time and intermittently scanned CGM are acceptable, with device choice individualized to patient preferences and circumstances, and I should confirm that structured education programs improve outcomes and are endorsed by endocrine guidelines [^112CmTAD] [^116LNaiy].

> Let me consider technology-enabled insulin delivery, and I need to be precise here. Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems are now the preferred modality for many adults with T1D who can use them, given improvements in time in range and reductions in hypoglycemia; if AID is not suitable, sensor-augmented pumps or MDI with CGM are reasonable alternatives, and I should ensure access and training are addressed up front [^1148rY5N] [^115dH2RA]. Wait, I should double-check the strength of evidence: meta-analyses of randomized trials show consistent gains in TIR and HbA1c with AID across 12–96 weeks, supporting early adoption when feasible [^115nWbom].

> But wait, what if glycemic targets remain unmet despite optimized basics? I should review adjunctive options carefully. Metformin may be considered in overweight or insulin-resistant adults with T1D, though evidence is modest and it does not replace insulin; pramlintide can blunt postprandial spikes but adherence and gastrointestinal effects limit use; SGLT2 inhibitors can improve glycemia and cardiorenal outcomes but carry a meaningful DKA risk in T1D, so if considered at all, they require strict ketone monitoring, patient selection, and insulin adjustments, and I should confirm that major guidelines still position them as investigational or exceptional in T1D [^115dH2RA] [^115dH2RA]. Hold on, I should verify that no adjunctive agent is approved to delay insulin in established T1D, so any off-label use must be framed as optional, risk-mitigated, and closely supervised [^113Fuftq].

> I need to ensure I cover special populations and contexts. In pregnancy, AID can be offered with experienced teams and assistive techniques, recognizing that pregnancy-specific targets and algorithms are not yet standardized; in chronic kidney disease, ACE inhibitors or ARBs are indicated with albuminuria to slow progression; in problematic hypoglycemia, a tiered approach starting with structured education, then adding CGM, then sensor-augmented pumps with low-glucose suspend, and finally considering islet or pancreas transplantation is evidence-informed; and in the hospital, initiate or intensify insulin for persistent hyperglycemia at or above 180 mg/dL, using validated order sets and a basal–bolus or correction-only approach tailored to severity and prior regimen [^115sq7VF] [^112qcMjF] [^116D1wAv] [^112rhL4X] [^1155mtfA]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought DKA treatment differed by diabetes type, but I should correct that: the acute management of DKA follows the same principles regardless of type, with fluids, electrolytes, and insulin as core therapy, even though the underlying pathophysiology differs [^1139QLA6].

> Next, I should review follow-up cadence and reassessment, and I need to ensure I align with high-quality guidance. Insulin regimens and overall diabetes care should be reassessed every 3–6 months, incorporating HbA1c, CGM metrics, hypoglycemia patterns, weight and blood pressure, cardiovascular risk, and patient-reported outcomes; therapy should be titrated proactively to overcome clinical inertia and adapted to life changes, comorbidities, and preferences [^115dH2RA] [^113CH1GZ]. I should confirm that continuous access to CGM, pumps, and AID is emphasized in payer policy discussions to avoid disruptions that worsen outcomes [^114JsuQw].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm while keeping the caveats visible. Start with confirmed or strongly suspected T1D based on phenotype and, when needed, autoantibodies; initiate physiologic basal–bolus insulin with analogs and pair with CGM or structured SMBG; provide comprehensive education on carb counting, sick days, and activity; escalate to AID if available and acceptable; add metformin or pramlintide selectively for residual hyperglycemia or weight issues; manage comorbidities and special situations per guideline-directed care; and reassess every 3–6 months, adjusting insulin, technology, and education to maintain individualized targets and minimize hypoglycemia [^115dH2RA] [^1148rY5N] [^112KrFgn]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with ADA/EASD consensus and AACE guidance on insulin analogs and CGM-first monitoring, which it does, while acknowledging that local access and patient factors will shape the exact sequence [^113SLi6X] [^1151QRQF].

> Finally, I should double-check key pitfalls and how to avoid them. Misclassification is common in adults; relying on age of diagnosis or self-report alone mislabels a substantial fraction, so I should integrate clinical course, autoantibodies, and C-peptide when the picture is murky and avoid prematurely excluding insulin in someone who might have T1D [^114fhajM] [^1167jJyE]. I also need to remember that while AID is preferred for many, outcomes depend on training, support, and shared decision-making, and that disparities in access and digital literacy must be addressed proactively to avoid widening outcome gaps [^1148rY5N] [^114JsuQw].

The treatment algorithm for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) centers on **insulin as lifelong therapy** [^115dH2RA] with physiologic basal–bolus regimens or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) [^112jAm3o], plus **continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)** [^112CmTAD] to optimize glycemic control and reduce hypoglycemia [^113RQNuE]. Education on carbohydrate counting, sick-day management, and hypoglycemia recognition is essential [^112KrFgn]; automated insulin delivery (AID) is recommended when available [^1148rY5N] [^115nWbom]. Adjuncts (metformin, pramlintide, SGLT inhibitors) are reserved for selected cases with caution [^115dH2RA]. Therapy is individualized and reassessed every 3–6 months [^115dH2RA] to meet A1C and time-in-range targets while minimizing hypoglycemia [^11384CfT].

---

## Core principles of T1DM management

- **Insulin therapy**: Lifelong insulin is mandatory [^115dH2RA] due to absolute insulin deficiency [^113Fuftq]; physiologic basal–bolus regimens or CSII are first-line [^112jAm3o].

- **Glucose monitoring**: CGM is preferred for most patients [^112CmTAD] to improve time-in-range and reduce hypoglycemia [^113RQNuE]; if CGM is unavailable, structured SMBG is used [^notfound].

- **Education**: Structured diabetes self-management education (DSME) [^114ApWJk] covering insulin dosing, carbohydrate counting, sick-day rules, and hypoglycemia management is essential [^112KrFgn].

- **Individualization**: Therapy is tailored to age, comorbidities, lifestyle, and patient preferences, with shared decision-making [^113CH1GZ].

---

## Initial assessment and baseline evaluation

At diagnosis, perform a **comprehensive assessment** that includes:

| **Assessment component** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| Clinical evaluation | - Age <br/> - BMI <br/> - Comorbidities <br/> - Medication use <br/> - Lifestyle factors [^notfound] |
| Laboratory tests | - A1C <br/> - Fasting glucose <br/> - C-peptide (if classification is uncertain) [^1167jJyE] <br/> - Autoantibodies (GAD65, IA-2, ZnT8) [^113K3tqa] |
| Education needs | - Assess knowledge <br/> - Numeracy <br/> - Health literacy <br/> - Psychosocial barriers [^notfound] |

## Insulin therapy algorithms

### Basal-bolus multiple daily injections (MDI)

- **Basal insulin**: Long-acting analogs (glargine, detemir, degludec) provide stable background insulin [^115iUaZp].

- **Prandial insulin**: Rapid-acting analogs (aspart, lispro, glulisine, afrezza) cover mealtime glucose excursions [^115iUaZp].

- **Dosing**: Typical total daily insulin (TDI) is 0.4–1.0 units/kg/day; ~50% basal, ~50% prandial, adjusted to metabolic needs [^1127sg8M].

---

### Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII)

CSII is indicated for patients with **poor control on MDI**, frequent hypoglycemia, dawn phenomenon, or high glycemic variability [^115iUaZp]. It offers flexible, precise dosing and can improve A1C and reduce hypoglycemia when combined with CGM [^115iUaZp].

---

### Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems

AID systems integrate CGM and insulin pumps with algorithms to adjust insulin automatically [^115nWbom]. They are **recommended for most adults with T1DM** to improve time-in-range and reduce hypoglycemia [^1148rY5N].

---

## Glucose monitoring strategies

- **Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)**: Preferred for most patients; improves time-in-range, reduces hypoglycemia, and enables data-driven adjustments [^112CmTAD] [^113RQNuE].

- **Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)**: Use when CGM is unavailable or as adjunct; structured SMBG (e.g. before meals, bedtime, occasional 2-hour postprandial) supports dosing decisions [^notfound].

- **Time-in-range (TIR)**: Target TIR 70–180 mg/dL ≥ 70% for most adults; individualize based on comorbidities and hypoglycemia risk [^notfound].

---

## Patient education and self-management

Structured education should include **carbohydrate counting** to match insulin to intake [^112KrFgn]; hypoglycemia recognition and treatment; sick-day management with sick-day rules and ketone monitoring; and physical activity adjustments, including insulin and dietary modifications. Ongoing support with regular follow-up and access to diabetes educators and mental health resources is essential [^116LNaiy].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

Adjuncts are **not first-line** and require careful selection:

- **Metformin**: Consider in overweight/obese patients with insulin resistance to reduce insulin dose and weight [^notfound].

- **Pramlintide**: May reduce postprandial spikes and aid weight loss; requires additional injections and hypoglycemia monitoring [^notfound].

- **SGLT inhibitors**: Potential benefits for cardio-renal outcomes but increased DKA risk; use cautiously with education and ketone monitoring [^114azKvH].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Children and adolescents**: Emphasize family involvement, growth monitoring, and school-based care; AID is appropriate in many cases [^111LxyXf].

- **Pregnancy**: Intensive insulin therapy, CGM, and multidisciplinary care are essential; AID may be considered with experienced teams [^115sq7VF].

- **Elderly**: Individualize targets to reduce hypoglycemia risk; simplify regimens when possible [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up every 3–6 months should assess **A1C, CGM data, hypoglycemia, weight, blood pressure, and lipid profiles** [^115dH2RA]. Therapy is adjusted to maintain individualized A1C and TIR targets while minimizing hypoglycemia [^11384CfT].

---

## Emerging technologies and future directions

- **Artificial intelligence**: Decision support systems may optimize insulin dosing and improve outcomes [^1129cogS].

- **Closed-loop systems**: Advances in fully automated systems aim to further reduce burden and improve glycemic control [^115nWbom].

- **Beta-cell replacement**: Islet transplantation and stem cell therapies are under investigation for select patients [^116D1wAv].

---

The T1DM treatment algorithm is a **dynamic, evidence-based framework** centered on insulin therapy, CGM, and education, with individualized adjustments and emerging technologies to optimize outcomes [^115dH2RA].

FIGURE 1
Algorithm for diagnosing Type 1 diabetes in adults.

Despite advances in tools for clarifying aetiology, there may be yet unidentified forms of diabetes that can be very challenging to classify in a simple algorithm. However, outside of specific forms of sulphonylurea‐sensitive monogenic diabetes, glycaemic treatment requirements are largely driven by the degree of insulin deficiency, rather than underlying disease aetiology. Therefore, most patients can be pragmatically and safely managed based on their endogenous insulin production, that is, C‐peptide levels, even if disease aetiology remains unclear.

### Comparison of several survey-based algorithms to ascertain type 1 diabetes among US adults with self-reported diabetes [^1153mKfY]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Algorithms for type 1 diabetes

We selected five primary and two supplementary algorithms for type 1 diabetes using various combinations of self-reported diabetes type, age of diagnosis, current and continuous insulin use, and use of oral hypoglycemics. Continuous insulin use was defined as reporting all three of the following: (1) current insulin use, (2) starting insulin within 1 year of diagnosis, and (3) not stopping insulin for more than 6 months except during the first year after diagnosis. The third criterion was added because of the honeymoon period, in which some individuals with type 1 diabetes go into apparent remission after starting insulin but later need insulin for the rest of their lives.

Table 1
Algorithm definitions for type 1 diabetes, NHIS 2016–2017

Table 1 illustrates the criteria used in each survey-based algorithm. Algorithms were chosen based on their use in previous publications. Algorithm 1 includes continuous insulin use only. Algorithm 2 starts with algorithm 1 and additionally requires that diabetes was diagnosed at age < 30. Algorithm 2 has been used in epidemiologic and some clinical researchbecause historically it had been thought that type 1 diabetes only occurs during youth. Algorithm 3 is a variant of algorithm 2 that increases the age of diagnosis to < 40 years, which intends to include more people with type 1 diabetes but may also incorrectly capture more with type 2 diabetes. Algorithms 4 and 5 use self-reported diabetes type and insulin use. Algorithm 4, using continuous insulin use, is more specific to type 1 diabetes. Algorithm 5, using current insulin use, has been used in recent publications. Algorithms 6 and 7 were included in online supplemental material for comparison purposes. Supplementary algorithm 6 includes self-reported type 1 diabetes as the only criterion. However, as insulin is an essential treatment for type 1 diabetes, excluding insulin as a criterion will miss persons with type 1 diabetes. Supplementary algorithm 7 defines type 1 diabetes as diagnosis at age < 30, current insulin use, and not using oral hypoglycemics. The latter criterion has been used in analyses of NHIS and NHANES databecause oral hypoglycemics were historically only taken by persons with type 2 diabetes; it is included in online supplemental material because oral hypoglycemics are increasingly used with insulin to treat type 1 diabetes.

In presenting the percentages of type 1 diabetes among those with diagnosed diabetes, and the distribution of characteristics among those classified as having type 1 diabetes, we generally focus the Results section on comparisons between algorithms that are similar — except for changing one or two criteria — to more clearly show changes in percentages.

### Type 1 diabetes prevention: a goal dependent on accepting a diagnosis of an asymptomatic disease [^111dtPgN]. Diabetes (2016). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes, a disease defined by absolute insulin deficiency, is considered a chronic autoimmune disorder resulting from the destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells. The incidence of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes has been increasing at a rate of 3%-5% per year globally. Despite the introduction of an impressive array of therapies aimed at improving disease management, no means for a practical "cure" exist. This said, hope remains high that any of a number of emerging technologies (e.g., continuous glucose monitoring, insulin pumps, smart algorithms), alongside advances in stem cell biology, cell encapsulation methodologies, and immunotherapy, will eventually impact the lives of those with recently diagnosed or established type 1 diabetes. However, efforts aimed at reversing insulin dependence do not address the obvious benefits of disease prevention. Hence, key "stretch goals" for type 1 diabetes research include identifying improved and increasingly practical means for diagnosing the disease at earlier stages in its natural history (i.e., early, presymptomatic diagnosis), undertaking such efforts in the population at large to optimally identify those with presymptomatic type 1 diabetes, and introducing safe and effective therapeutic options for prevention.

### Treatment of type 1 diabetes: synopsis of the 2017 American diabetes association standards of medical care in diabetes [^111bvBvR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) annually updates Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes to provide clinicians, patients, researchers, payers, and other interested parties with evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with diabetes.

Methods

For the 2017 Standards of Care, the ADA Professional Practice Committee did MEDLINE searches from 1 January 2016 to November 2016 to add, clarify, or revise recommendations on the basis of new evidence. The committee rated the recommendations as A, B, or C, depending on the quality of evidence, or E for expert consensus or clinical experience. The Standards of Care were reviewed and approved by the Executive Committee of the ADA Board of Directors, which includes health care professionals, scientists, and laypersons. Feedback from the larger clinical community informed revisions.

Recommendation

This synopsis focuses on recommendations from the 2017 Standards of Care about monitoring and pharmacologic approaches to glycemic management for type 1 diabetes.

### Evidence-informed clinical practice recommendations for treatment of type 1 diabetes complicated by problematic hypoglycemia [^116D1wAv]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Problematic hypoglycemia, defined as two or more episodes per year of severe hypoglycemia or as one episode associated with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia, extreme glycemic lability, or major fear and maladaptive behavior, is a challenge, especially for patients with long-standing type 1 diabetes. Individualized therapy for such patients should include a composite target: optimal glucose control without problematic hypoglycemia. Therefore, we propose a tiered, four-stage algorithm based on evidence of efficacy given the limitations of educational, technological, and transplant interventions. All patients with problematic hypoglycemia should undergo structured or hypoglycemia-specific education programs (stage 1). Glycemic and hypoglycemia treatment targets should be individualized and reassessed every 3–6 months. If targets are not met, one diabetes technology-continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion or continuous glucose monitoring-should be added (stage 2). For patients with continued problematic hypoglycemia despite education (stage 1) and one diabetes technology (stage 2), sensor-augmented insulin pumps preferably with an automated low-glucose suspend feature and/or very frequent contact with a specialized hypoglycemia service can reduce hypoglycemia (stage 3). For patients whose problematic hypoglycemia persists, islet or pancreas transplant should be considered (stage 4). This algorithm provides an evidence-informed approach to resolving problematic hypoglycemia; it should be used as a guide, with individual patient circumstances directing suitability and acceptability to ensure the prudent use of technology and scarce transplant resources. Standardized reporting of hypoglycemia outcomes and inclusion of patients with problematic hypoglycemia in studies of new interventions may help to guide future therapeutic strategies.

4 CLOSING

Adult‐onset T1D accounts for the majority of newly diagnosed T1D cases each year; however, knowledge gaps exist regarding the diagnosis, classification, treatment and natural history of adult‐onset T1D. Compared to children, adults presenting with T1D have different genetic risk, immunologic profiles and metabolic outcomes, yet different diagnostic criteria or treatment plans based upon age at diagnosis have not been developed, highlighting several key questions for the field: (1) should age be treated as a continuous variable for T1D in biological studies, classification and treatment?; (2) is it feasible and preferable to develop different guidelines for T1D diagnosis and treatment for children versus adults?; (3) do the newly defined stages of pre‐clinical T1D apply equally to children and adults? and (4) would adult‐specific standards for T1D diagnosis decrease misclassification of diabetes subtype?

Table 2 and Figure 1 summarise the knowledge gaps and opportunities to increase our understanding of adult‐onset T1D. A better understanding of the clinical features and natural history of adult‐onset T1D will reduce the burden of misdiagnosis and could lead to optimised population‐based screening in this underrecognised population.

Conclusions

There are many insulin treatment options and delivery methods for persons with T1DM, including new insulin formulations and hybrid closed-loop systems. A suggested treatment algorithm for T1DM is summarized in Fig. 1. Although CSII is recommended over MDI in adult patients with T1DM as it can improve glycemic control and the risk of hypoglycemia, due to cost and availability issues, the most used insulin regimen in the treatment of T1DM is MDI, especially in low-income countries. If glycemic targets are not achieved, or if there is high glycemic variability, frequent hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia unawareness, or pronounced dawn phenomenon, CSII is recommended. CGM is recommended for patients who can commit to its daily use regardless of whether they are receiving MDI or CSII. People with T1DM in general should use basal insulin analogues to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain and because basal insulin analogues generally exhibit better efficacy than NPH insulin. Second-generation basal insulin analogues (Gla-300 and degludec) provide similar glycemic control and a lower risk of hypoglycemia (mainly nocturnal) and glycemic variability compared with first-generation basal insulin analogues (Gla-100 and detemir), and thus their use may be also recommended in patients with increased risk of hypoglycemia. Some cases require twice-daily dosing of the basal analogues, which is more frequently seen with detemir than with other basal insulin analogues.

All patients with T1DM require bolus insulins for prandial glycemic control. Patients should be educated on how to match prandial insulin dose to carbohydrate intake, premeal blood glucose, anticipated activity, and flexible insulin dosing. The rapid-acting prandial insulins show generally comparable efficacy with each other and equivalent or better efficacy and lower hypoglycemia risk than short-acting regular human insulin, with the faster-acting aspart offering additional benefits versus aspart.

Special considerations/patients

In the setting of severely uncontrolled diabetes with catabolism, defined as fasting plasma glucose levels > 13.9 mmol/l (250 mg/dl), random glucose levels consistently above 16.7 mmol/l (300 mg/dl), A1C above 10%, or the presence of ketonuria, or as symptomatic diabetes with polyuria, polydipsia and weight loss, insulin therapy in combination with lifestyle intervention is the treatment of choice. Some patients with these characteristics will have unrecognized type 1 diabetes; others will have type 2 diabetes with severe insulin deficiency. Insulin can be titrated rapidly and is associated with the greatest likelihood of returning glucose levels rapidly to target levels. After symptoms are relieved and glucose levels decreased, oral agents can often be added and it may be possible to withdraw insulin, if preferred.

Type 1 diabetes natural history and progression risk indicate that stage 1, defined by the presence of two or more autoantibodies and normoglycemia, carries a 5-year risk of developing symptomatic type 1 diabetes of ~44%. In stage 2, risk is ~60% by 2 years and ~75% within 5 years of developing a clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. A consensus group provides expert recommendations on what should be monitored and how often these factors should be monitored in individuals with presymptomatic type 1 diabetes.

### Current issues in GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy for type 2 diabetes [^114M64od]. Endocrine Practice (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is guided not only by published treatment algorithms, but also by consideration of recent evidence and through consultation with colleagues and experts. Recent studies have dramatically increased the amount of information regarding the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). Topics that may be of particular interest to clinicians who treat T2DM patients include relative glycemic control efficacy of GLP-1 RAs, use of GLP-1 RAs across T2DM progression and in combination with insulin, recent data regarding GLP-1 RA safety, nonglycemic actions of GLP-1 RAs, including weight effects, and impact of GLP-1 RAs on patient quality of life and treatment satisfaction. The following review includes expert consideration of these topics with emphasis on recent, relevant reports to illustrate current perspectives.

Pharmacologic therapy for adults with type 1 diabetes — recommendations as printed: Treat most adults with type 1 diabetes with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion or multiple daily doses of prandial (injected or inhaled) and basal insulin. A For most adults with type 1 diabetes, insulin analogs (or inhaled insulin) are preferred over injectable human insulins to minimize hypoglycemia risk. A Early use of continuous glucose monitoring is recommended for adults with type 1 diabetes to improve glycemic outcomes and quality of life and to minimize hypoglycemia. B Automated insulin delivery systems should be offered to all adults with type 1 diabetes. A To improve glycemic outcomes and quality of life and to minimize hypoglycemia risk, most adults with type 1 diabetes should receive education on how to match mealtime insulin doses to carbohydrate intake and fat and protein intake. They should also be taught how to modify the insulin dose (correction dose) based on concurrent glycemia, glycemic trends (if available), sick-day management, and anticipated physical activity. B Insulin treatment plan and insulin-taking behavior should be reevaluated at regular intervals (e.g., every 3–6 months) and adjusted to incorporate specific factors that impact choice of treatment and ensure achievement of individualized glycemic goals.

### Heterogeneity and endotypes in type 1 diabetes mellitus [^112PVPss]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Despite major advances over the past decade, prevention and treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) remain suboptimal, with large and unexplained variations in individual responses to interventions. The current classification schema for diabetes mellitus does not capture the complexity of this disease or guide clinical management effectively. One of the approaches to achieve the goal of applying precision medicine in diabetes mellitus is to identify endotypes (that is, well-defined subtypes) of the disease each of which has a distinct aetiopathogenesis that might be amenable to specific interventions. Here, we describe epidemiological, clinical, genetic, immunological, histological and metabolic differences within T1DM that, together, suggest heterogeneity in its aetiology and pathogenesis. We then present the emerging endotypes and their impact on T1DM prediction, prevention and treatment.

### Comparison of several survey-based algorithms to ascertain type 1 diabetes among US adults with self-reported diabetes [^116uPM1G]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) estimates that the percentage of type 1 diabetes among those with diabetes ranges from 5% to 10%. The percentages estimated in this analysis generally fell close to the ADA estimates, ranging from 3.3% to 10.5%. When comparing algorithm 2 (diagnosed < 30 and continuous insulin use) and algorithm 4 (self-reported type 1 diabetes and continuous insulin use), the percentage with type 1 diabetes was similar overall, and similar for normal weight, and for those taking oral hypoglycemics. Since smaller, non-representative type 1 diabetes populations vary depending on age, duration of type 1 diabetes, and glucose control there is no benchmark for BMI and oral hypoglycemic use in type 1 diabetes; however, these attributes align with the expectation that those with type 1 diabetes have lower levels of obesity and lower frequency of using oral hypoglycemics compared with those with type 2 diabetes. While self-reported type 1 diabetes and current insulin use (algorithm 5) have been used previouslyand percentages for mean BMI and oral hypoglycemic use were similar to algorithms 2 and 4, information on continuous rather than current insulin use is preferred since persons with type 1 diabetes require insulin for the duration of their disease.

### Diagnosing type 1 diabetes in adults: guidance from the UK T1D immunotherapy consortium [^115pSGkv]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

1 WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?

The differential diagnosis of type 1 (T1D) versus type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains challenging. However, recent advances in diabetes management are increasing the importance of accurate diagnosis. In T2D, the last decade has brought new therapeutics working on the GLP‐1 or SGLT‐2 pathways that delay or replace insulin therapy, as well as an increasing focus on initiating very low‐calorie diets soon after diagnosis to induce remission. In T1D, advanced insulin replacement technology and continuous glucose monitoring are becoming the standard of care. In addition, immunotherapy may soon be introduced to preserve beta‐cell function but needs to be initiated early in the disease process for maximal effect. Hence, although a 'blind' insulin start is acceptable in severe presentations, early distinction of T1D from T2D is required to guide optimal therapy.

### Comparison of several survey-based algorithms to ascertain type 1 diabetes among US adults with self-reported diabetes [^114fhajM]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Using age of diagnosis to classify type 1 diabetes is problematic as approximately 40% of people with type 1 diabetes are diagnosed between ages 31 and 60. Recent analysis of the 2016 NHIS estimated the prevalence of type 1 diabetes in the general population of adults aged ≥ 18 to be 0.55%, defining type 1 diabetes as current insulin use and self-reported type 1 diabetes. However, current insulin use is not exclusive to those with type 1 diabetes; many adults with type 2 diabetes take insulin. Therefore, this algorithm may result in misclassification. Except for an initial period of generally several months after diagnosis, continuous use of insulin is essential in people with type 1 diabetes. Adults with type 1 diabetes are sometimes misdiagnosed during the initial period as having type 2 diabetes. Additionally, respondents do not always interpret these survey questions as they are intended. Also, previous research found that people with type 1 diabetes are more often normal weight and less likely to use oral hypoglycemics than those with type 2 diabetes.

Given the various definitions used to classify type 1 diabetes using survey data and the lack of a gold standard, we examined the percentages of adults with diagnosed diabetes classified as having type 1 diabetes in the NHIS, using five primary and two supplementary algorithms, included for comparison purposes. We describe the percentage of type 1 diabetes and the sociodemographic and diabetes-specific characteristics of adults classified by each algorithm. Finally, we discuss the shortfalls and adequacy of each algorithm.

### A perspective on treating type 1 diabetes mellitus before insulin is needed [^112jXbSZ]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a progressive autoimmune disease that starts long before a clinical diagnosis is made. The American Diabetes Association recognizes three stages: stage 1 (normoglycaemic and positive for autoantibodies to β-cell antigens); stage 2 (asymptomatic with dysglycaemia); and stage 3, which is defined by glucose levels consistent with the definition of diabetes mellitus. This Perspective focuses on the management of the proportion of individuals with early stage 3 T1DM who do not immediately require insulin; a stage we propose should be termed stage 3a. To date, this period of non-insulin-dependent T1DM has been largely unrecognized. Importantly, it represents a window of opportunity for intervention, as remaining at this stage might delay the need for insulin by months or years. Extending the insulin-free period and/or avoiding unnecessary insulin therapy are important goals, as there is no risk of hypoglycaemia during this period and the adherence burden on patients of glycaemic monitoring and daily adjustments for diet and exercise is substantially reduced. Recognizing the pressing need for guidance on adequate management of children and adults with stage 3a T1DM, we present our perspective on the subject, which needs to be tested in formal and adequately powered clinical trials.

### Evaluation of an algorithm to guide patients with type 1 diabetes treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion on how to respond to real-time continuous glucose levels: a randomized controlled trial [^115fB3F6]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

To evaluate an algorithm guiding responses of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII)–treated type 1 diabetic patients using real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Sixty CSII-treated type 1 diabetic participants (aged 13–70 years, including adult and adolescent subgroups, with A1C ≤ 9.5%) were randomized in age-, sex-, and A1C-matched pairs. Phase 1 was an open 16-week multicenter randomized controlled trial. Group A was treated with CSII/RT-CGM with the algorithm, and group B was treated with CSII/RT-CGM without the algorithm. The primary outcome was the difference in time in target (4–10 mmol/l) glucose range on 6-day masked CGM. Secondary outcomes were differences in A1C, low (≤ 3.9 mmol/l) glucose CGM time, and glycemic variability. Phase 2 was the week 16–32 follow-up. Group A was returned to usual care, and group B was provided with the algorithm. Glycemia parameters were as above. Comparisons were made between baseline and 16 weeks and 32 weeks.

RESULTS

In phase 1, after withdrawals 29 of 30 subjects were left in group A and 28 of 30 subjects were left in group B. The change in target glucose time did not differ between groups. A1C fell (mean 7.9% [95% CI 7.7–8.2to 7.6% [7.2–8.0]; P < 0.03) in group A but not in group B (7.8% [7.5–8.1] to 7.7 [7.3–8.0]; NS) with no difference between groups. More subjects in group A achieved A1C ≤ 7% than those in group B (2 of 29 to 14 of 29 vs. 4 of 28 to 7 of 28; P = 0.015). In phase 2, one participant was lost from each group. In group A, A1C returned to baseline with RT-CGM discontinuation but did not change in group B, who continued RT-CGM with addition of the algorithm.

CONCLUSIONS

Early but not late algorithm provision to type 1 diabetic patients using CSII/RT-CGM did not increase the target glucose time but increased achievement of A1C ≤ 7%. Upon RT-CGM cessation, A1C returned to baseline.

### Envisioning tools to help classify type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes in new-onset adult diabetes [^116aC5TM]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2025). Medium credibility.

A tool is needed to distinguish type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in adults with new-onset diabetes because correct classification is needed for correct diagnoses and treatments. Current classification methods are usually applied to biomarkers using binary or quantitative classification with a cut point and may not be adequately nuanced. Combinations of clinical features are not necessarily specific for classifying and may not always indicate a single diagnosis. A probabilistic decision tree classification tool with multiple branches per decision node is needed for adults with new-onset diabetes to avoid misdiagnosis of actual T1D as T2D, misdiagnosis of actual T2D or monogenic diabetes as T1D, and misclassified patients in future population health studies which will lead to incorrect conclusions and suboptimal patient outcomes.

### An artificial intelligence decision support system for the management of type 1 diabetes [^1129cogS]. Nature Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by pancreatic beta cell dysfunction and insulin depletion. Over 40% of people with T1D manage their glucose through multiple injections of long-acting basal and short-acting bolus insulin, so-called multiple daily injections (MDI) 1,2. Errors in dosing can lead to life-threatening hypoglycaemia events (< 70 mg/dL) and hyperglycaemia (> 180 mg/dL), increasing the risk of retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. Machine learning (artificial intelligence) approaches are being harnessed to incorporate decision support into many medical specialties. Here, we report an algorithm that provides weekly insulin dosage recommendations to adults with T1D using MDI therapy. We employ a unique virtual platform 3 to generate over 50,000 glucose observations to train a k-nearest neighbours 4 decision support system (KNN-DSS) to identify causes of hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia and determine necessary insulin adjustments from a set of 12 potential recommendations. The KNN-DSS algorithm achieves an overall agreement with board-certified endocrinologists of 67.9% when validated on real-world human data, and delivers safe recommendations, per endocrinologist review. A comparison of inter-physician-recommended adjustments to insulin pump therapy indicates full agreement of 41.2% among endocrinologists, which is consistent with previous measures of inter-physician agreement (41–45%) 5. In silico 3,6 benchmarking using a platform accepted by the United States Food and Drug Administration for evaluation of artificial pancreas technologies indicates substantial improvement in glycaemic outcomes after 12 weeks of KNN-DSS use. Our data indicate that the KNN-DSS allows for early identification of dangerous insulin regimens and may be used to improve glycaemic outcomes and prevent life-threatening complications in people with T1D.

It appears that the road is now open for the incorporation of SGLT2is into the treatment algorithm of T1D, based on the high burden of cardio-renal-metabolic co-morbidities in this population, as well as the documented beneficial effects of this class across the cardio-metabolic continuum. However, we definitely need dedicated RCTs assessing surrogate morbidity and mortality endpoints; of note, there are ongoing studies [for example, the Sotagliflozin in Patients With Heart Failure Symptoms and Type 1 Diabetes (SOPHIST) trial (NCT064351560) and the Sotagliflozin to Slow Kidney Function Decline in Persons With Type 1 Diabetes and Diabetic Kidney Disease (SUGARNSALT) trial (NCT06217302)] in the field, with results being highly anticipated.

### Classification of hypoglycemic events in type 1 diabetes using machine learning algorithms [^114ADbiz]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

The results of the initial training of the algorithm indicate that the method developed in this study generalizes well to unseen data given the fact the initial validation was only conducted with 'unknown' patients. From a performance perspective, this strategy is a rather conservative approach, since the model is only evaluated based on its ability to classify new patients correctly. In real-world use, we would have a mix of known and unknown patients, as included in our 'benchmark' test. However, a broader test cohort is required to ensure model robustness and reliability in other patient populations in which the treatment regimens can differ.

### Evaluating treatment algorithms for the management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a perspective on the definition of treatment success [^111BoDgp]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Traditional treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has focused on correcting hyperglycemia. However, T2DM is often accompanied by other conditions and risk factors, including hypertension, overweight/obesity, and dyslipidemia, that affect morbidity and mortality. A broader view toward treating the array of physiologic derangements may provide significant long-term outcomes benefits.

Objective

This perspective paper reviews recent data regarding the pathophysiology of T2DM, evaluates current treatment recommendations/algorithms, and discusses potential risks and benefits associated with the various therapeutic options and their combinations.

Methods

Information was obtained by a search of the PubMed and Embase databases using the key words type 2 diabetes mellitus, glycosylated hemoglobin, pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes, glycemic control, antidiabetes therapy, multifactorial therapy, and treatment algorithms for the period of 1985 to 2010. A representative number of relevant articles dealing with these topics was then selected for review.

Results

Three recently proposed treatment algorithms, the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes less well-validated algorithm, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology algorithm, and the DeFronzo algorithm, were compared and contrasted. Metformin is usually the first oral agent to be used when not contraindicated because of its ability to suppress hepatic glucose production. Some recommended agents, such as sulfonylureas, drive β-cell failure even as they improve glycosylated hemoglobin. Others, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and thiazolidinediones, support and enhance β-cell function. Also, some agents predispose to weight gain (eg, sulfonylureas and insulin), whereas others are weight neutral (eg, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors) or result in weight loss (eg, GLP-1 receptor agonists, pramlintide). Finally, the impact of these agents on associated cardiovascular risk factors is varied. Agents that improve glycemic control while favorably affecting blood lipid levels and/or systemic blood pressure may lead to improvements in morbidity and mortality. Attention to the mechanisms of action and associated consequences of the numerous pharmacologic treatment choices may provide clinicians a better selection of agents in treating patients with T2DM.

Conclusions

Physicians should evaluate the array of treatment options available for patients with T2DM. An aggressive regimen including metformin, a thiazolidinedione, and a GLP-1 receptor agonist may improve insulin sensitivity and enhance β-cell function. Addressing the pathophysiologic defects associated with T2DM, as well as the various associated cardiovascular risk factors, with combination therapy may slow the natural progression of the disease and development of its associated complications.

### Comparison of several survey-based algorithms to ascertain type 1 diabetes among US adults with self-reported diabetes [^112AzJpJ]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Among persons who self-reported type 1 diabetes alone (supplementary algorithm 6), about one-third reported taking oral hypoglycemics and no insulin and approximately one-third reported continuous insulin use, the hallmark of type 1 diabetes. This demonstrates that self-report alone is an unreliable method to classify diabetes type. However, adding the criterion of continuous insulin use to self-report of type 1 may reduce misclassification. Among those classified using algorithm 5 (self-reported type 1 diabetes and current insulin use), only two-thirds reported continuous insulin use indicating this algorithm may include a high percentage of individuals with type 2 diabetes.

More recently, oral hypoglycemics are used along with insulin to improve control in type 1 diabetes, but they are used much less frequently than insulin alone. Using supplementary algorithm 7 (diagnosis at age < 30, current insulin use, and not using oral hypoglycemics), nearly a third of adults did not report continuous insulin use suggesting that it includes many people with type 2 diabetes. For algorithms 2 and 4, the percentage using oral hypoglycemics was 16.1% and 11.1%, respectively. Data from the Type 1 Diabetes Exchange Network found that 6% age ≥ 26 were taking metformin. Use of non-insulin hypoglycemic medication was 3.1% in the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study and 2.4% in the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications Study (C Cowie and T Orchard, personal communication). Thus, using oral hypoglycemics as an exclusion criterion for type 1 diabetes may result in misclassification.

Discussion

The results from this analysis demonstrate the variability in the percentage of adults classified as having type 1 diabetes, as well as the distribution of sociodemographic and diabetes-specific characteristics by algorithms used in survey research. The lack of biomarkers or medical records to confirm diabetes type limits our ability to compare the algorithms to a gold standard. The information presented here illustrates the pros and cons of each algorithm allowing researchers to select an algorithm suited to their research.

Using algorithm 1, continuous insulin use alone, two-thirds of people with type 1 diabetes were diagnosed at age ≥ 30 and 54% diagnosed at ages 30–59. This may include some people with type 2 diabetes who are generally diagnosed later in life. However, previous work suggests that 40% of people with type 1 diabetes are diagnosed between ages 31 and 60.

Over time, type 1 diabetes has been diagnosed later in life and type 2 diabetes at younger ages, indicating that age of diagnosis as a criterion (algorithms 2 and 3) may not be an essential part of algorithms. Nonetheless, our analyses showed that larger percentages of individuals classified as having type 1 diabetes using algorithms with age of diagnosis cut-points and continuous insulin use self-reported type 1 diabetes, were of normal weight, and were not using oral hypoglycemics as compared with those classified by continuous insulin use alone. The age restriction likely removes some people with type 2 diabetes, while excluding later onset type 1 diabetes. For researchers studying younger adults, the use of age cut-points and continuous insulin use may be appropriate.

It is important to highlight that this national study defined continuous insulin use as using insulin within 1 year of diagnosis and not stopping thereafter (with the exception of stopping for > 6 months within the first year of diagnosis) as compared with a historical definition of continuous insulin use from the time of diagnosis. Since adults with type 1 diabetes may experience a honeymoon period after diagnosis and initial treatment of near normal glucose levels without taking insulin, the historical definition of continuous insulin use would have excluded some adults with type 1 diabetes.

The consensus algorithm for the medical management of type 2 diabetes was published in August 2006 with the expectation that it would be updated, based on the availability of new interventions and new evidence to establish their clinical role. The authors continue to endorse the principles used to develop the algorithm and its major features. We are sensitive to the risks of changing the algorithm cavalierly or too frequently, without compelling new information. An update to the consensus algorithm published in January 2008 specifically addressed safety issues surrounding the thiazolidinediones. In this revision, we focus on the new classes of medications that now have more clinical data and experience.

Glucose-centric algorithm for glycemic control (persons without established or high ASCVD/HF/stroke/TIA/CKD risk) — initial therapy and escalation: Metformin should be initiated if there is no contraindication (eg, eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) and started at a low dose titrated over a few weeks to the maximally tolerated dose. Given T2D progression, many will need a second antihyperglycemic medication to reach targets, which usually occurs within 3 months. Agents such as GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i are associated with low risk of hypoglycemia unless combined with insulin or sulfonylureas. Patients often present with > 1 treatment-shaping factor; in those with overweight/obesity and a weight-loss goal, oral GLP-1 RA, GLP-1 RA, or SGLT2i are preferred options. For cost/access constraints, a TZD, SU, or glinide would be more economical. Patients with symptomatic hyperglycemia and/or an A1C > 10% should start basal insulin; basal can be initiated with or without a GLP-1 RA, and some may need simultaneous bolus insulin.

Decision support

Despite advances in diabetes technologies, for many living with type 1 diabetes, achievement of glycemic targets remains elusive. Some of this may be due to an insufficient number of providers who can guide diabetes management and the frequency with which follow-up is often scheduled. To address this gap and streamline the process of integrating data to optimize insulin doses, decision support systems have been developed in recent years. We identified only two relevant articles reporting primary analysis results of multicenter RCTs on decision support systems (Table 2). One of the trials was industry-sponsored. These studies randomized 80 and 122 individuals, respectively, and included both adult and pediatric participants. Bisio et al. studied a CGM-based decision support system, including real-time dosing advice and retrospective therapy optimization in individuals with type 1 diabetes using MDI over 3 months. Nimri et al. evaluated an automated artificial intelligence-based decision support system in participants with type 1 diabetes using insulin pump therapy and CGM over 6 months. The primary outcome was CGM-based TIR for both studies. While Bisio et al. failed to show a significant difference in TIR (or HbA1c, analyzed as a secondary outcome), Nimri et al. demonstrated that TIR in those using the decision support system was not inferior to intensive insulin titration provided by physicians. Although Nimri et al. also reported statistically significant improvement in HbA1c from baseline to the end of the study in those randomized to the decision support system, there was no between-group difference in HbA1c between the study arms. Information on sequence generation, allocation concealment, and blinding of outcome assessment were not reported by either of the articles. Both study personnel and participants were aware of the treatment groups. Both articles had complete data and minimal bias for selective reporting. (GRADE Evidence: Level B).

### Validation of an algorithm for the prediction of diabetic retinopathy in type 1 diabetic patients in a Spanish population [^111E4SYb]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a global disease whose incidence is increasing rapidly. In Europe alone, 59 million people are affected (2019 data) by Type 1 (T1DM) and Type 2 (T2DM) diabetes mellitus, a number that is predicted to rise by 15% to 68 million by 2045. These diseases bring their own complications, such as microangiopathy, of which diabetic retinopathy (DR), an ocular manifestation, is the most frequent cause of poor vision and blindness for these patients. Science associations recommend that ophthalmology units, with the support of general practitioners, endocrinologists, and paediatricians, carry out regular screening of the retina at various frequencies depending on the risk of progression to DR.

Screening for DR needs to be carried out annually, and early detection is crucial for establishing the most effective treatments. For patients with DM but without DR, it is very important to monitor each patient according to their level of risk.

To personalize DR screening programmes, we have developed an algorithm named RETIPROGRAM, a diagnostic aid system for T2DM patients. The aim of present study was to build a new algorithm that can include T1DM patients.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^111gjVNW]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Algorithm

The algorithm (Fig. 2) takes into account the characteristics of the individual interventions, their synergies, and expense. The goal is to achieve and maintain A1C levels of < 7% and to change interventions at as rapid a pace as titration of medications allows when target glycemic goals are not being achieved. Mounting evidence suggests that aggressive lowering of glycemia, especially with insulin therapy, in newly diagnosed diabetes can result in sustained remissions, i.e. normoglycemia without need for glucose-lowering medications. Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease, and patients should be informed that they are likely to require the addition of glucose-lowering medications over time.

The amylin agonists, α-glucosidase inhibitors, glinides, and DPP-4 inhibitors are not included in the two tiers of preferred agents in this algorithm, owing to their lower or equivalent overall glucose-lowering effectiveness compared with the first- and second-tier agents and/or to their limited clinical data or relative expense (Table 1). However, they may be appropriate choices in selected patients.

Type 1 diabetes insulin regimens and technologies — For persons with type 1 diabetes (T1D), physiologic insulin replacement regimens that provide both basal and prandial insulin are recommended, and achievement of glucose targets using either multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) is needed to prevent life-threatening crises. A multi-component self-management diabetes mellitus (DM) education program is recommended, and the ideal insulin regimen should be personalized to an individual's needs and glycemic targets to maintain near normoglycemia and minimize hypoglycemia. Insulin regimens usually should involve the use of insulin analogs and include approaches such as MDI, which usually involve 1 to 2 subcutaneous injections daily of basal insulin with prandial or inhaled insulin before each meal with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) as the preferred monitoring method; CSII can improve glycemic control and should be an option, ideally with CGM; automated insulin delivery systems are recommended for many persons with T1D; and open-loop and sensor-augmented pump systems that can temporarily interrupt insulin delivery when glucose values are low or forecast to be low within 30 min are recommended to many adults with T1D and to many T1D children who prefer not to use or cannot access automated insulin delivery systems.

### The role of GLP-1 mimetics and basal insulin analogues in type 2 diabetes mellitus: guidance from studies of liraglutide [^1142zwSr]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

The ADA and EASD have also updated their consensus statement to include newer medications that now have more clinical data to guide their use. These outline a ranked algorithm for T2DM treatment based on validated (first line) and less well-validated (second line) therapies. The ADA/EASD treatment algorithm advocates that diabetes disease management be initiated with lifestyle changes and the use of metformin, which are both well-validated core therapies. Basal insulin or a sulfonylurea should then be added if HbA1c is ≥ 7% (≥ 53 mmol/mol) for 2–3 months despite initial intervention. This approach is favoured in patients with poor glycaemic control [HbA1c > 8.5% (> 69 mmol/mol)] or who have symptoms associated with hyperglycaemia. As part of second-line interventions, thiazolidinediones and the GLP-1 mimetics, liraglutide and exenatide, are advocated along with meglitinides, pramlintide and DPP-4 inhibitors because of less extensive clinical experience.

The ADA/EASD algorithm on the optimal management of hyperglycaemia has been criticized for several reasons. In particular, it has been argued that the recommended two-tier approach is not evidence-based, and that it does not offer the best quality of treatment based on the multifactorial pathophysiology of T2DM and the need for individualized therapy. It should also be noted that some populations are more suited to treatment with a second-line therapy than with a first-line therapy, irrespective of how well validated each agent is, that is, a smaller evidence base does not necessarily mean that a treatment is inferior.

### Statement by an American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology consensus panel on type 2 diabetes mellitus: an algorithm for glycemic control [^116Vz6kN]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

This report presents an algorithm to assist primary care physicians, endocrinologists, and others in the management of adult, nonpregnant patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In order to minimize the risk of diabetes-related complications, the goal of therapy is to achieve a hemoglobin A1c (A1C) of 6.5% or less, with recognition of the need for individualization to minimize the risks of hypoglycemia. We provide therapeutic pathways stratified on the basis of current levels of A1C, whether the patient is receiving treatment or is drug naïve. We consider monotherapy, dual therapy, and triple therapy, including 8 major classes of medications (biguanides, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, incretin mimetics, thiazolidinediones, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and bile acid sequestrants) and insulin therapy (basal, premixed, and multiple daily injections), with or without orally administered medications. We prioritize choices of medications according to safety, risk of hypoglycemia, efficacy, simplicity, anticipated degree of patient adherence, and cost of medications. We recommend only combinations of medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that provide complementary mechanisms of action. It is essential to monitor therapy with A1C and self-monitoring of blood glucose and to adjust or advance therapy frequently (every 2 to 3 months) if the appropriate goal for each patient has not been achieved. We provide a flow-chart and table summarizing the major considerations. This algorithm represents a consensus of 14 highly experienced clinicians, clinical researchers, practitioners, and academicians and is based on the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology Diabetes Guidelines and the recent medical literature.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) convened a writing group to develop a consensus statement on the management of type 1 diabetes in adults. The writing group has considered the rapid development of new treatments and technologies and addressed the following topics: diagnosis, aims of management, schedule of care, diabetes self-management education and support, glucose monitoring, insulin therapy, hypoglycemia, behavioral considerations, psychosocial care, diabetic ketoacidosis, pancreas and islet transplantation, adjunctive therapies, special populations, inpatient management, and future perspectives. Although we discuss the schedule for follow-up examinations and testing, we have not included the evaluation and treatment of the chronic microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes as these are well-reviewed and discussed elsewhere. The writing group was aware of both national and international guidance on type 1 diabetes and did not seek to replicate this but rather aimed to highlight the major areas that health care professionals should consider when managing adults with type 1 diabetes. Though evidence-based where possible, the recommendations in the report represent the consensus opinion of the authors.

### Comparison of national / regional diabetes guidelines for the management of blood glucose control in non-Western countries [^114J3Y9z]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, national guidelines were identified for 33 out of 75 (44%) lower income countries, of which 76% also had guidelines for type 1 diabetes. Two-thirds of countries with national guidelines for type 2 diabetes had made the latest version of their guidelines available after 2008, enabling the latest treatment options to be included. Given that, the consensus algorithms developed by ADA/EASD have been criticized because they were based mostly on expert opinion rather than on an evidence-based process. Therefore, it is notable that many national guidelines seem now to have adopted a more evidence-based approach. Furthermore, with regular updating to reflect the rapid pace of change in the management of type 2 diabetes, this suggests that quality national guidelines may benefit a wider international population of people with diabetes.

However, establishment of national guidelines is only the first step in achieving a high quality of disease management and more efforts need to be made for clinicians and patients to adhere to the recommendations of national guidelines, since glycemic control is still poor in the countries where this study was conducted.

### Clinical and biochemical profile of 786 sequential episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus [^1139QLA6]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of diabetes which requires rapid assessment and treatment. It is characterized by the triad of hyperglycemia, acidemia and ketosis and results from insulin deficiency. Treatment involves correction of hyperglycemia and hypovolemia and replacement of electrolytes. The incidence of DKA ranges from 4.6 to 8 episodes per 1000 people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. While mortality associated with DKA appears to have significantly decreased over the last 20 years (from 7.96% to 0.67%), DKA still represents a considerable risk in adults, adolescents and young children.

Diabetes is usually classified into type 1 and type 2 diabetes and most people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes (90%–95%). It is traditionally accepted that DKA is characteristic of type 1 diabetes. In fact, it has previously been considered that DKA is indicative, or diagnostic, of type 1 diabetes. However, it is also recognized that those with type 2 diabetes can also develop DKA; a retrospective cohort study recently estimated that the incidence of DKA in type 2 diabetes has increased by 4.24% annually between 1992 and 2013. Unfortunately, data reporting on DKA in people with type 2 diabetes are sparse and guidelines for managing DKA in people with type 2 diabetes are based on those for type 1 diabetes.

Newton and Raskinstudied the clinical and biochemical characteristics of 176 episodes of DKA in people with type 1 diabetes compared with 20 with type 2 diabetes. They found a greater proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes experiencing DKA were Latino-American or African-American and required a longer period of treatment to achieve ketone-free urine. Balasubramanyam et al also compared 141 people with type 1 diabetes and 55 people with type 2 diabetes presenting with DKA and identified differences in ethnicities, body mass index and age of onset at presentation. These studies are small and there are currently no published studies comparing DKA in type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the UK.

This descriptive study aimed to compare the demographics and clinical course of DKA in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We also explored the hypothesis on whether DKA treatment algorithm is as effective in people with type 2 diabetes as in those with type 1 diabetes.

Module A: T2DM management — The algorithm begins with a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and first asks whether there is an urgent or emergent care need (e.g., symptomatic hyperglycemia, severe hypoglycemia, concurrent medical issue); if yes, treat and/or refer for acute care, and if no, assess barriers to success (e.g., psychosocial needs, navigating health care, health literacy/numeracy, patient/provider inertia, social determinants of health [e.g., transportation, economic or food insecurity]). The next step is to develop an individualized treatment plan reviewing non‑pharmacologic therapies (Medical Nutrition Therapy including weight management; Diabetes Self‑Management Education and Support; exercise), and if pharmacologic therapy is indicated, begin metformin unless contraindicated. The algorithm then evaluates whether the patient has any of the following: established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or high ASCVD risk, diabetic neuropathy, or heart failure; if yes, consider GLP‑1 RA or SGLT‑2 inhibitor if indicated, and if no, assess whether the glycemic target has been achieved (A1C 7.0–8.5% for most patients or alternative range based on individualization). If the target has not been achieved, consider additional medications until the target A1C range is achieved and select the agent based on efficacy and risk‑benefit ration; if the target has been achieved, review the treatment plan to minimize or treat complications and/or comorbidities.

### Initiating and intensifying insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115a3xBx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Although insulin therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus is perceived to be challenging to initiate and intensify, it forms a vital part of treatment as the disease progresses. This review discusses the challenges, real and perceived, faced by patients and their carers, and presents some practical suggestions concerning patient education and management of insulin therapy. A positive attitude toward insulin therapy can be achieved through patient education that focuses on disease pathophysiology and active involvement in treatment that enables them to manage concerns such as possible hypoglycemia, weight gain, and injection anxiety. Insulin analogues have more physiologic time-action profiles and are more convenient compared with older human insulins. Clinical trials show that insulin analogue regimens enable glycemic targets to be achieved with potentially less risk for hypoglycemia and more convenient dosing. Furthermore, finer needles and more convenient insulin-delivery systems are now available. With titration algorithms, intensification of an insulin regimen to improve glycemic control is relatively straightforward. Furthermore, patients with type 2 diabetes are less susceptible to hypoglycemia than are those with type 1 diabetes. With modern treatment options, insulin therapy need no longer be feared by patients with type 2 diabetes or their carers. Many common concerns in this respect are unfounded, and today's insulin regimens are generally simple, effective, and well tolerated.

AACE 2023 symptomatic hyperglycemia — initial insulin indications: Basal with or without prandial insulin treatment may be needed as initial therapy if the A1C is > 10% and/or glucose values are > 300 mg/dL combined with catabolic symptoms, such as weight loss. If symptomatic hyperglycemia is present, a GLP-1 RA alone is not recommended as it requires titration and may delay glucose control. The goal of initial intensive insulin therapy for symptomatic hyperglycemia is to reduce glucose levels safely and promptly. After improved glycemic control is achieved with short-term insulin therapy, especially with a new diagnosis of DM, a role for noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents could be considered.

### Management of individuals with diabetes at high risk for hypoglycemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114y7fxT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Endocrine Society hypoglycemia guideline — results outline scope and recommendation strengths: The panel agreed on 10 questions specific to hypoglycemia risk and prevention in people with diabetes for which 10 recommendations were made. The guideline includes conditional recommendations for use of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and algorithm-driven insulin pumps in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D), use of CGM for outpatients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for hypoglycemia, use of long-acting and rapid-acting insulin analogs, and initiation and continuation of CGM for select inpatient populations at high risk for hypoglycemia. Strong recommendations were made for structured diabetes education programs for those at high risk for hypoglycemia; use of glucagon preparations that do not require reconstitution versus those that do for managing severe outpatient hypoglycemia for adults and children; for children, use of real-time CGM for individuals with T1D receiving multiple daily injections; and the use of inpatient glycemic management programs leveraging electronic health record data to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.

### Validation of Danish registry-cases of type 1 diabetes in women giving live birth using a clinical cohort as gold standard [^11714X1N]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, we used algorithms and Danish national health registries to identify type 1 diabetes in women giving live birth among all 407,157 live births in Denmark from 1994 to 1999. All algorithms were validated against a clinical cohort of women with confirmed type 1 diabetes and live birth in Denmark as a gold standard. Algorithms based on any diabetes diagnosis code given before delivery and registered before maternal age of 30 (algorithm 1) or a specific type 1 diabetes diagnosis code regardless of maternal age (algorithm 2) had acceptable PPV and completeness, whereas algorithms based on a specific 'preexisting type 1 diabetes in pregnancy' diagnosis code (algorithm 3) performed poorly. Inclusion of additional information on anti‐diabetic treatment and the exclusion of women given a gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosis code in the index pregnancy increased the PPV but decreased the completeness across all algorithms. Algorithms 1 and 2 showed similar patterns in terms of number of identified cases over the years, indicating that both algorithms were robust against potential changes over time (e.g. in registries and demographics).

### A practitioner's toolkit for insulin motivation in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus: evidence-based recommendations from an international expert panel [^115dWyMc]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Proposed Toolkits for Practitioners for Insulin Use in DM Patients

The expert group proposed a tool kit for the practitioners to address the queries and key challenges faced by the patients with diabetes at different stages of their journey through insulin therapy. These toolkits are based on the clinical experiences of the experts in their day-to-day practice.

Tool Kit for Pre-initiation of Insulin Therapy

Patient Queries and Recommended Responses

Toolkit for Initiation of Insulin Therapy

Patient education while initiating insulin therapy should be simple and focus on a single topic at a time for better retention. A step-wise approach should be followed for insulin-specific diabetes education, and all patient queries should be answered.

Titration and Intensification: Best Practices

Titration inertia can be a result of reluctance/inaction or the HCP or patient, or both.
Simpler titration algorithms and educational self-management programs for diabetic individuals are essential for optimizing clinical outcomes.
Most physicians believe that insulin is the most effective agent for achieving glycemic goals, yet they are reluctant to intensify insulin therapy.
Insulin intensification inertia can be addressed by using better insulins with good efficacy and safety profiles and newer medications for type 2 diabetes as well as through patient education and effective communication between HCPs and patients with diabetes.

Toolkit for Titration

In addition to the fear of hypoglycemia and poor self-management, a lack of adequate insulin titration contributes to poor glycemic control among patients with T2DM on insulin. Titration of insulin doses is as important as the initiation of insulin treatment. However, in practice, once insulin has been initiated, an increase in dose is not recommended. Insulin dose irregularities can be due to a missed dose, untimely administration of a dose or reduced doses.

Toolkit for Intensification

Following initiation of a basal/bolus insulin regimen, titration of the insulin dose becomes important. Insulin dose adjustments should be made in both mealtime and basal insulin based on blood glucose levels. Home glucose monitoring or HbA 1c levels aid in titration of insulin doses. Reduction of the basal insulin dose should be considered following titration of the prandial insulin dose, the evening meal dose in particular.

The 4th Cardiovascular Outcome Trial (CVOT) Summit of the Diabetes & Cardiovascular Disease (D&CVD) EASD Study Group was held in Munich on 25–26 October 2018. As in previous years, this summit served as a reference meeting for in-depth discussions on the topic of recently completed and presented CVOTs. This year, focus was placed on the CVOTs CARMELINA, DECLARE-TIMI 58 and Harmony Outcomes. Trial implications for diabetes management and the impact of the new ADA/EASD consensus statement treatment algorithm were highlighted for diabetologists, cardiologists, endocrinologists, nephrologists and general practitioners. Discussions evolved from CVOTs to additional therapy options for heart failure (ARNI), knowledge gained for adjunct therapy of type 1 diabetes and, on the occasion of the 10 year anniversary of the FDA's "Guidance for Industry: "should CVOTs be continued and/or modified?" The 5th Cardiovascular Outcome Trial Summit will be held in Munich on 24–25 October 2019.

### Management of hyperglycemia in hospitalized adult patients in non-critical care settings: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113ZTy5L]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Regarding inpatient care for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to management of hospitalized patients, insulin therapy, ES 2022 guidelines recommend to consider administering initial therapy with correctional insulin over scheduled insulin therapy (defined as basal or basal/bolus insulin) to maintain glucose targets in the range of 100–180 mg/dL (5.6–10.0 mmol/L) in adult patients with no prior history of diabetes hospitalized for a non-critical illness and experiencing hyperglycemia (defined as blood glucose > 140 mg/dL; 7.8 mmol/L) during hospitalization. Consider adding scheduled insulin therapy in patients with persistent hyperglycemia (≥ 2 point-of-care blood glucose measurements ≥ 180 mg/dL in a 24-hour period on correctional insulin alone).

### Glucose control and psychosocial outcomes with use of automated insulin delivery for 12 to 96 weeks in type 1 diabetes: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115nWbom]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic autoimmune disease, characterised by the progressive destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Intensive insulin treatment is the current standard of care for T1DM. Unfortunately, the proportion of patients achieving a controlled HbA1c and their time in range (TIR) glycaemic level is low. A large proportion of individuals with type 1 diabetes are unable to meet recommended glycaemic targets and severe hypoglycaemia is a recurrent problem.

Since the 1960s, several automated insulin delivery (AID) systems have been developed. The goal of such devices is to achieve better glycaemic control, reduce glucose variability, and decrease the risk of micro and macrovascular complications as well as treatment distress. An AID system consists of three components: a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), a pump able to continuously deliver insulin, and a computer algorithm controlling insulin delivery through glucose-responsive feedback. In the last 15 years, multiple closed-loop (CL) systems were developed, such as predictive low-glucose suspend (PLGS) systems, hybrid closed-loop (HCL) systems, and fully closed-loop (FCL) systems, however, their long-term impact on clinical and functional outcomes is still unclear. Previous randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have obtained variable conclusions. While some showed no significant difference in mean overnight blood glucose when comparing CL and Sensor-augmented Insulin Pump (SAP) in adults, adolescents, and children, others showed no difference in time spent in hypoglycaemia. Recent trials using more advanced AID systems have demonstrated better therapeutic efficacy regarding HbA1c levels and TIR.
