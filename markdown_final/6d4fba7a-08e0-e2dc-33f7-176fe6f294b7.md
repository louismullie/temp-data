## Question

Hypertensive urgency minimal systolic and diastolic blood pressures needed to make diagnosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the minimal systolic and diastolic blood pressures required to diagnose hypertensive urgency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition of hypertensive urgency versus hypertensive emergency. Then, I should verify the most authoritative thresholds used in contemporary guidelines and high-quality cohort studies. Next, I will check for any exceptions or variations across societies and settings. Finally, I will reconcile any conflicting terminology and confirm the bottom line with citations.

> Let me first confirm the core concept so I don't jump to conclusions: hypertensive urgency is severe hypertension without acute target organ damage, whereas hypertensive emergency is severe hypertension with acute target organ damage; the presence or absence of organ injury, not the exact number, is the key discriminator, but the numeric thresholds still matter for labeling and triage [^cb447e10] [^cb447e10].

> Now, I should verify the most consistently cited thresholds. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on the same cut points: systolic blood pressure of at least 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure of at least 110 mmHg, in the absence of acute target organ damage, defines hypertensive urgency; this is the definition used in the large JAMA Internal Medicine cohort and echoed in systematic reviews and contemporary guideline frameworks [^d112dd24] [^7dbb8153] [^5b5912e0].

> Wait, let me verify guideline alignment so I'm not over-relying on a single study. The 2024 ESC guidance instructs clinicians to exclude hypertensive emergency when office BP is 180/110 mmHg or higher, which operationally anchors the same threshold for "severe hypertension without target organ damage" in practice, and the 2025 AHA/ACC guidance explicitly distinguishes severe hypertension without target organ damage from hypertensive emergency, again reflecting the same 180/110 mmHg boundary in common usage [^cb447e10] [^5b5912e0].

> Hold on, I should check for exceptions or variations. Some emergency medicine policies and older literature occasionally used 160/100 mmHg as a "markedly elevated" threshold in asymptomatic patients, but that lower cut point aligns with JNC 7 stage 2 hypertension and is not the modern definition of hypertensive urgency; it risks overcalling urgency and prompting unnecessary acute therapy in the ED, which current guidance discourages in the absence of organ damage [^6bfa708a] [^c655af25].

> I need to ensure I'm not conflating terminology. The 2025 ACC/AHA methodology update notes that the prior term "hypertensive urgency" is being replaced with "severe hypertension" for severe elevations without target organ damage, but the numeric thresholds remain the same in practice and in the evidence base that operationalized "urgency" as 180/110 mmHg without organ injury [^984425ac] [^d112dd24].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to be precise: the minimal blood pressures required to diagnose hypertensive urgency are systolic blood pressure ≥ 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mmHg, provided there is no acute target organ damage; if organ damage is present, the same or even lower numbers may constitute hypertensive emergency, which changes management entirely [^d112dd24] [^5b5912e0] [^cb447e10].

---

The minimum blood pressures required to diagnose hypertensive urgency are **≥ 180 mmHg systolic** and/or **≥ 110 mmHg diastolic**, in the absence of acute target organ damage [^d112dd24] [^7dbb8153]. These thresholds are widely used in clinical practice and guidelines, and hypertensive urgency is distinct from hypertensive emergency, which requires evidence of acute organ injury [^5b5912e0] [^cb447e10].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

Hypertensive urgency is defined as a **severe elevation in blood pressure** — specifically, systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 110 mmHg — without evidence of acute target organ damage [^d112dd24] [^7dbb8153]. This distinguishes it from hypertensive emergency, which involves the same or even lower blood pressure thresholds but with acute target organ damage such as encephalopathy, acute heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, or acute renal failure [^5b5912e0] [^cb447e10].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the thresholds

The thresholds of **SBP ≥ 180 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 110 mmHg** are supported by multiple clinical studies and guidelines:

- **JAMA Internal Medicine study**: Defined hypertensive urgency as SBP ≥ 180 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 110 mmHg without acute target organ damage, and found a prevalence of 4.6% in outpatient settings [^d112dd24].
- **Systematic review**: Defined hypertensive urgency as SBP ≥ 180 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 110 mmHg without end-organ damage, emphasizing the need for gradual blood pressure control over 24–48 hours [^7dbb8153].
- **ESC 2024 guidelines**: Recommend excluding hypertensive emergency when office BP is ≥ 180/110 mmHg, reinforcing the threshold for severe hypertension without acute organ damage [^cb447e10].

---

## Clinical implications of hypertensive urgency

Although hypertensive urgency does not involve acute target organ damage, it still carries significant clinical implications:

- **Short-term risk**: Patients with hypertensive urgency have a low short-term risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), with MACE occurring in less than 1% of patients within 6 months [^d112dd24] [^7dbb8153].
- **Long-term risk**: Persistent uncontrolled hypertension increases the risk of cardiovascular events, stroke, and renal damage over time [^1ad6939b] [^8eb2328e].
- **Management**: Gradual blood pressure reduction over 24–48 hours using oral antihypertensive medications is recommended, with close follow-up to ensure sustained control [^d112dd24] [^7dbb8153].

---

## Differentiation from hypertensive emergency

It is critical to distinguish hypertensive urgency from hypertensive emergency, as the latter requires **immediate, intensive care** and parenteral antihypertensive therapy to prevent or limit target organ damage [^5b5912e0] [^cb447e10]. Hypertensive emergency is defined by severe hypertension (typically ≥ 180/120 mmHg) with acute target organ damage, such as:

- Hypertensive encephalopathy
- Acute heart failure
- Acute coronary syndrome
- Stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic)
- Acute renal failure
- Aortic dissection

---

## Summary of diagnostic criteria

| **Criterion** | **Hypertensive urgency** | **Hypertensive emergency** |
|-|-|-|
| Systolic blood pressure | ≥ 180 mmHg | ≥ 180 mmHg |
| Diastolic blood pressure | ≥ 110 mmHg | ≥ 120 mmHg |
| Acute target organ damage | Absent | Present |
| Management | Gradual oral antihypertensive therapy over 24–48 hours | Immediate parenteral antihypertensive therapy |

---

The minimum blood pressures required to diagnose hypertensive urgency are **≥ 180 mmHg systolic** and/or **≥ 110 mmHg diastolic**, in the absence of acute target organ damage. These thresholds are supported by clinical evidence and guidelines, and it is essential to differentiate hypertensive urgency from hypertensive emergency to guide appropriate management strategies [^d112dd24] [^7dbb8153] [^5b5912e0] [^cb447e10].

### Current diagnosis and management of hypertensive emergency [^6958f478]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

The appropriate and timely evaluation and treatment of patients with severely elevated blood pressure is essential to avoid serious adverse outcomes. Most importantly, the distinction between a hypertensive emergency (crisis) and urgency needs to be made. A sudden elevation in systolic (SBP) and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) that is associated with acute end organ damage (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or renal) is defined as a hypertensive crisis or emergency. In contrast, acute elevation in SBP and/or DBP not associated with evidence of end organ damage is defined as hypertensive urgency. In patients with a hypertensive emergency, blood pressure control should be attained as expeditiously as possible with parenteral medications to prevent ongoing and potentially permanent end organ damage. In contrast, with hypertensive urgency, blood pressure control can be achieved with the use of oral medications within 24–48 hours. This paper reviews the management of hypertensive emergencies.

Furthermore, existing guidelines provide few recommendations as to the management of those with markedly elevated BP absent a hypertensive emergency, leading to questions on who warrants diagnostic testing to look for end-organ injury, how much acute pain or anxiety may contribute to BP in the ED, when initiation or titration of antihypertensive medications is indicated, or how to manage patients with no reliable outpatient follow-up. Emergency clinicians continue to use outdated and incorrect diagnoses such as "hypertension urgency", a term that implies the need for "something" to be done in the ED setting, despite lack of sound basis in the literature, including current international guidelines.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertensive urgency in the outpatient setting: a systematic review [^7dbb8153]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hypertensive urgency (HU) is defined as systolic blood pressure of at least 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure of at least 110 mmHg, without associated end-organ damage. Patients with HU may be completely asymptomatic or may present with symptoms such as headache, epistaxis, faintness, malaise, psychomotor agitation, nausea, or vomiting.

Up to 65 million Americans have hypertension; about 1% will have an episode of HU during their lives. The prevalence of HU in emergency room (ER) or office settings is estimated at 3–5%. In a recent cohort study, cardiovascular events were found to occur in less than 1% of patients within a 6-month period.

Guidance for immediate management of HU is unclear, since there is no consensus on the optimal target for acute blood pressure reduction or the time frame for achieving a normal blood pressure range. Most patients receive drug therapy for elevated blood pressure within the first 48 h of presentation. – Knowledge of the effectiveness and safety of different medication choices and associated comorbidities is crucial for clinicians, especially generalists.

The aim of this systematic review is to summarize evidence of the benefits and harms associated with antihypertensive medications used to treat HU in adults, either in the clinic or ER. This systematic review is intended for a broad audience, including clinicians — especially general internists — along with policymakers and funding agencies, professional societies developing clinical practice guidelines, patients and their care providers, and researchers.

### Characteristics and outcomes of patients presenting with hypertensive urgency in the office setting [^d112dd24]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

The prevalence and short-term outcomes of hypertensive urgency (systolic blood pressure ≥ 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mm Hg) are unknown. Guidelines recommend achieving blood pressure control within 24 to 48 hours. However, some patients are referred to the emergency department (ED) or directly admitted to the hospital, and whether hospital management is associated with better outcomes is unknown.

Objectives

To describe the prevalence of hypertensive urgency and the characteristics and short-term outcomes of these patients, and to determine whether referral to the hospital is associated with better outcomes than outpatient management.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study with propensity matching included all patients presenting with hypertensive urgency to an office in the Cleveland Clinic Healthcare system from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2013. Pregnant women and patients referred to the hospital for symptoms or treatment of other conditions were excluded. Final follow-up was completed on June 30, 2014, and data were assessed from October 31, 2014, to May 31, 2015.

Exposures

Hospital vs ambulatory blood pressure management.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) consisting of acute coronary syndrome and stroke or transient ischemic attack, uncontrolled hypertension (≥ 140/90 mm Hg), and hospital admissions.

Results

Of 2 199 019 unique patient office visits, 59 836 (4.6%) met the definition of hypertensive urgency. After excluding 851 patients, 58 535 were included. Mean (SD) age was 63.1 (15.4) years; 57.7% were women; and 76.0% were white. Mean (SD) body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 31.1 (7.6); mean (SD) systolic blood pressure, 182.5 (16.6) mm Hg; and mean (SD) diastolic blood pressure, 96.4 (15.8) mm Hg. In the propensity-matched analysis, the 852 patients sent home were compared with the 426 patients referred to the hospital, with no significant difference in MACE at 7 days (0 vs 2 [0.5%]; P = 0.11), 8 to 30 days (0 vs 2 [0.5%]; P = 0.11), or 6 months (8 [0.9%] vs 4 [0.9%]; P > .99). Patients sent home were more likely to have uncontrolled hypertension at 1 month (735 of 852 [86.3%] vs 349 of 426 [81.9%]; P = 0.04) but not at 6 months (393 of 608 [64.6%] vs 213 of 320 [66.6%]; P = 0.56). Patients sent home had lower hospital admission rates at 7 days (40 [4.7%] vs 35 [8.2%]; P = 0.01) and at 8 to 30 days (59 [6.9%] vs 48 [11.3%]; P = 0.009).

Conclusions and Relevance

Hypertensive urgency is common, but the rate of MACE in asymptomatic patients is very low. Visits to the ED were associated with more hospitalizations, but not improved outcomes. Most patients still had uncontrolled hypertension 6 months later.

### Hypertensive crises: challenges and management [^64f74f1d]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Hypertension affects > 65 million people in the United States and is one of the leading causes of death. One to two percent of patients with hypertension have acute elevations of BP that require urgent medical treatment. Depending on the degree of BP elevation and presence of end-organ damage, severe hypertension can be defined as either a hypertensive emergency or a hypertensive urgency. A hypertensive emergency is associated with acute end-organ damage and requires immediate treatment with a titratable short-acting IV antihypertensive agent. Severe hypertension without acute end-organ damage is referred to as a hypertensive urgency and is usually treated with oral antihypertensive agents. This article reviews definitions, current concepts, common misconceptions, and pitfalls in the diagnosis and management of patients with acutely elevated BP as well as special clinical situations in which BP must be controlled.

### What is normal blood pressure? [^a5370941]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Given the continuous relations of blood pressure to cardiovascular risk, any definition of high blood pressure is arbitrary, and based on thresholds at which there is clear evidence that treatment benefits outweigh potential risks. This review examines what constitutes optimal blood pressure.

Recent Findings

A recent report raised the possibility of an age- and sex-dependent threshold for risk associated with systolic blood pressure, questioning the use of a single threshold (such as 140/90 mmHg) for defining hypertension. Several subsequent studies have questioned this notion and reemphasized that lower blood pressure levels are associated with less morbidity and mortality even within the nonhypertensive range. A recent meta-analysis confirmed that a blood pressure of 115/75 mmHg is associated with minimal vascular mortality and likely constitutes optimal blood pressure. Such blood pressure levels are infrequent in westernized societies. The target blood pressure goal for treated hypertensives is higher at 140/90 mmHg but is infrequently achieved. Select individuals at high absolute risk of cardiovascular disease events and/or with specific conditions (notably diabetes, renal insufficiency and prior vascular disease) may benefit from blood pressure lowering below this threshold.

Summary

At a population level, a blood pressure of 115/75 mmHg seems optimal because it is associated with minimal vascular risk. Over half of all hypertensives do not have their blood pressure controlled underscoring the challenges facing health care providers. Efforts should be strengthened for the primary prevention of hypertension and the promotion of optimal blood pressure through lifestyle measures.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients in the emergency department with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure [^c655af25]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to management of hypertensive urgency, ACEP 2013 guidelines recommend to do not offer routine medical intervention in the emergency department in patients presenting with asymptomatic markedly elevated BP (HTN stage 2, ≥ 160/100 mmHg). Consider treating markedly elevated BP in the emergency department and/or initiate therapy for long-term control in selected patients, such as with poor follow-up. Refer patients with asymptomatic markedly elevated BP for outpatient follow-up.

### Severe asymptomatic hypertension: evaluation and treatment… [^3997426f]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Severe asymptomatic hypertension, or hypertensive urgency, is defined as severely elevated blood pressure without acute target organ injury. 6 Patients may still have headache, lightheadedness, nausea, shortness of breath, palpitations, epistaxis, or anxiety, depending on the acuity and severity of blood pressure elevation. Hypertensive emergency is defined as severe blood pressure elevation in the presence of acute target organ injury, such as encephalopathy, cerebrovascular or cardiovascular events, pulmonary edema, renal injury, or aortic dissection. 7 These patients require urgent evaluation and hospitalization. A retrospective cohort study from a single multispecialty outpatient health care system showed that in 4. 6% of patients, initial blood pressure measurements met diagnostic criteria for severe asymptomatic hypertension.

There is insufficient evidence to dictate the most appropriate management for severe asymptomatic hypertension. Most guidelines focus on hypertensive emergency. Evaluation HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A comprehensive history is essential in the initial evaluation of patients with severe asymptomatic hypertension. DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION Patients presenting with severe asymptomatic hypertension rarely require diagnostic evaluation, although subsequent office visits should include evaluation for long-term hypertension risks based on current guidelines. 4, 6 Patients with symptoms or clinical findings suggesting acute target organ injury require appropriate diagnostic testing and evaluation for possible hypertensive emergency. A recent trial of an outpatient population referred to the ED for severe asymptomatic hypertension showed only 5% of tests ordered had abnormal results, and only 2% of patients had evidence of target organ injury.

A retrospective outpatient study evaluated the short-term outcomes of patients with severe asymptomatic hypertension. Patients had a mean systolic blood pressure of 183 mm Hg and mean diastolic blood pressure of 96 mm Hg. 19 Although scientific evidence is lacking, patients with sustained diastolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg or more should be considered for treatment with short-acting antihypertensives followed by long-acting agents. Symptomatic patients with persistent systolic blood pressure elevations exceeding 240 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than 130 mm Hg despite appropriate rest and treatment with short-acting antihypertensives may benefit from hospitalization.

### Clinical review: the management of hypertensive crises [^b019de15]. Critical Care (2003). Low credibility.

Hypertension is an extremely common clinical problem, affecting approximately 50 million people in the USA and approximately 1 billion individuals worldwide. Approximately 1% of these patients will develop acute elevations in blood pressure at some point in their lifetime. A number of terms have been applied to severe hypertension, including hypertensive crises, emergencies, and urgencies. By definition, acute elevations in blood pressure that are associated with end-organ damage are called hypertensive crises. Immediate reduction in blood pressure is required only in patients with acute end-organ damage. This article reviews current concepts, and common misconceptions and pitfalls in the diagnosis and management of patients with acutely elevated blood pressure.

### Evaluation and treatment of severe asymptomatic hypertension [^536bfb18]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Poorly controlled hypertension is a common finding in the outpatient setting. When patients present with severely elevated blood pressure (i.e., systolic blood pressure of 180 mm Hg or greater, or diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or greater), physicians need to differentiate hypertensive emergency from severely elevated blood pressure without signs or symptoms of end-organ damage (severe asymptomatic hypertension). Most patients who are asymptomatic but have poorly controlled hypertension do not have acute end-organ damage and, therefore, do not require immediate workup or treatment (within 24 hours). However, physicians should confirm blood pressure readings and appropriately classify the hypertensive state. A cardiovascular risk profile is important in guiding the treatment of severe asymptomatic hypertension; higher risk patients may benefit from more urgent and aggressive evaluation and treatment. Oral agents may be initiated before discharge, but intravenous medications and fast-acting oral agents should be reserved for true hypertensive emergencies. High blood pressure should be treated gradually. Appropriate, repeated follow-up over weeks to months is needed to reach desired blood pressure goals.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertensive urgency in the outpatient setting: a systematic review [^758c2ba4]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

Additional longitudinal studies are needed to determine how best to safely decrease blood pressure in patients with HU. Larger and longer-term studies are also needed, including participants with other common comorbidities. Such research would hopefully provide more guidance to improve both short- and long-term cardiovascular outcome.

Broader Coverage of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Aspects by Guidelines and Protocols Proposed for the Primary Clinical Conditions

The natural diagnosis sequence in patients with hypertensive emergencies is usually from the typical manifestations of the primary clinical diagnosis and not from the detection of high BP. The management of BP is one among several steps of care in such conditions, and frequently the intervention over BP is secondary or even not considered in guidelines for the primary diagnoses.

METHODS

Eligibility Criteria

We defined HU as severe hypertension without evidence of acute end-organ damage. We included studies with non-pregnant adults with systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 179 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 109 mmHg, with no end-organ damage. Because of inconsistent terminology, we selected studies based on the above blood pressure criteria. We included both clinic and ER settings in the search, but excluded studies where patients were hospitalized.

Data Sources and Search

Following the PRISMA guidelines, and in collaboration with a librarian (JT), two reviewers (CLC, KO) searched the literature using PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Embase. The medical librarian created search strategies with standardized terms and keywords. We excluded case reports, letters, and editorials. Searches were limited to English-language publications and to human studies using the limits provided by the databases. The "human" filter recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventionswas used in PubMed. Studies on pulmonary hypertension were excluded. The gray literature was also searched utilizing Google Scholar. In addition, one expert (PD) identified key literature for the review. All search results were exported to EndNote. Using the EndNote duplicate locator, 4861 duplicate articles were removed. The librarian updated the search in May 2016, and all searches were completed in July 2016. The full search strategy is shown in Appendix A.

Two evaluators (CLC and KO) independently identified and screened articles for inclusion. Reference lists of studies were manually scanned, and cited references were screened by each evaluator (Fig. 1).

### Association of elevated blood pressure in the emergency department with chronically elevated blood pressure [^638711fe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertension affects more than one‐third of adults in the United States, and hypertension‐related emergency department (ED) visits are increasing. 1, 2 Although the spectrum of acuity for hypertension‐related ED visits ranges widely, true hypertensive emergencies, such as acute heart failure in which acute BP reduction (< 24 hours) is warranted, are rare. 3, 4 For the much more common ED visits with asymptomatic elevated BP, rapid BP reduction can cause significant harm by impairing cerebral blood flow and has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 The American College of Emergency Physicians' policy recommendation on asymptomatic elevated BP in the ED reflects current lack of evidence to guide evaluation and treatment; based on expert opinion or panel consensus (level C evidence), it states that although all patients with asymptomatic elevated BP should be referred for follow‐up, routine ED testing and treatment are not needed but can be considered for those with poor follow‐up. 10

The risk of elevated BP after an ED visit and thresholds for classifying BP in the ED were not addressed by the American College of Emergency Physicians policy recommendation. Recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines revising the threshold for hypertension to 130/80 mm Hg among high‐risk patients adds urgency to addressing this evidence gap, as many ED patients are likely to meet these new criteria for hypertension and also have insufficient access to other sources of care. 11

There are several long‐standing barriers to using BP measured in the ED as part of diagnosing and treating hypertension. One barrier is uncertainty regarding the validity of BP measured in the ED. Despite some evidence to the contrary, BP measured in the ED is often disregarded because of concerns about measurement accuracy or because BP elevations attributed to pain, anxiety, or illness are presumed to be temporary and clinically unimportant. 12, 13 Questions about whether the ED can or should serve as a location of care to manage chronic diseases, such as hypertension, contribute to variation in how elevated BP in the ED is evaluated and treated. 14, 15, 16 Such variations in practice patterns due to lack of evidence are likely to result in worse health outcomes overall. 17

### Severe asymptomatic hypertension: evaluation and treatment [^2ae3a846]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension affects one-third of Americans and is a significant modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke, renal disease, and death. Severe asymptomatic hypertension is defined as severely elevated blood pressure (180 mm Hg or more systolic, or 110 mm Hg or more diastolic) without symptoms of acute target organ injury. The short-term risks of acute target organ injury and major adverse cardiovascular events are low in this population, whereas hypertensive emergencies manifest as acute target organ injury requiring immediate hospitalization. Individuals with severe asymptomatic hypertension often have preexisting poorly controlled hypertension and usually can be managed in the outpatient setting. Immediate diagnostic testing rarely alters short-term management, and blood pressure control is best achieved with initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive therapy. Aggressive lowering of blood pressure should be avoided, and the use of parenteral medications is not indicated. Current recommendations are to gradually reduce blood pressure over several days to weeks. Patients with escalating blood pressure, manifestation of acute target organ injury, or lack of compliance with treatment should be considered for hospital admission.

### Is it time to retire the diagnosis "Hypertensive emergency"? [^c3a769bb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The recognition of high BP in patients in emergency settings requires the diagnosis of the causes of the elevation. The diversity of clinical conditions that lead to the diagnosis of hypertensive emergency does not have a common denominator to justify a similar BP‐lowering strategy for all. The clinical conditions are usually self‐evident and should be managed according to their specific guidelines, which include several aspects of diagnosis and treatment. Treating elevated BP rather than the primary clinical condition can be harmful. The diagnosis of hypertensive emergency provided good services to doctors and patients, but given the contemporary reality, it should have a well‐deserved retirement.

### The management of severe hypertension [^b756ec2c]. Seminars in Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

Although definitions of severe hypertension vary, thresholds of ≥ 160–170 mm Hg systolic and/or ≥ 110 mm Hg diastolic are in most common usage. A recent focus has been placed on systolic hypertension given the increased pulse pressure in these women. In pregnancy, there is a general consensus that severe hypertension should be treated. Among woman with pre-eclampsia, attention must be paid to other end organ dysfunction, as blood pressure (BP) management is but one aspect of care. The urgency of antihypertensive therapy will depend primarily on the absolute level of BP. However, most clinicians will also consider both the rate of BP rise and the presence of maternal symptoms. Most commonly, severe hypertension is treated with parenteral labetalol or hydralazine, or oral nifedipine (capsules or PA tablet). Other options will depend on local availability. MgSO(4) should not be relied on as an antihypertensive.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients with asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department [^b6eace0b]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

Definitions and measurement framework emphasize JNC 7 categories and scope. The definitions of hypertension used in this report are those developed by JNC 7 and include normal, prehypertension, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension, and acute hypertensive emergencies are not addressed by this policy. Classification is based on the average of 2 or more properly measured, seated blood pressure readings on each of 2 or more office visits. JNC 7 defined prehypertension as systolic blood pressure of 120 to 139 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg, and patients with prehypertension are at increased risk for progression to hypertension; those in the 120–139 mm Hg systolic or 80–89 mm Hg diastolic range are at twice the risk to develop hypertension as those with lower values. The table applies to adults aged 18 years or older.

### Is it time to retire the diagnosis "Hypertensive emergency"? [^c2f148a9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with high BP in emergency departments have worse long‐term cardiovascular outcomes than those with lower BP. This consequence is expected because these patients already have high BP levels and a longer duration of hypertension. The diagnoses of urgency and emergency would be justified if short‐term outcomes were influenced by prompt therapy in emergency departments. Nevertheless, there is no clinical trial in patients diagnosed as having hypertensive urgencies and emergencies showing the short‐term reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular events. The long‐term benefits would depend of the management after the discharge of the emergency department.

The denomination of hypertensive urgency for the isolated elevation of BP in the emergency room has been questioned. There is no evidence that lowering BP in a short period prevents major cardiovascular events and the prognosis was not different in patients referred to an emergency service. The resumption of medication for the chronic management of hypertension in this context can be considered.

The utility of the diagnosis of hypertensive emergencies to guide the treatment of patients in emergency departments should also be questioned. There is a clear difference between the dangerous long‐term elevation of BP, the major cause of cardiovascular diseases, and the acute elevation of BP, even if accompanied by target organ damage or dysfunction. Delayed therapy for primary clinical conditions, and treating high BP instead, continues to occur in emergency settings. Here, we propose reasons to abandon the diagnosis of hypertensive emergency (Table), which had been useful to characterize the risks of high BP but now deserves an honorable retirement.

### Under pressure: treatment of acute severe hypertension (hypertensive crisis) [^c161b883]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute severe hypertension encompasses a spectrum of severe blood pressure elevations that can progress to end organ damage if left unmanaged. Understanding the presentations of various acute hypertensive scenarios can help guide interventional radiologists in recognizing clinical symptoms, signs, and selecting effective management strategies. The timely administration of antihypertensive agents is critical to prevent the detrimental effects associated with hypertensive emergencies. The preferred approach to achieve optimal blood pressure control and the desired target blood pressure range may vary based on the hypertensive scenario and patient-specific factors.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertensive urgency in the outpatient setting: a systematic review [^709ef022]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertensive urgency (HU), defined as acute severe uncontrolled hypertension without end-organ damage, is a common condition. Despite its association with long-term morbidity and mortality, guidance regarding immediate management is sparse. Our objective was to summarize the evidence examining the effects of antihypertensive medications to treat.

Methods

We searched the PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Embase through May 2016. Study selection: We evaluated prospective controlled clinical trials, case–control studies, and cohort studies of HU in emergency room (ER) or clinic settings. We initially identified 11,223 published articles. We reviewed 10,748 titles and abstracts and identified 538 eligible articles. We assessed the full text for eligibility and included 31 articles written in English that were clinical trials or cohort studies and provided blood pressure data within 48 h of treatment. Studies were appraised for risk of bias using components recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. The main outcome measured was blood pressure change with antihypertensive medications. Since studies were too diverse both clinically and methodologically to combine in a meta-analysis, tabular data and a narrative synthesis of studies are presented.

Results

We identified only 20 double-blind randomized controlled trials and 12 cohort studies, with 262 participants in prospective controlled trials. However, we could not pool the results of studies. In addition, comorbidities and their potential contribution to long-term treatment of these subjects were not adequately addressed in any of the reviewed studies.

Conclusions

Longitudinal studies are still needed to determine how best to lower blood pressure in patients with HU. Longer-term management of individuals who have experienced HU continues to be an area requiring further study, especially as applicable to care from the generalist.

### What is the most important component of blood pressure: systolic, diastolic or pulse pressure? [^b1de9b18]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diastolic blood pressure has traditionally been considered the most important component of blood pressure and the primary target of antihypertensive therapy. However, over 30 years ago important epidemiological studies pointed out the importance of systolic blood pressure, and research during the 1990s has strengthened this view. Unlike diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure increases progressively with age, and in the ageing societies elevated systolic pressure is the most common form of hypertension. The characteristic changes of systolic and diastolic blood pressure with age lead to increases in pulse pressure (systolic minus diastolic), which has emerged as a new, potentially independent risk factor. In this review we compare the relative importance of various blood pressure components.

Recent Findings

Generally, in studies in which readings of systolic and diastolic blood pressure have been compared, systolic blood pressure has been a better predictor of risk. Moreover, isolated systolic hypertension predicts risk better than isolated diastolic hypertension, and the treatment of both isolated systolic hypertension and combined hypertension has reduced cardiovascular events. There are no treatment studies of isolated diastolic hypertension. Pulse pressure reflects stiffening of large arteries and is associated with several cardiovascular risk factors. Pulse pressure also predicts events in epidemiologic studies, but elucidation of an independent role is hampered by the close correlation between pulse pressure and systolic blood pressure.

Summary

Epidemiological and treatment studies suggest that systolic blood pressure should be the primary target of antihypertensive therapy, although consideration of systolic and diastolic pressure together improves risk prediction. The greatest practical concern at the moment is the undertreatment of hypertension, especially systolic, and total cardiovascular risk.

Other Topics

Both guidelines provide recommendations for follow-up intervals, with the ACC/AHA CPG suggesting 1 year for reevaluation of adults with a normal BP, 3 to 6 months for those treated with nonpharmacological therapy, and 1 month after initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy followed by 3 to 6 months after meeting the BP goal. The ESC/ESH CPG suggests follow-up within the first 2 months after the initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy, with the caveat that the interval should depend on the severity of hypertension and urgency to achieve BP control. After the desired BP target has been achieved, an interval of a few months is suggested for BP monitoring and 2 years for reassessment of risk factors and evidence of asymptomatic target organ damage. The ESC/ESH CPG recommends achieving BP control within 3 months of initiating therapy, further emphasizing the need to consider initial therapy with combination drugs in most patients to achieve rapid BP control.

Both guidelines provide detailed guidance for detection and management of secondary hypertension, definition and management of resistant hypertension, hypertensive urgencies and emergencies, masked and white coat hypertension, hypertension in older adults, men and women, persons of different race/ethnicity, and patients with various comorbidities and conditions, including heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, CKD, peripheral vascular disease, DM and metabolic syndrome, aortic disease, and pregnancy.

Both guidelines focus considerable attention on strategies to improve adherence to therapy, emphasizing the advantage of single-pill combinations to improve adherence and overcome therapeutic inertia, and team-based care. Both guidelines also focus on implementation, that is, models for delivery of care, use of health information technology, improving quality of care, health literacy, access to care, social and community services, and a patient-specific plan of care. The ESC/ESH provides recommendations for treatment of isolated systolic hypertension, and it recommends reserving device-based treatments of hypertension for research settings. The ESC/ESH provides recommendations for managing concomitant CVD risk with specific recommendations for the use of statins, antiplatelet drugs, and oral anticoagulation (in atrial fibrillation), whereas the ACC/AHA largely defers to other ACC/AHA guidelines that cover these topics. Last, both guidelines identify gaps in evidence and provide a summary key message (ESC/ESH) or BP treatment thresholds and goals (ACC/AHA).

### Advancing risk-based approaches in blood pressure management: reflections on the 2025 AHA / ACC statement [^c870bffa]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

According to the 2017 Guideline, 68 million individuals had uncontrolled hypertension and were recommended for antihypertensive therapy; of these, 35 million were untreated, and 33 million were receiving treatment but had not attained target BP levels. We advocate for the application of risk stratification to guide priority interventions in both cohorts, informing optimal escalation strategies for those inadequately controlled, and prioritizing interventions to address nontreatment in the untreated population. Drawing a parallel with lipid-lowering therapy, it is both rational and evidence-based to ensure that individuals at the highest risk receive the most effective — and, where appropriate, more intensive — therapeutic regimens. We propose that BP-lowering interventions should be classified by intensity, analogous to lipid-lowering therapies: low, moderate, and high intensity, corresponding to reductions in systolic BP of < 10, 10 to 19, and ≥ 20 mm Hg, respectively. Those at the highest absolute risk should generally be prioritized for high-intensity regimens, provided adverse effects do not preclude their use. Achieving a mean SBP of ≤ 120 mm Hg is essential to maintain the majority of BP readings below 130/80 mm Hg over time, given the natural intraindividual variability in BP. Thus, all patients with untreated mean SBP > 140 mm Hg will require high-intensity regimens to attain and sustain optimal BP control and minimize cardiovascular risk. The substantial expansion of high-intensity therapy should therefore be directed primarily towards individuals at the highest absolute risk and with the greatest gap to achieving optimal BP. Given the heightened urgency in patients with high predicted risk, immediate pharmacological intervention — potentially with dual therapy — should be considered as the default strategy. Naturally, this approach must be tailored to patient preferences and tolerability; nonetheless, the evidence increasingly supports early, decisive intervention in those most likely to benefit.

### Clinical trial design principles and outcomes definitions for device-based therapies for hypertension: a consensus document from the hypertension academic research consortium [^1ad6939b]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite its recognition as the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, the awareness, treatment, and control of blood pressure (BP) have plateaued if not modestly declined. In the United States alone, for example, more than half of individuals with hypertension — representing > 29 million people — are estimated to have BP exceeding professional society and guideline-recommended treatment goals. As the most commonly diagnosed condition and largest contributor to mortality in industrialized countries, hypertension is present in > 1 in 3 individuals, and the risk of cardiovascular mortality doubles for every 20 mm Hg and 10 mm Hg increase in the systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), respectively. With population growth and aging, the global prevalence of hypertension and associated adverse outcomes are expected to continue to escalate.

Irrespective of baseline hypertension severity, even moderate reductions in BP translate into clinically meaningful reductions in cardiac, renal, and cerebral vascular-related adverse events. Recent large randomized clinical trials have also demonstrated the clinical benefits of more intensive BP reduction, leading to revision of guideline-directed treatment goals to further lower SBP and DBP standards. Countering evidence-based efforts to improve BP with a broad spectrum of pharmaceutical therapies are routine challenges in clinical practice that include patient intolerance of medication-related adverse effects, general nonadherence with prescribed therapy, and physician inertia for treatment of an illness that remains largely silent until onset of clinically irreversible conditions.

### Hypertensive crisis during pregnancy and postpartum period [^a8873dbc]. Seminars in Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Hypertension affects 10% of pregnancies, many with underlying chronic hypertension, and approximately 1–2% will undergo a hypertensive crisis at some point during their lives. Hypertensive crisis includes hypertensive urgency and emergency; the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists describes a hypertensive emergency in pregnancy as persistent (lasting 15 min or more), acute-onset, severe hypertension, defined as systolic BP greater than 160 mmHg or diastolic BP > 110 mmHg in the setting of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. Pregnancy may be complicated by hypertensive crisis, with lower blood pressure threshold for end-organ damage than non-pregnant patients. Maternal assessment should include a thorough history. Fetal assessment should include heart rate tracing, ultrasound for growth and amniotic assessment, and Doppler evaluation if growth restriction is suspected. Initial management of hypertensive emergency (systolic BP > 160 mmHg or diastolic BP > 110 mmHg in the setting of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia) generally includes the rapid reduction of blood pressure through the use of intravenous antihypertensive medications, with goal systolic blood pressure between 140 mmHg and 150 mmHg and diastolic pressure between 90 mmHg and 100 mmHg. First-line intravenous drugs include labetalol and hydralazine, but other agents may be used, including esmolol, nicardipine, nifedipine, and, as a last resort, sodium nitroprusside. Among patients with hypertensive urgency, slower blood pressure reduction can be provided with oral agents. The objective of this article is to review the current understanding, diagnosis, and management of hypertensive crisis during pregnancy and the postpartum period.

### Management of inpatient elevated blood pressures: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines [^05e5900b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Management of elevated blood pressure (BP) during hospitalization varies widely, with many hospitalized adults experiencing BPs higher than those recommended for the outpatient setting.

Purpose

To systematically identify guidelines on elevated BP management in the hospital.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Guidelines International Network, and specialty society websites from 1 January 2010 to 29 January 2024.

Study Selection

Clinical practice guidelines pertaining to BP management for the adult and older adult populations in ambulatory, emergency department, and inpatient settings.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently screened articles, assessed quality, and extracted data. Disagreements were resolved via consensus. Recommendations on treatment targets, preferred antihypertensive classes, and follow-up were collected for ambulatory and inpatient settings.

Data Synthesis

Fourteen clinical practice guidelines met inclusion criteria (11 were assessed as high-quality per the AGREE II [Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II] instrument), 11 provided broad BP management recommendations, and 1 each was specific to the emergency department setting, older adults, and hypertensive crises. No guidelines provided goals for inpatient BP or recommendations for managing asymptomatic moderately elevated BP in the hospital. Six guidelines defined hypertensive urgency as BP above 180/120 mm Hg, with hypertensive emergencies requiring the addition of target organ damage. Hypertensive emergency recommendations consistently included use of intravenous antihypertensives in intensive care settings. Recommendations for managing hypertensive urgencies were inconsistent, from expert consensus, and focused on the emergency department. Outpatient treatment with oral medications and follow-up in days to weeks were most often advised. In contrast, outpatient BP goals were clearly defined, varying between 130/80 and 140/90 mm Hg.

Limitation

Exclusion of non-English-language guidelines and guidelines specific to subpopulations.

Conclusion

Despite general consensus on outpatient BP management, guidance on inpatient management of elevated BP without symptoms is lacking, which may contribute to variable practice patterns.

We therefore evaluated the relationship between ED systolic BP (SBP) and the risk of having mean SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg in the subsequent year after the ED visit, after accounting for multiple patient demographic and clinical conditions, including an existing diagnosis of hypertension, ED disposition, and pain‐related ED chief complaint. Diastolic BP (DBP), alternative post‐ED BP thresholds, different time intervals of post‐ED follow‐up (within 6 months and months 4–12 after the ED visit), and stratification by diagnosed hypertension were examined in secondary and sensitivity analyses.

### Is it time to retire the diagnosis "Hypertensive emergency"? [^9858647e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The recognition of the risks of high blood pressure (BP) in the last century was highlighted by observing the acute association between very high BP and medical catastrophes in emergency settings, including stroke, acute left ventricular failure, and myocardial infarction. Edward Freis was among the first authors to propose the concept of "hypertensive crisis", which he characterized as a life‐threatening disorder caused by acute or severe elevation of BP and clinical manifestations secondary to hypertension. According to Freis, the clinical manifestations included encephalopathy, neuroretinitis, evidence of rapidly advancing renal impairment, and acute heart failure.

Hypertension guidelines incorporated the diagnosis of hypertensive crisis, and the 1984 Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure report proposed the classification of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies. Hypertensive emergencies were characterized by hypertensive encephalopathy, intracranial hemorrhage, acute left ventricular failure, dissecting aortic aneurysm, severe hypertension, toxemia, head trauma, extensive burns, unstable angina pectoris, and acute myocardial infarction, in which BP should be lowered within 1 hour. Urgencies were defined as situations in which BP should be controlled within 24 hours, including accelerated or malignant hypertension, perioperative hypertension, and patients requiring emergency surgeries.

With slight variations in the criteria for the definition of urgencies and emergencies, these recommendations have been repeatedly copied and pasted into the Joint National Committee guidelines and the guidelines from Europe and other countries. The 2017 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology hypertension guidelinesdefined hypertensive emergencies as severe BP elevations (> 180/120 mm Hg) associated with evidence of hypertensive encephalopathy, intracerebral hemorrhage, acute ischemic stroke, acute myocardial infarction, acute left ventricular failure, unstable angina pectoris, dissecting aortic aneurysm, acute renal failure, and eclampsia. The guideline defined hypertensive urgencies as situations associated with severe BP elevation in patients without an acute or impending change in target organ damage or dysfunction. The 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines of hypertensionincluded the diagnosis of malignant hypertension (characterized by funduscopic changes or disseminated intravascular coagulation), excluded any presentation of stroke from the criteria to characterize hypertensive emergencies, and proposed a similar definition for hypertensive urgencies.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^b4e0a966]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Hypertension definitions and treatment thresholds — VA/DoD CPG background summarizes evolving criteria and the Work Group definition. JNC 7 defined hypertension (HTN) as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg, and prehypertension was classified as SBP 120–139 or DBP 80–89. The 2017 ACC/AHA defines HTN as an SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg, a DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg, or both; it removed prehypertension and added elevated blood pressure defined as an SBP of 120–129 with a DBP < 80 mm Hg. For this CPG, the Work Group defines HTN as an SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg, a DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, or both, and also as SBP and/or DBP at or above 130/90 mm Hg, assuming proper measurement technique. The page notes that treatment benefit has not been proven for lowering slightly elevated blood pressures to a "normal" blood pressure of 115/75 mm Hg, and for those with a blood pressure above "normal" but not in the hypertensive range there is no evidence to date that there is a benefit from treatment.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 203: chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^49325468]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 203 — definition and diagnosis of chronic hypertension in pregnancy states that chronic hypertension in pregnancy is defined as hypertension diagnosed or present before pregnancy or before 20 weeks of gestation, and hypertension that is diagnosed for the first time during pregnancy and that does not resolve in the typical postpartum period also is classified as chronic hypertension; traditionally, criteria are a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more, a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or more, or both; in general, it is recommended that a diagnosis of hypertension requires at least two determinations at least 4 hours apart, although on occasion the diagnosis can be confirmed within a shorter interval (even minutes) to facilitate timely therapy; recent ACC/AHA recommendations include classifying blood pressure into four categories — 1) normal (systolic blood pressure less than 120 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure less than 80 mm Hg), 2) elevated (systolic blood pressure of 120–129 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure less than 80 mm Hg), 3) stage 1 hypertension (systolic blood pressure of 130–139 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of 80–89 mm Hg), and 4) stage 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or more); the recommendations now suggest beginning treatment in nonpregnant adults with risk factors for current or future cardiovascular disease in patients with stage 1 hypertension (systolic blood pressure of 130–139 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of 80–89 mm Hg).

### High blood pressure in the emergency department as an opportunistic screening tool for detection of hypertension [^370acdd5]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

What is known about the topic?

Hypertension is the most preventable cause of morbidity and mortality, but many are underdiagnosed and lack treatment control.
Hypertension in the Emergency Department is commonly observed, but mostly used for short term evaluation.
The utility of blood pressure measured at the Emergency Department as a screening tool for undiagnosed hypertension is uncertain.

What this study adds

In patients without hypertension a blood pressure ≥ 160/100 mmHg at an ED visit can reveal undiagnosed hypertension in one third of the patients.
Blood pressure measured at the emergency department might be used as a screening tool for hypertension.

### Evaluation and management of hypertensive emergency [^cffc3dc7]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Hypertensive emergencies cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly when acute organ injury is present. Careful and effective strategies to reduce blood pressure and diminish the effects of pressure-mediated injury are essential. While the selection of specific antihypertensive medications varies little across different forms of hypertensive emergencies, the intensity of blood pressure reduction to the target pressure differs substantially. Treatment hinges on balancing the positive effects of lowering blood pressure with the potential for negative effects of organ hypoperfusion in patients with altered autoregulatory mechanisms. When patients do not have acute organ injury in addition to severe hypertension, they benefit from a conservative, outpatient approach to blood pressure management. In all cases, long term control of blood pressure is paramount to prevent recurrent hypertensive emergencies and improve overall prognosis. This review discusses the current evidence and guidelines on the evaluation and management of hypertensive emergency.

### Epidemiological, pathophysiological and clinical significance of systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure [^97f72b40]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Long-term population surveys and studies of untreated hypertensive patients both strongly suggest that over the age of about 45, the height of the systolic blood pressure is a better predictor of cardiovascular outcome than the diastolic pressure. Research into echocardiographic left ventricular size, endothelial function and thromborheology also back up this supposition. In clinical practice, the treatment of isolated systolic hypertension has been shown to be very worthwhile. There remains some uncertainty as to the relative significance of diastolic blood pressure when it is frankly high, as in severe systo-diastolic hypertension. However some clinicians and epidemiologists have questioned whether diastolic pressure is still worth measuring, given the overwhelming importance of the height of the systolic blood pressure at predicting outcome.

### Editors' commentary on the 2023 ESH management of arterial hypertension guidelines [^0b0b0009]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines are ideally suited to the provision of advice on the prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure (BP). The recently published European Society of Hypertension (ESH) 2023 ESH Guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension is the latest in a long series of high BP clinical practice guidelines. It closely resembles the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/ESH guidelines, with incremental rather than major changes. Although the ESH guidelines are primarily written for European clinicians and public health workers, there is a high degree of concordance between its recommendations and those in the other major BP guidelines. Despite the large number of national and international BP guidelines around the world, general population surveys demonstrate that BP guidelines are not being well implemented in any part of the world. The level of BP, which is the basis for diagnosis and management, continues to be poorly measured in routine clinical practice and control of hypertension remains suboptimal, even to a conservative BP target such as a systolic/diastolic BP < 140/90 mmHg. BP guidelines need to focus much more on implementation of recommendations for accurate diagnosis and strategies for improved control in those being treated for hypertension. An evolving body of implementation science can assist in meeting this goal. Given the enormous health, social, and financial burden of high BP, better diagnosis and management should be an imperative for clinicians, government, and others responsible for the provision of health care services. Hopefully, the 2023 ESH will help enable this.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients in the emergency department with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure [^6bfa708a]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Definition — Asymptomatic markedly elevated blood pressure: JNC 7 classified stage 2 hypertension as systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 100 mm Hg, although many clinical studies use thresholds of systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 110 mm Hg. This policy considers markedly elevated blood pressure to be consistent with the JNC 7 definition of stage 2 hypertension, and the term asymptomatic markedly elevated blood pressure is used where asymptomatic hypertension had previously been used in the published literature.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 203: chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^12e3d44c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Chronic hypertension in pregnancy — acute-onset severe hypertension thresholds and timing: Antihypertensive treatment should be initiated expeditiously for acute-onset, severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg or more or diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or more) that is confirmed as persistent (15 minutes or more). The available literature suggests that antihypertensive agents should be administered within 30–60 minutes; it is recommended to administer antihypertensive therapy as soon as reasonably possible after the criteria for acute-onset severe hypertension are met, and evidence suggests that therapy should be initiated within 60 minutes. If blood pressure remains elevated after initiating antihypertensive therapy or for initial blood pressure elevations of 180 mm Hg or more systolic or 120 mm Hg or more diastolic, this represents further and ongoing risk of severe maternal morbidity and mortality and requires accelerated maternal and obstetric evaluation and decision making by the obstetric care provider.

Hypertension affects ≈29% of the US adult population, an estimated 72 million people, with a prevalence of > 65% in persons older than 60 years. 1, 2 It is an important risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), accounting for ≈41% of all CVD deaths. 3, 4 Indeed, there is a known graded relationship between increasing blood pressure (BP) and the risk of CVD, starting at 115/75 mm Hg. 5 Based on observational data, an increase in BP of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic is associated with a doubling of the risk of CVD death, regardless of age. 5 Further, hypertension in middle age is known to increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia in later life, an important issue given the aging demographic in Western societies. 6 Finally, despite the fact that BP recognition and control are improving, it is concerning that nearly half of the hypertensive population remains suboptimally controlled. 2

With the 2003 Joint National Committee's seventh report (JNC 7) becoming increasingly outdated and the 2011 Institute of Medicine report calling for high‐quality evidence‐based guidelines, 7, 8 the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) was initially appointed to create an updated treatment guideline for hypertension under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although the NIH ultimately withdrew from the guideline development process at a late stage in the development of JNC 8, the panel decided, nonetheless, to publish their recommendations independently.

The panel aimed to answer 3 questions: Does initiating antihypertensive treatment at specific BP thresholds improve health outcomes? Does treatment with antihypertensive therapy to a specific BP goal improve health outcomes? Are there differences in benefit/harm between antihypertensive drugs or drug classes on specific health outcomes? The committee focused exclusively on large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as supporting evidence, although 5 of the 9 recommendations in the final report were ultimately based on expert opinion. Partly in response to JNC 8, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) are now in the process of developing official hypertension guidelines. In this review, we discuss the basis of each recommendation from the JNC 8 panel, provide additional insights, and compare these recommendations with guidelines from other professional societies to generate suggestions for the new AHA/ACC hypertension guideline committee.

### Management of patients with hypertensive urgencies and emergencies: a systematic review of the literature [^edc749d9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertensive urgencies and emergencies are common clinical occurrences in hypertensive patients. Treatment practices vary considerably to because of the lack of evidence supporting the use of one therapeutic agent over another. This paper was designed to review the evidence for various pharmacotherapeutic regimens in the management of hypertensive urgencies and emergencies, in terms of the agents' abilities to reach predetermined "safe" goal blood pressures (BPs), and to prevent adverse events.

Methods

medline was searched from 1966 to 2001, and the reference lists of all the articles were retrieved and searched for relevant references, and experts in the field were contacted to identify other relevant studies. The Cochrane Library was also searched. Studies that were eligible for inclusion in this review were systematic reviews of randomized control trials (RCTs) and individual RCTs, all-or-none studies, systematic reviews of cohort studies and individual cohort studies, and outcomes research. No language restrictions were used.

Results

None of the trials included in this review identified an optimal rate of BP lowering in hypertensive emergencies and urgencies. The definitions of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies were not consistent, but emergencies always involved target end-organ damage, and urgencies were without such damage. Measures of outcome were not uniform between studies. The 4 hypertensive emergency and 15 hypertensive urgency studies represented 236 and 1,074 patients, respectively. The evidence indicated a nonsignificant trend toward increased efficacy with urapidil compared to nitroprusside for hypertensive emergencies (number needed to treat [NNT] for urapidil to achieve target BP, 12; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], number of patients needed to harm [NNH], 5 to NNT, 40 compared to nitroprusside). Several medications were efficacious in treating hypertensive urgencies, including: nicardipine (NNT for nicardipine compared to plabebo, 2 in one study [95% CI, 1 to 5] and 1 in another [95% CI, 1 to 1]); lacidipine (NNT, 2; 95% CI, 1 to 8 for lacidipine vs nifedipine) or urapidil (NNT for urapidil compared to enalaprilat and nifedipine, 4; 95% CI, 3 to 6); and nitroprusside and fenoldopam (all patients reached target BP in 2 studies). The studies reported 2 cases of cerebral ischemia secondary to nifedipine.

Conclusions

Many effective agents exist for the treatment of hypertensive crises. Because of the lack of large randomized controlled trials, many questions remain unanswered, such as follow-up times and whether any of the studied agents have mortality benefit.

### Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to diagnose and manage hypertension [^76e0ecd0]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Table 1.
Proposals for Ambulatory Blood Pressure Thresholds

In 2017, the new American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline reclassified office BP and proposed new thresholds for the ambulatory BP, albeit without explicit justification. The rationale of the proposed thresholds was described in a later separate publication in 2019. Thresholds were, therefore, derived from the IDACO databasethat yielded risks equivalent to the new office BP categories. Among 11 152 participants representative of 13 populations, the thresholds indicating elevated 24-hour, daytime, and nighttime systolic/diastolic BPs were 120/75, 120/80, and 105/65 mm Hg, and for stages 1 and 2, ambulatory hypertension the thresholds were 125/75 and 130/80 mm Hg, 130/80 and 135/85 mm Hg, and 110/65 and 120/70 mm Hg, respectively (Table 1). In general, the thresholds proposed in the European and American guidelines closely approximated to the outcome-driven thresholds. The systolic thresholds derived in the Jackson Heart Study in relation to outcome were substantially higher compared with those proposed by European and American guidelines and those derived from the IDACO database. Ravenell et alproposed ethnic differences as a possible explanation.

### Hypertensive urgency not really an urgent problem… [^062f9f82]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question How urgently should we aim to control hypertensive urgency. Bottom Line It seems that rapid treatment of patients with hypertensive urgency is unsuccessful and unnecessary. In this study of almost 60, 000 patients, 80% did not have controlled blood pressure after one month of treatment, including patients who were hospitalized. On the other hand, the risk of a major cardiovascular event was also low: one in 1, 000 over the next seven days. Synopsis These authors identified all patients in a single health care system who presented to an office or emergency department with a blood pressure of at least 180 mm Hg systolic and/or 110 mm Hg diastolic. Most of the patients in the analysis just met these minimums; only 10. 2% had a systolic pressure of 200 mm Hg or higher and
5. 7% had a diastolic pressure of 120 mm Hg or higher. The mean age of the patients was 63. 1 years,
57.

7% were women, and 76% were white. A small proportion were hospitalized for blood pressure management; however, one-half of these patients had pressures of at least 200 mm Hg systolic or at least 120 mm Hg diastolic. Regardless of treatment or place of treatment, the likelihood of blood pressure control and the likelihood of adverse effects were low. At one month, less than 15% of patients had controlled blood pressure; at six months, less than 40% had controlled blood pressure. Even so, the likelihood of a major adverse cardiovascular event was low in the next seven days, at eight to 30 days, or within six months. Hospitalization was not associated with a decrease in the risk of adverse outcomes.

### Underdiagnosis of isolated systolic and isolated diastolic hypertension [^1f62c4eb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Systolic and diastolic hypertension independently predict the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. It remains unclear how systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, and other patient characteristics influence the initial diagnosis of hypertension. Here, we use a cohort of 146,816 adults in a large healthcare system to examine how elevated systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure measurements influence initial diagnosis of hypertension and how other patient characteristics influence the diagnosis. Thirty-four percent of the cohort were diagnosed with hypertension within 1 year. In multivariable logistic regression of the diagnosis of hypertension, controlling for covariates, isolated systolic hypertensive measures (odds ratio [OR] 0.42 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.41 to 0.43]) and isolated diastolic hypertensive measures (OR 0.32 [95% CI 0.31 to 0.33]) were less likely to lead to hypertension diagnosis when compared with combined hypertensive measures. Higher levels of systolic blood pressure had a greater impact on hypertension diagnosis (OR 1.77 [95% CI 1.75 to 1.79] per Z-score) than did higher levels of diastolic blood pressure (OR 1.34 [95% CI 1.32 to 1.36] per Z-score). Older age, non-white race/ethnicity, and medical comorbidities all predicted the establishment of a diagnosis of hypertension. Isolated systolic and isolated diastolic hypertension are underdiagnosed in clinical practice, and several patient-centered factors also strongly influence whether a diagnosis is made. In conclusion, our findings uncover a care gap that can be closed with increased attention to the independent influence of systolic and diastolic hypertension and the various patient-centered factors that may impact hypertension diagnosis.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to management of hypertensive emergency, AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASH/ASPC/NMA/PCNA 2018 guidelines recommend to reduce SBP by no more than 25% within the first hour in adult patients without a compelling condition. Reduce SBP to 160/100 mmHg within the next 2–6 hours, and then cautiously to normal during the following 24–48 hours.

### How important it is to determine the blood pressure in paediatric patients? [^ce17c1fd]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of hypertension among the paediatric population is 1%-2%. The emergency physician should recognise potentially harmful blood pressure (BP) levels and ensure they are adequately treated, in order to avoid life-threatening complications. A hypertensive emergency is a severely elevated BP complicated by target organ dysfunction (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and/or renal). Hypertensive urgency, however, is a severe elevation in BP without target organ dysfunction. This distinction is critical for the clinical approach. The authors present a case of a severe hypertension due to primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. In this case, the lack of BP measurement in the infant surveillance and the devaluation of an albuminuria detected in a previous routine urine examination, have culminated in a late diagnosis of a severe hypertension, with subsequent effects on target organs.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients with asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department [^5bb7d0da]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department — guideline statements — emphasize limited need for emergency therapy without target organ damage but provide mixed direction on immediate treatment. JNC VI stated, "Elevated blood pressure alone, in the absence of symptoms or new or progressive target organ damage, rarely requires emergency therapy". JNC 7 recommendations state that "marked elevations of blood pressure without target organ damage "usually do not require hospitalization, but should receive immediate combination oral antihypertensive therapy". This statement appears to be consensus in origin because no supportive references were cited, and the authors noted, "We could find no evidence demonstrating improved patient outcomes or decreased mortality or morbidity with acute management of elevated blood pressure in the ED".

### New developments in the management of hypertension… [^bfc8a607]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Systolic Blood Pressure Although physicians traditionally have emphasized management of diastolic blood pressure, 4 systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure correlate more strongly with cardiovascular disease risk than does diastolic blood pressure, and treatment of isolated systolic blood pressure reduces vascular complications. 6 This finding is especially important because most patients with uncontrolled hypertension have isolated elevation of systolic blood pressure. 7–9 Thus, persistent isolated elevation of systolic blood pressure should be treated to achieve a normal range, even in the presence of normal diastolic blood pressure. Diastolic blood pressure is still important, however, because it may be a clinical marker for hypertensive urgency or emergency.

In hypertensive urgencies, elevated blood pressure that is not associated with new or progressive end-organ damage may be lowered over hours to days in an outpatient setting. Hypertensive emergencies, however, require immediate lowering of blood pressure through intensive inpatient care and parenteral medications to limit or prevent progressive end-organ damage. 30 showed eplerenone to be as effective as amlodipine in the treatment of systolic hypertension, with the added advantage of a reduction in microalbuminuria in the patients with this condition at baseline. Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality outcome data are not yet available with this agent. 44), and isolated systolic hypertension.

Both borderline and true isolated systolic hypertension have received more attention in the past decade after large European and North American trials consistently demonstrated the value of treating these conditions. JNC 7 recommends similar treatment for hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension for younger and older patients.
3. Reduced rates of complications are substantial, including stroke, ischemic heart disease events, all cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular deaths. 45 Despite these reductions, undertreatment of isolated systolic hypertension has been called "the major problem for the lack of hypertension treatment and control in the United States today.

We suggest using attended or unattended, fully automated office blood pressure measurement (programmed to wait five minutes and record the average of three measurements separated by at least 30 seconds). When fully automated blood pressure measurement is not available, we suggest measurement of blood pressure using standard technique and a properly calibrated and validated sphygmomanometer. We suggest using out-of-office blood pressure monitoring methods (ambulatory 24-hour monitoring or home blood pressure measurements) to inform the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Among patients treated for hypertension, we suggest offering home blood pressure self-monitoring with co-interventions for lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

### Hypertensive urgency in the office setting… [^cbdd5b43]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Importance The prevalence and short-term outcomes of hypertensive urgency are unknown. Guidelines recommend achieving blood pressure control within 24 to 48 hours. However, some patients are referred to the emergency department or directly admitted to the hospital, and whether hospital management is associated with better outcomes is unknown. Mean body mass index was 31. 1; mean systolic blood pressure,
182. 5 mm Hg; and mean diastolic blood pressure, 96. 4 mm Hg. Quiz Ref IDApproximately one-third of the US population has hypertension, which is associated with an increased risk for end-organ damage, mainly myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and kidney damage.

1–4 For chronic uncontrolled hypertension, every 20–mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure or 10–mm Hg increase in diastolic blood pressure is associated with doubling of vascular mortality. 5 Because organ damage results from increased blood pressure over time, physicians may be concerned about the potential for end-organ damage after severely elevated blood pressure, even for short periods. Hypertensive urgency is defined as SBP of at least 180 mm Hg and/or DBP of at least 110 mm Hg, without associated end-organ damage. 6–8 The prevalence of hypertensive urgency in the outpatient setting is unknown, and management is complicated by a lack of observational studies or randomized clinical trials. The seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommended gradual blood pressure control for 24 to 48 hours, 4 but this was not addressed in the eighth report.

### Hypertension management in emergency departments [^9923f10b]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines revising the diagnosis threshold for hypertension and goal BP to 130/80 mm Hg among high-risk patientsadds to the importance of identifying and addressing elevated BP in the ED, particularly for ED patients without access other sources of care. While there is considerable evidence linked to long-term outcomes that guide non-ED assessment and management of nonemergent BP elevations, evidence to inform ED care is still evolving. The 2013 ACEP clinical policy writing group articulated this noting significant gaps in evidence regarding ED hypertension screening, management of nonemergent elevated BP, antihypertensive medication initiation or titration, and timing of follow-up to improve short- and long-term outcomes while minimizing risks of adverse events.

While the ACC/AHA guidelines have traction in the United States, the 2018 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines have noted differences in defining hypertension and targets for treatment. The ESC/ESH guidelines define hypertension as ≥ 140/90 mm Hg and target treatment based on age and risk. For patients with BP 130–139/85–89 mm Hg, ESC/ESH guidelines recommend lifestyle change and consideration of drug treatment, particularly if patients have high cardiovascular risk. For patients ≤ 80 years who have BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg, drug treatment is indicated. For patients > 80 years, ESC/ESH guidelines recommend drug treatment for SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg. If patients tolerate treatment to maintain BP < 140/90 mm Hg, further lowering targets a DBP < 80 mm Hg and SBP based on age (SBP target 120–129 mm Hg if age < 65 years, 130–139 mm Hg if 65–79 years, and 130–139 mm Hg as tolerated in those > 80 years). For patients with known coronary artery disease, therapy is targeted to maintain BP < 130/80 mm Hg. Both guidelines have similar recommendations for BP measurement, lifestyle modifications, and recommended medications. Both recommend strong consideration for single-pill combination antihypertensive medications.

### Association between hypertensive urgencies and subsequent cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension [^aaf48bac]. Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether patients with hypertensive urgency have a higher risk for subsequent cardiovascular events compared with hypertensive patients without this event.

Methods

Overall, 384 patients with hypertensive urgency and 295 control patients were followed up for at least 2 years. Hypertensive urgency was defined as a systolic blood pressure above 220 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure above 120 mmHg without any evidence of acute end-organ damage. The control group consisted of patients admitted to the emergency department with a systolic blood pressure between 135 to 180 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure between 85–110 mmHg. The number of cardiovascular events defined as acute coronary syndrome, acute stroke, atrial fibrillation, acute left ventricular failure and aortic aneurysm were consecutively analyzed during follow-up. The median follow-up time was 4.2 years (interquartile range 2.9–5.7 years). Twenty-six patients of the urgency group and 23 patients of the control group were lost for follow-up.

Results

Overall, 117 (17%) patients had nonfatal clinical cardiovascular events and 13 had (2%) fatal cardiovascular events. The frequency of cardiovascular events was significantly higher in patients with hypertensive urgencies (88 vs. 42; P = 0.005). The Cox regression analysis identified age (P < 0.001) and hypertensive urgencies (P = 0.035) as independent predictors for subsequent cardiovascular events.

Conclusions

Hypertensive urgencies are associated with an increased risk for subsequent cardiovascular events in patients with arterial hypertension.

### Clinical features in the management of selected hypertensive emergencies [^376693b7]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

A hypertensive emergency is a clinical diagnosis that is appropriate when marked hypertension is associated with acute target-organ damage; in this setting, lowering of blood pressure (BP) is typically begun within hours of diagnosis. For hypertensive urgency with no acute target-organ damage, BP lowering may occur over hours to days. A hypertensive emergency may present with cardiac, renal, neurologic, hemorrhagic, or obstetric manifestations, but prompt recognition of the condition and institution of rapidly acting parenteral therapy to lower BP (typically in an intensive care unit) are widely recommended. For aortic dissection, the systolic BP target is lower than 120 mm Hg, to be achieved during the first 20 minutes using a beta-blocker (typically esmolol) and a vasodilator to reduce both shear stress on the aortic tear and the BP, respectively. Otherwise, sodium nitroprusside is the agent with the lowest acquisition cost and longest record of successful use in hypertensive emergencies; however, it is metabolized to toxic thiocyanate and cyanide. Other attractive agents include fenoldopam mesylate, nicardipine, and labetalol; in pregnant women, magnesium and nifedipine are used commonly. Most authors suggest a reduction in mean arterial pressure of approximately 10% during the first hour and a further 10% to 15% during the next 2 to 4 hours; hypoperfusion can result if the BP is lowered too suddenly or too far (eg, into the range of < 140/90 mm Hg). Oral antihypertensive therapy can usually be instituted after 6 to 12 hours of parenteral therapy, and the patient moved out of the intensive care unit, when consideration should be given to screening for secondary causes of hypertension. Long-term follow-up to ensure adequate control of hypertension is necessary to prevent further target-organ damage and recurrence of another hypertensive emergency.

### Potential impact of 2017 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association hypertension guideline on contemporary practice: a cross-sectional analysis from NCDR PINNACLE registry [^7295f6b3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adultsprovides blood pressure (BP) thresholds for the diagnosis of hypertension, initiation of antihypertensive treatment, and targets for BP control. Compared with recommendations from the 2014 report from the expert panel, composed of members appointed to the intended Eighth Joint National Committeeand the 2003 Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7), notable differences in definitions exist (Table 1).

Table 1
BP Levels to Define Hypertension, Recommend Antihypertensive Therapy, and Provide Treatment Goals, According to the ACC/AHA Guideline, 2014 Expert Panel Report, and JNC7

First, the ACC/AHA guideline uses a lower systolic and diastolic BP threshold of 130/80 mm Hg to define hypertension, compared with 140/90 mm Hg used by the previous 2014 expert panel report and JNC7. Although all 3 documents recommend the use of antihypertensive therapy in those with a BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg, the most recent guideline also recommends therapy for individuals with a BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg and either a 10‐year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk ≥ 10% or high‐risk comorbidities (ischemic heart disease, heart failure [HF], diabetes, or chronic kidney disease). Based in part on data from SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline recommends a more aggressive BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg in all adults. In contrast, the 2014 expert panel report recommends a goal of < 140/90 mm Hg for all except those aged > 60 years, for whom a target of < 150/90 mm Hg is recommended. Similarly, the JNC7 set a BP goal of < 140/90 mm Hg for the general population, reserving a more intensive goal of < 130/80 mm Hg for those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease.

BP Classification

The most obvious difference between the 2 guidelines is their approach to BP classification and the BP cut points recommended for the identification of hypertension (Table 4). The ACC/AHA proposes categories for normal BP, elevated BP, and 2 stages of hypertension, with a cut point of systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 130 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 80 mm Hg for identification of hypertension. This is a change from the preceding 2003 Joint National Committee 7 CPG, which recommended use of an SBP and/or DBP cut point of 140 and/or 90 mm Hg, except in adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) or chronic kidney disease (CKD), where an SBP and/or DBP cut point of 130 and/or 80 mm Hg was recommended. The ESC/ESH classifies BP into optimal BP, normal BP, high normal BP, 3 grades of systolic/diastolic hypertension, and isolated systolic hypertension. It retains the same SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg cut points for diagnosis of hypertension recommended in the preceding 2013 ESH/ESC hypertension CPG.

Table 4
Blood Pressure Classification

The potential US population impact of the ACC/AHA guideline was estimated by an analysis of the 2011 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In this analysis, 24.1% of US adults ≥ 20 years of age reported that they were taking antihypertensive medication and were therefore considered to have hypertension. Of those not taking antihypertensive medication, 7.7% had an SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, and 13.7% had an SBP 130 to 139 mm Hg or DBP 80 to 89 mm Hg, yielding a 46% prevalence of hypertension for adults using the SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg cut points, or taking antihypertensive medication definition of hypertension compared with a prevalence of 32% using the SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, or taking antihypertensive medication definition. Prevalence estimates using the 2 definitions of hypertension were more discrepant at younger age than at older age, and in men compared with women. Taken altogether, the ACC/AHA reclassification of BP resulted in an estimated population increase in hypertension prevalence of ≈14%. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey analyses, however, are likely to overestimate hypertension prevalence because participant BP was only measured on a single occasion and presumed hypertension was not confirmed by out-of-office BP readings.

Known hypertension — prospective multicenter observational data indicate that sphygmomanometric blood pressures obtained in both the office and ambulatory setting were prognostic: both office and ambulatory measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly predicted the primary endpoint of fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events; however, blood pressures were not obtained in the emergency setting and 3 blood pressure readings were obtained on separate visits, which is not feasible in an emergency setting.

Best practice: the diagnosis of hypertension

General practitioners should establish whether blood pressure has been measured and managed in all adults before non‐urgent surgical referrals. A blood pressure measurement taken within the preceding 12 months should be detailed in the referral letter.

The diagnosis of hypertension in patients referred for investigation of surgical disease that are not treated for hypertension and who have not had a blood pressure measurement in the preceding 12 months follows the same process as any other primary care patient. We recommend that the practice instigates ambulatory or home blood pressure measurements before non‐urgent referrals if the standard blood pressure is equal to or greater than 160/100 mmHg. If the patient's ABPM/HBPM blood pressure is equal to or greater than 150/95 mmHg (or equal to or greater than 135/85 mmHg with target organ damage), the patient is diagnosed as having hypertension; treatment should be discussed and commenced using the NICE/BHS CG127 algorithm 19. This process can take place at the same time as urgent surgical referral, but a reduction in blood pressure to less than 160/100 mmHg should precede non‐urgent surgical referral. The referral letter should document that an informed discussion has taken place with patients who decline treatment, or detail that all appropriate attempts have been made to reduce blood pressure for patients with persistent hypertension, which might have included specialist investigations.

Surgical outpatients should request that general practitioners forward primary care blood pressure measurements if these have not been documented in the referral letter. Pre‐operative assessment clinics should measure the blood pressures of patients who present without documentation of primary care blood pressures. If the blood pressure is raised above 180 mmHg systolic or 110 mmHg diastolic, the patient should return to their general practice for primary care assessment and management of their blood pressure, as detailed above (Fig. 2). If the blood pressure is above 140 mmHg systolic or 90 mmHg diastolic, but below 180 mmHg systolic and below 110 mmHg diastolic, the GP should be informed, but elective surgery should not be postponed.

### Hypertensive urgency: an emergency department pipeline to primary care pilot study [^c8c53c34]. American Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Optimal triage of patients with hypertensive urgency (HU) in the emergency department (ED) is not well established. 2017 ACC/AHA hypertension (HTN) guidelines recommend treatment initiation and follow-up within 1 week. Objectives of our pilot study were to evaluate feasibility and impact of directly connecting ED patients with HU to outpatient HTN management on blood pressure (BP) control and ED utilization.

Methods

ED patients with HU and no primary care physician were scheduled by a referral coordinator for an initial appointment in a HTN clinic embedded within a primary care practice. BP control and ED utilization over the subsequent 90 days were tracked and compared with BP at time of the referral ED visit, and ED utilization in the 90 days preceding referral.

Results

Data are reported for the first 40 referred patients. Average time to first visit was 7.8 days. Mean age was 51 years (range 28–76), 75% were African-American, and mean pooled 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk was 20.8%. Mean BP declined from 198/116 mm Hg at ED visit to 167/98 mm Hg at HTN clinic visit 1 to 136/83 by 6 weeks and was sustained at 90 days. Total ED visits for the group decreased from 61 in the 90 days prior to referral, to 18 in the 90 days after the first HTN clinic visit.

Conclusions

In this pilot study, coordinated referral between the ED and primary care provides safe, timely care for this high ASCVD risk population and leads to sustained reductions in BP and ED utilization.

### Minimally sufficient numbers of measurements for validation of 24-hour blood pressure monitoring in chronic kidney disease [^93abfc07]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) remains a reference standard, but the minimal number of ABPM readings required to diagnose hypertension has not been empirically validated. Among 360 patients with chronic kidney disease and 38 healthy controls, 24-hour blood pressure was recorded 2 times per hour during the night and 3 times per hour during the day. All subjects had at least 90% of the expected readings recorded. From this full set of ABPM recordings, we selected variable numbers of measurements and compared the performance of the selected readings against that of the full sample under either random or sequential sampling schemes. With 8 randomly selected systolic blood pressure readings, we were able to make diagnostic decisions in concordance with that from the full ABPM sample 91.0% of the time (kappa 0.804). With 15 randomly selected diastolic blood pressure readings, we made concordant decisions 96.3% of the time (kappa 0.810). A serial selection scheme generally required a greater number of readings to achieve the same levels of concordance with the full ABPM data. With a random selection scheme, 26 readings provided 95% confidence that the sample mean will be within 5 mm Hg of the true systolic blood pressure mean, and within 3.5 mm Hg of the true diastolic blood pressure mean.

### Blood pressure thresholds in pregnancy for identifying maternal and infant risk: a secondary analysis of community-level interventions for pre-eclampsia (CLIP) trial data [^e61bc823]. The Lancet: Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension in pregnancy has traditionally been defined as a systolic blood pressure (sBP) of at least 140 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure (dBP) of at least 90 mm Hg, or both. Hypertension defined in this way identifies pregnant women at increased risk of pre-eclampsia and other maternal and fetal or neonatal complications, including death, and these women are recommended to receive enhanced antenatal care and monitoring worldwide.

In 2017, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association recommended lowering the blood pressure thresholds for diagnosing hypertension outside of pregnancy, classified as: elevated blood pressure (or elevated sBP; defined as sBP 120–129 mm Hg and dBP < 80 mm Hg), stage 1 hypertension (sBP 130–139 mm Hg or dBP 80–89 mm Hg, or both), and stage 2 hypertension (sBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or dBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, or both). Although the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and WHO have retained a definition of blood pressure greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg for hypertension in pregnancy, several studies have reported a dose-response relationship between increasing blood pressure and adverse pregnancy outcomes, across gestational ages;, these findings provide potential support for the redefinition of hypertension in pregnancy. However, despite use of blood pressure as an essential screening test in pregnancy, no studies have yet reported the diagnostic test properties (such as sensitivity and specificity) of various blood pressure thresholds for hypertension diagnosis.

### Severely increased blood pressure in the emergency department [^26aad94c]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with severely increased blood pressure often present to the emergency department. Emergency physicians evaluate and treat hypertension in various contexts, ranging from the compliant patient with well-controlled blood pressure to the asymptomatic patient with increased blood pressure to the critically ill patient with increased blood pressure and acute target-organ deterioration. Despite extensive study and national guidelines for the assessment and treatment of chronically increased blood pressure, there is no clear consensus on the acute management of patients with severely increased blood pressure. In this article, we examine the broad spectrum of disease, from the asymptomatic to critically ill patient, and the dilemma it creates for the emergency physician in deciding how and when in the process to intervene.

### Long-term risk of adverse events in patients discharged alive after hospitalization for hypertensive crisis [^fc04ffaf]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hypertensive crisis is defined as a severe and rapid increase of the blood pressure (BP) ≥ 180/110 mmHg that often requires immediate but careful intervention to lower BP. This clinical condition often needs the access to the emergency department and can be further classified into hypertensive urgency or emergency based on the presence of acute target organ damage. Hypertensive urgencies are characterized by a rapid and severe BP elevation without organ injuries, whereas hypertension emergencies involve acute target organ damage, including the central nervous system (hypertensive encephalopathy and ischemic or haemorrhagic stroke), the cardiovascular system [myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), and aorta dissection or rupture], or the kidneys (acute renal failure).

Although there has been significant overall improvement in survival after hypertensive crises over the past fifty years, both hypertensive urgency and emergency are still associated with an increased short-term risks of adverse events. Relatively few studies on small populations have investigated the long-term risk of adverse events in patients who have survived hypertensive crises, and no data are available about the impact of the number and type of target organ damage and their associated risks of adverse clinical outcomes. Our aim was to assess the one-year risk of adverse events in patients presenting with hypertensive crises, using a large global federated healthcare dataset.

Definitions of elevated BP states

Various terminologies have been applied to describe severe elevation in BP, including acute severe hypertension, hypertensive urgency, hypertensive emergency, malignant hypertension (MHT), accelerated phase hypertension and hypertensive crisis. It is important to distinguish between the key terms to guide appropriate management and minimise the potential for iatrogenic harm.

Acute severe hypertension

The definition of 'severe' has changed progressively in the last 70 years. Most experts would accept that a BP of > 200/120 mmHg is severe, and needs urgent attention, but the degree of urgency depends on the precise circumstances. For example, a BP of 180/100 mmHg in a poorly adherent, uncontrolled chronically hypertensive patient, would not usually be considered as acute severe HTN needing immediate treatment, whereas a BP of 160/100 mmHg would be a medical (hypertensive) emergency in the context of acute end organ damage (EOD), such as preeclampsia. We prefer the term 'acute severe hypertension' to indicate patients with severe elevation in BP without evidence of acute and/or life-threatening EOD. Most patients presenting to emergency departments (ED) belong to this category and it is difficult to distinguish whether the rise in BP is acute or chronic especially if BP has not been measured recently. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines (NG 136) refer to this subgroup as severe hypertension {NICE, 2019 }. The term 'hypertensive urgency' in patients who are asymptomatic is not necessarily useful as this can lead to undue anxiety in patients and increased costs to healthcare with low associated morbidity; we prefer to avoid the use of this term.

Hypertensive emergency

Hypertensive emergency is elevated BP, which when sustained over the next few hours may lead to progressive life-threatening EOD. It primarily includes conditions such as acute pulmonary oedema, hypertensive encephalopathy, acute renal failure, aortic dissection, intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), severe preeclampsia/eclampsia, pheochromocytoma crisis and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In several of these diagnoses, BP may be severely elevated though not necessarily. Even a moderate elevation of BP can be potentially life-threatening in certain situations, particularly if the elevation of BP is rapid. Rise in BP may not be the immediate causal factor in some emergency states like acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) and sub-arachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) but may co-exist and complicate management.

### Impact of 2017 ACC / AHA guidelines on prevalence of hypertension and eligibility for antihypertensive treatment in United States and China: nationally representative cross sectional study [^36fc626f]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) recently released guideline recommendations for treatment strategies for hypertension with lower blood pressure values used to define elevated blood pressure, and lower treatment thresholds, than those recommended in current guidelines. These new guidelines define hypertension as a systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg or greater or a diastolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg or greater, in contrast to a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or greater or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or greater that was used to define hypertension in all previous guidelines.

Furthermore, treatment recommendations have been extensively revised. The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend treatment of only a subset of patients with a diagnosis of hypertension. This includes all those with a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or greater or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or greater. Treatment is recommended for additional patients with lower blood pressures. Among people with a systolic blood pressure of 130–139 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure of 80–89 mm Hg, treatment is recommended only for those who meet any of the following criteria: aged 65 years or older, pre-existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or a 10 year predicated risk of developing it of 10% or greater, chronic kidney disease, or diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, a target systolic blood pressure below 130 mm Hg and a target diastolic blood pressure below 80 mm Hg is recommended for all patients, regardless of their baseline blood pressures. These recommendations contrast with currently suggested systolic blood pressure targets of less than 140 mm Hg and diastolic targets of less than 90 mm Hg for most patients, other than targets of less than 150/90 mm Hg for those aged 60 years or over without concomitant diabetes or chronic kidney disease.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Hypertensive emergencies — definition, risks, and approach to severe hypertension without target organ damage: Hypertensive emergencies are defined as severe elevations in BP (≥ 180/120 mm Hg) associated with evidence of acute target organ damage, and patients with hypertensive emergencies experience a high in-hospital mortality rate of 10% with a 1-year cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rate of 20% to 30%. Hypertensive emergencies demand immediate reduction of BP to prevent or limit further target organ damage, but rapid correction to normal range may result in vital organ hypoperfusion due to loss of autoregulation. In contrast, patients with severe hypertension without evidence of acute target organ damage should not have aggressive BP lowering in the short-term or be given parenteral antihypertensive drug therapy, and reinitiation or intensification of oral antihypertensive medications, preferably in the outpatient setting, is recommended for these patients; additionally, there is no RCT evidence that antihypertensive drugs reduce morbidity or mortality in patients with hypertensive emergencies.

### Screening for hypertension in adults: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^47037a78]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations of others — external guidance on screening and confirmation: The Seventh Joint National Committee recommended screening for high blood pressure at least once every 2 years in adults with blood pressure less than 120/80 mm Hg and every year in adults with blood pressure of 120 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg. The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend that out-of-office blood pressure measurement be performed to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension, and they also suggest screening for masked hypertension with ABPM or HBPM when office systolic blood pressure is 120 to 129 mm Hg or diastolic 75 to 79 mm Hg, and for white coat hypertension when office systolic blood pressure is 130 to 160 mm Hg or diastolic 80 to 100 mm Hg. In 2019, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services added coverage of ABPM to diagnose suspected white coat and masked hypertension; in 2020, the American Heart Association and the American Medical Association released a joint statement supporting out-of-office self-measurement of blood pressure, and the American Academy of Family Physicians supports the 2015 USPSTF screening recommendation statement.

### Treatment blood pressure targets for hypertension [^bf16a63f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors need to know what blood pressure (BP) target they should try to achieve. The standard of clinical practice for some time has been ≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg. New guidelines are recommending BP targets lower than this standard. It is not known whether attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard reduces mortality and morbidity.

Objectives

To determine if lower BP targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard BP targets (≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (1966–2008), EMBASE (1980–2008), and CENTRAL (up to June 2008); references from review articles, clinical guidelines, and clinical trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing patients randomized to lower or to standard BP targets and providing data on any of the primary outcomes below.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers (JAA, MIP) independently assessed the included trials and data entry. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; total cardiovascular events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure and end stage renal disease. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean systolic and diastolic BP and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Main Results

No trials comparing different systolic BP targets were found. Seven trials (22,089 subjects) comparing different diastolic BP targets were included. Despite a -4/-3 mmHg greater achieved reduction in systolic/diastolic BP, p < 0.001, attempting to achieve "lower targets" instead of "standard targets" did not change total mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86–1.15), myocardial infarction (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74–1.09), stroke (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79–1.25), congestive heart failure (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59–1.32), major cardiovascular events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83–1.07), or end-stage renal disease (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.81–1.27). The net health effect of lower targets cannot be fully assessed due to lack of information regarding all total serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse effects in 6 of 7 trials. A sensitivity analysis in diabetic patients and in patients with chronic renal disease also did not show a reduction in any of the mortality and morbidity outcomes with lower targets as compared to standard targets.

Authors' Conclusions

Treating patients to lower than standard BP targets, ≤ 140–160/90–100 mmHg, does not reduce mortality or morbidity. Because guidelines are recommending even lower targets for diabetes mellitus and chronic renal disease, we are currently conducting systematic reviews in those groups of patients.
