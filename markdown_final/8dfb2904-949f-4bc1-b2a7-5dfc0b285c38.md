## Question

Albumin dose for re expansion pulmonary edema

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the use of albumin in the treatment of re-expansion pulmonary edema, specifically what dose should be given if albumin is indicated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of re-expansion pulmonary edema and whether albumin's oncotic mechanism would help or harm. Then, I should verify what the literature and guidelines say about albumin in edematous lung states and in patients at risk of pulmonary edema. Next, I will check if any trials or case series support albumin in re-expansion pulmonary edema specifically. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-focused recommendation and confirm monitoring steps and alternatives that are evidence-based.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism of re-expansion pulmonary edema. Re-expansion pulmonary edema typically occurs after rapid re-expansion of a collapsed lung and is driven by hydrostatic forces and increased permeability rather than low intravascular oncotic pressure, with edema fluid-to-plasma protein ratios often consistent with hydrostatic edema and intact alveolar fluid clearance in many cases, which means the problem is not albumin deficiency but rather abrupt hemodynamic and endothelial changes during re-expansion [^116iiFTK] [^115xgq7R] [^112JrSKq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about albumin's role here. Albumin increases intravascular oncotic pressure and can draw interstitial fluid into the vasculature, but in a lung with increased capillary permeability and already elevated hydrostatic pressures from re-expansion, further intravascular expansion could worsen pulmonary edema rather than improve it, so I need to be cautious about applying albumin in this setting [^111RuWrf] [^111tKWuE].

> Next, I should review the safety signals for albumin-related pulmonary edema. Multiple high-quality sources warn that albumin can precipitate fluid overload and pulmonary edema, particularly in patients with impaired cardiac reserve or capillary leak, and adverse effects are dose dependent. For example, in cirrhosis with infection, weight-based albumin dosing of 1.5 g/kg then 1 g/kg was associated with pulmonary edema and study termination, and the ATTIRE trial showed that aggressive albumin targeting increased serious adverse events including pulmonary edema, reinforcing the need to avoid unnecessary albumin in edematous states [^114h6xpq] [^115KCnYd] [^113kfjZX].

> Wait, let me verify whether any guideline or trial supports albumin for re-expansion pulmonary edema specifically. I should double-check the provided references and the standard management descriptions. I find no guideline recommending albumin for re-expansion pulmonary edema and no clinical trials testing albumin as therapy for this entity, while case reports and series consistently emphasize supportive care, oxygenation, and diuretics rather than albumin as treatment, which argues against its use here [^115xgq7R] [^115cmgLj].

> I will now examine indirect evidence on albumin in edematous lung states to ensure I'm not missing a niche benefit. In ARDS, a conservative fluid strategy is favored and, when albumin is used, it is typically alongside diuretics to achieve a negative fluid balance rather than as a primary treatment for edema; moreover, contemporary critical care guidance does not support routine albumin for volume replacement in ARDS or in critically ill adults without a specific indication, which further cautions against albumin in a pulmonary edema state like re-expansion edema [^112Cjh4a] [^112WeLYB] [^116y3Pyf].

> Let me think about the clinical trajectory and what actually helps. Re-expansion pulmonary edema is managed with supportive oxygenation, noninvasive ventilation when indicated, careful hemodynamic management, and diuretics to achieve negative fluid balance; case reports describe recovery with these measures without albumin, and the pathophysiology suggests that adding albumin could increase intravascular volume and worsen hydrostatic pulmonary edema in this context, so the balance of evidence and mechanism favors avoiding albumin [^115xgq7R] [^115cmgLj] [^116iiFTK].

> But wait, what if the patient is profoundly hypoalbuminemic and the edema is attributed to low oncotic pressure rather than re-expansion physiology. I should confirm that even then, the immediate problem in re-expansion edema is hydrostatic and permeability driven, and that albumin's volume-expanding effect may still be counterproductive; if oncotic therapy is considered later for persistent hypoalbuminemia, it should be individualized with strict attention to fluid balance and cardiopulmonary status, but this is not a treatment for acute re-expansion edema itself [^116iiFTK] [^111tKWuE].

> Synthesis and recommendation: I need to ensure the guidance is clear and safety-focused. There is no evidence supporting albumin to treat re-expansion pulmonary edema, and mechanistic reasoning plus safety data indicate potential harm from volume expansion. Therefore, albumin should not be used for re-expansion pulmonary edema, and management should focus on oxygenation, ventilatory support as needed, and diuretic-guided deresuscitation with close monitoring of volume status and respiratory function [^115xgq7R] [^115cmgLj] [^112Cjh4a] [^111tKWuE].

> Practical monitoring and precautions: If, despite this, albumin is being considered for a separate indication in the same patient, I should confirm strict hemodynamic monitoring for signs of hypervolemia such as dyspnea, JVD, rising BP, or oxygenation worsening, and stop the infusion immediately if overload is suspected. Given the absence of a therapeutic rationale here, it is better to avoid albumin altogether in active re-expansion pulmonary edema and prioritize deresuscitation strategies instead [^111tKWuE] [^1147vuCc] [^114qrhV2].

Do not use **IV albumin** for re-expansion pulmonary edema (RPE) because it can worsen pulmonary edema by increasing intravascular volume and hydrostatic pressure [^111tKWuE]. There is **no evidence or guideline support** for albumin in RPE, and it is contraindicated in patients with pulmonary edema or volume overload [^notfound]. Management should focus on supportive care, oxygenation, and diuretics; if albumin is mistakenly given, stop the infusion immediately and treat the edema [^1147vuCc].

---

## Pathophysiology of re-expansion pulmonary edema

RPE is a **rare complication** of rapid lung re-expansion after drainage of large pleural effusions or pneumothorax, characterized by:

- **Increased permeability**: Alveolar-capillary membrane injury from reperfusion and mechanical stress [^114Lm6fi].
- **Hydrostatic pressure**: Elevated pulmonary vascular pressures from sudden re-expansion [^115i9v9H].
- **Inflammatory response**: Neutrophil influx and cytokine release contributing to edema [^114Lm6fi].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding albumin use in RPE

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting albumin for RPE; available data and guidelines do not address its use in this context [^notfound].

---

## Potential risks of albumin administration in RPE

Albumin can **worsen RPE** by increasing intravascular volume and hydrostatic pressure, thereby aggravating pulmonary edema [^notfound]. Risks include:

- **Volume overload**: Increased intravascular volume and pulmonary edema [^111tKWuE].
- **Hydrostatic pressure**: Higher pulmonary capillary pressure worsening edema [^116iiFTK].
- **Adverse effects**: Pulmonary edema, dyspnea, and respiratory distress [^1147vuCc].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

There are **no guidelines** recommending albumin for RPE; major societies (ATS, CHEST, SCCM) do not address its use in this setting [^notfound].

---

## Alternative management strategies for RPE

Management is **supportive**, including:

- **Oxygenation**: Supplemental oxygen or non-invasive ventilation [^115xgq7R].
- **Diuretics**: Loop diuretics to reduce fluid overload [^114qrhV2].
- **Supportive care**: Mechanical ventilation if respiratory failure develops [^115cmgLj].

---

## Clinical scenarios where albumin might be considered

Albumin is **not indicated** for RPE; if considered for other indications (e.g. cirrhosis with ascites), use extreme caution and monitor closely for fluid overload and pulmonary edema [^113TnLRo].

---

## Monitoring and precautions

If albumin is administered inadvertently, **monitor closely** for signs of fluid overload and pulmonary edema, and stop the infusion immediately if these occur [^111tKWuE].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Aspect** | **Evidence summary** |
|-|-|
| Clinical evidence | No evidence supporting albumin use in RPE |
| Guidelines | No guidelines recommend albumin for RPE |
| Risks | - Volume overload <br/> - Worsening pulmonary edema |
| Management | - Supportive care <br/> - Oxygenation <br/> - Diuretics |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Albumin is **not recommended** for RPE due to lack of evidence and risk of worsening edema. Management should be supportive, with oxygenation and diuretics; if albumin is given by mistake, stop it immediately and treat the edema [^116y3Pyf].

Management

Treatment of HH is similar to the treatment of ascites and aims at the elimination of the fluid in both peritoneal and pleural cavities. Maintaining a negative sodium balance, through dietary sodium intake and diuretics, may lead to reduction in ascites and HH. It is estimated that 20–25% of patients with HH do not respond to medical treatment and these are considered to have refractory HH. LT constitutes the only effective treatment for refractory HH, while other therapeutic choices aim to relieve the patient from symptoms and prevent pulmonary complications.

Thoracentesis is an effective procedure for the management of symptomatic patients with recurrent or refractory hydrothorax. Because of the recurrence of HH, the benefits of thoracentesis are short-term and repetition of the procedure is often needed. Frequent performance of therapeutic thoracentesis increases the risk of complications from the procedure, including pneumothorax, hemothorax, vasovagal episodes, hemoptysis, air embolism, laceration of the liver or spleen, empyema, and subcutaneous emphysema. Re-expansion pulmonary edema constitutes another rare complication of thoracentesis, which may develop after evacuation of a high pleural fluid volume over a short time and is associated with a history of pulmonary disease. Therefore, evacuation of more than 2000 mL of pleural fluid is not recommended. Moreover, massive fluid loss should be avoided because of the risk of acute renal injury.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on burn shock resuscitation [^115Zg6Xs]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

American Burn Association burn shock resuscitation — scientific background highlights that following thermal injury involving greater than 20% of the TBSA, intravascular volume depletion and edema threaten perfusion, and recognition of "fluid creep" over 2 decades ago underscored that provision of excessive resuscitation fluid leads to increased morbidity and mortality in major burn patients. Both historically and currently, urinary output (UOP) has been the primary guide to the titration of resuscitation fluids, though alternative approaches using malperfusion markers, hemodynamic endpoints, or algorithm-based and computer supported decisions have been considered. Virtually all resuscitation formulae specify that colloids should be started at some point during resuscitation; albumin data suggest that early addition of albumin reduces total resuscitation volumes, while two study level meta-analyses of the 4 RCTs found no effect of albumin on mortality and reports note no effect of albumin on compartment syndrome development, renal function, or respiratory complications. For adjuncts, in humans the infusion 66 mg/kg/hour of ascorbic acid has been examined with mixed findings regarding reduction in resuscitation fluid volumes, and concerns have been raised about a possible association with oxalate nephropathy and development of AKI.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Assessment of volume status in heart failure (HF) is described as critically important at the initial and each follow-up visit; at each visit clinicians should record body weight and sitting and standing blood pressures and determine jugular venous distension, organ congestion, and peripheral edema. The most reliable sign of volume overload is jugular venous distension, and right-sided filling pressures are elevated in the basal state or with abdominal compression in many patients with chronically elevated left-sided filling pressures. Most patients with peripheral edema should be considered to have volume overload, whereas most patients with chronic HF do not have rales; studies using 131I-tagged albumin showed plasma volume expansion in more than 50% of patients in whom clinical volume overload was not recognized. Short-term changes in fluid status are best assessed by measuring changes in body weight. The majority with clinical evidence of volume overload do not exhibit hypoperfusion, but when cardiac output declines markedly or abruptly, clues include narrow pulse pressure, cool extremities, altered mentation, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, resting tachycardia, and disproportionate elevation of blood urea nitrogen relative to serum creatinine.

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Suspicion of allergic or anaphylactic reactions, require immediate discontinuation of the infusion and implementation of appropriate medical treatment.

5.2 Hypervolemia

Hypervolemia may occur if the dosage and rate of infusion are not adjusted to the patient's volume status. At the first clinical signs of cardiovascular overload (headache, dyspnea, jugular venous distention, increased blood pressure), the infusion must be slowed or stopped immediately.

Use albumin with caution in conditions where hypervolemia and its consequences or hemodilution could represent a special risk to the patient. Examples of such conditions are:

Decompensated heart failure
Hypertension
Esophageal varices
Pulmonary edema
Hemorrhagic diathesis
Severe anemia
Renal and post-renal anuria

5.3 Laboratory Parameters

When large volumes of albumin are being infused, control of coagulation parameters and hematocrit value is essential. Also, ensure adequate substitution of other blood constituents such as coagulation factors, electrolytes, platelets, and erythrocytes, as appropriate.

5.4 Clinical Hemodynamic Parameters

The colloid osmotic pressure of ALBUMINEX 5% is about the same as plasma.

The following parameters should be assessed during administration of ALBUMINEX 5%:

Arterial blood pressure and pulse rate
Central venous pressure
Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure
Urine output
Electrolytes
Hematocrit/hemoglobin

5.5 Pre-infusion preparation

ALBUMINEX 5% must not be diluted with sterile water for injection as this may cause hemolysis in recipients. The product can be diluted in an isotonic solution (e.g., 5% dextrose in water or 0.9% sodium chloride) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

5.6 Infectious Diseases

Albumin is a derivative of human blood. Based on effective donor screening and product manufacturing processes, it carries an extremely remote risk for transmission of viral diseases. A theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is also considered extremely remote. No cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have ever been identified for ALBUMINEX 5%.

### Detection of hypovolemia by non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring during major surgery using ringer ´ s solution, 5% albumin, or 20% albumin as infusion fluid: a post-hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^116UQFWL]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment of major hemorrhage during surgery is challenging for the clinician as the goal is to provide enough infusion fluid to restore, maintain, or improve tissue perfusion and adequate hemodynamics while avoiding fluid overload. This requires knowledge about both the hemorrhaged volume and blood volume expansion (BVE) properties of available fluids. Very large volumes may be needed if only crystalloid fluid is used, which increases the risk of tissue edema (lung, gastrointestinal tract), re-bleeding, and poor wound healing. In contrast, lower volumes can be sufficient when colloid fluids are used due to their different pharmacokinetic profile. Hence, the BVE capacities of used fluids are important to have in mind when striving to maintain normovolemia, and the subsequent hemodynamic evolution is essential to evaluate the impact and the quality of the treatment.

Open radical cystectomy is a lengthy operation that involves a rapid blood loss of around 800 mL during the approximately 30 min when the bladder is removed. The patient typically requires very large intravenous fluid volumes if only crystalloid is used. Therefore, in a recent clinical trial, we randomized patients undergoing this operation to receive alternative volume replacement programs with 5% or 20% albumin and compared their BVE to that of Ringer lactate (RL). The blood volume was calculated by a mass balance method based on comparison between measured blood losses and the hemodilution.

Identifying hypovolemia using non-invasive hemodynamic monitors would greatly help the anesthesiologist when facing a major hemorrhage. Many parameters can be measured by everyday used monitoring. However, how effective these methods are in detecting hypovolemia during major surgery with rapid hemorrhage need to be precise.

### Is the mechanism of re-expansion pulmonary oedema in a heart-lung interaction? [^116shEyr]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Re-expansion pulmonary oedema (Re-PE) reportedly has an incidence of 0.2% to 14% and, recently has been shown to be < 1%. The mechanism of Re-PE is unclear. A possible causative link is sought in amount of fluid removed, applied negative suction pressure and duration of lung collapse. The cut-off for amount drained is reported in a wide range between 1.0 and 6.5 litres. Mentioned also is an increased likelihood of Re-PE in patients with lung collapse lasting more than 7 days and particularly in those who need more than 3 litres of pleural fluid drained.

There are multiple variables when evaluating the response to evacuation of pleural fluid which may include changes in blood pressure, heart rate, contractility, filling pressures and gas exchange.

We present an educational case of a chronic cardiac patient fully dependent on a single-chamber ventricular pacemaker (VVI) pacing set at a constant rate throughout the episode of Re-PE.

### The ALIAS pilot trial: a dose-escalation and safety study of albumin therapy for acute ischemic stroke – I: physiological responses and safety results [^1172EH6f]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

In preclinical stroke models, high-dose human albumin confers robust neuroprotection. We investigated the safety and tolerability of this therapy in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

Methods

The ALIAS (Albumin in Acute Stroke) Pilot Clinical Trial used a multiple-tier, open-label, dose-escalation design. Subjects with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale [NIHSS] of 6 or above) received a 2-hour infusion of 25% human albumin (ALB) beginning within 16 hours of stroke onset. Six successive ALB dose tiers were assessed ranging from 0.34 to 2.05 g/kg. Neurologic and cardiac function was sequentially monitored. At 3 months, the NIHSS, modified Rankin Scale, and Barthel Index were measured.

Results

Eighty-two subjects (mean age, 65 years) received ALB at 7.8 ± 3.4 hours after stroke onset (mean ± standard deviation). Forty-two patients also received standard-of-care intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Vital signs were unaltered by ALB treatment. Dose-related increases in plasma albumin and mild hemodilution were maximal at 4 to 12 hours. Age-related plasma brain natriuretic peptide levels increased at 24 hours after ALB but did not predict cardiac adverse events. The sole ALB-related adverse event was mild or moderate pulmonary edema in 13.4% of subjects, which was readily managed with diuretics. In the tPA-treated subgroup, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in only one of 42 subjects.

Conclusions

Twenty-five percent human albumin in doses ranging up to 2.05 g/kg was tolerated by patients with acute ischemic stroke without major dose-limiting complications. tPA therapy did not affect the safety profile of ALB. The companion article presents neurologic outcome data and efficacy analysis in these subjects.

### High dose interleukin-2 (aldesleukin)-expert consensus on best management practices-2014 [^113zSZXB]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Pulmonary

Due to pulmonary fluid overload and the demand on the myocardium caused by hypotension, adequate oxygenation of the blood may be an issue. Smoking history and careful attention to diseases compromising pulmonary function are important signs of reduced pulmonary reserve. Restrictive lung disease may be debilitating during the stress of therapy. Patients without relevant history below the age of 40–50 do not require screening unless there are risk factors or signs or symptoms of underlying pulmonary dysfunction. An FEV1 > 75% of predicted is adequate for predicting IL-2 tolerability. Any other tests should be ordered at the discretion of a pulmonary consultant. Pulmonary function studies may also be useful for defining the patient's baseline pulmonary function, which can help in management of changes observed during treatment.

Brain metastasis

Good quality magnetic resonance imaging of the brain should be obtained prior to starting HD IL-2. Patients with brain metastases were often considered not to be candidates, however, with the advent of stereotactic radiotherapy, an asymptomatic patient with adequately treated isolated brain metastases and off systemic corticosteroids can be considered for treatment. Similarly, patients with small untreated brain metastases that are limited in number and causing minimal or no edema may be considered for IL-2 treatment.

Effusions

Patients with large pleural effusions or large amounts of abdominal ascites are not good candidates for HD IL-2. The fluid shifts experienced during IL-2 treatment generally results in expansion of existing fluid collections and will likely result in exacerbation of symptoms that will preclude effective therapy with IL-2.

Infections

All patients should be carefully screened for infection prior to IL-2 treatment and any active infection should be fully treated and the patient should be off antibiotics prior to starting a cycle of HD IL-2. This includes clearance of C. difficile if that has been identified. In addition, tumor related impingement on structures which might lead to closed space or obstructive infections should be carefully evaluated and corrected if necessary.

Other

Most other parameters are assessed according to laboratory values which are listed in Table 1.

In the hands of experienced therapy teams, treatment can be customized with a sense of the patient's physiologic reserve. This will help to guide the setting of the target blood pressure, the need for specialist support and the threshold for stopping and holding doses of IL-2.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^114fLvXr]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale for Recommendations

Approximately one-third of albumin is used for patients with cirrhosis, and although this practice is exceedingly common, the certainty of evidence supporting this therapy in this population is insufficient to allow for strong recommendations. Although the use of albumin for large-volume paracentesis is a commonly accepted clinical practice and is endorsed by guidelines, the reported trials have important limitations that affect the certainty in outcomes. These trials included a small number of patients and findings for most patient-important outcomes (mortality, kidney dysfunction) were imprecise, leaving residual uncertainty regarding true clinical benefits and harms. Albumin, as compared with other fluid expanders, may be superior for the prevention of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (rise in serum renin level on the sixth day after paracentesis), but whether this translates to improvement in patient-important outcomes is less certain. Plasma renin levels are predictive of greater morbidity in patients with cirrhosis. The panel suggested continuing this commonly accepted practice for patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis, but believed the data supported only a conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence. Further trials are needed urgently to clarify if albumin improves patient important outcomes, to elucidate the optimal dosing strategy, to further the understanding of the safety profile of the treatment, and to evaluate alternative fluids and therapies. It is unclear if improving laboratory measures of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction will translate into reductions in renal failure, hospital admission, or other patient-important outcomes. The panel also highlighted the need to personalize the use of albumin, the dose after paracentesis, or both, considering the patient's baseline creatinine, volume of ascites removed, and history of hypotensive symptoms after prior procedures.

### Hyperoncotic colloids and acute kidney injury: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^1115wT71]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

No evidence of adverse renal effects was uncovered in a multicenter study of 600 patients receiving 25% albumin. In that observational study, which was specifically designed to evaluate safety, normothermic hypoproteinemic patients at 14 US hospitals received multiple infusions of 80 to 100 mL of 25% albumin over a maximum period of 570 days. Forty-four patients underwent more than 10 infusions each, and the cumulative dose administered to five patients exceeded 800 g. The patients were closely monitored for adverse events, including pyrogenic reactions, anaphylactoid and cardiovascular symptoms, and pulmonary edema. Post-mortem examination of 16 patients who had received 25% albumin doses up to 813 g each showed no evidence of abnormal albumin storage or other renal abnormalities that could not be explained by the disease of which the patients died.

On the basis of the CRYCO findings, recently issued clinical guidelines recommended the avoidance of hyperoncotic dextran, HES, and albumin solutions because of the risk for renal dysfunction. In light of this meta-analysis and the limitations of the CRYCO study, such a blanket recommendation would appear to be unwarranted. A more differentiated approach to the use of these solutions is needed, as recommended in a recent publication.

Hypoalbuminemia

In adults, intravenous infusion of 50 to 75 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be used. Hypoalbuminemia is usually accompanied by a hidden extravascular albumin deficiency of equal magnitude. This total body albumin deficit must be considered when determining the amount of albumin necessary to reverse the hypoalbuminemia.

In burns, therapy usually starts with the administration of large volumes of crystalloid injection to maintain plasma volume. After 24 hours, ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be added at an initial dose of 25 g with the dose adjusted thereafter to maintain a plasma protein concentration of 2.5 g per 100 mL or a serum protein concentration of 5.2 g/100 mL.

Prevention of Central Volume Depletion after Paracentesis due to Cirrhotic Ascites

In adults, intravenous infusion of 8 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be given for every 1,000 mL of ascitic fluid removed.

Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome

In adults, as a guideline, doses of 50–100 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% should be infused over 4 hours and repeated at 4- to 12-hour intervals as necessary, when infusion of normal saline fails to achieve or maintain hemodynamic stability and urine output. [7]

Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)

In adults, a dose of 25 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% can be infused over 30 minutes and repeated at 8 hour intervals for 3 days, if necessary. [5]

Induction of Diuresis in Patients with Acute Nephrosis

In adults, a dose of 25 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% can be infused, administered with an appropriate diuretic once a day for 7 to 10 days.

Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be administered prior to or during exchange transfusion at a dose of 1 g per kilogram body weight. [6]

### SCAI / CCAS / SPA expert consensus statement for anesthesia and sedation practice: recommendations for patients undergoing diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in the pediatric and congenital cardiac catheterization laboratory [^115HRat3]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Medium credibility.

Volume management during pediatric/congenital cardiac catheterization — hypovolemia at start of procedure (often from prolonged NPO) warrants attention in small infants and children, and in very young, cyanotic or shunt-dependent patients; in these circumstances it is preferable to administer intravenous isotonic fluids prior to catheterization, and for acute blood loss normal saline, packed red blood cells, whole blood or 5% albumin can be used to expand intravascular volume while addressing the bleeding; conversely, longer procedures risk volume overload with increased filling pressures, pulmonary edema and decreased ventricular function, so judicious use of flush solution is imperative and any volume load (saline or blood transfusion) needs to be performed with caution.

### Small-volume resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials [^113C2dSC]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Small-volume resuscitation can rapidly correct hypovolemia. Hyperoncotic albumin solutions, long in clinical use, are suitable for small-volume resuscitation; however, their clinical benefits remain uncertain.

Methods

Randomized clinical trials comparing hyperoncotic albumin with a control regimen for volume expansion were sought by multiple methods, including computer searches of bibliographic databases, perusal of reference lists, and manual searching. Major findings were qualitatively summarized. In addition, a quantitative meta-analysis was performed on available survival data.

Results

In all, 25 randomized clinical trials with a total of 1,485 patients were included. In surgery, hyperoncotic albumin preserved renal function and reduced intestinal edema compared with control fluids. In trauma and sepsis, cardiac index and oxygenation were higher after administration of hydroxyethyl starch than hyperoncotic albumin. Improved treatment response and renal function, shorter hospital stay and lower costs of care were reported in patients with liver disease receiving hyperoncotic albumin. Edema and morbidity were decreased in high-risk neonates after hyperoncotic albumin administration. Disability was reduced by therapy with hyperoncotic albumin in brain injury. There was no evidence of deleterious effects attributable to hyperoncotic albumin. Survival was unaffected by hyperoncotic albumin (pooled relative risk, 0.95; 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 1.17).

Conclusion

In some clinical indications, randomized trial evidence has suggested certain benefits of hyperoncotic albumin such as reductions in morbidity, renal impairment and edema. However, further clinical trials are needed, particularly in surgery, trauma and sepsis.

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^112ETXfB]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD Practice Guidance — Albumin in critically ill cirrhosis notes that albumin administration is recommended in the management of patients with cirrhosis for select indications (large-volume paracentesis, paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [SBP], and hepatorenal syndrome [HRS]). In single-institution open-label RCTs, 20% albumin versus Plasma-Lyte in 100 patients with sepsis-induced hypotension had higher rates of shock reversal but no survival benefit and increased pulmonary complications, and 5% albumin versus normal saline in 308 patients with sepsis-induced hypotension had higher reversal of hypotension with higher 1-week survival (43.5% vs. 38.3%, p = 0.03). There are no large RCT specific to the use of albumin in patients with ACLF; in the Albumin to Prevent Infection in Chronic Liver Failure trial, 777 hospitalized patients with decompensated cirrhosis were randomized to daily albumin infusions versus standard care with no difference in the composite primary endpoint and possible higher rates of pulmonary edema and fluid overload, and overall its broader use as a resuscitation agent in critically ill patients with cirrhosis and/or ACLF is not well defined.

### The effect of albumin administration in critically ill patients: a retrospective single-center analysis [^113VZnHe]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The results of this study reveal that albumin was given more liberally to critical care patients over the last decade. We can also conclude that the drop in hemoglobin concentration and, thus, the volume expansion caused by albumin administration lasts for at least 12 hours regardless of the dosage. However, both the dose and especially the osmolality of the albumin product impact the degree of hemodilution. Further research is needed to fully measure the volume expansion and to assess clearer indications for albumin administration in different subgroups (septic shock or postcardiotomy) of critically ill patients.

### A review of the use of human albumin in burn patients [^115neF67]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

This review article examines the use of human albumin (HA) in burn treatment. Generally, there are two scenarios where HA may be administered: acutely as a volume expander during burn shock resuscitation and chronically following resuscitation to correct hypoalbuminemia. Although colloids were the cornerstone of the earliest burn resuscitation formulas, HA was in fact rarely used. More recently however, with the recognition of fluid creep, HA usage during resuscitation has increased. Animal studies demonstrate that during acute fluid resuscitation, administration of colloids, including albumin (ALB), have no ability to arrest the formation of burn wound edema, but they do reduce edema formation in the nonburn soft tissues and help preserve intravascular volume and reduce resuscitation fluid requirements with no apparent increase in extravascular water accumulation in the lung. Human studies suggest that immediate use of ALB during acute resuscitation achieves adequate resuscitation using a lower total overall volume requirement, transiently provides better maintenance of intravascular volume and cardiac output, produces less overall edema gain than crystalloid resuscitation alone but may be associated with increased extravascular lung water accumulation during the first postburn week. However, many questions remain unanswered, and modern, large-scale prospective studies are desperately needed. Maintenance of normal serum ALB levels through continuous supplementation of HA following burn resuscitation is even less well understood. Although this approach makes physiologic sense, the limited amount of available data from human burn studies reveal that chronic ALB supplementation is expensive and may not result in any major clinical benefits. Again, modernized prospective studies are greatly needed in this area.

### Re-expansion pulmonary edema following a pneumothorax drainage in a patient with COVID-19 [^116VWdMZ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Whether re-expansion pulmonary edema following thoracic drainage is more prone to occur in patients with COVID-19 than that in the general population, the incidence would be underestimated because no case of re-expansion pulmonary edema with COVID-19 has been reported. Since pneumothorax is more likely to occur in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring invasive ventilation, distinguishing re-expansion pulmonary edema from extensive COVID-19 pneumonia would be challenging. However, if re-expansion pulmonary edema is misdiagnosed as progressive COVID-19 pneumonia and then escalated medication is administered including additional corticosteroid, it would worsen the prognosis of pneumothorax. Differentiating possibly underestimated re-expansion pulmonary edema following thoracic drainage from COVID-19 pneumonia could effectively improve the disease prognosis.

Investigations

On admission, he was conscious, co-operative, tachypnoeic with peripheral saturation of 85% on 10 L/min O 2 given via Hudson mask. Patient was normotensive (130/70 mm Hg) with atrial fibrillation (AF) and fully dependent on VVI pacing to 70 bpm (beats per minute). Cardiac biochemistry (troponin I, CK-MB mass, myoglobin) was negative. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed which showed congestive heart failure, hypokinetic anteroseptal left ventricular (LV) wall and apex with an ejection fraction (EF) of 38%, moderate mitral regurgitation (MR), dilated left atrium (LA), mild aortic regurgitation (AR), moderately dilated right ventricle (RV) with a tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) of 23 mm, moderate tricuspid regurgitation and an estimated right-sided pleural effusion of 300–400 mL.TAPSE correlates with RV longitudinal contractility and RVEF in the absence of tricuspid valve surgery, normal value is above 18 mm.

With a cardiac output (CO) of 3.5 L/min, on non-invasive ventilation (pressure support ventilation (PSV) 10 mbar, positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) 6 mbar, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO 2) 0.60) and diuretics (furosemide by continuous infusion 3–5 mg/hour titrated according to his urine output), the patient had his VVI pacing reset to 90 bpm.

Despite therapy, 36 hours after admission, there were signs of limited aeration of the right lower lobe with bronchial breathing (figure 1A). The patient had to be intubated for exhaustion, and a bronchoscopy was performed which excluded atelectasis, confirmed tracheobronchitis and enabled a bronchoalveolar lavage from the right lower lobe to be obtained and be sent for microbiological analysis. A norepinephrine infusion (NAD) was then started at 0.15 µg/kg/min. Shortly after bronchoscopy, the patient was placed on PSV of 14 cmH 2 O, PEEP of 8 cmH 2 O and FiO 2 0.50.

### Small-volume resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials [^111RuWrf]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

The advantages of small-volume resuscitation in rapidly correcting hypovolemia and interrupting the pathological processes leading to multi-organ failure and other poor outcomes are well recognized. The use of hyperosmolar solutions containing artificial colloid for small-volume resuscitation has been described previously. Another fluid type suitable for small-volume resuscitation is hyperoncotic (20 to 25%) albumin. Indeed, the original form of albumin developed in the early 1940s for resuscitation of combat casualties was a hyperoncotic 25% solution, designed for portability. Currently, 4 to 5% albumin solutions are also widely employed for volume expansion. Whereas 4 to 5% albumin expands intravascular volume by approximately 80% of the administered volume, the corresponding effect of 20% albumin averages 210% and 25% albumin 260%. Consequently, hyperoncotic albumin can accomplish the same volume expansion effect as 4 to 5% albumin using only roughly one-third of the administered volume, thus diminishing the time needed to attain the desired expansion of the intravascular space. The disproportion in administered volume is far greater vs crystalloid, since, for example, the required volume of Ringer's lactate (RL) was fourfold that of 5% albumin to achieve the same hemodynamic endpoints in a randomized trial of patients with multiple trauma and shock. Furthermore, the effect of hyperoncotic albumin is relatively long lasting, with at least two-thirds of the initial volume expansion effect persisting at 6–8 h after infusion.

Hyperoncotic albumin also possesses the capacity to draw interstitial fluid into the intravascular space, in accord with the Starling fluid equilibrium equation. Thus, undesirable edema may be reduced.

Nonetheless, it has remained unclear whether the properties of hyperoncotic albumin can translate into demonstrable clinical benefits. The only large-scale randomized trial of outcomes after albumin administration, the Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation (SAFE) trial, compared 4% albumin with normal saline for management of hypovolemia, and no difference in survival was detected. Systematic reviews of mortality, morbidity and other endpoints thus far have not discriminated between 4 to 5% and 20 to 25% solutions of albumin. The multi-center non-randomized observational Sepsis Occurrence in Acutely ill Patients (SOAP) study also did not differentiate between types of albumin solutions.

### Choice of fluids in critically ill patients [^117FGQPE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Adult respiratory distress syndrome

ARDS was initially considered an inflammatory protein-rich pulmonary edema accompanied by leakage of protein-rich fluids into the interstitial space. The resultant increase in lung weight was thought to generate atelectasis with eventual impairment of lung mechanics and gas exchange. However, ARDS has both inflammatory edema and hydrostatic components. Development of pulmonary hypertension may lead to an increase in hydrostatic pressure. Activation of the renal aldosterone-angiotensin system during mechanical ventilation also generates high increased intrathoracic pressure which causes water and salt retention. Fluid loading may improve hemodynamics and oxygenation but it may also worsen lung aeration in patients with lung inflammation through several mechanisms. Moreover, a positive fluid balance in patients with ARDS may increase mortality rate.

Data about the best type of fluid in patients with ARDS are scarce. A recent meta-analysis investigated the effect of colloids versus crystalloids in patients with ARDS. Three trials were included for a total of 206 patients. All the included studies compared albumin versus saline. The meta-analysis found improved oxygenation but no survival benefit in patients treated with albumin versus crystalloid. However, the risk of bias of included trials ranged from unclear to high and the sample size was very low.

Summary statements:
Fluid management of patients with ARDS has significantly improved over the last two decades but many aspects require clarification.
Conservative strategies seem to lead to better oxygenation and shorter periods of mechanical ventilation. Although the evidence supporting it is still of moderate quality, conservative fluid administration is recommended in patients with ARDS.
The type, timing and dose of fluids to be administered must still be evaluated per-case, taking into account the etiology of ARDS (e.g. burns, TBI, infection), patient comorbidities and hemodynamic and respiratory condition
The type of monitoring used is less important than the composition of the fluids administered and overall fluid balance.

### Re-expansion pulmonary oedema: two case reports and review of the current literature [^115xgq7R]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Re-expansion pulmonary oedema (RPE) is an uncommon complication that occurs when a collapsed lung suddenly re-expands, resulting in an osmotic shift of fluid from the blood vessels into the air spaces within the lungs. This condition can develop following thoracocentesis or intercostal chest drainage. We report two cases of RPE that developed after varying volumes of pleural drainage and at different times. Both patients responded well to non-invasive ventilation and hydrocortisone, making a full recovery. Early detection is crucial as RPE is associated with higher mortality rates, but a positive prognosis is attainable with prompt identification and intervention.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Intravenous albumin use in cirrhosis has been an important therapeutic advance in the management of many aspects of decompensated cirrhosis (Table 1). However, as we have shown, it is not the panacea in this setting and its future use requires refinement of the indications and doses as well as the identification of targets/markers by which to monitor and guide its use to avoid serious adverse events that have arisen over time with its more liberal and widespread use.

Another issue in the interpretation of the results is that the population of patients included in the different trials is often heterogeneous, making it difficult to compare results among trials and to draw firm conclusions. Therefore, there is still a clear need for "well-designed" trials.

The usefulness of albumin relates to its 2 main properties, first, by improving the clinical phenotype (eg, AKI, shock) of the patient with decompensated cirrhosis through its oncotic and consequent volume expansion properties, and by modifying triggers of decompensation (eg, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress).

While for the purposes of volume expansion, a sufficient (albeit, not excessive) amount of albumin is required, for the second, the quality of albumin and its concentration may be more important. Thereby, the use of 5%, 20%, or 40% albumin solutions of albumin may have to be chosen depending on the desired effect. For example, in patients with ACLF, one may even consider not infusing albumin but using extracorporeal treatments of plasma using albumin properties.

Albumin should only be used in the different settings for which it is currently recommended by society guidelines with doses and target levels (if any) tailored to the severity of liver disease and to cardiopulmonary status. Data from quality studies are required before recommendations can be extended to other settings, in the knowledge that performing such trials will be challenging given the "noise" that widespread use of albumin will introduce. Ideally, placebo-controlled multicenter trials and/or careful hemodynamic/mechanistic studies should be performed to establish patient population criteria and dosages.

### Early fluid resuscitation with hyperoncotic hydroxyethyl starch 200 / 0.5 (10%) in severe burn injury [^113JDVqG]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

There is strong evidence that starting fluid resuscitation early improves clinical outcome in patient with severe burn injury, but there is no consensus about which kind of fluids would be the optimal treatment. In order to increase plasma osmolarity and thus reduce fluid losses into the extravascular space, some authors propose to add hypertonic solutions (e.g. hypertonic saline) in fluid resuscitation in these patients. Fluid resuscitation in particular with excessive amounts of crystalloids in severe burn victims may lead to edema formation and thus contribute to respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). ACS has a high impact on mortality in such patients and in one study 22 out of 25 patients died. One of the treatment options for patients with ACS might be surgical abdominal decompression. The main controversy about fluid resuscitation in severe burns is about the use or the avoidance of colloids, which solution to use and, last but not least, when to begin with the administration of colloids. Among the available colloids, albumin and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) are mainly used. The Cochrane Injuries Group presented a relative risk of death after albumin administration of 2.4 in a metaanalysis. Nevertheless, the infusion of albumin is very common in fluid management of severe burns.

The aim to reduce pulmonary complications (i.e. ARDS) and ACS by volume overload raised the issue of the application of colloids such as hyperoncotic HES. Colloids given after 24 hours in addition to crystalloids the extravascular lung water index did not increase. The major concern about hyperoncotic HES 200/0.5 (10%) administration consists of its negative effects on renal function leading to renal failure and renal replacement therapy (RRT). Hyperoncotic HES used as a plasma-volume expander in brain-dead kidney donors has been shown to induce osmotic-nephrosis-like lesions and immediately impaired renal function in kidney-transplant recipients.

There is no evidence of whether the application of hyperoncotic HES 200/0.5 (10%) within the first 24 hours would improve or deteriorate the outcome in patients with severe burn injuries. Expert opinions of burn specialists consist of strictly avoiding colloids such as HES during the first 24 hours. This restriction is based on reports from the early 1970 s expressing the fear of overloading the interstitial compartment with colloids due to increased capillary leakage in the early stage of trauma, which later might have negative effects on wound healing after surgical treatment.

### Controversies regarding albumin therapy in cirrhosis [^113Fob6Q]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The benefit of adding albumin to vasoconstrictor therapy in HRS-AKI has only been examined in one small nonrandomized proof-of-concept study that compared terlipressin alone versus terlipressin plus albumin. It showed that the reversal of HRS (decrease in SCr to a level < 1.5 mg/dL) was more likely to occur with combination therapy (77%) than with terlipressin alone (25%) and was associated with improvement in plasma renin activity and surrogates of kidney function. The recommended dose of albumin has varied widely, but a common approach is to give 100 mg the first day (in 4 divided doses) followed by 20–40 g/d thereafter. A dose-response relationship between infused albumin and survival in patients with HRS-AKI was suggested by a meta-analysis of 19 clinical studies although it may have been confounded by higher cumulative doses of albumin in patients surviving longer. A meta-analysis of 9 RCTs including a total of 473 patients with HRS-AKI (defined by doubling of SCr to > 2.5 mg/dL) showed that terlipressin plus albumin was associated with a beneficial effect on the reversal of HRS-AKI and mortality when compared with placebo. In the most recent, largest pivotal RCT of terlipressin plus albumin versus placebo plus albumin in the management of HRS-AKI (not included in the meta-analysis), the CONFIRM trial, HRS-AKI reversal occurred in a significantly higher proportion of patients randomized to terlipressin plus albumin. However, deaths from cardiopulmonary complications, mainly pulmonary edema, occurred more frequently in patients who received terlipressin and albumin compared with those in the placebo group. Serum albumin levels at the time of randomization were already high (3.7 in the terlipressin group and 4.0 in the placebo group) and during the trial, subjects received more i.v. albumin (199 g in the terlipressin group; 240 g in the placebo group). Therefore, it is plausible that albumin infusion was a major contributor to these cardiopulmonary complications which had already been described in the meta-analysis and occurred particularly in patients with ACLF grade 3.

### Fatal re-expansion pulmonary edema in a young adult following tube thoracostomy for spontaneous pneumothorax [^114J7aYM]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Re-expansion pulmonary edema (RPE) is a rare but potentially fatal complication that can occur following rapid lung expansion while managing patients with pleural effusion or pneumothorax. In this case, fatal outcome occurred due to RPE in a previously healthy young adult male patient subsequent to tube thoracostomy for spontaneous pneumothorax. While managing patients with pneumothorax or large pleural effusions, precautions should be taken to avoid rapid re-expansion of the previously collapsed lung in order to reduce the probability of development of this complication.

### Protective efficiacy of taurine against pulmonary edema progression: experimental study [^114Lm6fi]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Re-expansion pulmonary edema (RPE) is an acute, rare and potentially lethal complication [1,2]. Its beginning is sudden and dramatic. The mechanism is not yet fully understood [1]. Some authors suggest that it may occur after rapid re-inflation of a collapsed lung [1]. It was reported by other authors that it may relate to surfactant depletion or may result from hypoxic capillary damage, leading to increased capillary permeability [1,3]. In RPE, unilateral lung injury is initiated by cytotoxic oxygen metabolites and temporally associated with an influx of polymorphonuclear neutrophils [1]. These toxic oxygen products are the results of re-oxygenation of a collapsed lung. Treatment of re-expansion pulmonary edema is basically preventive [4].

### Controversies regarding albumin therapy in cirrhosis [^1162jbJQ]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Notably, none of the RCTs of terlipressin versus placebo have defined HRS-AKI using the most current definition. In the CONFIRM trial, HRS-AKI was defined as a doubling of SCr to a level > 2.25 mg/dL) and patients had a mean creatinine of 3.5 mg/dL at randomization. With the new definition, lower baseline SCr levels could meet HRS-AKI criteria and it is likely that a shorter duration of vasoconstrictor/albumin therapy would be required, particularly since the definition of reversal of HRS-AKI now only requires a return of SCr to a level within 0.3 mg/dL of baseline (pre-AKI). Society guidelines recommend the use of vasoconstrictor drugs in combination with albumin as the treatment of choice for HRS-AKI, with terlipressin being the preferred drug, administered either as i.v. bolus or continuous i.v. infusion. Both guidelines recommend that patients should be closely monitored for the possible development of side effects of vasoconstrictors and albumin, including ischemic complications and pulmonary edema.

Further possible and controversial indications of albumin

Because of the many recommended indications of albumin and its purported benefits beyond volume expansion, many practitioners have considered this as a "golden bullet", the answer to every complication of cirrhosis. This has led to the widespread use of albumin for indications for which there is a lack of strong scientific evidence or even for indications for which evidence discourages the use of albumin. These indications and the rationale for the use of albumin in them are outlined in the following section.

### Fluid administration and monitoring in ARDS: which management? [^112WeLYB]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Modalities of fluid management in patients sustaining the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are challenging and controversial. Optimal fluid management should provide adequate oxygen delivery to the body, while avoiding inadvertent increase in lung edema which further impairs gas exchange. In ARDS patients, positive fluid balance has been associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation, longer ICU and hospital stay, and higher mortality. Accordingly, a restrictive strategy has been compared to a more liberal approach in randomized controlled trials conducted in various clinical settings. Restrictive strategies included fluid restriction guided by the monitoring of extravascular lung water, pulmonary capillary wedge or central venous pressure, and furosemide targeted to diuresis and/or albumin replacement in hypoproteinemic patients. Overall, restrictive strategies improved oxygenation significantly and reduced duration of mechanical ventilation, but had no significant effect on mortality. Fluid management may require different approaches depending on the time course of ARDS (i.e., early vs. late period). The effects of fluid strategy management according to ARDS phenotypes remain to be evaluated. Since ARDS is frequently associated with sepsis-induced acute circulatory failure, the prediction of fluid responsiveness is crucial in these patients to avoid hemodynamically inefficient-hence respiratory detrimental-fluid administration. Specific hemodynamic indices of fluid responsiveness or mini-fluid challenges should be preferably used. Since the positive airway pressure contributes to positive fluid balance in ventilated ARDS patients, it should be kept as low as possible. As soon as the hemodynamic status is stabilized, correction of cumulated fluid retention may rely on diuretics administration or renal replacement therapy.

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^114sHcK1]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Which concentration of albumin solution?

Albumin solutions are available in a variety of concentrations, mainly 20 to 25% or 4 to 5%, and which concentration should be used has generated some debate. Direct blood volume measurements in humans have revealed that the intravascular volume effect of isooncotic preparations of human albumin solutions is much higher than that of crystalloids (> 80% vs < 20%). However, the albumin concentration chosen largely depends on whether other fluids, especially crystalloids, are administered simultaneously – a 20% (20 g in 100 ml) albumin solution given simultaneously with 500 mL of normal saline solution is equivalent to a 3.3% (20/600) albumin solution. Nevertheless, hyperoncotic albumin may be a better choice if edema is already present, avoiding excessive sodium and chloride loads and their attendant complications.

Which dose of albumin?

Determining the ideal dose or volume of albumin that should be used is difficult. Early physiological studies demonstrated that administration of 5% albumin to septic patients expanded the plasma volume by an amount equivalent to the volume infused. Different studies have used different doses, and perhaps the dose should be adjusted according to a target serum albumin concentration, as in the ALBIOS study. The dose chosen by Mira and colleagues in the EARSS study (100 mL of 20% albumin 8 hourly for 3 days) achieved an increase in serum albumin to 25 to 29 g/l, raising the possibility that the albumin dose used may have been too low to show definite benefit – although this increase was similar to that reported in the SAFE study subgroup analysis of patients with sepsis, in whom a benefit was reported.

### Small-volume resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials [^114336BJ]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Small-volume resuscitation

A small volume can be administered more rapidly, and so the period during which the patient remains at increased risk of poor outcome can be commensurately reduced. In the pre-hospital setting, hyperoncotic albumin could accelerate hemodynamic stabilization and transport to hospital. Another advantage in the pre-hospital setting is the portability of small hyperoncotic albumin volumes.

In surgical patients, small-volume hyperoncotic albumin resuscitation may simplify fluid management by maintaining a stable hemodynamic state. In a retrospective study of 28 patients undergoing pelvic exenterations for gynecological malignancies, recipients of 25% albumin required fewer boluses of fluid (p < 0.01), electrolyte (p < 0.01) and diuretic (p < 0.01) and could be started sooner on central hyperalimentation (p < 0.05) than the group receiving crystalloid.

Speed of resuscitation may also be of the essence in rapidly progressing conditions such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and in the urgent care of high-risk neonates. In pre-term infants with respiratory distress syndrome, intravenous administration of 1 g/kg 25% albumin over a 10 min period increased blood volume (p < 0.0005) and mean arterial blood pressure (p < 0.05) within 10 min after infusion was completed. Albumin also significantly augmented glomerular filtration in that study, as indicated by increased creatinine clearance (p < 0.005).

Edema

Formation of edema serves as a harbinger of organ failure and may, depending upon the tissues affected, lead to impairments in gas exchange, myocardial compliance, neurocognitive function, gut barrier competence, nutrient absorption and wound healing. Pulmonary edema, for instance, is associated with prolonged ventilator dependence and intensive care unit stay. Furthermore, positive fluid balance appears to be predictive of poorer survival in sepsis. Encephalopathy may occur at least as frequently as other forms of organ damage during sepsis. Contributors to septic encephalopathy are reduced cerebral blood flow and oxygen extraction by the brain and cerebral edema. While edema may be adequately tolerated by many patients, such as young serious trauma victims, more grave consequences may be faced by elderly or frail patients in whom edema may retard oxygen delivery to the lungs, myocardium and brain.

### Albumin treatment regimen for type 1 hepatorenal syndrome: a dose-response meta-analysis [^115518qR]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Unlike the vasoconstrictors, adverse events attributable to albumin infusion have been reported only very infrequently in the included and other studies, and these have been related to pulmonary edema and/or circulatory overload. Two included studies specifically reported no adverse effects related to intravenous albumin administration. Therefore while albumin infusion, even in high total doses, appears to be well-tolerated in type 1 HRS patients, nonetheless, monitoring of central venous pressure directly by catheterization or indirectly by vena cava ultrasound for signs of excessive cardiac preload may be a prudent precaution, especially in patients receiving higher cumulative albumin doses.

The pathophysiology of type 1 HRS is complex, but pivotal to its onset is the marked reduction of effective arterial blood volume resulting from blood volume redistribution into the splanchnic circulation and relatively insufficient cardiac output. This leads to renal hypoperfusion caused by both reduced renal perfusion pressure and renal vasoconstriction resulting from increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sympathetic nervous system.

The hypovolemia of type 1 HRS patients is an effective not an absolute volume deficiency. A critical amount of the circulating volume becomes pooled in the enlarged splanchnic circulation because of increased portal resistance to portal flow, excess production of a number of endogenous vasodilators, most notably nitric oxide (NO), and decreased responsiveness to endogenous vasoconstrictors in that area. Pharmacologic therapy with vasoconstrictors is thought to reverse HRS primarily by working on the splanchnic vasculature to redistribute part of the splanchnic volume back to the systemic circulation.

The infusion of hyperoncotic 20 or 25% albumin can enhance and accelerate this redistribution by drawing fluid into the central circulatory volume because of its potent oncotic properties. Hyperoncotic albumin can expand intravascular volume from 210 to 260% of its administered volume. This small volume resuscitation is advantageous in type 1 HRS patients because they already carry a large fluid load and substantial fluid infusion could potentially lead to worsening of ascites, pleural effusion or heart failure. In addition, albumin administration to cirrhotic patients with ascites has been shown to result in markedly reduced plasma renin activity, aldosterone levels and muscle sympathetic nerve activity in a number of patient types with ascites.

### Is the mechanism of re-expansion pulmonary oedema in a heart-lung interaction? [^115jji6i]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

The mechanism of re-expansion pulmonary oedema (Re-PE) is unclear. There are multiple variables in play when evaluating the response to evacuation of pleural fluid. We present an educational case of a critically ill patient admitted for respiratory failure who was fully dependent on ventricular pacing set at a constant rate throughout the episode of Re-PE. The transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed an ejection fraction of 38%, moderate mitral regurgitation (MR), mildly dilated right ventricle and moderate pulmonary hypertension. A pleural tap evacuated 850mL of transudate, which was followed by tachypnoea and deteriorating oxygenation. Another repeat TTE revealed a Re-PE with elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, severe MR, increased pulmonary hypertension and a decrease in stroke volume. There were no parallel changes in ventilation modality, heart rate, fluid therapy and vasopressor dosage. The treatment was initiated with dobutamine. The patient was extubated the next day and was later discharged to the cardiology department.

### Small-volume resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials [^113NM8n7]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Key messages

Hyperoncotic 20 to 25% albumin solutions are suitable for small-volume resuscitation.

In a systematic review of 25 randomized clinical trials, several benefits of hyperoncotic albumin were documented such as decreases in morbidity, renal impairment and edema.

There was no evidence of deleterious effects due to hyperoncotic albumin.

Overall survival was not affected by hyperoncotic albumin (pooled relative risk, 0.95; 95% confidence interval 0.78–1.17).

Further clinical trials of hyperoncotic albumin are warranted.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

Most common adverse reactions seen in clinical trials (greater than or equal to 5% incidence) were anaphylactoid type reactions.

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Octapharma USA Inc. at phone # 866–766–4860 and/or FDA at 1–800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

6.1 General

The most serious events are anaphylactic shock, circulatory failure, cardiac failure, and pulmonary edema.

The most common adverse events are anaphylactoid type of reactions.

Adverse reactions for ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% normally resolve when the infusion rate is slowed down or the infusion is stopped. In case of severe reactions, the infusion should be stopped and appropriate treatment should be initiated.

6.2 Clinical Studies Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trial of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

A prospective, double-blind parallel-group study was performed with ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25%. The trial compared the efficacy and safety of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% versus a licensed human albumin 25% solution in preventing central volume depletion after paracentesis due to cirrhotic ascites.

In total, 17 subjects (12 males, 5 females; median age 53 years, range 35–75) received study infusions (10 subjects received ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% infusions and 7 subjects received the comparator drug. The maximum exposure was 3 infusions (5 subjects in the ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% treatment group and 4 subjects in the comparator group). The dose administered was 8 grams of study product for every 1000 mL of ascites removed.

Table 1 lists all adverse events (AEs) that occurred in more than 5% of subjects, irrespective of causality.

6.3 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) (any strength). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113TnLRo]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Cirrhosis with acute kidney injury (AKI) — vasoconstrictor response, renal replacement therapy (RRT), and transplant evaluation — Patients should be closely monitored for the possible development of side effects of vasoconstrictors and albumin, including ischemic complications and pulmonary edema. Response to terlipressin or norepinephrine is defined by creatinine decreases to < 1.5 mg/dL or return to within 0.3 mg/dL of baseline over a maximum of 14 days, and therapy may be discontinued if creatinine remains at or above the pretreatment level over 4 days with the maximum tolerated doses of the vasoconstrictor. Recurrence may occur after treatment discontinuation and should be retreated. All patients with cirrhosis and AKI should be considered for urgent liver transplantation (LT) evaluation given the high short-term mortality even in responders to vasoconstrictors. RRT should be used in candidates for LT with worsening renal function or electrolyte disturbances or increasing volume overload unresponsive to vasoconstrictor therapy, and initiation of RRT in patients who are not candidates for LT must be made with a clear endpoint in mind. Given the complexity of patients with suspected AKI, timely initiation of vasoconstrictor therapy and RRT should be made, if possible, by multidisciplinary teams including specialists in hepatology, nephrology, critical care, and transplant surgery. Simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation may be necessary for patients who are not expected to recover kidney function posttransplantation.

Regarding medical management for burn injury, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, albumin, ABA 2024 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence on whether to initiate albumin before or after 12 hours to reduce the volume of administered fluid, improve urine output, or decrease edema in situations where albumin is part of the resuscitation plan (not a rescue situation). Consider initiating albumin any time in the first 12 hours in the context of a research study, given the uncertainty about the undesirable outcome of pulmonary edema related to early albumin provision and the overall importance of timing.

### Controversies regarding albumin therapy in cirrhosis [^113kfjZX]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Albumin in the prevention of relevant outcomes in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and ascites

The ATTIRE study, that included inpatients with decompensated cirrhosis, hypothesized that albumin infusion would prevent bacterial infection, AKI, and/or death. This was an open-label randomized trial that included 777 patients hospitalized with a decompensating event, mostly new or worsening ascites. Patients were randomized to either standard-of-care (albumin administration for recommended indications: LVP, SBP, AKI, HRS-AKI) or to albumin infusions aimed at maintaining a serum albumin level ≥ 3.0 g/L throughout hospitalization. The study was negative as it failed to find differences in the composite primary outcome between daily albumin and standard-of-care (30% in each group experienced the primary outcome). In addition, the experimental group received 10 times the amount of albumin that the standard-of-care group received and, consequently, had more severe serious adverse events, especially pulmonary edema. Again, although experimentally these investigators had shown that albumin could improve immunity by improving B-cell functionand macrophage-mediated hepatic inflammation, the lack of efficacy of albumin in the ATTIRE trial indicates that in these patients the severity of disease is more relevant than the experimentally demonstrated potential benefits of albumin. Importantly, the ATTIRE study demonstrates that targeting albumin administration to reach predefined serum albumin levels is not appropriate for clinical practice and can lead to volume overload.

An important conclusion derived from most studies regarding albumin infusion is that albumin administration should be monitored not based on serum albumin levels but on volume repletion status. Future studies in inpatients should explore noninvasive methods to evaluate volume repletion so that albumin dosing could be used in a rational way.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^116wmkLo]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) in cirrhosis — algorithmic management begins with an "Acute increase in serum creatinine > 0.3 mg/dL", after which stage 1 is split into "AKI 1a: creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL" and "AKI 1b: creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL", and "AKI 2–3" represents higher-stage disease; initial stage 1 care is "Risk factor management*: monitor 48 hours", while persistent cases and higher stages receive "Risk factors management* Albumin (1g/kg) for 2 days". Nonresolution prompts "Urinary biomarkers" to triage to "Consistent with ATN", for which the action box states "Renal replacement therapy on individualized basis", or "Consistent with HRS", for which the action box states "Vasoconstrictor therapy + albumin". The legend clarifies that "Initial management of AKI (increase in serum creatinine > 0.3 mg/dL in 48 hours) is geared toward reversing risk factors", and that "When the serum creatinine has increased > 1.5mg/dL (Stage 1b), or to ≥ 2 times baseline value (stage 2; stage 3 when serum creatinine has increased > 3 times baseline value) and remains above these levels despite risk factor management for 2 days, then vasoconstrictor agents are indicated provided patient meets HRS criteria"; it also defines response thresholds: "Complete response to therapy is defined return of the serum creatinine with treatment to < 0.3 mg above baseline value; partial response is defined as reduction in serum creatinine but to > 0.3 mg above baseline value". Risk factor management "involves holding diuretics, beta-blockers, and nephrotoxic drugs and discontinuing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) agents; treating infections and other precipitating causes; and expanding plasma volume as required", and "Careful monitoring for fluid overload is required when albumin is administered in patients with AKI because of the risk of pulmonary edema".

### Small-volume resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials [^11531HUR]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

In the survival meta-analysis, the short median follow-up of 5 days may account partly or entirely for the lack of overall effect. Follow-up of 30 days or longer is typical for outcomes trials. Even at 30 days survival, differences may be substantially underestimated compared with those observed at 90 days. In all three included trials designed to assess survival, the follow-up period was at least 90 days.

As in previous systematic reviews of albumin administration, one of the control regimens represented among the trials in this review was no albumin, accounting for six of the included trials (24%). No albumin as the designated control regimen did not necessarily mean no volume expansion, however. In one surgery trial the no-albumin control group received a cumulative mean volume of 24 l non-colloid fluids over the course of the 5-day study. In two trials of high-risk neonates, the no albumin control regimen consisted of routine fluid or 5 ml/kg infant maintenance fluid. No albumin control group volume expansion, if any, in three other trials was unspecified. If control patients in any of those three trials did not receive volume expanders, then observed differences between the hyperoncotic albumin and control arms might have reflected volume expansion rather than a specific effect of hyperoncotic albumin per se. In that scenario, it is possible that an alternative fluid could exert effects similar to those observed with hyperoncotic albumin.

These limitations highlight the need for further trials. There is consistent evidence that hyperoncotic albumin has the capacity to reduce edema; however, the impact of edema reduction on outcomes requires further investigation. Short follow-up has been a deficiency of most hyperoncotic albumin trials to date, and future trials with longer follow-up are essential to assess outcomes. Especially in the areas of surgery, trauma and sepsis existing data need to be supplemented by additional trials. Lastly, standardized and well-specified control regimens will be important in future trials so that clearer inferences can be drawn concerning the specific effects of hyperoncotic albumin vs those of particular alternative fluids or generic volume expansion.

### Lung-kidney interactions in critically ill patients: consensus report of the Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) 21 workgroup [^111hCex5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Recommendation for research

Experimental studies focusing on specific pathways of kidney–lung interaction and the impact of interventions that mitigate the impact of AKI on respiratory failure. These may include the effects of inhibition of HBP (albumin, heparin), IL-10 production and resistin elimination by haemoperfusion techniques for example.

Question: What are interventions or modifiable risk factors which may mitigate respiratory dysfunction among patients with AKI?

Consensus statements

Evidence does not support one single approach to the management of severe AKI in the setting of respiratory failure.
Appropriate timing of RRT initiation and the rate and volume of fluid and solute removal should be determined by patient characteristics and clinical circumstances.

Rationale

No single approach has demonstrated clear benefit for patients who have AKI and develop respiratory failure. Close monitoring and optimization of haemodynamic status and judicious use of intravascular volume expansion or careful volume removal after the initial resuscitation phase are crucial. Patients with AKI are at increased risk of fluid overload and pulmonary oedema. A post hoc analysis of the FACTT trial demonstrated that a negative fluid balance using a higher cumulative dose of diuretics is associated with improved mortality in patients with AKI. Administration of albumin together with furosemide improved oxygenation in ARDS patients with hypoalbuminaemia and facilitated negative fluid balance, particularly in tandem with a conservative approach to fluid replacement. However, this was not performed in patients with AKI. Furthermore, albumin may inactivate HBP (that increases endothelial permeability) and a HBP to albumin ratio > 3 has been associated with increased risk of AKI in sepsis.

Initiation of RRT corrects metabolic acidosis secondary to AKI and improves oxygenation in volume overload. However, the best modality, timing and intensity to optimize respiratory function are unknown. The role of immune modulating interventions is poorly established. Preliminary data, indicating beneficial effects of resistin elimination by sorbent-based haemoadsorption require confirmation in clinical studies. Haemoadsorption has been shown to reduce levels of the uraemic toxin resistin and improving macrophage function ex vivo.

Recommendations for practice

We recommend adherence to KDIGO guidelines for AKI management, as it may translate into improved pulmonary outcomes (Grade 1D).
We suggest conservative fluid management and selected use of diuretics or ultrafiltration (RRT) in patients with AKI on IMV to improve respiratory function and decrease duration of IMV in patients with ARF/ARDS (Grade 2C).
We recommend delivery of RRT to mitigate the metabolic consequences of AKI particularly where acid – base derangement may affect ventilation (Grade 1D).

### Controversies regarding albumin therapy in cirrhosis [^115KCnYd]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

In another larger randomized non–placebo-controlled study by Thevenot et alincluding patients with a higher MELD score and non-SBP infection (also predominantly pneumonia and urinary tract infection) with 13% having severe sepsis, albumin use was not associated with a significant benefit in either the 3-month development of renal dysfunction (primary outcome) or in 3-month survival (secondary endpoint). As in the study by Guevara and colleagues, a third of the patients did not have ascites. Of note, pulmonary edema developed in 8 of 96 patients in the albumin group of whom 2 died, leading to the premature discontinuation of the study. Investigators cautioned against the use of albumin in the "sickest cirrhotic patients".

A third multicenter study (INFECIR-2) was recently performed in a study population that was more similar to the Guevara et al's study. The study did not show significant differences in in-hospital and 90-day mortality rates between treatment arms, confirming the results of the prior RCTs. In fact, the trial had to be terminated prematurely when less than a third of the planned number of patients had been enrolled because of lack of effect on survival and, as in the 2 other studies, because of a greater incidence of pulmonary edema in the albumin treatment group. In post hoc analyses, albumin prevented secondary bacterial infection, decreased inflammatory biomarkers, and improved circulatory dysfunction.

The dose of albumin used in the 3 trials are those recommended for SBP that, as mentioned above, were empirical: 1.5 g/kg of body weight on day 1 and 1 g/kg of body weight on day 3. Since the 3 trials had pulmonary edema as the main complication it is obvious that doses of albumin recommended are too high and should not be weight-based. This would be particularly relevant for patients with NASH, the currently most common etiology of cirrhosis in the United States, where obesity is more prevalent compared with other etiologies. Importantly, patients with pneumonia were the most prone to develop pulmonary edema in these trials and special attention should be placed when volume expanding these patients independent of the indication.

Based on 3 negative RCTs and a meta-analysis, one cannot recommend albumin in the management of infections other than SBP, in a similar way as for SBP. There may be a subgroup of these patients that may benefit from albumin use and these may be those with AKI, for whom albumin is already recommended at lower doses (see above).

### Albumin human — albumin — human [^111tKWuE]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity

Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions have been observed, and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis. Epinephrine should be available immediately to treat any acute hypersensitivity reaction.

5.2 Hypervolemia/Hemodilution

Hypervolemia may occur if the dosage and rate of infusion are not adjusted to the patient's volume status. At the first clinical signs of possible cardiovascular overload, e.g., headache, dyspnea, increased blood pressure, jugular venous distention, elevated central venous pressure, pulmonary edema, the infusion should be stopped immediately and the patient reevaluated. Albumin should be used with caution in conditions where hypervolemia and its consequences or hemodilution could represent a special risk for the patient. Examples of such conditions are:

Decompensated cardiac insufficiency
Hypertension
Esophageal varices
Pulmonary edema
Hemorrhagic diathesis
Severe anemia
Renal and post-renal anuria.

5.3 Electrolyte Imbalance

20–25% Albumin (Human) is relatively low in electrolytes compared to the 4–5% Albumin (Human) solutions. When albumin is given, monitor the electrolyte status of the patient and take appropriate steps taken to restore or maintain the electrolyte balance.

5.4 Coagulation Abnormalities

If comparatively large volumes are to be replaced, monitoring of coagulation and hematocrit is necessary. Ensure adequate substitution of other blood constituents (coagulation factors, electrolytes, platelets and erythrocytes).

5.5 Laboratory Monitoring

If ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% is to be administered, monitor hemodynamic performance regularly; this may include:

Arterial blood pressure and pulse rate
Central venous pressure
Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure
Urine output
Electrolytes
Hematocrit/hemoglobin.

5.6 Application Precautions

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% must not be diluted with sterile water for injection as this may cause hemolysis in recipients.

5.7 Infection Risk from Human Plasma

This product is a derivative of human plasma. Based on effective donor screening and product manufacturing processes it carries an extremely remote risk for transmission of viral diseases. A theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) also is considered extremely remote. No cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have been identified for ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25%.

### Everything you need to know about deresuscitation [^114qrhV2]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

How to deresuscitate?

In principle, parameters achieved during the stabilization phase should be maintained during deresuscitation. Prevention (fluid restriction) and de-escalation come first and clinicians should be aware that most fluids given are not given for resuscitation purposes (only 6%) but rather for maintenance (25%), nutrition (33%) and drug administration (fluid creep) (33%). Measures to remove excess fluid can be pharmacologic (drugs) and non-pharmacologic (net UF), combined with fluid restriction. Provided some kidney function is preserved, diuretics are usually tried first, either as monotherapy or in combination. The options are summarized in supplementary Table 1 and include loop diuretics (furosemide, bumetanide), carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (acetazolamide), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (spironolactone), thiazides or thiazide-like drugs (indapamide). In case of low serum albumin levels (< 30 g/L) or low serum total protein levels (< 60 g/L), hyper-oncotic albumin 20–25% can be added for synergistic effect. The combination of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP, in cmH 2 O, set at the level of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) in mmHg), followed by hyper-oncotic albumin (up to albumin levels of 30 g/L) and furosemide resulted in a negative cumulative fluid balance, a reduction of EVLWI and IAP, and improved clinical outcomes in a matched cohort of 114 critically ill patients with hyperpermeability pulmonary edema. However, caution is necessary when using hyper-oncotic human albumin solution to facilitate restrictive fluid therapy. Current evidence stems mostly from observational studies, and more randomized trials are needed to better establish a personalized approach to fluid management.

### Effects of saline or albumin fluid bolus in resuscitation: evidence from re-analysis of the FEAST trial [^111pW9rA]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Implications of all the available evidence

Despite the universal belief that volume expansion with crystalloid or colloidal fluid is beneficial in sepsis, and the inclusion of bolus volume expansion in current treatment recommendations, the FEAST trial showed fluid bolus increased mortality. The results of our analysis of the vital signs, haematological data, and biochemical data from FEAST provide a biologically plausible explanation for the adverse outcomes associated with bolus fluids. A modest bolus (20–40 mL/kg) of normal saline or albumin resulted in prolonged hyperchloraemic acidosis, reduced haemoglobin concentration, and worse respiratory and neurological function in the early hours after infusion, despite transient improvement in cardiovascular function, and explained the increase mortality in bolus recipients. Of these effects, saline-induced hyperchloraemic acidosis was a major contributor to the adverse outcome in bolus recipients. Our data suggest that normal saline and other unbuffered crystalloid solutions should be avoided in resuscitating seriously ill patients. Because volume resuscitation is associated with deterioration of respiratory function and neurological function in some patients, caution in use of fluids might be needed in patients with respiratory or CNS compromise, and trials of lower volumes of buffered solutions are now needed to establish whether the beneficial effects of fluid on cardiovascular function can be achieved with less risk of respiratory and neurological compromise.

By contrast with practice in resource-rich countries, fluid bolus resuscitation is not routine in Africa and other resource-poor regions. There has been an equipoise in many African hospitals between clinicians who recommend fluid resuscitation and those who avoid rapid fluid bolus resuscitation for fear that it might result in pulmonary or cerebral oedema. It was this equipoise in the use of fluids for resuscitation that motivated the FEAST (Fluid Expansion As Supportive Treatment) trial. In FEAST, 3141 febrile children with signs of under-perfusion in Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania were randomly allocated to receive 20–40 mL/kg of normal saline or albumin bolus or maintenance only fluids. There was surprise both among the investigators as well as the wider scientific community when the trial was stopped by the study data and safety monitoring group after 3141 patients had been recruited, because of clear evidence of increased incidence of death in the recipients of bolus fluids.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^115VYHyv]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Albumin is administered in a wide spectrum of clinical scenarios including complications of cirrhosis, intradialytic hypotension, volume resuscitation, and priming of cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. Iso-oncotic albumin often is used to maintain intravascular volume in patients with hypovolemia, assuming that crystalloid resuscitation will be ineffective given its shorter intravascular half-life. Hyperoncotic albumin is used to correct low serum albumin levels or to mobilize extravascular fluid.

Hypoalbuminemia is common in acute and chronic illness. Hospitalized patients with hypoalbuminemia have been described as having greater morbidity compared with patients with preserved albumin levels, promoting the use of IV albumin. In the postoperative period, serum albumin levels decreases precipitously by 10 to 15 g/L; hypoalbuminemia is thought to be the result of suppressed synthesis by inflammatory cytokinesand transcapillary loss. In addition to its use in patients with hypoalbuminemia, edema, or both, albumin also is used for the prevention and treatment of hypovolemia, particular after administration of large volumes of IV crystalloid solutions.

Practice audits describing the use of albumin show highly variable practice among regions. Albumin is manufactured from large volumes of plasma and is expensive (approximately $130/25 g United States dollars; warehouse acquisition cost of albumin), with the acquisition cost likely a fraction of the total health care expenditure. Albumin also can be associated with adverse consequences, including fluid overload, hypotension, hemodilution requiring RBC transfusion, anaphylaxis, and peripheral gangrene from dilution of natural anticoagulants. Because potential benefits and risks are associated with its use, a multidisciplinary, international guideline panel was convened to develop evidence-based recommendations for the use of albumin in patient populations where it is prescribed commonly. These guidelines are designed to assist clinicians in their decisions on the use of albumin for its most common uses.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of ascites, volume overload, and hyponatremia in cirrhosis: expert review [^1111AaRS]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update (CPU) is to summarize the available evidence and offer expert Best Practice Advice (BPA) on the management of ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, volume overload, and hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board and Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. This CPU expert review underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through the standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These BPA statements were developed based on review of the published literature and expert opinion and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board. Because formal systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Patients with cirrhosis with ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, or volume overload should be managed with dietary sodium restriction and diuretics at the lowest effective dose, with dose escalation guided by symptoms, weight, urine output, and electrolyte/renal monitoring. Education and referral to a dietitian should be provided for dietary management. Triggers of liver decompensation should be identified and addressed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Patients with cirrhosis with new-onset ascites, or those admitted to the hospital for symptoms related to ascites or encephalopathy should receive diagnostic paracentesis as soon as possible. Testing should include serum ascites albumin gradient and cell count, Gram stain, and culture. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Patients with hepatic hydrothorax with dyspnea and/or hypoxemia should undergo a therapeutic thoracentesis for both symptom relief and expansion of the underlying lung. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: All patients with refractory ascites and/or hepatic hydrothorax should be considered for liver transplantation evaluation, regardless of their Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Refractory ascites and/or hydrothorax should be managed with therapeutic paracentesis and/or thoracentesis, respectively, with the frequency guided by recurrence. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: When the volume of ascites removed is > 5 L, 20%-25% intravenous albumin 6–8 g per every total liter removed should be administered. For patients with hypotension, renal insufficiency, or electrolyte abnormalities, albumin should also be considered for removal of smaller volumes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Well-selected patients with refractory ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, volume overload, or hyponatremia should be referred for to transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Diagnostic workup for the etiology of hyponatremia in cirrhosis should include dietary and medication history (diuretics, bowel regimen); review of electrolyte and kidney function; gastrointestinal bleeding assessment; infectious workup, including diagnostic paracentesis, and evaluation of secondary causes (thyroid or adrenal dysfunction). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Outpatient management of asymptomatic hypervolemic hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis entails both sodium and water restriction (aiming for 1–1.5 L of daily fluid intake), modification of diuretics and laxatives, and monitoring of electrolytes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Inpatient management of severe or symptomatic hypervolemic hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis includes both sodium and water restriction; modification or discontinuation of diuretics and laxatives; and additional measures, such as intravenous albumin based on volume assessment or oral vasoconstriction therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Recurrent or refractory hyponatremia management should involve a multidisciplinary approach (including the liver transplantation team when appropriate) and can consider several therapeutic options, including intravenous vasoconstrictor therapy, infusion of hypertonic saline, use of vasopressin receptor antagonist (vaptans), or use of renal replacement therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Inpatient management of volume overload includes escalation or trial of intravenous loop diuretics (furosemide or bumetanide) in bolus (2–3 times per day) or continuous fashion. Cautious escalation can be done every 2–3 days with monitoring of volume status, kidney function, daily weights, and symptoms. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Advanced strategies in refractory anasarca should be coordinated with nephrology for consideration of diuretics in the setting of contraction alkalosis (eg, addition of acetazolamide), second agent with alternate mechanism of actions (eg, thiazide diuretics, such as metolazone), or need for ultrafiltration.

We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register (searched 31 May 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (Ovid) (1948 to week 3 May 2011), EMBASE (Ovid) (1980 to Week 21 2011), CINAHL (EBSCO) (1982 to May 2011), ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) (1970 to May 2011), ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S) (1990 to May 2011), PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez/) (searched 10 June 2011, limit: last 60 days). Reference lists of trials and review articles were checked, and authors of identified trials were contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing albumin or PPF with no albumin or PPF or with a crystalloid solution in critically ill patients with hypovolaemia, burns or hypoalbuminaemia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected data on the participants, albumin solution used, mortality at the end of follow up, and quality of allocation concealment. Analysis was stratified according to patient type.

Main Results

We found 38 trials meeting the inclusion criteria and reporting death as an outcome. There were 1,958 deaths among 10,842 trial participants. For hypovolaemia, the relative risk of death following albumin administration was 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.13). This estimate was heavily influenced by the results of the SAFE trial, which contributed 75.2% of the information (based on the weights in the meta-analysis). For burns, the relative risk was 2.93 (95% CI 1.28 to 6.72) and for hypoalbuminaemia the relative risk was 1.26 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.88). There was no substantial heterogeneity between the trials in the various categories (Chi(2) = 26.66, df = 31, P = 0.69). The pooled relative risk of death with albumin administration was 1.05 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.16).

Authors' Conclusions

For patients with hypovolaemia, there is no evidence that albumin reduces mortality when compared with cheaper alternatives such as saline. There is no evidence that albumin reduces mortality in critically ill patients with burns and hypoalbuminaemia. The possibility that there may be highly selected populations of critically ill patients in which albumin may be indicated remains open to question. However, in view of the absence of evidence of a mortality benefit from albumin and the increased cost of albumin compared to alternatives such as saline, it would seem reasonable that albumin should only be used within the context of well concealed and adequately powered randomised controlled trials.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on burn shock resuscitation [^112Pjx8P]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

Burn shock resuscitation — albumin administration in adults with major burns is addressed as follows: We recommend that clinicians consider providing albumin in the first 24 hours of resuscitation to improve urinary output and to reduce the total volume of resuscitation fluids. The strength of this recommendation is greater for patients with larger burns, and weaker for patients with smaller burns. We also recommend administration of albumin in "rescue" situations where resuscitation is deteriorating despite receiving escalating amounts of crystalloids. We have low confidence in the strength of the limited available evidence to make any recommendations on the use of albumin to limit edema-related complications. Question 2: Among adults with burns ≥ 20% TBSA should albumin be initiated early (< 12 hours post burn) or late (after 12 hours post burn) during acute fluid resuscitation to (a) reduce total fluid resuscitation volume or total crystalloid resuscitation volume at 24 or 48 hours post burn, (b) increase urine output, or (c) decrease edema-related complications. We identified only one study that met criteria for inclusion by addressing the PICO question of administering albumin "early" (< 12 hours) vs "late" (> 12 hours). Patients who received albumin < 12 hours (N = 118) had significantly larger and deeper burns than those who received albumin later (N = 135). There was also a critical difference between those 2 groups; up to the point when albumin was initiated, those that received early albumin had been administered significantly more crystalloids and had a significantly higher in-to-out (I: O) ratio than those who were given albumin late. Thus, this study cannot answer the question of early versus late albumin with respect to any of our specified outcomes. However, one finding using a linear mixed effect model did show a faster rate of decline in fluids if albumin is given compared to not giving it (point estimate −29.52, 95% CI, −24.21 to −34.83, p < .001). Thus, one might hypothesize that the sooner albumin is administered, the faster the fluid infusion rate will decline, potentially leading to less fluid administration. This is theoretical, and no firm conclusion can be reached about the effects of earlier versus later albumin administration from the ABRUPT study.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on burn shock resuscitation [^113p5J3R]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

Albumin timing during acute burn resuscitation — In situations where albumin is part of the resuscitation plan, the guideline states uncertainty about whether to start albumin before or after 12 hours to reduce crystalloid volume, improve urine output, or decrease edema, and therefore we recommend that initiation of albumin any time in the first 12 hours preferably be considered in the context of a research study.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on burn shock resuscitation [^117M7gCA]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

Burn shock resuscitation — albumin versus crystalloid in adults with large burns is assessed among adults with burns ≥ 20% total body surface area (TBSA) during the first 24 hours to evaluate effects on resuscitation volume at 24 or 48 hours, urine output (UOP), and edema-related complications. In nonrescue comparisons, two high-strength studies and 2 low-strength studies showed either a significant decrease or a trend to lower resuscitation volume with albumin compared to crystalloid alone, whereas most rescue studies found higher volumes with albumin; in rescue studies, patients were generally sicker, had bigger and/or deeper burns, and were already receiving large amounts of crystalloids, potentially influencing outcomes. Across rescue situations, three studies observed that initiation of albumin rapidly lowered the in-to-out (I:O) ratio, suggesting that albumin appears to have a fluid-sparing effect. For UOP, one high strength study showed a tendency to higher UOP in albumin-treated patients, but most studies did not directly examine or report this variable. Edema-related findings were mixed: a predetermined-use, high-strength study found pulmonary edema significantly worsened over the first post burn week in albumin-treated patients; another rescue study saw no respiratory compromise with colloids compared to crystalloid alone; and one meta-analysis found a lower odds of abdominal compartment syndrome with albumin infusion but pooled heterogeneous study types. Mortality was not evaluated due to underpowered and heterogeneous crystalloid-versus-colloid evidence, and larger high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed (e.g. ABRUPT 2, NCT03456859).

### Albumin infusion rate and plasma volume expansion: a randomized clinical trial in postoperative patients after major surgery [^115Qdx89]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Major surgery initiates a systemic inflammatory response syndrome which disrupts the normal regulation of transcapillary fluid exchange and may induce tissue edema and hypovolemia. Fluid replacement is therefore a cornerstone in the perioperative treatment of these patients as well as in patients suffering from increased vascular leakage of other etiologies. Although fluid therapy is life-saving, it is also associated with side effects such as further edema formation and compartment syndromes which may adversely affect the outcome.

From a clinical perspective, it is therefore important that fluid administered to counteract hypovolemia is retained intravascularly as much as possible. Colloids are macromolecules for which the vessel wall has a low permeability, and less volume is required for an equal plasma volume expansion compared to crystalloids. However, extravasation of colloids is not only a function of the vessel wall permeability but is also dependent on the volume of fluid that is filtered across the capillary wall, which in turn depends on the transcapillary hydrostatic pressure. This indicates that infusion rate may influence extravasation of colloids by effects on hydrostatic pressure, but the importance of such an effect on plasma volume expansion by a colloid is unclear. The hypothesis is supported by studies in rodent models of sepsis showing that plasma volume expansion in experimental sepsis is greater after a slow infusion compared to a rapid infusion of the same volume of colloid. In contrast, no effect of a high infusion rate on extravasation of albumin could be demonstrated in porcine endotoxemia.

### Blood volume and hemodynamics during treatment of major hemorrhage with ringer solution, 5% albumin, and 20% albumin: a single-center randomized controlled trial [^11176k9G]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment of major hemorrhage is a challenge for the clinician whenever it occurs in the prehospital setting, in the operating theatre, and in the intensive care unit (ICU). Although blood transfusion is preferred in uncontrolled hemorrhage (trauma patients), hemorrhage in better controlled environments is treated with "clear fluids" until a pre-specified blood hemoglobin level ("transfusion trigger") is reached. Intravenous fluid administration during surgery should still be planned to maintain normovolemia and adequate hemodynamics. However, fluid management is more challenging than in the awake state, as general anesthesia obtunds the body´s ability to correct both fluid overload and hypovolemia; the diuretic response to infused fluid is only 10–15% of normal and the depressive effect of intravenous and volatile anesthetics on lymphatic pumping promotes hypovolemia and decreases the ability to compensate hypovolemia by capillary refill.

Therefore, well-performed fluid therapy requires knowledge about both the hemodynamic adaptation to general anesthesia and to the blood volume (BV) expanding properties of available fluids in scenarios where surgery is associated with major hemorrhage.

Animal models provided evidence in understanding the mechanistic effect of fluid administration in hypovolemic shock. However, quite few randomized studies compare the clinical efficacy of crystalloid and colloids fluid during major hemorrhage in humans, and they have usually been focused on trauma cases. Because crystalloids quickly equilibrate between the intravascular and interstitial volume, very large fluid volumes are needed if only crystalloid fluids are used, which increases the risk of overfilling the patients, raising complications like pulmonary edema, re-bleeding due to dilution effect, and poor healing. Smaller volumes are believed to be needed when colloid fluids are used, which is due to their different pharmacokinetic profile. Dextran and hydroxyethyl starch have left the market, leaving albumin as the colloid fluid of choice in the ICU and in the perioperative setting, but its documentation is mainly based on old literature. The hyperoncotic 20% albumin is known to offer strong plasma volume expansion (PVE) per infused volume, being approximately twice the infused volume, in volunteers and during surgery with minor hemorrhage. However, the efficacy of albumin solutions during major surgery has been questioned based on the belief that the capillary leakage rate is markedly increased by shedding of the endothelial glycocalyx layer.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^113igVB6]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Two small prospective RCTs compared standard dose (6–8 g/L of ascites drained) albumin after LVP with low-dose albumin (2–4 g/L). Pooled results from 70 patients suggested no difference in post-paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (RR = 2.97, 95% CI 0.89, 9.91) and no development of renal dysfunction (no events in either group). A larger retrospective review of 935 patients found no increase in renal dysfunction when adherence to guidance (8 g/L after 5 L drained) was implemented, but significant cost savings were made because less HAS was used.

Potential cost savings have been proposed in relation to length of hospital stay in patients with ascites undergoing LVP who are treated with HAS as compared with an alternative plasma expander. However, HAS is more expensive than alternatives and is in worldwide shortage, therefore it should be prescribed according to recommended guidance based on the available evidence. There have been no cost-effectiveness analyses in the UK.

Until further studies are undertaken to compare efficacy of albumin against clinically available artificial plasma expanders, we would recommend that albumin remains the preferred plasma expander when paracentesis is undertaken. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) should be infused after paracentesis of > 5 L is completed at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^114Gkx8V]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Management of HRS-AKI — prevention focuses on modifiable triggers and cautious albumin use, noting uncertain long-term benefit. Prevention measures include "avoidance of alcohol use, monitoring of serum creatinine and electrolytes when patients are on diuretics, albumin infusion with therapeutic paracentesis, administering antibiotics with episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding, antibiotic prophylaxis against spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and avoiding use of nonselective beta-blockers and nephrotoxic medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs". It is stated that "It is unclear whether long-term albumin infusion prevents HRS. Long-term albumin administration reduced the likelihood of developing HRS and improved 18-month survival in one study, but the results were not replicated in another study". Patients "may derive most benefit when the serum albumin is kept above 4 g/ dL", and clinicians should recognize that "Albumin infusion may be associated with volume overload and life-threatening pulmonary edema".

### Hydrostatic mechanisms may contribute to the pathogenesis of human re-expansion pulmonary edema [^116iiFTK]. Intensive Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The primary objective was to test the hypothesis that clinical re-expansion pulmonary edema is predominantly due to increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier. A secondary objective was to determine if the alveolar epithelium was functionally intact in patients with re-expansion pulmonary edema by measuring net alveolar epithelial fluid transport in a subset of patients.

Design

Retrospective study of mechanically ventilated patients with re-expansion pulmonary edema.

Setting

Two academic tertiary care hospitals.

Patients

Seven patients with acute onset of re-expansion pulmonary edema after tube thoracostomy or thoracentesis.

Interventions

Pulmonary edema fluid and plasma were collected at the time of onset of re-expansion edema.

Measurements and Results

Contrary to our hypothesis, the mean initial edema fluid to plasma protein ratio was 0.58 ± 0.21, supporting a hydrostatic mechanism of edema formation. Four of the patients had an initial edema fluid to plasma protein ratio of less than 0.65, consistent with pure hydrostatic pulmonary edema, while the others had a slight increase in permeability (edema fluid to plasma ratios of 0.67, 0.71 and 0.77), perhaps due to capillary stress failure from hydrostatic stress. Alveolar fluid clearance (mean 9.8 ± 8.0%/h) was intact in the subset of three patients in whom it was measured.

Conclusions

This study provides the first direct evidence that hydrostatic forces may contribute to the development of re-expansion pulmonary edema.

### Can albumin reduce the mortality of patients with cirrhosis and ascites? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112HcBSN]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Albumin therapy in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis has always been a controversial issue. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of albumin in reducing mortality and controlling complications in patients with liver cirrhosis and provide a reference for relevant decision-making.

Methods

Databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched to collect eligible articles published before January 2022, which were analyzed by Revman 5.3.

Results

A total of 10 randomized controlled trials (2040 patients) were included. Based on the meta-analysis results, no significant difference in mortality was shown between the albumin administration group and the control group (HR = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.97–1.05; P = 0.62). Subgroup analysis showed that albumin administration had no significant short-term or long-term survival benefits in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis and increased the risk of pulmonary edema adverse reactions (RR = 3.14; 95% CI, 1.48–6.65; P = 0.003). Subgroup analysis based on albumin administration time showed that short-term (HR = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.76–1.13; P = 0.47) or long-term (HR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.87–1.08; P = 0.58) administration of albumin could not significantly reduce the mortality of patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis. In contrast, albumin administration could significantly reduce the recurrence rate of ascites (RR = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.46–0.68; P = 0.000).

Conclusion

Short-term(< 1 month) or long-term (> 1 month) administration of albumin can not significantly reduce the mortality of patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis, and a large amount of albumin infusion will increase the risk of pulmonary edema.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^112PX1Z2]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Evidence Summary

We identified a 2019 Cochrane systematic review including 27 RCTs (N = 1,592) examining the use of any plasma volume expanders in patients with cirrhosis undergoing paracentesis. In general, enrolled patients were undergoing large-volume paracentesis (> 5 L), and the most commonly used albumin doses were either 6 to 8 g of albumin per 1 L of fluid removed or a standard dose of 20 to 40 g. Compared with no plasma expander, no statistically significant effect of using hyperoncotic (20%-25%) albumin on mortality (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.06–4.83), kidney impairment (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.02–5.88), or recurrence of ascites (RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.49–3.42) was found. Compared with hyperoncotic albumin, use of other fluids showed uncertain effects on mortality (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.82–1.30), kidney impairment (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.71–1.91), and recurrence of ascites (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.96–1.36). Paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction was more frequent with nonalbumin plasma expanders (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.31–2.99) compared with albumin. A 2020 systematic review focused on the impact of different therapies (albumin, other fluids, vasoactive drugs) on the rate of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction and identified nine RCTs (N = 620). Albumin at a dose of 8 g/L was found to be superior to other volume expanders for the prevention of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction (rise in plasma renin activity by ≥ 50% of baseline). Similar to the Cochrane review, uncertainty regarding the role of albumin as compared with alternative treatments was noted for the prevention of complications after paracentesis. RCTs comparing high-dose albumin (6–8 g/L of ascitic fluid removed) with low-dose albumin (2–4 g/L of ascitic fluid removed) found no difference in the rate of paracentesis associated circulatory dysfunction, although uncertainty exists regarding the risk to benefit profile of the two doses, given the small sample size (two studies [N = 120]; RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.22–4.49).

### Albumin versus crystalloid solutions in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115vJ2BD]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

In patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the alveolar-capillary barrier permeability is increased due to inflammation, resulting in extravasation of protein-enriched fluid into the alveoli. In turn, the presence of pulmonary exudate in the alveoli, as well as the inactivation of lung surfactant can result in life-threatening hypoxemia, impaired CO 2 elimination, and decreased lung compliance. Thus, mechanical ventilation is often required in such patients in order to improve oxygenation and alleviate the work of breathing. The use of low tidal volumes and moderate-to-high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can reduce mortality in severe ARDS patients. As it is a multifactorial syndrome, patients with ARDS face reduction of intravascular volume during the course of disease. In order to counteract these episodes, fluid therapy needs to be instituted promptly.

Experimental and clinical data demonstrate beneficial effects on the lungs of colloids compared to crystalloids, including reduced alveolar-capillary permeability, less histological damage, decreased inflammatory cell infiltration and faster hemodynamic stabilization. On the other hand, tissue edema might be increased due to extravasation of colloid molecules in the presence of high capillary leakage. Furthermore, damage due to the use of synthetic colloids, namely hydroxylethlyl starch, and also gelatin are associated with a higher risk of death and kidney injury in septic patients. Due to those adverse effects, the interest in intravascular volume expansion using human albumin is increasing. However, a recent meta-analysis on the use of colloids in general critically ill populations found no difference in mortality among the different colloids compared to crystalloids.

In view of those controversial findings the use of colloids in critically ill patients has been intensively debated, but a consensus has not been achieved. In particular, the population of ARDS patients remains unaddressed. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of colloid compared to crystalloid therapy on mortality and oxygenation in adults with ARDS.

### Is the mechanism of re-expansion pulmonary oedema in a heart-lung interaction? [^115gTicN]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

On Re-PE incidence, Echevarria et al provided an insightful paper where they went through Medline and searched for papers dated from 1950 to January 2008. Of the 233 papers, 13 provided some insight into the existence of Re-PE with a reported incidence of 0%–1%. Mynarek et al found zero occurrence of Re-PE after investigating 711 ultrasound-guided thoracentesis procedures performed on 371 patients. Rozenman et al detailed their experience over an 8-year period where 180 patients who experienced 320 episodes of pneumothorax, and only 3 of 320 cases of Re-PE were diagnosed. All these insightful papers conclude that Re-PE is overall a rare entity.

Stawicki et al stated some risk factors of Re-PE as: size of effusion or pneumothorax, duration of collapse, technique used for re-expansion and pulmonary artery pressure changes among others. The British Thoracic Society guidelines advocate for pleural drainage of no more than 1.5 litres. Soharahas alluded to these being the two major causes of Re-PE: (1) histological pulmonary microvasculature abnormality due to continual lung collapse and (ii) mechanical stress imposed on pulmonary microvasculature by the re-expansion process.

Moving on to evaluate the relationship between cardiac compromise and Re-PE, Chowdhary et al documented a fatal Re-PE in a patient with LV compromise. They postulated that lung re-expansion causes shifts in fluid, and as a result, the oedematous lung impedes ventricular filling in a situation where the LV is compromised. The authors thus suggest that thoracentesis in LV compromise be prudently performed. There is no mention of incorporation of echocardiography to monitor the heart function or preload assessment in light of knowledge of a compromised ventricle when performing a thoracentesis. Thus, a question sneaks into the reported relationship between a 'non-compliant LV' and Re-PE which may be reversed with the primary cause known in LV compromise.

Tan et al studied the haemodynamic traits among patients with pneumothorax and documented an increase in CO after chest tube insertion and alluded to this as a possible indicator to a possible occurrence of Re-PE. Their data, however, do not confer any significant difference. The authors also reported no change in the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in the patients who developed Re-PE, which is still possible after drainage in obstruction. They thus concluded that the reason for the increase in CO seen here is a topic for further research.

### Albumin administration – what is the evidence of clinical benefit? A systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^114EEu27]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

The advantages of albumin over less costly alternative fluids continue to be debated. Meta-analyses focusing on survival have been inconclusive, and other clinically relevant end-points have not been systematically addressed. We sought to determine whether albumin confers significant clinical benefit in acute illness compared with other fluid regimens.

Methods

Database searches (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library) and other methods were used to identify randomized controlled trials comparing albumin with crystalloid, artificial colloid, no albumin or lower-dose albumin. Major findings for all end-points were extracted and summarized. A quantitative meta-analysis was not attempted.

Results

Seventy-nine randomized trials with a total of 4755 patients were included. No significant treatment effects were detectable in 20/79 (25%) trials. In cardiac surgery, albumin administration resulted in lower fluid requirements, higher colloid oncotic pressure, reduced pulmonary oedema with respiratory impairment and greater haemodilution compared with crystalloid and hydroxyethylstarch increased postoperative bleeding. In non-cardiac surgery, fluid requirements, and pulmonary and intestinal oedema were decreased by albumin compared with crystalloid. In hypoalbuminaemia, higher doses of albumin reduced morbidity. In ascites, albumin reduced haemodynamic derangements, morbidity and length of stay and improved survival after spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In sepsis, albumin decreased pulmonary oedema and respiratory dysfunction compared with crystalloid, while hydroxyethylstarch induced abnormalities of haemostasis. Complications were lowered by albumin compared with crystalloid in burn patients. Albumin-containing therapeutic regimens improved outcomes after brain injury.

Conclusions

Albumin can bestow benefit in diverse clinical settings. Further trials are warranted to delineate optimal fluid regimens, in particular indications.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on burn shock resuscitation [^112bQMmD]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

Burn shock resuscitation (American Burn Association CPG) — methods and PICO questions: The panel created 10 questions for adults with burns ≥ 20% TBSA assessing whether interventions reduce total fluid resuscitation volume or total crystalloid resuscitation volume at 24 or 48 hours post burn, increase urine output, or decrease edema-related complications. Questions address albumin during the first 24 hours versus crystalloid alone; timing of albumin initiation early (< 12 hours post burn) versus later (≥ 12 hours post burn); starting resuscitation at 2 mL/kg/%TBSA burn versus 4 mL/kg/%TBSA burn; use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) during acute resuscitation compared with crystalloids alone; high dose (66 mg/kg/hour) ascorbic acid (vitamin C) during crystalloid resuscitation; titrating fluids with central venous pressure (CVP), transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD), or stroke volume variation (SVV) or pulse pressure variation (PPV) versus hourly urine output with conventional endpoints; use of computerized decision support software (CDSS) to titrate fluids versus hourly urine output alone; consideration of early continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT); and monitoring intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), intra-ocular pressure (IOP), serum lactate (L), and arterial base deficit (BD) during the first 48 hours post burn. "Edema-related complications" were defined as abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), limb (extremity) compartment syndrome, orbital compartment syndrome (OCS), elevated IOP, or pulmonary edema (radiologic or reduced PaO2/FiO2 ratio in first 48 hours).

### Fluid management in the critically ill [^111fSKis]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

Fluid therapy, which is provided to restore and maintain tissue perfusion, is part of routine management for almost all critically ill patients. However, because either too much or too little fluid can have a negative impact on patient outcomes, fluid administration must be titrated carefully for each patient. The "salvage, optimization, stabilization, de-escalation" (SOSD) mnemonic should be used as a general guide to fluid resuscitation, and fluid administration should be adapted according to the course of the disease. In the initial salvage phase, lifesaving fluid should be administered generously. Once hemodynamic monitoring is available, fluid administration should be optimized by determining the patient's fluid status and the need for further fluid. This determination can be difficult, however; clinical indicators of hypovolemia, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and urine output, may not detect early hypovolemia, and edema is a late sign of fluid overload. Dynamic tests of fluid responsiveness such as pulse pressure or stroke volume variation can be used in only a small percentage of critically ill patients, and thus a fluid challenge technique is most frequently used to assess ongoing fluid requirements. Once a patient has been stabilized, efforts should start to concentrate on removing excess fluid. Which fluid should be used remains a matter of some debate. Crystalloid solutions are cheaper than colloid solutions, but colloid solutions remain in the intravascular space for a longer period, making edema less likely. Thus crystalloids and colloids should be used together, especially in patients likely to require large fluid volumes. Human albumin is a natural colloid and may have beneficial effects in patients with sepsis in addition to its volume effects. Fluids should be prescribed as are other medications, taking into account individual patient factors, disease processes, and other treatments.

Grade recommendation justification

Despite the low quality of evidence for the majority of outcomes, and the results being driven largely by a single trial, conservative fluid management may be beneficial without evidence of harm. We therefore suggest that in adult patients with ARDS, clinicians consider the use of a conservative fluid strategy which uses fluid restriction, diuretics and possibly hyperoncotic albumin to avoid a positive fluid balance in preference to a liberal fluid strategy.

### Hydroxyethyl starch for perioperative goal-directed fluid therapy in 2020: a narrative review [^114ccNMi]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 3: is there a place for a colloid solution in GDFT protocols?

YES.

From a physiological perspective, it seems obvious that colloid solutions have a role in GDFT protocols. Colloid solutions remain longer intravascularly than do crystalloid solutions, continuing to create oncotic pressure, so theoretically they are associated with a decrease in the amount of fluid needed to achieve and maintain hemodynamic goals. The exclusive use of crystalloid solutions, because of their lower volume effect and shorter intravascular persistence, is associated with greater volumes of fluid administration resulting in fluid overload and its potential complications in the perioperative period. Indeed, compared to colloid solutions, greater crystalloid fluid volumes may be required to restore intravascular volume. In an experimental study, Hiltebrand et al. showed that compared to a crystalloid solution (Ringer's lactate), administration of HES boluses, guided by the measurement of venous oxygen saturation, reduced the total volume of fluid infused and, more importantly, improved microcirculatory blood flow and intestinal oxygen partial pressure after abdominal surgery. Excessive fluid administration (mainly crystalloids) has been shown to increase the risk of intestinal tissue edema, leading not only to delayed resumption of intestinal activity and anastomotic leakage, but also to a risk of pulmonary edema and postoperative respiratory complications, all of which increase the hospital length of stay. The use of large volumes of isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) also leads to an increased risk of hyperchloremic acidosis, which can lead to gastrointestinal and renal dysfunction, secondary to the vasoconstrictive properties of the chloride ion. Importantly, volume effects of colloids have been demonstrated to be context sensitive. Administration of iso-oncotic colloids (5% albumin or 6% hydroxyethyl starch) during acute bleeding when carefully maintaining intravascular normovolemia led to volume effects of more than 90%. In contrast, preoperative volume loading in a non-bleeding patient resulted in a volume effect of only 30–35%, two-third of the given bolus leaving the vascular space toward the interstitial compartment within minutes. Colloids and crystalloids cannot be exchanged by simply adapting the amount. Recently, Orbegozo Cortes et al. reviewed all studies comparing crystalloid and colloid solutions in all types of patients (medical, surgical, and trauma patients), many of which likely had altered vascular permeability. They reported that greater volumes were required to achieve similar targets with crystalloid than with colloid solutions (estimated ratio: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.36–1.65). Figure 2 represents the comparison of the crystalloids vs colloids ratio extracted from the study from Orbegozo et al. in the context of an administration of crystalloids without or with a certain amount of colloids. These results were confirmed by Annane et al. in the CRISTAL study. Although this ratio would be expected to be greater than 1.5, it is important to note that none of these studies strictly compared a pure colloid with a pure crystalloid strategy as the colloid groups also always received some crystalloid infusion.

### Re-expansion pulmonary edema (REPE) following thoracentesis: is large-volume thoracentesis associated with increased incidence of REPE? [^1133MCGP]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine the safety and efficacy associated with drainage volumes greater than 1,500 mL in a single, unilateral thoracentesis without pleural manometry measurements.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective, single-institution study included 872 patients (18 years and older) who underwent ultrasound-guided thoracentesis. Patient and procedures data were collected including demographics, number of and laterality of thoracenteses, volume and consistency of fluid removed, and whether clinical or radiologic evidence of re-expansion pulmonary edema (REPE) developed within 24 h of thoracentesis. Fisher's exact test was used to test the significance of the relationship between volume of fluid removed and evidence of REPE.

Results

A total of 1376 thoracenteses were performed among the patients included in the study. The mean volume of fluid removed among all procedures was 901.1 mL (SD = 641.7 mL), with 194 (14.1%) procedures involving the removal of ≥ 1,500 mL of fluid. In total, six (0.7%) patients developed signs of REPE following thoracentesis, five of which were a first-time thoracentesis. No statistically significant difference in incidence of REPE was observed between those with ≥ 1,500 mL of fluid removed compared to those with < 1,500 mL of fluid removed (p-value = 0.599).

Conclusions

Large-volume thoracentesis may safely improve patients' symptoms while preventing the need for repeat procedures.

Fluid resuscitation and vasopressors

What fluids and vasopressors should be used in patients with DC in the ICU?

Recommendation

Balanced salt solutions should be used over normal saline. Norepinephrine is the vasopressor of choice. Albumin is useful in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and PPCD.

Discussion

Fluid management and vasopressor use in patients with DC require an understanding of several pathophysiological parameters and neurohumoral mediators. Recent evidence supports the use of balanced salt solutions such as lactated Ringer's or PlasmaLyte over normal saline, driven by the lower incidence of hyperchloremic acidosis and concomitant renal injury. For patients who require vasopressors to maintain MAP > 60 mm Hg, norepinephrine is the first-line choice. Epinephrine should be avoided to reduce the risk of ischemia.

Literature supports the use of albumin in some patients with DC. Specifically, albumin has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with SBP (although not in other forms of infection/sepsis) and hepatorenal syndrome, and to prevent PPCD. In the setting of SBP, the patient should be given 1.5 g/kg of albumin on the day of diagnosis (day 1) followed by 1 g/kg on day 3.PPCD is a syndrome after large volume paracentesis (LVP) resulting in splanchnic vasodilation, with resultant rapid reaccumulation of ascites, hyponatremia, and renal injury. As discussed in the next section, peri-paracentesis albumin administration can help prevent PPCD.

There is mixed data on long-term albumin use as therapy in DC to prevent complications and improve survival. The human Albumin for the treatmeNt of aScites in patients With hEpatic ciRrhosis (ANSWER) trial demonstrated improvement in 18-month survival as well as improvement in management of ascites and decrease in cirrhosis complications including SBP, non-SBP bacterial infections, episodes of renal dysfunction, and severe HE. However, the Effect of Midodrine and Albumin in the Prevention of Complications in Cirrhotic Patients Awaiting Liver Transplantation (MACHT) study, which compared standard therapy with standard therapy plus albumin and midodrine, showed no difference in 1-year mortality or complications of cirrhosis. These conflicting findings may be related to dose differences of albumin in the trials with higher doses being given in ANSWER, and further studies are needed to determine the appropriate patients with DC who should receive long-term albumin therapy.

### Human albumin solution for resuscitation and volume expansion in critically ill patients [^1136hYw8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Human albumin solutions are used in a range of medical and surgical problems. Licensed indications are the emergency treatment of shock and other conditions where restoration of blood volume is urgent, burns, and hypoproteinaemia. Human albumin solutions are more expensive than other colloids and crystalloids.

Objectives

To quantify the effect on mortality of human albumin and plasma protein fraction (PPF) administration in the management of critically ill patients.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group trials register, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline, Embase and BIDS Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings. Reference lists of trials and review articles were checked, and authors of identified trials were contacted. The search was last updated in November 2001.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing albumin/PPF with no albumin/PPF, or with a crystalloid solution, in critically ill patients with hypovolaemia, burns or hypoalbuminaemia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected data on the participants, albumin solution used, mortality at the end of follow up, and quality of allocation concealment. Analysis was stratified according to patient type.

Main Results

We found 31 trials meeting the inclusion criteria and reporting death as an outcome. There were 177 deaths among 1519 trial participants. For each patient category the risk of death in the albumin treated group was higher than in the comparison group. For hypovolaemia the relative risk of death following albumin administration was 1.46 (95% confidence interval 0.97 to 2.22), for burns the relative risk was 2.40 (1.11 to 5.19), and for hypoalbuminaemia the relative risk was 1.38 (0.94 to 2.03). The pooled relative risk of death with albumin administration was 1.52 (1.17 to 1.99). Overall, the risk of death in patients receiving albumin was 14% compared to 9% in the control groups, an increase in the risk of death of 5% (2% to 8%). These data suggest that for every 20 critically ill patients treated with albumin there is one additional death.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is no evidence that albumin administration reduces the risk of death in critically ill patients with hypovolaemia, burns or hypoalbuminaemia, and a strong suggestion that it may increase the risk of death. These data suggest that the use of human albumin in critically ill patients should be urgently reviewed and that it should not be used outside the context of a rigorously conducted randomised controlled trial.

### Re-expansion pulmonary oedema: a novel emergency therapeutic option [^112trN73]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Re-expansion pulmonary oedema (REPO) is a rare complication of pleural fluid thoracocentesis and has been associated with a high mortality rate. There is limited evidence to inform on its most effective management. We present two cases of large volume thoracocentesis resulting in acute respiratory decompensation that was treated by reintroducing the drained pleural fluid back into the pleural cavity. We also present a review of the literature specifically assessing the reported incidence rate of REPO after pleural fluid drainage. In both of our cases, symptoms and signs of respiratory instability were promptly reversed on reintroduction of the drained pleural fluid into the patient's pleural space-a therapy we have termed 'rapid pleural space re-expansion'. This was not associated with any short-term adverse outcomes. The occurrence of REPO is a rare event with most cohort studies reporting an incidence of between 0% and 1%.

### Small-volume resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials [^116MdHAg]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Safety

The capacity of hyperoncotic albumin to shift fluid from the interstitium to the intravascular space may be viewed as a two-edged sword, depending upon the hydration state of the patient. In edematous states, such fluid shifts may be desirable. Conversely, hyperoncotic albumin should probably be avoided in patients with severe dehydration.

High doses of hyperoncotic albumin could potentially increase pulmonary edema and capillary leak. In one widely cited randomized trial of Lucas et al. patients receiving very high hyperoncotic albumin doses (1,142 g) and total fluid volumes (44.9 l) displayed impairment in pulmonary function. Commentators have ascribed that result to fluid overload rather than hyperoncotic albumin per se, however. The trial of Lucas et al. was not included in the present review because albumin was administered with the aim of elevating serum albumin concentration rather than expanding intravascular volume, and indeed the attained central venous pressure (mean 18.6 cm H 2 O) was supranormal.

In a dose-escalation study of 25% albumin treatment in 82 patients with acute ischemic stroke, mild or moderate pulmonary edema was observed in 13% of the patients. This adverse effect was readily managed with diuretics, and 25% albumin doses up to 2 g/kg could be tolerated without major dose-limiting complications.

None of the trials included in the present review or in a prior systematic review of both hyperoncotic and 4 to 5% albumin has indicated harmful effects attributable to albumin. A Cochrane meta-analysis encompassing both 4 to 5% and 20 to 25% solutions suggested increased mortality among albumin recipients (RR 1.7). That finding could not be replicated either in the SAFE trial or a more comprehensive subsequent meta-analysis. In the present survival meta-analysis, which was adequately powered to detect a relative mortality risk increase only half as great as that reported by the Cochrane investigators, there was no evidence of poorer survival among hyperoncotic albumin recipients.

### Identification of indications for albumin administration in septic patients with liver cirrhosis [^115fGJGi]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Meanwhile, we also explored the potential indications for albumin infusion except for hypoalbuminemia and declared that albumin infusion would also be effective if provided to selected patients with unstable hemodynamic status, indicating by serum lactate greater than or equal to 2 mmol/L, MAP less than 60 mmHg, or vasopressor dosage between 0.2 and 0.3 mcg/kg/min (NEE), regardless of the serum albumin concentration. Although the beneficial effects of albumin infusion on hemodynamic status have been proved, no clear criteria were available. The present study identified clear criteria using a data-driven approach under real-world conditions.

The systemic and organ inflammation-modulating effect of albumin highly depends on the post-treatment serum albumin concentration, emphasizing the importance of albumin dosage. The three randomized controlled trials so far published assessing the beneficial effects of albumin therapy in cirrhosis patients with non-SBP infection draw similar conclusions that receiving albumin 1.5 g/kg on day 1 and 1 g/kg on day 3 would not improve survival. A more troublesome observation was that Thévenot et al. found nine patients who suffered from pulmonary edema following albumin infusion, two of whom died within a short time window after albumin infusion. These findings were validated in our study. The association between different albumin dosages and 28-day mortality suggested that the therapeutic effects of albumin infusion were compromised when the daily dose exceeded 1.0 g/kg. Despite the potential benefits of albumin, its protective oncotic effect may be diminished when capillary permeability increases, a condition well established in cirrhotic patients with sepsis, exacerbated by impaired lymphatic circulation. Increased extravasation of albumin from capillaries may result in accumulation within the extravascular spaces, leading to fluid overload subsequently. Overall, from a clinical point of view, we suggested that a large amount of albumin administration should be avoided in patients with prominent pulmonary capillary permeability alterations, or given cautiously after a thorough assessment of cardiac function and volume status.

### The evidence for small-volume resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin in critical illness [^116mwa5v]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Small-volume resuscitation of critically ill patients with hyperoncotic albumin offers a number of theoretical advantages, such as increasing intravascular volume in excess of the volume of fluid administered and reducing interstitial edema. Whilst iso-oncotic albumin has been shown to be equi-effective to isotonic saline for the resuscitation of critically ill patients without associated traumatic brain injury, the efficacy of hyperoncotic albumin for resuscitation has not been evaluated in large-scale randomized-controlled trials. Overall, the evidence for resuscitation with hyper-oncotic albumin is limited by studies of poor methodological quality with heterogenous study populations and control regimens. There is marginal qualitative evidence of improvements in surrogate outcomes in disparate patient populations, but no evidence of any survival benefit associated with resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin. Given the lack of evidence and clinical uncertainty about the efficacy of hyperoncotic albumin, a large-scale randomized-controlled trial is required to determine its role in the acute resuscitation of hypovolemic or hypoalbuminemic critically ill patients.
