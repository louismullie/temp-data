## Question

Steroid shot cause micro hematoma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a steroid shot can cause a micro hematoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "micro hematoma" means in different clinical contexts. Then, I should verify the mechanisms by which corticosteroid injections could plausibly cause bleeding or hematoma formation. Next, I will examine direct evidence across common injection sites and quantify risk where possible. After that, I should distinguish hematoma risk from other steroid-related complications that are often conflated. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified answer with counseling points and mitigation strategies.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misinterpret the question. "Micro hematoma" is not a standardized term; in practice it refers to a small, localized collection of blood, often subcutaneous or intramuscular, that may be clinically subtle or only appreciated on imaging, and it sits on a spectrum from visible bruising to larger, compressive hematomas that can threaten neurovascular structures depending on location.

> Now, I need to check the mechanistic plausibility. Steroid injections can cause bleeding via direct needle trauma to vessels and via patient-specific coagulopathy or antithrombotic therapy; additionally, some steroid formulations are particulate and may promote aggregation or embolic phenomena, though that latter mechanism is more relevant to ischemia than to hematoma per se, so I should be careful not to overextend that point to bleeding risk [^e0b87447] [^0cf56aa0].

> Next, I should review direct evidence for hematoma after steroid injections. Wait, let me verify the highest-yield sources: neuraxial procedures carry the most robust documentation of hemorrhagic complications, including epidural and subdural hematomas, with reported risks in anticoagulated patients and even in some without anticoagulation, underscoring that hematoma can occur after epidural steroid injection albeit rarely [^e0b87447] [^ec49a0b6] [^3d46193a]. I should also confirm that non-neuraxial sites show hematoma as well; indeed, case reports and series document hematomas after cervical transforaminal injections, lumbar transforaminal injections, and even periocular steroid injections, including an "intraframe hematoma" after peribulbar triamcinolone, which fits a "micro hematoma" description in that context [^ab87ff0e] [^34bdd8d5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about frequency without quantification. I need to check guideline estimates: for epidural steroid injections, hemorrhagic complications are described in the 0.0% to 0.4% range when continuing anticoagulants and 0.0% to 0.6% when continuing antiplatelets, with the caveat that these figures reflect detection and reporting biases and vary by approach and patient factors; importantly, hematomas have also been reported in patients without antithrombotic therapy, so risk is never zero [^e0b87447] [^99b85213] [^ec49a0b6]. For non-neuraxial injections, high-quality incidence data are sparse, but case-based literature confirms that hematomas can occur, particularly in patients with coagulopathy or when injecting near vascular-rich regions [^ab87ff0e] [^34bdd8d5].

> I should double-check that I'm distinguishing hematoma from other steroid complications. Steroid injections are well known for local effects like postinjection flare, skin atrophy, hypopigmentation, and, in some formulations, embolic ischemic injury, but these are mechanistically distinct from bleeding; conflating them would overstate hematoma risk, so I need to keep the categories separate while acknowledging that both can occur depending on site and technique [^261b2770] [^2eea6de7] [^0cf56aa0].

> Let me consider site-specific nuances. In the cervical spine, transforaminal injections carry higher embolic and hemorrhagic risk due to radiculomedullary arteries, and hematomas can be catastrophic; in the lumbar spine, hematomas are less common but still reported, including distant or contralateral hematomas, which reminds me to counsel that neurologic symptoms after any neuraxial injection warrant urgent imaging even if the presentation is atypical [^2eea6de7] [^ab87ff0e] [^de93e94b]. In periocular or orbital injections, small hematomas can present as localized ecchymosis or intraframe collections and are typically self-limited but require vigilance for vision-threatening complications in that compartment [^34bdd8d5].

> I will now examine patient-level risk modifiers. Anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy increase hemorrhagic risk for neuraxial procedures, yet even with guideline-concordant periprocedural management, epidural hematomas have occurred, so shared decision-making is essential; conversely, withholding anticoagulation can precipitate thromboembolic events, so the balance must be individualized and coordinated with the prescribing clinician [^e0b87447] [^8168ea33]. Intrinsic coagulopathies, difficult anatomy, multiple needle passes, and larger-bore needles also plausibly increase risk, though high-quality comparative data are limited [^3c179754].

> But wait, what if the injection is intra-articular or intramuscular rather than neuraxial or periocular? I should confirm that hematoma is less commonly reported in routine joint and soft-tissue injections, though isolated cases and small series do document hematoma, particularly in patients with bleeding disorders or when injecting near major vessels; overall, the incidence appears low, but absence of robust surveillance likely underestimates true risk [^ecfc003b].

> Next, I should review mitigation strategies that meaningfully reduce risk. Image guidance improves accuracy and reduces inadvertent vascular puncture, live fluoroscopy or digital subtraction angiography can detect intravascular needle placement, and using nonparticulate steroids in high-risk neuraxial approaches reduces embolic risk even if it does not directly change hematoma risk; atraumatic technique, smaller-gauge needles, and careful aspiration before injection are sensible precautions across sites [^2eea6de7] [^dd2f4c02] [^3c799180]. For patients on antithrombotics, individualized periprocedural planning that weighs bleeding versus thromboembolic risk is critical, and routine withholding of anticoagulation solely for a joint injection is not generally recommended in current guidance, though neuraxial procedures follow different rules [^e0b87447] [^261b2770].

> Let me synthesize and answer the question directly. Yes, steroid shots can cause a micro hematoma, primarily via direct needle trauma to small vessels, with risk modulated by patient coagulation status, injection site, and technique; documented examples include epidural hematomas after transforaminal or interlaminar epidural injections, subdural hematomas, foraminal or perineural hematomas, and periocular hematomas, with reported frequencies for neuraxial hematomas in the fractions of a percent in anticoagulated patients and rare events even without anticoagulation, while non-neuraxial injections have sporadic case-level evidence of hematoma without reliable incidence estimates [^e0b87447] [^ec49a0b6] [^ab87ff0e] [^34bdd8d5] [^85d3e07a].

> Finally, I need to ensure the counseling is practical. Patients should be informed that bruising at the injection site is common and usually benign, but new neurologic symptoms, severe pain, swelling, or expanding ecchymosis warrant prompt evaluation; clinicians should screen for bleeding risk, consider image guidance for deep or high-risk injections, and coordinate anticoagulation management when neuraxial procedures are planned, recognizing that the absolute risk of clinically significant hematoma is low but not negligible and that early recognition can be sight- or limb-saving in the neuraxial compartment [^e0b87447] [^2eea6de7] [^ecfc003b].

Steroid injections can cause **microhematoma** at the injection site due to needle trauma to small vessels, especially in patients on anticoagulants or with bleeding disorders [^e0b87447]. The risk is **low but real**, and microhematomas are usually small, self-limited, and clinically silent, though they can cause local pain or discoloration. Use of **image guidance** and careful technique reduce risk; patients on anticoagulants should have individualized risk–benefit assessment and may continue therapy for most joint injections, with close monitoring for bleeding [^261b2770] [^e0b87447].

---

## Mechanisms of microhematoma formation

Microhematoma formation after steroid injection is **primarily due to mechanical trauma** from the needle disrupting small blood vessels, causing blood to leak into surrounding tissues. Key factors include:

- **Needle trauma**: Direct injury to capillaries or small vessels during injection.
- **Patient factors**: Anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy, bleeding disorders, or vascular fragility increase risk [^e0b87447].
- **Injection site**: Highly vascular areas (e.g. epidural space, periocular region) carry higher risk [^2eea6de7].

---

## Incidence and clinical significance

The incidence of microhematoma after steroid injection is **difficult to quantify** because many cases are asymptomatic and underreported. Available data suggest:

- **Epidural injections**: Hemorrhagic complications, including microhematoma, are rare but reported, particularly with transforaminal approaches or in patients on anticoagulants [^e0b87447] [^ab87ff0e].
- **Periocular injections**: Central retinal artery embolization and local hematoma have been reported, though rarely [^7ec9a078] [^34bdd8d5].
- **Joint injections**: Microhematoma is uncommon and usually self-limited, often presenting as mild bruising or local discomfort [^notfound].

Clinically, most microhematomas are **minor and resolve spontaneously**, but they can cause local pain, swelling, or discoloration. Rarely, larger hematomas may compress nerves or other structures, requiring intervention [^e0b87447].

---

## Risk factors

Several factors **increase the risk** of microhematoma formation:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy | Increases bleeding risk; individualized risk–benefit assessment recommended [^e0b87447] [^99b85213] |
| Bleeding disorders | Congenital or acquired coagulopathies increase risk [^3c179754] |
| Vascular fragility | Age, vascular disease, or chronic steroid use may weaken vessels [^notfound] |
| Injection site | Highly vascular areas (e.g. epidural, periocular) carry higher risk [^2eea6de7] |
| Technique | Multiple attempts, large-bore needles, or poor technique increase trauma [^3c179754] |

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Microhematomas typically present with:

- **Local pain**: Mild to moderate pain at injection site.
- **Swelling**: Localized swelling or induration.
- **Discoloration**: Bruising or ecchymosis.
- **Rare symptoms**: Neurologic deficits if compression occurs (e.g. epidural hematoma) [^e0b87447].

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, based on history and examination; ultrasound or MRI may be used if deeper structures are involved or if symptoms persist [^notfound].

---

## Management

Most microhematomas are **managed conservatively**:

- **Observation**: Most resolve spontaneously within 1–2 weeks.
- **Analgesia**: Acetaminophen or NSAIDs for pain control.
- **Compression**: Local pressure or compression bandages may reduce swelling.
- **Ice**: Apply ice intermittently in the first 24–48 hours.

Indications for intervention include **large hematomas causing significant pain, nerve compression, or infection**; drainage or surgical evacuation may be required in rare cases [^e0b87447].

---

## Prevention strategies

To **minimize the risk** of microhematoma:

- **Image guidance**: Use ultrasound or fluoroscopy for deep or high-risk injections [^2eea6de7].
- **Aspiration**: Check for blood return before injecting.
- **Needle selection**: Use smaller-gauge needles when feasible.
- **Technique**: Minimize passes and avoid excessive force.
- **Patient selection**: Assess bleeding risk and adjust anticoagulation as indicated [^e0b87447].

---

## Conclusion

Steroid injections can cause **microhematoma** due to needle trauma, with risk influenced by patient factors and technique. Most are minor and self-limited, but clinicians should recognize risk factors, use best practices, and monitor for complications. Individualized anticoagulation management and image guidance further reduce risk [^e0b87447] [^2eea6de7].

Discussion

The data reported here highlight that the controversies previously described in hyphema management currently persist internationally. Although we witnessed several areas of general consensus, including the use of topical steroids and cycloplegics, and the recommendation for head elevation/sleeping upright, we observed areas of variation in preferences for the administration and types of medications used for hyphema cases, indications for surgical interventions, as well as activity limitations and typical disposition of patients. Previous investigations thus far have shown management techniques to affect secondary hemorrhage rates, but not necessarily improve visual outcomes. However, evidence-based management protocols are still needed to reduce clinical waste, limit unnecessary exposure to medication side effects or adverse surgical events, and ensure access to optimal care.

Steroids are widely considered a mainstay of hyphema treatment to prevent rebleeds and synechiae formation, but there is conflicting evidence for their effectiveness in this setting. Several controlled prospective studies found no association between systemic steroid use, particularly prednisone, and the incidence of secondary hemorrhage or final visual outcomes after traumatic hyphema. More recently, a systematic review was unable to determine efficacy due to a lack of statistical power in existing trials. In another meta-analysis, however, steroids (either topical or systemic) were found to effectively reduce secondary hemorrhage risk, but not to improve final visual acuity. Other trials have found that systemic and/or topical steroids may be beneficial for preventing rebleeds. Despite a lack of conclusive evidence, the vast majority of experts in our study routinely administered topical steroids to patients with gross hyphema or microhyphema (n = 34, 94.4%, and n = 29, 80.6%, respectively). Because topical steroids have limited side effects compared to systemic administration, they would be preferred if they are found to be similarly effective. Investigations are needed to compare the efficacy of topical steroids relative to control groups without steroid treatment and to systemic therapy to determine if topical steroids alone are sufficient, as well as determine an optimal dosing regimen.

Infantile hemangioma intralesional corticosteroids (Key Action Statement 3F) — Clinicians may recommend intralesional injection of triamcinolone and/or betamethasone to treat focal, bulky IHs during proliferation or in certain critical anatomic locations (eg, the lip) (grade B, moderate recommendation). Aggregate evidence quality is Grade B; benefits are a modest benefit in IH clearance; risks include clinically important harms, cost of medication and visits for injection, and risk of anesthesia if used; the benefit–harm assessment states benefits outweigh harms in selected clinical situations; patient preference involves shared decision-making regarding route of drug delivery; and the stated strength is a moderate recommendation.

### Diagnosis and management of infantile hemangioma [^7ec9a078]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Periocular infantile hemangioma (IH) — intralesional steroid injection for bulky lesions used a combination of triamcinolone and betamethasone, with a response within 2 weeks anticipated in 60% to 80% of patients. However, intralesional steroids have been associated with complications, with embolism of the central retinal artery most feared; proposed mechanisms include high injection pressures (causing retrograde flow), excessive injection volumes, and direct intravascular injection, and even using a large-capacity syringe and small bore cannula may be insufficient in preventing embolization. Other reported complications include hypopigmentation, atrophy of subcutaneous fat, and full-thickness eyelid necrosis, and with improvements in systemic medications and surgical techniques, many now believe there are better options for the management of periocular IHs.

### Diagnosis and management of infantile hemangioma: executive summary [^97af376a]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Medication therapy for infantile hemangioma — intralesional steroid injections are often effective in treating small, bulky, well-localized lesions but this modality is no longer considered first-line therapy for most IHs because intralesional steroids may be systemically absorbed and optimal dosing and safety profile are not well studied. High-potency topical steroids have been reported as effective for small superficial IH, although their use is largely being replaced by treatment with topical β-blockers. Periodic monitoring for potential toxicity, especially blood pressure elevation and decreased rate of growth, is recommended. Medications other than β-blockers and corticosteroids may have efficacy in treating IH, but their utility is limited by their safety profile, and although interferon-α appeared promising in the 1980s and early 1990s, studies showing significant neurotoxicity have generally precluded this treatment modality for IH.

Epidural steroid injections — FDA safety communications and reported events are described: In 2011, the label for triamcinolone was updated, warning against epidural use. In April 2014, the FDA issued a warning that epidural steroid injections can cause "rare but serious adverse events, including loss of vision, stroke, paralysis, and death". In the FDA's risk assessment between 1997 and 2014, a total of 90 serious and sometimes fatal neurologic events were reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), and compounded glucocorticoids used in epidural injections have been associated with fungal meningitis, with contaminated-product cases not included in the cited case series.

Infantile hemangioma — intralesional corticosteroids dosing, interval, outcomes, and complications are detailed: Many authors consider intralesional corticosteroid injection effective with a "relatively low frequency of reported systemic adverse effects at low doses (≤ 2–3 mg/kg)". In most studies, triamcinolone alone or a mixture with betamethasone was used at "total equivalent doses of triamcinolone dose of < 3 mg/kg, by using a 27- or 30-gauge needle", and "The interval between injections varied from 1 to 6 weeks". Large studies reported "accelerated regression in 77% to 100% of patients with IH and cessation of growth in 16% to 23%"; "The effects of the steroid last approximately 3 to 4 weeks". Local complications include fat and/or dermal atrophy and/or hypopigmentation (0%–3%); systemic adverse effects including cushingoid features (0%–3%) and adrenal suppression can occur when very large doses are given (≥ 5 mg/kg); in the upper eyelid, "3 cases of retinal embolization" after injection into IHs have been reported.

### Paraplegia complicating selective steroid injections of the lumbar spine. report of five cases and review of the literature [^309c845f]. European Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Selective steroid injections of the lumbar spine carry a risk of paraplegia of sudden onset. Seven cases have been reported in the English literature since 2002.

Materials and Methods

Five new cases have been analyzed, all coming from Paris area centers. Injections were performed between 2003 and 2008. The following items were searched for: location of a previous lumbar spine surgery if any, symptoms indicating the procedure, route of injection, imaging technique used for needle guidance, injection of a contrast medium, type of steroid, other drugs injected if any, paraplegia level, post-procedure MR findings. The current and reported cases were compared.

Results

MR findings were consistent with spinal cord ischemia of arterial origin. The high rate of patients who had been operated on in these cases does not correspond to that of patients undergoing injections. The presence of epidural scar might increase the risk. The foraminal route was the only one involved in nonoperated patients. Foraminal, interlaminar, or juxta-zygoapophyseal routes were used in operated-on patients.

Conclusion

The high rate of French cases when compared to the literature might arise from the almost exclusive use of prednisolone acetate, a molecule with a high tendency to coalesce in macro-aggregates, putting the spinal cord at risk of arterial supply embolization.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of infantile hemangiomas [^b4ab715e]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Key action statement 3F — intralesional corticosteroid injections for infantile hemangiomas (IHs): Clinicians may recommend intralesional injection of triamcinolone and/or betamethasone to treat focal, bulky IHs during proliferation or in certain critical anatomic locations (eg, the lip) (grade B, moderate recommendation). Most studies have used triamcinolone either alone or in conjunction with betamethasone, with injections given on average every 4 to 6 weeks, and repeat injections are often administered with the number used ranging in most reports from 1 to 7. The AHRQ review found that intralesional triamcinolone had a mean estimate of expected clearance of 58%. In a retrospective review of periorbital IHs comparing oral propranolol with intralesional corticosteroid injection, both groups showed a reduction in astigmatism over 12 months and neither experienced significant adverse effects necessitating dose reduction or treatment cessation, and the authors concluded that oral propranolol has emerged as the treatment of choice for periorbital IHs requiring therapy. Steroid-related harms include transient Cushingoid features, failure to thrive, local skin complications such as fat and/or dermal atrophy and pigmentary changes, infrequent adrenal suppression when large doses (eg, > 4 mg/kg) have been administered, and rare central retinal artery embolization after upper eyelid injections, likely related to high injection pressures and/or volumes.

### Intravitreal injections – 2025 [^26446293]. AAO (2025). High credibility.

Systemic complications of anti-VEGF therapy — risk profile and evidence synthesis indicate that when agents such as anti-VEGF medications and corticosteroids are given systemically, they can have significant and potentially life-threatening complications, and although all intravitreal anti-VEGF treatments may carry theoretical risks for systemic arterial thromboembolic events, the results of clinical trials remain inconclusive; a 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that intravitreal anti-VEGF therapies did not increase the risk of major cardiovascular events but there were increased nonocular hemorrhages in patients with AMD, additional meta-analyses found that anti-VEGF therapies and treatment intensity did not have an effect on mortality with low certainty evidence making estimates imprecise, and ophthalmologists need to monitor the patient for the possibility of long-term systemic side effects.

Image-guided epidural steroid injection (ESI) — vascular injury risks: The penetrating needle may cause vascular dissection, and embolic occlusion of a vessel with steroid aggregates, predominantly particulate, may occur; a rare, devastating complication in cervical and lumbar ESIs is spinal cord infarction, hypothesized to be due to embolization of particulate steroids, needle-induced vasospasm, compression from an epidural hematoma or abscess, and mechanical disruption of radiculomedullary arteries, and preservatives such as benzyl alcohol may be neurotoxic with reported paraplegia, neural degeneration, and demyelination.

### Paralysis after lumbar interlaminar epidural steroid injection in the absence of hematoma: a case of congestive myelopathy due to spinal dural arteriovenous fistula and a review of the literature [^c099d040]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Paraplegia after interlaminar epidural steroid injection is a rare event and has typically been described after epidural hematoma or direct spinal cord injury. We present a case of an 87-yr-old man who experienced transient lower limb weakness after a lumbar interlaminar epidural steroid injection due to an alternative cause, congestive myelopathy related to an underlying vascular malformation, namely, a spinal dural arteriovenous fistula. This is a poorly recognized and potentially treatable cause of progressive myelopathy. We present this case and review the literature on paraplegia after epidural steroid injection due to spinal dural arteriovenous fistula. Notably, this case of paralysis occurred in association with the lowest volume of epidural injectate reported in the literature to date (4 ml); importantly, this volume is consistent with the current clinical practice guideline standards for the safe performance of interlaminar epidural steroid injections. Physicians should be aware of this potential complication of epidural steroid injection and remain vigilant for the possibility after a procedure, even when performed according to current practice standards.

### Global current practice patterns for the management of hyphema [^ad0e0aaa]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyphema consists of blood build up in the anterior chamber (AC) of the eye resulting from injury to ciliary body and iris blood vessels. Hyphema most often occurs after trauma or surgery, but may also arise spontaneously due to coagulopathies, neovascularization, or sudden intraocular pressure changes.

The level of hyphema is one of the critical factors for grading its severity, in addition to corneal blood staining and intraocular pressure. The mildest grade of hyphema is termed microhyphema, which consists of red blood cells in the AC that are only identifiable via microscopy and/or gonioscopy. When a hyphema progresses and erythrocytes precipitate, it is considered to be a gross or layered hyphema, which is graded based upon the extent to which erythrocytes fill the AC.

In cases of traumatic ophthalmic injuries that induce hyphema, poor visual outcome (ie, < 20/40) is often due to associated injuries (such as corneal laceration or retinal detachment), but can be due to the hyphema itself in 8–33% of cases. Current treatment regimens for hyphema include cycloplegics, steroids, antifibrinolytics, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, as well as activity restrictions, such as partial to complete bed rest, and protection with a rigid shield.

While various studies have investigated the comparative efficacy of specific interventions for hyphema management, uncertainties persist regarding which medications and interventions are optimal. The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) provides recommendations on management standards for many common conditions in ophthalmology called the Preferred Practice Patterns©. However, these guidelines do not cover most traumatic ocular injuries, including hyphema. Additionally, inconsistencies in traumatic hyphema treatment likely persist given the heterogeneity of institutional resources on an international level.

We surveyed ophthalmic trauma experts at international institutions to summarize generally accepted principles of hyphema management and to highlight areas of variation within clinical practice.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^ec49a0b6]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

Appendix table — cervical epidural steroid injection complications without antithrombotic therapy are documented across multiple case reports, including epidural hematoma and chronic subdural hematoma, often in patients described as "without any risk factors or anticoagulant therapy" and "without antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy", with presentations such as Brown- Séquard syndrome. Examples include a 56-year-old man who developed Brown- Séquard syndrome after a fluoroscopically guided cervical steroid injection, with neurological deficit occurring "Within half an hour", and a healthy 34-year-old man who developed a large cervical epidural hematoma "8 days after cervical epidural steroid injection". Additional reports describe a 39-year-old female who underwent cervical epidural injection at C6 and, "Five days after epidural injection", had headache with imaging showing "a chronic subdural hematoma", and a 61-year-old female who developed cervical epidural hematoma "within 3 hours after the procedure". Conclusions emphasize that "epidural hematoma may occur in the absence of known risk factors", that "This case shows Brown- Séquard syndrome can be a presenting finding in cervical hematoma", and that "This case highlights the need for vigilance in the setting of low bleeding risks".

### Management of calcaneal cysts in the pediatric population: a review [^2d922e9e]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Steroid/Bone Marrow Injection

Injection with steroids was an early treatment approach for simple bone cysts due to the theory that cysts were the result of an inflammatory reaction. Although this theory did not stand up as the sole cause of simple bone cysts, there is a notable amount of data looking at the healing rates of injected cysts, the recurrence rate, and complications for simple bone cysts in general. The data are widely varied on whether steroid injection or bone marrow provides better results, with some studies showing that steroid injection is superior and others showing no difference. Cho et al.showed that steroid and bone marrow injection had similar success rates, but steroid injection was associated with a higher recurrence rate in bone cysts, irrespective of location. Conversely, Chang et al.showed no difference between steroid and bone marrow injection for simple bone cysts independent of location. Finally, in a systematic review of the available literature, Zhao et al.could not identify a statistical difference between steroid and bone marrow injection. Because of the inconsistent data regarding the efficacy of steroid versus bone marrow injection, we will consider injection broadly as a treatment modality. The theoretical risks of injection to the calcaneus, as with any injection, include infection and iatrogenic damage to the surrounding structures. However, despite these theoretical risks, a very few complications have been reported with the injection group. The healing rates of cysts injected with steroids or bone marrow are widely varied, with some studies showing no healing of the cyst and others showing rates as high as 66%. Zhao et al.in their systematic review, cited success rates of < 50% for both steroid and bone marrow injection at 2-year follow-up for long bone simple bone cysts. Differences in frequency, number, and the amount injected are likely to account for the contradictory data. In addition, most studies showed that more than one injection was required before an effect, if any, was seen. In a study of 11 patients over 7 years at two institutions, Glaser et al. found that steroid injection alone did not resolve simple bone cysts and that surgery on these patients did provide radiographic healing. Glaser suggests that although injection of simple bone cysts in other areas of the body, such as long bones, has provided positive results, injection of the calcaneus is uniquely refractory, and surgical intervention is generally required. Injections are an alternative to observation in nonsurgical management with few risks or complications. Still, success rates are widely varied, and some data show that it may not be an ideal treatment modality for calcaneal bone cysts.

Appendix Table 1 — Lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injection describes an epidural hematoma after injection in a patient not on antithrombotics: an "82-year-old male" received a transforaminal epidural steroid injection at the "L2-L3 level", and later required surgery for a "clotted hematoma over the thecal sac from T12 to L1"; conclusions state this "can occur without risk factors such as anticoagulant drugs", and that "Direct vascular puncture due to foraminal entry cannot be ruled out", while raising doubt that blood from L2-3 would "travel" to T12-L1 without local hematoma.

### Corticosteroid treatment of periorbital haemangioma of infancy: a review of the evidence [^aaf6b2e0]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

Aim

To systematically review the literature for corticosteroid treatment of periorbital haemangioma of infancy (HOI) and determine the relative efficacy and safety of oral, topical and intralesional corticosteroids.

Methods

PubMed and the Cochrane Library were queried using keywords, and further articles were obtained by reviewing bibliographies. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to create a subset of literature for analysis.

Results

Systematic review revealed 81 original reports of periorbital HOI cases treated with steroids. Most studies and case series failed to document refractive error or visual acuity before and after treatment. Of cases meeting inclusion criteria, five patients received topical steroids and 25 patients received intralesional steroids. Patients receiving intralesional injections tended to demonstrate reduced astigmatism at follow up after treatment (21 of 28). The lack of studies with relevant objective ophthalmological end points prevented statistical meta-analysis.

Conclusion

Intralesional injections may reduce refractive error, while the efficacy of topical steroids is unclear. Studies measuring objective ophthalmic data before and after treatment are sparse, and more studies are needed to determine the relative efficacy of different steroids. There are insufficient data to estimate the incidence of steroid side effects in patients treated with steroids for periorbital HOI or complications of intralesional injections in particular.

### The potential role of corticosteroid prophylaxis for the prevention of microscopic fat embolism syndrome in gluteal augmentations [^636f2158]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Microscopic fat embolism syndrome (micro-FES) has been recently identified as a potentially fatal complication following gluteal augmentation utilizing autologous fat grafts; safety recommendations advocating for subcutaneous lipo-injections may be insufficient for its prevention.

Objectives

The authors of this systematic review evaluated the potential role of corticosteroid prophylaxis for the prevention of micro-FES in gluteal augmentation procedures.

Methods

The authors performed a systematic search employing the National Library of Medicine (PubMed), Medline, and Embase databases. Search terms were those pertaining to studies reporting the efficacy of prophylactic corticosteroid administration on micro-FES incidence in a high-risk surrogate population.

Results

Thirteen articles met the inclusion criteria for review, comprising 2 studies reporting on the efficacy of a single intravenous (IV) corticosteroid dose for the prophylaxis of micro-FES, 9 studies reporting on multiple prophylactic IV doses, and 2 additional studies reporting on the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids in this context. All studies were identified from the orthopedic literature given that none were available directly from within plastic surgery. The prophylactic efficacy of multiple IV doses of methylprednisolone, or a single larger dose, was established, whereas the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids remains elusive.

Conclusions

A single perioperative IV dose of methylprednisolone may be most appropriate for utilization by plastic surgeons; the safety and implication of this therapy on wound healing and fat graft survival are discussed. Further studies directly evaluating the efficacy of corticosteroid prophylaxis in the gluteal augmentation population are indicated. Finally, recommendations pertaining to the prevention, timely recognition, and effective management of micro-FES are discussed.

### Serious neurological events complicating epidural injections of glucocorticoid suspensions: evidence for a direct effect of some particulate steroids on red blood cells [^0cf56aa0]. RMD Open (2016). Low credibility.

To explore the mechanisms by which steroids provoke the cord infarction, we used intravital microscopy of mouse cremaster muscles to investigate the in vivo effects of an intra-arterial injection of four different particulate steroids, namely methylprednisolone acetate, triamcinolone acetonide, prednisolone acetate and cortivazol and one corticosteroid solution, namely dexamethasone sodium phosphate, on microvascular perfusion. Intra-arterial administration of 20 µL of pure prednisolone acetate or triamcinolone acetonide suspension completely stopped blood flow in all arterioles and venules, which decreased the functional capillary density to zero (see online supplementary material). Methylprednisolone acetate sharply decreased perfusion as well, although some blood flow was maintained in a few areas of the arteriolar and venular network. In contrast, intra-arterial administration of the cortivazol suspension or dexamethasone sodium phosphate solution did not change microvascular blood flow. The formation of macroaggregates of particulate steroids, which has been suggested to lead to vascular obliteration, was not observed in our animal experiments. An arterial spasm was not observed as well. Our results disclosed another mechanism for microvascular occlusion. We found that an unexpected aggregation of red blood cells (RBCs), occurring immediately after injection of the particulate steroids into the blood stream, was responsible for the obstruction of arterioles. As well, the particulate steroids could directly interact with RBCs without mediation by white cells or plasma proteins. Scanning electron microscopy provided some insight into the mechanism of RBC agglutination, showing RBCs with a deformed shape and their transformation into spiculated cells with prednisolone acetate, triamcinolone acetonide and methylprednisolone acetate administration (figure 1). More than 28% of the RBCs changed into spiculated cells with these three corticosteroid suspensions.

### Intralesional steroid injection for the management of otohematoma [^197eda2f]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the therapeutic efficacies of aspiration plus intralesional steroid injection and aspiration plus pressure dressing for the management of otohematoma.

Study Design and Setting

Fifteen patients with otohematoma were treated by aspiration plus pressure dressing (the pressure dressing group) and 34 patients were treated with intralesional steroid injections followed by simple aspiration (the steroid injection group).

Results

Otohematoma resolved within four weeks in all 15 patients in the pressure dressing group, but eight of the 15 showed perichondrial thickening. The duration of treatment was shorter in the steroid injection group than in the pressure dressing group; 14 (41.2%) of the 34 recovered after the first injections and another 15 (44.1%) after the second, and the remaining 5 (14.7%) after the third without any complications. However, multiple steroid injections are needed due to a high early recurrence rate.

Conclusion

Intralesional steroid injection is the treatment of choice for the management of otohematoma. The correction of causative use of a hard pillow, a helmet, and headphones is essential to prevent late recurrence.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^db707939]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Neuraxial corticosteroids in epidural injections — formulations, complications, and particle characteristics — are highlighted with concern for embolic risk. The chemistry of neuraxial steroids has taken center stage due to devastating complications following epidural injections, and "Steroid particle embolism of small radicular arteries is believed to be an important causative factor". Common long-acting formulations include methylprednisolone (Depo‑Medrol), triamcinolone acetonide (Aristocort or Kenalog), and betamethasone acetate and phosphate mixture (Celestone Soluspan). A reported transforaminal case noted paraplegia shortly after corticosteroid injection with a working diagnosis of massive cerebellar infarct, and microscopy indicated that corticosteroid suspensions contained large particles capable of occluding metarterioles and arterioles. Comparative particle studies reported that dexamethasone and betamethasone sodium phosphate were pure liquid, with a significantly greater proportion of larger particles in methylprednisolone and compounded betamethasone than in commercial betamethasone; dilution effects differed, as increasing dilution of methylprednisolone 80 mg/mL with saline increased the proportion of larger particles. The investigators concluded that "commercial betamethasone is the recommended preparation if a nonsoluble steroid is preferred" and that "Dexamethasone is a nonparticulate steroid, but its routine use awaits further studies on its safety and efficacy".

### Joint and soft tissue injection [^5dcba391]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Injection techniques are helpful for diagnosis and therapy in a wide variety of musculoskeletal conditions. Diagnostic indications include the aspiration of fluid for analysis and the assessment of pain relief and increased range of motion as a diagnostic tool. Therapeutic indications include the delivery of local anesthetics for pain relief and the delivery of corticosteroids for suppression of inflammation. Side effects are few, but may include tendon rupture, infection, steroid flare, hypopigmentation, and soft tissue atrophy. Injection technique requires knowledge of anatomy of the targeted area and a thorough understanding of the agents used. In this overview, the indications, contraindications, potential side effects, timing, proper technique, necessary materials, pharmaceuticals used and their actions, and post-procedure care of patients are presented.

### Serious neurological events complicating epidural injections of glucocorticoid suspensions: evidence for a direct effect of some particulate steroids on red blood cells [^567adf38]. RMD Open (2016). Low credibility.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved any injectable glucocorticoid product for epidural administration, but epidural injection of glucocorticoids is commonly used to manage radicular neck and back pain. Severe and sometimes fatal neurological events have occurred immediately after epidural injection of glucocorticoids. Indeed, 90 events were reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) between 1997 and 2014.

In the December 10, 2015 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, Racoosin et al, from the FDA, found that all the catastrophic neurological events (brain and spinal cord infarctions resulting in permanent disability or death) reported to the FAERS were associated with injection of a glucocorticoid suspension, with only a few cases, involving temporary symptoms, reported with glucocorticoid solutions. However, the authors found that suspension formulations still accounted for more than 80% of the commercially available corticosteroid products used for epidural injections in 2013, according to Medicare and IMS health data, despite the increasing use of solutions.

Potential causes of neurological complications after spinal injections of a suspension of particulate steroids include intrathecal injection, epidural hematoma, direct spinal cord injury and cord infarction due to an arterial spasm or vascular obliteration after inadvertent intra-arterial injection. However, the almost immediate onset of neurological deficit, as well as the MR findings performed in patients who underwent this complication, are very suggestive of spinal cord ischaemia following interruption of arterial blood supply. Brain or spinal cord ischaemia resulting from particulate steroid injection into the vertebral artery has also been demonstrated in an animal study. Occlusion of distal intramedullary arteries by steroid particles via an unexpected intra-arterial injection has been incriminated as the mechanism leading to cord infarction in severe neurological deficit occurring after foraminal steroid injections at the cervical spine. It has been suggested that the tendency of steroid particles to coalesce and the size of their final aggregates, which differ among the different types of particulate steroids, may influence the risk of arterial embolisation.

### Epidural steroid warning controversy still dogging FDA [^3b873b12]. Pain Physician (2014). Low credibility.

On April 23, 2014, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a letter of warning that injection of corticosteroids into the epidural space of the spine may result in rare, but serious adverse events, including "loss of vision, stroke, paralysis, and death". The advisory also advocated that patients should discuss the benefits and risks of epidural corticosteroid injections with their health care professionals, along with the benefits and risks associated with other possible treatments. In addition, the FDA stated that the effectiveness and safety of the corticosteroids for epidural use have not been established, and the FDA has not approved corticosteroids for such use. To raise awareness of the risks of epidural corticosteroid injections in the medical community, the FDA's Safe Use Initiative convened a panel of experts including pain management experts to help define the techniques for such injections with the aim of reducing preventable harm. The panel was unable to reach an agreement on 20 proposed items related to technical aspects of performing epidural injections. Subsequently, the FDA issued the above referenced warning and a notice that a panel will be convened in November 2014. This review assesses the inaccuracies of the warning and critically analyzes the available literature. The literature has been assessed in reference to alternate techniques and an understanding of the risk factors when performing transforaminal epidural injections in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions, ultimately resulting in improved safety. The results of this review show the efficacy of epidural injections, with or without steroids, in a multitude of spinal ailments utilizing caudal, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar interlaminar approaches as well as lumbar transforaminal epidural injections. The evidence also shows the superiority of steroids in managing lumbar disc herniation utilizing caudal and lumbar interlaminar approaches without any significant difference as compared to transforaminal approaches, either with local anesthetic alone or local anesthetic and steroids combined. In conclusion, the authors request that the FDA modify the warning based on the evidence.

### FDA requires label changes to warn of rare but serious neurologic… [^dc38d98b]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

The U. S. Food and Drug Administration is warning that injection of corticosteroids into the epidural space of the spine may result in rare but serious adverse events, including loss of vision, stroke, paralysis, and death. The injections are given to treat neck and back pain, and radiating pain in the arms and legs. Additional Information for Patients
- Rare but serious problems have occurred after injection of corticosteroids into the epidural space of the spine to treat neck and back pain, and radiating pain in the arms and legs.
- These serious problems include loss of vision, stroke, paralysis, and death.
- The effectiveness and safety of injection of corticosteroids into the epidural space of the spine have not been established, and FDA has not approved corticosteroids for this use.
- Rare but serious neurologic adverse events have been reported with epidural corticosteroid injections, including spinal cord infarction, paraplegia, quadriplegia, cortical blindness, stroke, and death.
- These serious neurologic events have been reported with and without the use of fluoroscopy.
- The effectiveness and safety of epidural administration of corticosteroids have not been established, and FDA has not approved corticosteroids for this use. 2–16 Serious adverse events included death, spinal cord infarction, paraplegia, quadriplegia, cortical blindness, stroke, seizures, nerve injury, and brain edema. Many cases were temporally associated with the corticosteroid injections, with adverse events occurring within minutes to 48 hours after the corticosteroid injections. In some cases, diagnoses of neurologic adverse events were confirmed through magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scan. Many patients did not recover from these reported adverse events.

### Acute epidural haematoma following epidural steroid injection in a patient with spinal stenosis [^fea1e23d]. Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Extradural haematoma is a rare but known complication of neuraxial procedures. Although the literature quotes an incidence of 1:150,000 and 1:220,000 after epidural and spinal procedures, respectively, there is only a limited number of case reports described in pain practice. This case report describes an unusual occurrence of thoracic extradural haematoma following a lumbar epidural steroid injection. An entirely unique feature was its occurrence at a level distant to the site of injection, which has not been reported previously unless associated with catheterisation. We would like to highlight this report as it raises several pertinent and challenging questions; both for regional anaesthesia and pain practice.

### Aggregation properties of triamcinolone acetonide injection in human serum: considerations when performing epidural steroid injections [^9f400dee]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

ESIs are commonly used to treat a variety of spine pain conditions. Generally accepted as an innocuous procedure, rare, but devastating, associated complications have been reported. Despite the infrequency of such cases, much attention has been directed at the safety of these procedures. There are a number of published reports regarding their complications, including death, spinal cord, vertebrobasilar, and brain infarcts. Arterial embolization with particulate steroid is the well-accepted mechanism; therefore, epidurals performed in spinal locations with dense local arterial flow are most vulnerable to these devastating outcomes. Available case series reports support this theory, as the incidence of severe neurological deficits are disproportionally more common with cervical transforaminal epidural spinal injections than with epidurals performed in areas with less prominent arterial structures. This theory of intra-arterial particulate steroid injections causing embolization has also been supported in the literature.–In addition, many investigators believe that insoluble particulates, such as steroids injected during ESIs, increase the risk for poor neurological sequelae. Benzon et al validated this causal risk for ESI and steroid embolus by comparing the histological size of commonly used particulate steroids with and without the solutions they are mixed with prior to injection. Their investigation clearly demonstrated that particulate steroids could occlude a small- to medium-sized arteriole. It has also been reported that occult intra-arterial injection during ESIs are much more common than the reported neurological sequelae. Nahm et al described a 20% incidence of intravascular injection during the performance of cervical transforaminal ESIs. However, the reported rate of neurological sequelae with these injections is extremely low, even when these injections were performed commonly with particulate steroids. The discrepancy of vascular injection frequency to reported clinical sequelae suggests that blood factors may prevent steroid particle aggregation.

### Diagnosis and management of infantile hemangioma [^63f9f2c2]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Infantile hemangioma (IH) — corticosteroid adverse effects and precautions: Suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis has been observed during therapy with both intralesional and systemic steroids, with incidence estimates varying from 1.7% to 87%. Gastric irritation is seen in 21% to 32% of patients taking oral corticosteroids, and mild behavioral changes have been seen in up to 29% of infants receiving systemic corticosteroid for IH therapy. Rare cases of pneumonia attributable to Pneumocystis carinii infection have been reported in infants taking corticosteroids for IH, and prophylaxis of these patients with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been advocated by some experts; it has been suggested that infants not receive live vaccines during long-term corticosteroid therapy and that clinicians consider checking vaccine titers on completion of corticosteroid therapy to assess the adequacy of response. Ocular adverse effects of long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy include cataracts and increased intraocular pressure, and the most serious ocular adverse effect is that of vision loss caused by embolic occlusion of the central retinal artery after intralesional injection; however, the actual risk is thought to be quite low and is primarily related to high injection pressure. Cutaneous adverse effects are most often associated with intralesional and topical therapy, with the most common risks being atrophy and hypopigmentation, and in treating bulky IHs with intralesional therapy, cutaneous complications can be avoided by keeping the injection well below the dermis. Given these potential adverse effects, many physicians will periodically reevaluate those infants receiving systemic corticosteroids (oral or intralesional), with specific attention to growth variables and blood pressure, and some physicians will also reassess adrenal function at the end of therapy and determine the need for stress doses of steroids on cessation of therapy.

Transforaminal epidural steroid injection–associated hemorrhagic events are detailed across case reports. Desai and Dua describe a 72-year-old female undergoing right transforaminal epidural injection at L3 and L4, who four days after the injection developed progressive neurologic deficits, with MRI consistent with a small hematoma affecting the L4 nerve root and with no history of coagulopathy; the authors emphasize this is not truly an epidural hematoma and that a foraminal hematoma only affects the isolated nerve root and does not result in paraplegia. Gungor and Aiyer report epidural hematoma after lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injection in a patient with severe lumbar spinal stenosis, located on the contralateral side of the dura at a distance from the needle path, and there was no anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy involved. Lee et al report a 79-year-old female who had 3 trials of transforaminal steroid injection within a one-month period and developed an iatrogenic hemorrhagic ganglion cyst compressing the thecal sac and L5 nerve root, which the authors state is not the same bleeding complication as a true epidural hematoma and was removed from epidural hematoma count. Kim et al describe an 82-year-old male not taking any anticoagulants or antiplatelets who received 2 sessions at the L2–L3 level; the next morning he underwent emergency MRI, surgical evacuation was performed that evening for a hematoma from T12 to L1, and two weeks later the patient was discharged, with the authors noting that such epidural hematoma can occur without risk factors such as anticoagulant drugs.

Question 16: What are Potential Rare Adverse Events from Injection of Biological Agents?

Summary of Adverse Reactions

As with all injections, there are common complications that may arise from using regenerative medicine therapy. Localized soreness or discomfort from the injection itself is a common adverse event after therapy. Similar to injections with corticosteroid, an increase in pain intensity may be observed after injections with injectable biologics, which many commonly attribute to an initial short-term pro-inflammatory cascade. There is also a risk of infection due to poor sterile technique or contamination of the blood or tissue product during transfer. Using closed systems for product manufacturing is preferred to reduce the risk of product contamination. In the case of BMAC therapy, it can be common for patients to develop harvest site pain, soreness, or bruising. These adverse effects can be treated with supportive therapy such as rest, ice, heat and oral analgesics. Skin dimpling or other cosmetic disfigurement can also occur during lipoaspiration for adipose-derived stem cells, and therefore it is important to practice good aspiration technique to prevent these complications.

More severe adverse reactions that have been associated with stem cell-based therapy include: tumor formation, disease transmission, reactivation of latent viruses, unwanted cell growth, neoplasm formation (benign or malignant), undesired immune responses (eg, graft versus host disease), unintended physiological and anatomical consequences (arrhythmia), toxicity and lack of efficacy. We discuss a few of these rarer adverse events in greater detail below. The delivery method of stem cell therapy can also impact the occurrence of adverse reactions as well. Conventional delivery including intravenous injection and surgical implantation may have its disadvantages such as low delivery efficacy, inappropriate stem cell migration, hemorrhage, and systemic exposure of cells. Understanding the types of adverse reactions that can occur from stem cell therapy is essential for ensuring patient safety and optimizing treatment outcomes.

### Subdural hematoma after cervical epidural steroid injection [^85d3e07a]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

A case report is presented involving a subdural hematoma after cervical epidural steroid injection.

Objective

To demonstrate a previously unreported complication of cervical epidural steroid injection.

Summary Of Background Data

Cervical epidural steroid injection is a common procedure performed in the care of patients with spine-related complaints. Reports of complications are rare, and most of these are fairly benign. To the authors' knowledge, subdural hematoma has never been described as a complication of a cervical epidural steroid injection.

Methods

A patient underwent an uncomplicated cervical epidural steroid injection by an experienced anesthesiologist. She developed acute onset of axial pain followed by progressive quadriparesis within a matter of 8 hours. She was transferred from a local emergency room after a CT scan suggested posterior cord displacement consistent with an anterior spinal hematoma from C3 to C5. She was taken to the operating room for urgent decompression. Exploration revealed an anterior subdural hematoma that was evacuated followed by dural closure with a patch.

Results

After surgery the patient was initially quadriplegic but rapidly gained full function in the left upper and lower extremities. She was making steady progress with motor recovery on the right side when she developed acute meningitis about 8 days after surgery, and then she subsequently went into cardiopulmonary arrest. She was successfully resuscitated but remained critically ill with no evidence of encouraging neurologic function. Six days later she had a second cardiac arrest and could not be resuscitated.

Conclusions

It is important to acknowledge that spinal hematomas can occur after cervical epidural steroid injection, as prompt recognition and treatment could improve the prognosis for recovery. The sequelae of a cervical subdural hematoma after epidural steroid injection remain potentially devastating.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of foot health in inflammatory arthritis [^b53aa48d]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Concern has been expressed about possible deleterious effects on articular cartilage volume of repeated joint injections with corticosteroid in people with knee osteoarthritis, but there is little evidence in people with IA. EULAR recommendations for intra-articular therapies advise avoiding > 3–4 corticosteroid injections in the same joint per year while acknowledging the lack of evidence to underpin this.

Conscious sedation, such as nitrous oxide, provides safe and effective short-term relief of pain and anxiety during intra-articular injections and can therefore be considered when administering local corticosteroid injections in children and young people with IA. General anaesthesia may be more suitable in certain cases (e.g. younger children or those requiring multiple injections).

Local corticosteroid injections are well tolerated, and serious side effects are rare. Recognized complications include infection, lipoatrophy, hypopigmentation and temporary worsening of diabetes control. No serious adverse effects took place during the injection procedure or follow-up for all patients included in the systematic review of the five studies mentioned above (n = 120). A minority of patients (n = 7) reported a mild cold feeling during the injection and one patient developed mild local atrophoderma at the point of entry after the treatment. Administration of local corticosteroid injections is also standard practice in other joints in IA (e.g. knees, shoulders), with evidence from RCTs for reduction in joint swelling, improved disease activity scores and DAS28 remission. There is no evidence to support any specific corticosteroid agent over another in the foot.

### Epidural steroid injection resulting in epidural hematoma in a patient despite strict adherence to anticoagulation guidelines [^70eb0305]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2009). Low credibility.

Epidural steroid injections are relatively safe procedures, although the risk of hemorrhagic complications in patients undergoing long-term anticoagulation therapy is higher. The American Society for Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine has specific guidelines for treatment of these patients when they undergo neuraxial anesthetic procedures. In this paper, the authors present a case in which the current American Society for Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine guidelines were strictly followed with respect to withholding and reintroducing warfarin and enoxaparin after an epidural steroid injection, but the patient nevertheless developed a spinal epidural hematoma requiring emergency surgical evacuation. The authors compare the case with the 8 other published cases of postinjection epidural hematomas in patients with coagulopathy, and the specific risk factors that may have contributed to the hemorrhagic complication in this patient is analyzed.

### Avoiding and treating dermal filler complications [^38f2dad2]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

All fillers are associated with the risk of both early and late complications. Early side effects such as swelling, redness, and bruising occur after intradermal or subdermal injections. The patient has to be aware of and accept these risks. Adverse events that last longer than 2 weeks can be attributable to technical shortcomings (e.g., too superficial an implantation of a long-lasting filler substance). Such adverse events can be treated with intradermal 5-fluorouracil, steroid injections, vascular lasers, or intense pulsed light, and later with dermabrasion or shaving. Late adverse events also include immunologic phenomena such as late-onset allergy and nonallergic foreign body granuloma. Both react well to intralesional steroid injections, which often have to be repeated to establish the right dose. Surgical excisions shall remain the last option and are indicated for hard lumps in the lips and visible hard nodules or hard granuloma in the subcutaneous fat.

### Local and systemic side effects of corticosteroid injections for musculoskeletal indications [^ecfc003b]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2024). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroid injections can be associated with a range of potential side effects, which may be classified as local or systemic and further stratified as immediate or delayed in onset. Radiologists performing image-guided musculoskeletal injections should recognize the potential side effects of corticosteroid medication when counseling patients before injection and consider such side effects in planning individual injections. This Review summarizes the available evidence regarding the local and systemic side effects of corticosteroid injections performed for musculoskeletal indications. Local side effects include postinjection flare, skin hypopigmentation and atrophy, infection, tendon rupture, accelerated progression of osteoarthritis, and osseous injury. Systemic side effects include adrenal suppression or insufficiency, facial flushing, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and osteoporosis. Additional targeted counseling is warranted regarding side effects that are specific to certain patient populations (i.e., premenopausal women, patients with diabetes, athletes, and pediatric patients). Corticosteroid injections are contraindicated in the presence of superficial or deep infection, fracture, or a prosthetic joint. Guidelines on the frequency, duration, and maximal lifetime use of corticosteroid injections are currently lacking. Further research is needed regarding the long-term complications of continuous corticosteroid use, particularly with regard to osseous effects.

Indications and frequency limits for injections — the document states these decisions have often relied on non-evidence-based assumptions. Over the years, some authors have recommended one injection for diagnostic as well as therapeutic purposes; others have preached 3 injections in a series irrespective of a patient's progress or lack thereof; others suggest 3 injections followed by a repeat course of 3 injections after 3-, 6-, or 12-month intervals; and some propose an unlimited number of injections. Dose caps such as a limitation of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight of steroid or 210 mg per year in an average person and a lifetime dose of 420 mg of steroid also have been advocated; however, with no scientific basis.

Cervical epidural steroid injections are a common treatment of cervical radicular pain. Important safety considerations include attention to the possibility of spinal cord infarction and spinal epidural hematoma. When appropriate, radiographic, technical, and pharmacologic principals are used, these procedures are relatively safe. Cervical epidural steroid injections are effective for the short-term treatment of radicular pain. More rigorously designed clinical outcomes studies of both cervical interlaminar and transforaminal epidural steroid injections are needed.

### Terminating corticosteroid injection in tendinopathy? Hasta la vista, baby [^5b8ed0a2]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

SYNOPSIS: Two recent randomized-controlled trials showed promising results of local corticosteroid injections combined with exercise therapy for Achilles tendinopathy and plantar fasciopathy. Should clinicians go back to using corticosteroid injections to treat tendinopathy? Are corticosteroids back (baby)? In this viewpoint we critically appraise the new evidence and humbly share our clinical reasoning when advising athletes about corticosteroid injections in practice. Our goal is to help clinicians decide what to do and what to recommend to patients. We prioritize the risk for higher recurrence rates and tendon rupture when weighing the reasonable treatment options for tendinopathy, and recommend against using corticosteroid injections. The best systematic review evidence shows that local corticosteroid injections are not effective for tendinopathies after the first few weeks, and produce worse long-term outcomes compared to other treatments. For now, we consider corticosteroid injections remain terminated. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2023;53(11):1–4. Epub: 28 July 2023. doi:10.2519/jospt.2023.11875.

Injectate Selection

An isolated diagnostic injection may be performed using 1% lidocaine for immediate, short-acting effect or 0.25% bupivacaine, which has a short onset with analgesia lasting approximately 5 hours; there is no literature supporting the preferential use of one over the other. We typically use 1% lidocaine for diagnostic injections because its short-acting effect is preferable in outpatient settings. The literature does not favor any specific steroid for symptomatic relief, and options such as dexamethasone, depot triamcinolone, betamethasone, or methylprednisolone may all be considered. For therapeutic injections, we utilize a combination of 0.5 mL 1% lidocaine and 1 mL dexamethasone 10 mg/mL as the initial treatment. We prefer non-particulate steroids such as dexamethasone in the cervical spine because the risk of intravascular injection of particulate steroids leading to embolization of the brain vasculature is catastrophic, potentially resulting in acute infarct or death. If a patient previously had a successful injection with dexamethasone and returns with persistent pain, we will discuss the risks and benefits of attempting a particulate steroid injection, such as triamcinolone-acetate, to achieve longer-lasting pain relief.

### ACR-ASNR-ASSR-SIR-SNIS practice parameter for the performance of image-guided epidural steroid injection [^99b85213]. SIR (2025). High credibility.

Image-guided epidural steroid injection (ESI) — bleeding risk and anticoagulation: Spinal hematoma is described as a rare but serious complication following epidural puncture with an incidence less than 1:150,000, and reported risks of hemorrhagic complications when therapy is continued are 0.0% to 0.4% for anticoagulants and 0.0% to 0.6% for antiplatelet medications; given potential risks of discontinuation, "the benefits and risks of an ESI should be considered on an individual patient basis and after discussion with the clinician prescribing the anticoagulant".

### Spine injectables: what is the safest cocktail? [^4d2ebf9d]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Spinal injections are common pain management procedures using corticosteroids and local anesthetics. Most corticosteroid preparations are particulate suspensions, such as methylprednisolone acetate and triamcinolone acetonide. In the cervical spine, particulate corticosteroids have been linked to catastrophic complications, including blindness, paralysis, and death. Serious neurologic injuries have also been reported at the thoracic, lumbar, and sacral levels.

Conclusion

Nonparticulate preparations, such as dexamethasone, are safer but have shorter-lived antiinflammatory effects. Local anesthetics are often mixed with corticosteroids in pain management procedures. Although everyday risks are minimal, injection techniques should take into account neural and cardiac toxicities. In this article, we discuss the potential for serious adverse events associated with injected medications. We review the current literature to make conclusions on medication combinations that balance safety and efficacy.

### ACR-ASNR-ASSR-SIR-SNIS practice parameter for the performance of image-guided epidural steroid injection [^e0b87447]. SIR (2025). High credibility.

Epidural steroid injection (ESI) — hemorrhagic complications and anticoagulation management are detailed, noting a risk of 0.0% to 0.4% for hemorrhagic complications when continuing anticoagulants and 0.0% to 0.6% when continuing antiplatelet medications, with particular care needed in individuals with coagulopathy. The risk of hemorrhagic complications in anticoagulated patients undergoing interlaminar epidural steroid injections (ILESIs) may not be the same for lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI), and the pressure effects of epidural hematoma can lead to compression and/or ischemia of the spinal cord and/or nerve roots. As there may actually be more risk in discontinuing anticoagulants, "the benefits and risks of an ESI should be considered on an individual patient basis and after discussion with the clinician prescribing the anticoagulant".

### Serious neurological events complicating epidural injections of glucocorticoid suspensions: evidence for a direct effect of some particulate steroids on red blood cells [^a377e090]. RMD Open (2016). Low credibility.

In a recent review, MacMahon et al concluded that, in cervical, thoracic and high lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections, a growing consensus of the literature supports the exclusive use of non-particulate glucocorticoid to reduce the risk of embolic injury to the brain and spinal cord, but that both particulate and non-particulate glucocorticoid are acceptable choices in lower lumbosacral transforaminal epidural spine injection since serious neurological events are exceedingly rare at this level.

However, we believe that cord infarction is rarer at the lower lumbar level compared to upper levels just because the anatomical disposition of a metameric artery contributing to the cord vascularisation is only present in very few persons.

From our results, we suggest that the particulate steroids responsible for blood-flow arrest in our experiments, namely methylprednisolone acetate, triamcinolone acetonide and prednisolone acetate, should no longer be used for foraminal injections at the cervical as well at the lumbar level and probably, as a precaution, for epidural injections as well.

In our clinical practice, we presently use the particulate steroid cortivazol, which does not provoke RBC agglutination, but which is not available for epidural injection in most other countries. However, more experience is needed to confirm the agent's innocuity, especially with foraminal administration.

In countries where cortivazol is not available, use of dexamethasone sodium phosphate solution for epidural injection, despite it is short action time, is the only available alternative to corticosteroid suspensions. Dexamethasone is widely used with intra-arterial administration and to our knowledge has never been associated with permanent neurological complications. Several studies that compared pain reduction with transforaminal injection of either dexamethasone sodium phosphate or steroid suspensions have found no evidence that dexamethasone is less effective than particulate steroids. However, there is no direct evidence that non-particulate steroids are superior to sham injections, and studies that show no difference between particulate and non-particulate steroids are underpowered. Therefore, further studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of dexamethasone sodium phosphate with this method of administration.

### Paraplegia following image-guided transforaminal lumbar spine epidural steroid injection: two case reports [^6307c01c]. Pain Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To present two case reports of a rare but devastating injury after image-guided, lumbar transforaminal injection of steroids, and to explore features in common with previously reported cases.

Background

Image (fluoroscopic and computed tomography [CT])-guided, lumbar transforaminal injections of corticosteroids have been adopted as a treatment for radicular pain. Complications associated with these procedures are rare, but can be severe.

Case Reports

An 83-year-old woman underwent a fluoroscopically guided, left L3-L4, transforaminal injection of betamethasone (Celestone Soluspan). A 79-year-old man underwent a CT-guided, right L3-L4, transforaminal injection of methylprednisolone (DepoMedrol). Both patients developed bilateral lower extremity paralysis, with neurogenic bowel and bladder, immediately after the procedures. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were consistent with spinal cord infarction. There was no evidence of intraspinal mass or hematoma.

Conclusion

These cases consolidate a pattern emerging in the literature. Distal cord and conus injury can occur following transforaminal injections at lumbar levels, whether injection is on the left or right. This conforms with the probability of radicular-medullary arteries forming an arteria radicularis magna at lumbar levels. All cases used particulate corticosteroids, which promotes embolization in a radicular artery as the likely mechanism of injury. The risk of this complication can be reduced, and potentially eliminated, by the utilization of particulate free steroids, testing for intra-arterial injection with digital subtraction angiography, and a preliminary injection of local anesthetic.

### Size and aggregation of corticosteroids used for epidural injections [^916377c7]. Pain Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to document particulate size in commonly used corticosteroid preparations. Inadvertent injection of particulate corticosteroids into a vertebral or foraminal artery can cause brain and spinal cord embolic infarcts and the size of the particles could be directly related to the chance that a clinically significant infarct would occur. One might assume that corticosteroids with particles significantly smaller than red blood cells might be safer.

Design

The following four types of corticosteroid preparations were used in various solutions and evaluated under light microscopy: dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection, triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension, betamethasone sodium phosphate and betamethasone acetate injectable suspension, and methylprednisolone acetate injectable suspension.

Results

Dexamethasone sodium phosphate particle size was approximately 10 times smaller than red blood cells and the particles did not appear to aggregate; even mixed with 1% lidocaine HCl solution and with contrast dye, the size of the particles were unchanged. Triamcinolone acetonide and betamethasone sodium phosphate showed variable sizes; some particles were larger than red blood cells, and aggregation of particles was evident. Methylprednisolone acetate showed uniformity in size and the majority were smaller than red blood cells which were not aggregated, but the particles were densely packed.

Conclusions

Compared with the particulate steroid solutions, dexamethasone sodium phosphate had particles that were significantly smaller than red blood cells, had the least tendency to aggregation, and had the lowest density. These characteristics should significantly reduce the risk of embolic infarcts or prevent them from occurring after intra-arterial injection. Until shown otherwise in clinical studies, interventionalists might consider using dexamethasone or another corticosteroid preparation with similar high solubility and negligible particle size when performing epidural injections.

### Treatment of soft tissue filler complications: expert consensus recommendations [^e07d09c6]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Foreign-Body Granulomas

Foreign-body granulomas may form as the body's immune system responds to a foreign body that cannot be broken down by the usual mechanisms.

Although they can occur with all injectable dermal fillers, the incidence is very rare (from 0.01 to 1.0%) and usually appears after a latent period, which can be several months to years after injection. Diagnosis of granulomas is further complicated by the fact that clinicians are sometimes faced with patients with unknown or incomplete medical and cosmetic treatment history.

Granulomatous reactions to hyaluronic acid fillers can be treated with hyaluronidase with the dosing of 150 U/mL.

Once infection has been ruled out or quiescent, granulomas may respond to oral or intralesional steroids. If steroids are not enough, many patients will respond to the addition of 5-FU to the corticosteroids. In cases of repeated failure of other therapies, surgical excision is the treatment of choice for foreign-body granuloma.

Tissue Necrosis

Impending tissue necrosis, although fortunately rare, may occur as a result of inadvertent injection of filler into vessels supplying the mucosa or the skin, resulting in vessel occlusion. On the other hand, necrosis may also occur secondary to local edema or to occlusion of adjacent vasculature secondary to the hydrophilic properties of the product.

The risk of skin necrosis can be reduced by different strategies (see Table 6).

All the injectors have to be familiar with the signs of skin necrosis and the appropriate therapy. For intravascular infarction, the panel recommended:
To apply a warm gauze, tapping the area to facilitate vasodilatation, and massage of the area.
To use topical nitroglycerin (1 or 2%) paste 2 or 3 times/daily in the office and at home by the patient. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets can be used.
Hyaluronidase injection (200–400 IU/1–2 mL) + massage. See Table 5.
Although it was not absolutely proved, it was stated that acetylsalicylic acid (500 mg/8 h, 24–48 h) might be helpful.
If there are ocular symptoms (blurred vision, loss of vision, or ocular pain), the patient has to be urgently referred to the ophthalmologist.
Other strategies including systemic or topical steroids (prednisone 20–40 mg each day for 3–5 days), low molecular weight heparin, hyperbaric oxygen, sildenafil (1 per day for 3–5 days) have been proposed.

### Intravitreal steroids versus observation for macular edema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion [^b75f5fce]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is a common retinal vascular abnormality associated with conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, glaucoma, and a wide variety of hematologic disorders. Macular edema (ME) represents an important vision-threatening complication of CRVO. Intravitreal steroids (IVS), such as triamcinolone acetonide, have been utilized to treat macular edema stemming from a variety of etiologies and may be a treatment option for CRVO-ME.

Objectives

To explore the effectiveness and safety of intravitreal steroids in the treatment of CRVO-ME.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2014 Issue 10), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to November 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to November 2014), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 13 November 2014. For all included primary studies, we used The Science Citation Index (3 December 2014) and manually reviewed reference lists to identify other possible relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared intravitreal steroids, of any dosage and duration of treatment of at least six months, with observation for the treatment of CRVO-ME.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts identified from the electronic searches and assessed full-text articles from potentially eligible trials. Two review authors independently assessed trial characteristics, risk of bias, and extracted data from included trials. We contacted investigators of included trials for desired data not provided in the trial reports.

Main Results

We included two RCTs that enrolled a total of 708 participants with CRVO-ME. SCORE compared triamcinolone acetonide intravitreal injections (n = 165) with observation (n = 72); GENEVA compared dexamethasone intravitreal implants (n = 290) with sham injections (n = 147). We observed characteristics indicative of high risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data in SCORE and selective outcome reporting in GENEVA. Loss to follow-up was high with 10% in the steroid groups and almost twice as much (17%) in the observation group. GENEVA enrolled participants with both branch and central retinal vein occlusion, but did not present subgroup data for the CRVO-ME population. A qualitative assessment of the results from GENEVA indicated that the dexamethasone implant was not associated with improvement in visual acuity after six months among participants with CRVO-ME. Although the SCORE investigators reported that participants treated with 1 mg (n = 82) or 4 mg (n = 83) triamcinolone intravitreal injections were five times more likely to have gained 15 letters or more in visual acuity compared with participants in the observation group (1 mg; risk ratio (RR): 5.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.62 to 17.15; 4 mg RR 4.92; 95% CI 1.50 to 16.10) by the eighth-month follow-up examination, the average visual acuity decreased in all three groups. However, eyes treated with triamcinolone lost fewer letters than participants in the observation group at 8 months (1 mg mean difference (MD): 8.70 letters, 95% CI 1.86 to 15.54; 4 mg MD: 9.80 letters, 95% CI 3.32 to 16.28). A higher incidence of adverse events was noted with IVS therapy when compared with observation alone. As many as 20% to 35% of participants experienced an adverse event in the IVS groups compared with 8% of participants in the observation group of the SCORE study. The GENEVA investigators reported 63% in the treatment arm versus 43% in the observation arm experienced an adverse event. The most commonly encountered adverse events were elevated intraocular pressure, progression of cataracts, and retinal neovascularization. We graded the quality of evidence as low due to study limitations, imprecision of treatment estimates, and selective outcome reporting.

Authors' Conclusions

The two RCTs reviewed herein provide insufficient evidence to determine the benefits of IVS for individuals with CRVO-ME. The improvement in visual acuity noted in the SCORE trial should be interpreted with caution as outcome data were missing for a large proportion of the observation group. Adverse events were observed more often with IVS treatment compared with observation/no treatment.

### Anatomical location of the segmental spinal arteries in the cervical intervertebral foramina: 3D-micro CT findings relevant to transforaminal epidural injection [^e57a7076]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cervical radiculopathy often causes symptoms like numbness, tingling, or weakness in the hands and arms, impacting a person's daily activities and quality of life. These symptoms occur because the nerves in the cervical spine are being compressed. This compression is usually caused by degenerative changes, such as osteoarthritis, which wear down the spinal discs and joints and can lead to the narrowing of the spaces through which the nerves travel. A herniated disc, in which the inner gel of the disc bulges out and presses on the nerves, can also cause this condition.

For the treatment of cervical radiculopathy, steroids and local anesthetics are often injected into the epidural space to reduce inflammation and pain. Cervical transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) is a method of injecting medication into the epidural space around the cervical nerve roots where they exit the spine through the intervertebral foramen (IVF). For treatment at the cervical spine, fluoroscopically-guided TFESI typically involves an oblique angled approach from the front toward the back to reach the target area. These injections need to be performed very carefully because there are important arteries in the IVF, such as the segmental spinal artery (SSA, described as the radicular artery in some clinical reports) and the segmental medullary artery. Damage to these arteries can cause serious complications including spinal cord injury or cerebellar stroke.

Traditional research methods for cervical spine anatomy have mainly relied on manual dissection; however, the cervical foramen is very small, and the surrounding structures move easily. This complicates spinal surgery as it involves manipulation of vessels and structures around the foramen. Additionally, visualizing nerve roots and vessels inside the foramen is challenging, especially determining their location in the oblique view of the needle approach during fluoroscopically-guided TFESI. For detailed and accurate analysis of the arteries within the IVF, we used three-dimensional micro-computed tomography (3D micro-CT) imaging. Unlike manual dissection, 3D micro-CT offers high resolution and the ability to visualize small, delicate structures without causing damage. Previous studies have used conventional manual dissection to observe the SSA but lacked intuitive visual guidance to the cervical IVF. The present anatomical study analyzed the location of the SSA in the IVF using 3D micro-CT images. The study findings suggest the most frequent regions of SSA for safe TFESI in the cervical IVF.

### Interventional pain procedures: a narrative review focusing on safety and complications. part 1 injections for spinal pain [^3c179754]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The greatest incidence of spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma following epidural injections occurs as a complication of injections into the cervicothoracic region. A number of factors contribute to an increased risk of occurrence, including female gender, advanced age, vertebral anatomy abnormalities, a history of spine surgery, difficult epidural placement, needle size, multiple attempts and use of anticoagulants (or presence of coagulopathy) during the procedure. In a large study of 4617 lumbar interlaminar epidural injections and 1182 cervical epidurals, 7 hemorrhagic complications were reported, including epidural hematomas (6 patients) and intramedullary spinal cord hemorrhage (1 patient) at the injection site. Other studies have demonstrated that patients undergoing anticoagulant therapy developed epidural hematomas following cervical steroid injections. Some patients suffered permanent neurologic deficits, despite surgical decompression, while others recovered without any neurological sequelae. In one case, a patient was reported to have developed an intracranial subdural hemorrhage following an epidural injection. The patient then developed meningitis and died from cardiopulmonary arrest. The possibility of hematoma cannot be excluded even in the absence of risk factors. Previous cervical manipulation and local vessel friability following repeated steroid injections may affect these complications. Permanent neurological lesions of the lumbar spine caused by epidural hematoma after interlaminar ESI have also been reported. In a study examining potential complications in 52,935 procedures provided at a single institution, epidural hematomas linked to interlaminar lumbar and caudal epidural steroid injections developed in 2 cases. Epidural hematomas following lumbar steroid injection were also reported in patients with undiagnosed bleeding disorders or those on anticoagulation medications. Significantly greater risk is associated with cervical injections than with lumbar injections. Urgent surgical consultation is fundamental when hyposthenia in the upper limbs is detected during or following steroid injections, particularly in the cervical spine. A rare complication that has been reported following cervical interlaminar ESIs are cervical epidural abscesses. This should be taken into consideration in cases in which increased pain, spasm, motor, sensory, bowel, and bladder dysfunction in the patient are accompanied by fever. Epidural abscesses and bacterial meningitis can occur as a complication of lumbar interlaminar injections. The American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine published guidelines for administering neuraxial blocks in patients taking anticoagulation medications. However, it is important to note that the risk of hemorrhagic complications may still be present, even when closely following the guidelines. Furthermore, the suspension of anticoagulant therapies due to invasive procedures can lead to thromboembolic complications. A complication rate of 0.4% (including a fatal stroke and a fatal myocardial infarction) in those who discontinued anticoagulants/antiaggregants according to ASRA guidelines has been reported. Paresthesia following cervical interlaminar ESIs may be transient, prolonged, or permanent, and injury to the nerve root may ensue from needle insertion. A case of permanent paresthesia following sudden movement in an unsettled patient was also reported. Thus, for some patients, sedation may be considered necessary to avoid complications from excessive patient movement. Inadvertent intramedullary puncture may result during cervical ESIs and, on more rare occasions, lumbar ESIs. A report on 2 cases of intrinsic spinal cord damage following fluoroscopically guided cervical interlaminar ESIs in sedated patients has been published, and another study reported a case of quadriplegia in a patient who was sedated, due to an intramedullary injection following a cervical interlaminar ESI. Therefore, excessive sedation is discouraged to ensure that patients are able to indicate experiences of inadvertent spinal cord irritation. Particulate steroid use during cervical transforaminal injections should also be given careful consideration as it represents the primary cause of neurological injury associated with the procedure. Thirteen deaths and 31 brain and spinal cord infarctions with persistent neurological injuries resulting from cervical transforaminal ESIs have been reported, with most of the patients having been treated with particulate steroids. Neurological injuries subsequent to transforaminal ESIs in the lumbar spine were also reported in 18 cases. The transforaminal approach is associated with greater risk of neurological injury compared to the interlaminar approach. However, 2 cases following cervical interlaminar epidural injections and one case subsequent to a thoracic interlaminar epidural injection have been reported. It is worth noting that these 3 cases are not necessarily indicative of a causal relationship consequent to steroid injections. A frequent complication of ESIs is intravascular injection. Although real-time fluoroscopy with the injection of a contrast agent is most commonly employed as a precaution against intravascular penetration, digital subtraction angiography may prove to be a more useful alternative to real-time fluoroscopy.

Interventional treatment — in patients with Modic changes, intradiscal steroids are suggested to provide short-term improvements in pain and function in patients with Modic changes. Grade of Recommendation: B. A double-blind, randomized, controlled, prospective clinical study in degenerative chronic discogenic low back pain with endplate Modic changes recorded pain and disability at 3 and 6 months, found that subgroups 2 and 3 had significant improvements in pain and disability at both follow-up points, and provides Level I evidence that intradiscal steroid injections can provide pain relief in patients with single level Modic changes and positive provocative discography with contrast contained within the disc space for up to 6 months. An additional study of chronic low back pain with inflammatory Modic changes classified patients as Modic type I (n = 37), Modic 1–2 (n = 25) and Modic II-1 (n = 12), all of whom received a lumbar intradiscal injection of corticosteroids and reported pain intensity before and one, three and six months after injection.

### Low level light therapy for the treatment of recalcitrant chalazia: a sample case summary [^855cc95f]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

A 2016 meta-analysis compared steroid injection with I&C and concluded that the surgical intervention was more effective after one procedure (60% vs 78%) with a decrease in relative efficacy if taking into account a second attempt (73% vs 87%); there were no differences in complication rates between the two procedures. Singhania et al noted that the resolution of medium to large size chalazia (chalazia diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy) was comparable between one steroid injection (90% for medium and 74% for large) and I&C (92% for medium and 91% for large) taking an average of 2–3 weeks to resolve; the reason for the better results in the steroid group may be attributed to removal of material within the lesion for biopsy before steroid injection. In a study of 536 patients, I&C resulted in satisfactory outcome in 91% of cases though chalazia recurred in 6% of cases. Goawalla et al compared the three treatment modalities and noted no difference in outcome between steroid and surgical interventions (84% and 87%, respectively) with a lower success rate (46%) using compresses; pain scores were highest for the surgical group, inconvenience was least in the steroid group and satisfaction was lowest in the compresses group.

Adverse events with such common treatments have been reported. McMonnies et al note that the combination of heat and eye massage, such as when patients are prescribed warm compresses, could result in corneal distortion and may warrant follow-up using corneal topography. One downside to more conservative treatments (anything aside from surgical excision) is the potential to mask, delay or miss a more concerning diagnosis such as a cancerous lesion that requires biopsy. Steroid injections also carry an additional risk if used in an infected eyeas they can increase intraocular pressure or result in depigmentation of the skinor vascular occlusion with loss of vision. Botulinum toxin complications include hematoma, ptosis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, epiphora, reduced blink rate but all are expected to resolve once the paralysis effects of the injection wear off.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^7daa7985]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

ASIPP Epidural Guidelines — epidural steroid injection complications and safeguards: The text states that inadvertent vascular mechanical or occlusive injury is believed to be the leading cause of infarctions, potentially due to intravascular injection of particulate steroids, arterial injury, dissection, dislodgement of plaque causing embolism, or arterial muscle spasm. It notes that most complications have been seen with particulate steroid and cervical spine transforaminal epidural steroid injections, though case reports of spinal infarction have occurred with nonparticulate lumbar steroid injections such as dexamethasone as well. Transforaminal epidural steroid injections, compared to interlaminar epidural steroid injections, are associated with an increased risk of intradiscal injection and do not decrease the risk of known complications of interlaminar epidural steroid injections, including dural and subdural punctures, hematoma formation, and cauda equina syndrome. Although complications are rare, they can be catastrophic. The FDA sought to determine the role of glucocorticoids in these adverse events and convened a panel of experts to identify techniques that may reduce harm, but evidence was lacking and consensus was not reached on all items. Subsequently, the Multisociety Pain Workgroup (without inclusion of ASIPP) approved multiple safeguards to prevent neurologic complications after epidural steroid injections; this was opposed by ASIPP, which then petitioned the FDA to prevent the safeguards from being mandatory and to remove the safety warning. The FDA denied the request to remove the safety warning or limiting to cervical transforaminal epidural injections, but agreed with the second item that safeguards were not required.

### Randomised, prospective, non-blinded pilot study comparing the effect of intramuscular steroid injections and intralesional steroid injections in the management of tennis elbow [^e5df7e9c]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Key messages

What is already known on this topic?

Corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory and pain-modulating drugs and may act through both local and systemic mechanisms.
Multiple studies and a systematic review suggest that a steroid injection for tennis elbow improves many short-term (6-week) outcome measures including pain and disability.
Pain and disability associated with tennis elbow typically follows a self-limiting course of 12 months but this may pose a potentially significant socioeconomic impact on individuals.

What this study adds?

Both intralesional and intramuscular corticosteroid injections have been shown to be effective and safe in the treatment of tennis elbow.
Non-inferiority of the intramuscular steroid injection compared with the intralesional steroid injection could not be inferred.
Intramuscular steroid injection was shown to be less painful at the site and time of injection compared with an intralesional injection.
This study did not include a sham group, so whether either treatment is superior to placebo could not be determined.

Table 1
Complications of ESIs (Values Expressed as Range); NS: Non Stated

A reasonably frequent complication following epidural injections, with an incidence of 0.06% to 6%, are unintentional dural punctures and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage. Several authors suggest that entering the epidural space above the C7–T1 interspace should be avoided, as it may be easier to penetrate the dura at higher levels. Furthermore, the ligamentum flavum is adherent to the dura above C5 in 34% of the population. Since the epidural space becomes narrower above C7, accessing the epidural space at higher levels increases the risk of injuring the spinal cord. Gaps in the ligamentum flavum, demonstrated to be present in up to 74% of patients at C5-C6 level, increase the risk of accidental injection into the spinal cord. Dural tears with CSF leakage and subsequent reductions in CSF volume may result in post-dural puncture headaches (PDPHs) within 48 hours of the procedure. Needle size and bevel type, among other factors, possibly affect the incidence of PDPH. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, neck stiffness, blurred vision, photophobia, diplopia, tinnitus and ear obstruction, and conservative treatments include hydration, bed rest, analgesics and caffeine intake. In cases in which the aforementioned treatments do not provide adequate symptom relief, a greater occipital nerve block or an epidural blood patch (EBP) is suggested. Even if its mechanism of action is still debated, EBPs create a clot which seals the leak, thereby increasing intraspinal pressure and ensuring a rapid coagulation response, even if the tear is not located in proximity to the EBP site. On rare occasions, adverse events of a more serious nature can occur as a result of dural puncture. Intracranial hypotension following dural punctures and epidural granulomas due to cervical epidural steroid injections have been reported. The risk of subdural injection in the cervical region is greater than that in the lumbar spine, as the subdural space is larger in the cervical region. Contrast patterns with fluoroscopic-guided injection must be analyzed carefully to avoid accidental injection into the subdural or subarachnoid space. Dural punctures associated with transforaminal lumbar ESI are also documented, despite seemingly technically sound injections. Possible complications following dural puncture, and ensuing injections into the subdural and subarachnoid spaces, include persistent paresthesia, temporary respiratory depression, ascending weakness/sensory loss, apnea, unconsciousness, cauda equina and conus medullaris syndromes, arachnoiditis and meningitis. Further highly infrequent yet potentially serious complications of cervical interlaminar ESIs are hematomas of the epidural or subdural space, which potentially result in transient or permanent neurological deficits.

### Corticosteroid injections and risk of fracture [^9c6c6071]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are high numbers of corticosteroid injections (CSIs) associated with subsequent fractures?

Findings

In this cohort study of 7197 patients over a 4-year period, higher fracture risk was not associated with the cumulative dose of injected corticosteroid, regardless of osteoporosis status.

Meaning

Corticosteroid injections are an important option for pain treatment, and clinicians should not withhold CSI owing to fear of fracture risk.

### Diagnosis and management of infantile hemangioma [^c78484ec]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Infantile hemangioma (IH) — corticosteroid therapy efficacy, dosing, and monitoring: Despite their efficacy, systemic corticosteroids are no longer considered by most clinicians to be first-line therapy for IH due to the associated risk of adverse effects. Corticosteroids, administered orally at a dose of 2 to 3 mg/kg per day, are efficacious in reducing size and discoloration of IH. The mechanism of IH growth inhibition by corticosteroids likely involves reduced vasculogenesis and enhanced adipogenesis. Corticosteroids administered intralesionally and topically also appear to be effective in certain subsets of patients with more localized IH, but their dosing and safety profile are not well studied. Periodic reexamination of children receiving corticosteroid therapy for IH has been suggested for monitoring of growth and blood pressure as well as changes in the lesion(s) being treated. Many physicians will periodically reevaluate those infants receiving systemic corticosteroids (oral or intralesional), with specific attention to growth variables and blood pressure.

### Reappraisal of astigmatism induced by periocular capillary hemangioma and treatment with intralesional corticosteroid injection [^6187c96e]. Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To document refractive status and visual acuity before and after intralesional corticosteroid injection in children with astigmatism induced by periocular capillary hemangioma (PCH).

Design

Retrospective, interocular comparison, interventional case series.

Participants

Thirteen infants with anisometropic astigmatism of at least 1.50 diopters (D) induced by PCH.

Intervention

All infants had one or more intralesional corticosteroid injections of a PCH between 2 and 10 months of age. Injections of 0.3 to 1.0 mL of a 50:50 mixture of triamcinolone (40 mg/ml) and dexamethasone phosphate (4 mg/ml) were given at a single site under deep sedation.

Main Outcome Measures

Refraction and acuity using Teller acuity cards before and after injection.

Results

In affected eyes, mean astigmatisms were 3.75 D (pretreatment) and 1.25 D (posttreatment), and mean spherical errors were 0.75 D (pretreatment) and 1.50 D (posttreatment). Reduction in astigmatism was observed within 1 to 14 months after the injection. Despite reciprocal changes in astigmatism and spherical error, the amount of anisometropia (spherical equivalent) remained constant. Amblyopia was not observed before treatment and was observed in only 2 of 13 children after treatment. Complications were limited to adrenal suppression with transient reductions of linear growth and localized eyelid necrosis.

Conclusions

Intralesional corticosteroid injections given in infancy (between 2 and 10 months) resulted in a 63% reduction in the mean amount of astigmatism induced by PCH. The reciprocal changes of astigmatism and spherical error without changes in anisometropia suggest that the treatment effect was due to restoration of the spherical shape of the cornea. Before 3 years of age, visual immaturity exceeded the optical blur related to astigmatism induced by PCH. Therefore, astigmatism, not anisometropia or amblyopia, is the immediate indication for treatment of PCH with intralesional corticosteroids. Injection of corticosteroid at a single site minimizes the potential for severe ocular complications owing to tissue pressure and tumor volume considerations.

### Safeguards to prevent neurologic complications after epidural steroid injections: consensus opinions from a multidisciplinary working group and national organizations [^708f392b]. Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Epidural corticosteroid injections are a common treatment for radicular pain caused by intervertebral disc herniations, spinal stenosis, and other disorders. Although rare, catastrophic neurologic injuries, including stroke and spinal cord injury, have occurred with these injections.

Methods

A collaboration was undertaken between the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Safe Use Initiative, an expert multidisciplinary working group, and 13 specialty stakeholder societies. The goal of this collaboration was to review the existing evidence regarding neurologic complications associated with epidural corticosteroid injections and produce consensus procedural clinical considerations aimed at enhancing the safety of these injections. U.S. Food and Drug Administration Safe Use Initiative representatives helped convene and facilitate meetings without actively participating in the deliberations or decision-making process.

Results

Seventeen clinical considerations aimed at improving safety were produced by the stakeholder societies. Specific clinical considerations for performing transforaminal and interlaminar injections, including the use of nonparticulate steroid, anatomic considerations, and use of radiographic guidance are given along with the existing scientific evidence for each clinical consideration.

Conclusion

Adherence to specific recommended practices when performing epidural corticosteroid injections should lead to a reduction in the incidence of neurologic injuries.

### Local therapies for inflammatory eye disease in translation: past, present and future [^ecfa9b82]. BMC Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Periocular therapy for ocular inflammatory disease

The numerous side-effects of oral corticosteroids are well-known and include gastric ulcers, weight gain, psychological disturbances, osteoporosis, diabetes, hypertension and suppression of growth in children. In patients with unilateral or asymmetric disease, or in whom systemic administration of medication is less desirable, e.g. during pregnancy or in patients with a history of gastric ulceration, periocular injection can be useful to provide a depot of corticosteroid that successfully reaches the posterior segment to control inflammation.

Periocular corticosteroids

The precise mechanisms by which locally injected corticosteroids enter the eye are not known, but systemic drug levels remain low, and corticosteroids can be found in all layers of the eye, even at 30 days after a single subtenon injection of 40 mg of triamcinolone acetate, the highest levels being found in the choroid and retinal pigment epithelium. Periocular corticosteroid injections can be administered either via the subtenon route or as an orbital floor injection. Both procedures are safe, with a low risk of ocular penetration and of developing other side-effects of corticosteroid administration such as raised intraocular pressure and cataract. The duration of effect is approximately 2 months.

Other periocular agents

Currently no other non-corticosteroid agents are injected periocularly for the treatment of ocular inflammatory disease.

Intraocular corticosteroid therapy for ocular inflammatory disease

Intravitreal injections are now commonplace in ophthalmology, and are used for the treatment for a variety of ocular inflammatory and medical retinal disorders. The injection of dexamethasone into the vitreous had previously been used as an adjunct to vitrectomy, but it remains in the eye at therapeutic levels for hours only, and thus was superseded by triamcinolone as the intravitreal corticosteroid of choice. Triescence and Trivaris are triamcinolone preparations that are licenced for intraocular use in the US, but neither is available in the Europe, and Kenalog is commonly used off-label instead. However triamcinolone has a considerable side-effect profile in terms of cataract formation and raised intraocular pressure. The injection-related side effects of intravitreal therapy resemble those of any other intraocular injection, and include endophthalmitis, intravitreal haemorrhage, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, although these are rare. Other corticosteroid and non-corticosteroid agents have subsequently been developed, including sustained-release implants.

### Treatment of steroid atrophy with hyaluronic acid filler [^38676c6a]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Intralesional steroids are widely used after dermatologic surgery to treat formation of excess scar tissue. In this context, corticosteroids act by inhibiting collagen I and III synthesis, as well as decreasing fibroblast growth and synthesis of acid mucopolysaccharides; however, this same process can result in cutaneous atrophy. Steroid-induced atrophy is typically self-limited but can take 1 to 2 years to fully resolve, and there are reports of it lasting greater than 5 years. The degree of steroid atrophy depends on the potency and dose of injected corticosteroid, body site (with the face being more prone to steroid atrophy than other sites), and patient age.

There are multiple reported treatments for steroid-induced cutaneous atrophy, including fat grafting, surgical excision, and pulsed-dye laser. Other treatments for steroid atrophy include serial injections of saline, with the goal of pulling steroid crystals back into solution and allowing the body to clear the medication from the affected site. Steroid atrophy will often resolve with time, but patients may be understandably reluctant to wait for spontaneous resolution. There is a single published report of using hyaluronic acid filler to correct defects secondary to steroid atrophy induced in the treatment of a keloid scar. Hyaluronic acid fillers offer a good option for treatment of steroid-induced atrophy because they replace lost volume and pull in significant amounts of water, which can theoretically help clear away steroid crystals more rapidly. Disadvantages to their use include the risk of the Tyndall effect if placed too superficially, which may have a higher likelihood of occurring when atrophic areas are treated. There are also the usual risks associated with hyaluronic acid fillers, which include pain, bruising, and the rare risk of necrosis caused by vascular occlusion. Cost can also limit the use of this treatment.

In summary, steroid atrophy is a common adverse effect of injected corticosteroids. However, dermatologic surgeons frequently inject high concentrations of intralesional steroids to improve postsurgical scarring without adverse effects. There is the risk of intralesional steroid separating from the surgical scar and entering normal tissue, where steroid effects will be unwanted and significant compared with the response in the area of the scar, as occurred in this case. Ways to minimize steroid migration when injecting scars include injecting small amounts of steroid and injecting retrogradely, deep, and under low pressure. To our knowledge, this represents the first report of use of a hyaluronic acid filler to correct steroid atrophy on the face. In this case, the patient noted marked improvement in the appearance of her steroid atrophy after a single treatment with dermal hyaluronic acid filler.

### Aggregation properties of triamcinolone acetonide injection in human serum: considerations when performing epidural steroid injections [^dd2f4c02]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The authors suggest that if triamcinolone is used for ESIs, and if local anesthetic is preferred, that the local anesthetic and triamcinolone be injected separately. In addition, for all cases of triamcinolone, we suggest using digital subtraction whenever available; if not, injecting under live fluoroscopy to define lack of vascular detail is also suggested. We believe that the use of extension tubing should be used at the discretion of the practitioner because tubing has an inherent risk of altering final needle tip position (perhaps into a vessel) because the natural tension in packed, coiled tubing can displace preferred needle location. The use of a blunt needle is recommended whenever available. It is not unreasonable to perform a physiologic test injection with local anesthetic and epinephrine to assess intravascular injection prior to steroid injection. Thoughtful and careful practice should be mandated prior to injecting any particulate steroid.

A limitation of this study was its ex vivo preparation in predicting the in vivo behavior of the steroid–anesthetic solution in serum rather than whole blood. While examining the steroid behavior in blood is scientifically optimal, it hindered clear viewing of the steroid particles upon trial examinations preceding our serum analysis. We do not know why serum had a clumping effect on some steroids but not others; further research is required to understand this better. If the agents that cause steroid aggregation can be identified perhaps a solution can be created to retard, or reverse, this process.

Another limitation was variability of blood pH or osmolality, which may have impacted the steroid particle behavior and was not controlled in this study. Blood was drawn via venipuncture but clinically apparent neurologic sequelae occur as a cause of arterial disruption. We assumed that venous blood would create the same effect to steroid aggregation as arterial blood. Future investigation may warrant the evaluation of arterial blood and steroid aggregation. Lastly, our study was designed to assess triamcinolone aggregation in commonly used mixtures by pain physicians to complement previously studied methylprednisolone and betamethasone, focusing on the particle size as the component of morbidity with the assumption that embolism is the mechanism of devastating neuro-sequelae. However, we recognize that some investigators doubt embolism as the exact mechanism of injury to the brain or spinal cord following spinal injection.

This study was based on the assumption that embolization of particulate steroids used in ESIs was the mechanism by which the observed neurological sequelae occurred. However, we recognize that several other theories exist to explain this phenomenon.

### Novel steroid infiltration technique of the carpal tunnel [^ac9cdc99]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition with an annual incidence of 99/100 000, and a slight female predilection. Recent reports recommend first-line management options such as a trial of splinting or steroid injection directly into the carpal tunnel. Variable techniques such as distal and proximal carpal tunnel infiltration have been considered. A number of anatomical cadaveric studies have attempted to locate the median nerve within the wrist in order to minimise direct trauma to the nerve and adjacent structures. Most practitioners will report occasional difficulty when injecting the wrist with steroid and many will confess to having caused sudden pain by injecting directly into the median nerve.

Ultrasonic localisation nerve prior to infiltration has also been used to identify anatomical variations and swelling within the nerve in the proximal carpal tunnel. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and Royal College of Surgeons guidelinesrecommend splinting at night and a single corticosteroid injection for initial management in the primary care setting. Further management with corticosteroids is not recommended as it may delay surgical decompression. Corticosteroid infiltration is an appropriate treatment modality for high-risk patients (as in our case) and for patients who wish to avoid surgical intervention. Any functional impairment as a result of carpal tunnel syndrome should be managed by a specialist.

We describe a novel technique that allows localisation of the median nerve and infiltration using a blunt cannula to minimise direct trauma to the nerve itself and adjacent structures. To our knowledge, no other case report or study has described this method of carpal tunnel infiltration.

Patient's perspective

I was very happy to have the injection done. I know I'm a slightly higher risk patient due to my blood thinning medication and I'm not comfortable with the thought of surgery. I got good relief from the pins and needles and pain in the hands. It used to cause me pain at night and even since the injection my hands are great. It was painless to go through. If it happens to me again I want to have the same treatment again as surgery is not something I want unless I have no other option.

Learning points

Carpal tunnel infiltration can be performed with this novel technique.
The safety and efficacy profile of this is still being established with case series which are being gathered.
The potential benefit of this technique is infiltration of the carpal tunnel without traumatising the median nerve and causing shooting pain and discomfort to the patient.
In high-risk patients on anticoagulation, steroid infiltration with atraumatic approach may be the most prudent approach.

### Safety and complications of cervical epidural steroid injections [^bc39479c]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Serious neurologic complications following cervical transforaminal epidural steroid injections (CTFESI) and cervical interlaminar epidural steroid injections (CILESI) have been reported. For CILESI, this is caused by aberrant needle placement or space-occupying lesions, such as hematoma or abscess. For CTFESI, this is caused by embolic infarct when inadvertent intra-arterial injection of particulate steroids has occurred. Multiple safety techniques are used to mitigate the risk of these serious complications. The most common adverse events that occur following CTFESI or CILESI are procedural-related pain, steroid side effects, and vasovagal reactions, which are relatively minor and self-limited.

### Lumbar epidural hematoma following interlaminar fluoroscopically guided epidural steroid injection [^3d46193a]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Spinal epidural steroid injections are generally considered a safe, effective treatment for radicular pain in a variety of spinal conditions. Complications secondary to these injections, although rare, can result in devastating neurologic symptoms. Patients with preexisting moderate-to-severe spinal stenosis and recent use of chronic anticoagulation pose a challenging dilemma when making treatment decisions, as a history of both can increase the risk of complications.

Case Report

The following case study provides a description of a patient with spinal stenosis who discontinued anticoagulation therapy according to the recommended guidelines but who experienced a subsequent acute epidural hematoma and significant neurologic injury.

Conclusions

This case report describes the potential risk factors present in this patient. Presence of spinal stenosis and the interlaminar approach seem to be significant risk factors in this case. Presence of an intrinsic coagulopathy was not determined.

### Recurrent painful ecchymosis in an adolescent female [^a2ebd7a2]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Which of the following is an appropriate intervention in the management of this condition?
A. Avoidance of skin biopsy
B. Psychiatric evaluation
C. Autoerythrocyte sensitization skin test
D. Referral for malignancy workup
E. Oral corticosteroids

Answers:
A. Avoidance of skin biopsy – Incorrect. Skin biopsy of ecchymosis will show extravascular erythrocytes and edema in the epidermis or dermis. Histopathologic examination can be useful to help exclude vasculitis.
B. Psychiatric evaluation – Correct. PP can present in patients with an underlying psychiatric disorder. A detailed evaluation should be considered, as this may lead to a psychoemotional diagnosis that may otherwise go untreated. Because there is no confirmatory test, the diagnosis of PP is largely one of exclusion. Medication review and laboratory studies would be appropriate to rule out disorders that could predispose patients to ecchymosis.
C. Autoerythrocyte sensitization skin test – Incorrect. An autoerythrocyte sensitization skin test is positive if an ecchymosis develops at the site of injected autologous erythrocytes. Historically, this test was used for diagnosis of PP; however, its utility is now controversial because of lack of standardization and data on its validity.
D. Referral for malignancy workup – Incorrect. An association between PP and an underlying malignancy has not been reported. Hematologic malignancy may present with ecchymosis; however, prodromal of symptoms and lack of trauma in the area prior to the development of ecchymosis may not be present.
E. Oral corticosteroids – Incorrect. There is no standardized treatment of PP. Glucocorticoids, hormonal contraceptives, and antibiotics are ineffective. Investigators have reported improvement in skin conditions with treatment of the underlying psychiatric disease, if one is present.

Trigger point injections can be conducted based on palpation alone or with ultrasound, which may improve accuracy of injection (Grade C), and clinicians may consider ultrasound guidance for trigger point injections conducted in areas near high-risk tissues or in deeper anatomic locations (Grade C). The addition of corticosteroid to a local anesthetic does not result in increased benefit that outweighs the potential risks (level of certainty: moderate), and the use of local anesthetic alone should be considered for trigger point injections (Grade B).

Moderate certainty is when "the available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the intervention on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate is constrained by such factors", and "the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large enough to alter the conclusion". Low certainty indicates "the available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes".

### Thromboembolic stroke: a rare complication associated with peri-procedural management of an epidural steroid injection [^8168ea33]. Pain Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Little attention has been afforded to the potential adverse sequelae of withholding anticoagulation therapy in a patient after neuraxial interventions.

Objective

Presenting a case of thromboembolic stroke in a patient after holding warfarin for a lumbar epidural steroid injection, previously unreported in published literature. The discussion that follows reviews the guidelines available to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events in anticoagulated patients in the periprocedural period.

Case Report

An 81-year-old female with radicular pain secondary to spinal stenosis had been seen on 5 previous occasions for lumbar epidural steroid injections. Prior to each procedure warfarin was held for 5–7 days with demonstrable reversal of anticoagulation to within the safe limits set for neuraxial techniques by the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine. On the morning following the sixth injection the patient was admitted to the hospital for new onset slurred speech and left-sided hemiparesis. A computed tomography scan established an acute, localized infarct in the distribution of the right middle cerebral artery. Her symptoms were non-reversible and permanent.

Conclusions

Thromboembolism is a potentially devastating complication associated with atrial fibrillation. Twenty percent of thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation are fatal, and greater than 50% result in permanent disability. While thromboembolic events following a brief period of normalization of coagulation for interventions appear rare, so is the incidence of epidural hematomas. Considering the high mortality and permanent rate of disability with thromboembolic events associated with atrial fibrillation, perhaps it is time to balance our focus on the complications of withholding anticoagulation with those of bleeding.

### Triamcinolone acetonide (oralone) [^15a920d0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Press a small dab (about 1/4 inch) to the lesion until a thin film develops. A larger quantity may be required for coverage of some lesions. For optimal results use only enough to coat the lesion with a thin film. Do not rub in. Attempting to spread this preparation may result in granular, gritty sensation and cause it to crumble. After application, however, a smooth, slippery film develops.

The preparation should be applied at bedtime to permit steroid contact with the lesion throughout the night. Depending on the severity of symptoms, it may be necessary to apply the preparation two or three times a day, preferably after meals. If significant repair or regeneration has not occurred in seven days, further investigation is advisable.

### A controlled clinical study on efficacy and safety of periocular triamcinolone acetonide injection for treating ocular myasthenia gravis [^34bdd8d5]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

There are several risk factors that may affect the generalization of OMG, including patient's age of onset, degree of initial symptoms, anti-AChR-Ab positive rate, and thymoma. Among those risk factors, we found that the concentration of anti-AChR-Ab is related to the generalize conversion rate. Our finding is consistent with previous research.

Although complications with periocular injections of steroids are not common, they can still occur, such as globe perforation, arterial occlusion, toxic optic neuropathy, or atrophy of subcutaneous tissue in the face, all of which should be taken seriously. Patients should be closely monitored for any signs of complications, and healthcare providers should follow proper injection techniques to minimize the risk of complications. In this study, the patient's intraocular pressure was stable during the treatment period. There were no other complications, except for intra frame hematoma, indicating that local medication is safer than systemic medication. However, local pain and patient fear caused by injection are important factors that affect patients' long-term adherence to treatment. To this end, it is necessary to provide them with education and support to address any concerns or fears they may have about injections. Sustained-release agents with longer therapeutic durations may also be a viable option for improving patient acceptance of treatment. Ultimately, the choice of treatment should be based on individual patient factors and preferences, as well as careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks of each treatment option.

Conclusion: based on the study's findings, it seems that repeated peribulbar injection of triamcinolone acetonide can be an effective treatment for initial symptoms of ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) and may have the potential to reduce the use of other drugs, thereby minimizing associated side effects. Additionally, it may reduce the risk of secondary generalized myasthenia gravis (GMG) in the long run. However, further research is needed to confirm the long-term efficacy of this treatment and to explore any potential complications associated with long-term local hormone injection.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^6056a0aa]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Microscopic particle assessments of epidural corticosteroid preparations describe distinct size and aggregation profiles across agents and mixtures. Dexamethasone sodium phosphate particle size was "approximately 10 times smaller than red blood cells" and did not aggregate, and even when mixed with "1% lidocaine hydrochloride solution" and contrast, particle size was unchanged. In contrast, triamcinolone acetonide and betamethasone sodium phosphate had variable sizes with some particles larger than red blood cells with evident aggregation, while methylprednisolone acetate injectable suspension had particles larger than red blood cells that were densely packed without aggregation. Mixing clonidine with equal parts of dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection, triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension, or betamethasone sodium phosphate and betamethasone acetate injectable suspension did not increase clumping or particle size; dexamethasone 4 mg/mL solution had no measurable particles with no apparent aggregation. Triamcinolone 40 mg/mL solution contained particles measuring 2.3 μm to 200 μm with extensive aggregation, and betamethasone 6 mg/mL solution formed extensive aggregates with particles measured from 1.5 to 7.5 μm.

### Injectable corticosteroids in modern practice [^e99c2009]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2005). Low credibility.

Long-lasting, crystalline suspensions of injectable corticosteroids have been used to treat joint and soft-tissue disorders for many years; they decrease inflammation by reducing local infiltration of inflammatory cells and mediators. Depot formulations differ in their characteristics. Compounds with low solubility are thought to have the longest duration of action but may cause tissue atrophy when used in soft tissues. Intra-articular corticosteroids are commonly used to treat osteoarthritis and inflammatory arthritis: meta-analyses confirm their benefit in reducing pain and symptoms. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections have been shown to be safe and effective for repeated use (every 3 months) for up to 2 years, with no joint space narrowing detected. Fewer clinical trials are available for extra-articular uses for injectable corticosteroids, although there is evidence of efficacy in a variety of soft-tissue conditions. The accuracy of injections affects outcomes. Postinjection flare, facial flushing, and skin and fat atrophy are the most common side effects. Systemic complications of injectable corticosteroids are rare.

### Epidural steroid injections [^40cf949a]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Epidural steroid injections (ESI) can be an effective treatment of radicular pain, while also providing potential for functional improvement. There are 3 main interventional approaches including: interlaminar (IL), transforaminal (TF), and caudal. The risks and efficacy data vary between these routes of injection and the underlying pathology with the TF route having the most robust efficacy data. However, selecting an injection approach should be based on a patient's clinical presentation, pathology, anatomy, consideration of the natural course of pain, and the unique risks and benefits of the particular technique.

### Reassessing the management of treatment-induced brain necrosis in metastatic patients: advancing surgical alternatives to steroid therapy [^a4956704]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Although upfront surgical resection is highly underused and the current time, there are many potential consequences that must be considered given that less invasive methods of treatment exist as discussed above. Most notably, a counterpoint to early surgical intervention for treatment necrosis is the potential for postoperative morbidity, and that the treatment necrosis may self-resolve. In addition, many patients at the time of treatment necrosis presentation may not be fit for surgery. However, modern neurosurgical techniques, minimally invasive surgeries, and improved imaging and guidance have made these inflammatory lesions more amenable to earlier surgical resection with fewer risks. Surgical resection offers the potential for significant steroid reduction, enabling some patients to decrease their steroid use by up to two-thirds, thereby mitigating the side effects associated with prolonged steroid therapy. Decreased steroid use may enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapies in select cases. Importantly, patients may experience faster symptom relief from the debulking of symptomatic treatment necrosis. Another key advantage of surgical debulking is that it yields vital tissue to inform subsequent treatment decisions and to help define the overall effectiveness of experimental therapeutics where response assessment is challenging with contemporary diagnostic imaging. An important point to consider is the threshold for resection of the necrotic lesion. Many patients with treatment necrosis can have a relatively small, asymptomatic necrotic lesions that often resolve without treatment. Therefore, we suggest upfront surgical resection for those lesions that are symptomatic, may become symptomatic, and/or are classically treated with prolonged steroid therapy.

### Extra-articular steroid injection: early patient response and the incidence of flare reaction [^3a3f3562]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the timing of improvement after extra-articular steroid injection, the incidence of a postinjection pain flare (a delayed postinjection transient increase in pain), and the role of the injection acidity in the postinjection flare.

Methods

One hundred twenty-five patients with trigger finger (88 patients) or de Quervain's tenosynovitis (37 patients) were prospectively randomized in this double-blind study to receive either an injection of steroid, lidocaine, and bupivacaine alone (standard injection, acidic pH) or an injection of steroid, lidocaine, bupivacaine, and bicarbonate (balanced injection, neutral pH). All patients completed a visual analog scale for pain before and immediately after the injection, daily for 7 days, and then again at 6 weeks. A flare reaction was defined as an increase in the visual analog scale score by 2 or more points any time after the injection.

Results

All patients immediately responded to the steroid injection, but pain rebounded to preinjection levels by day 1. In both groups the pain then gradually declined over the course of 7 days. In the balanced group, 23 of the 68 patients had flare reactions. In the standard group, 18 of the 57 patients had flare reactions. The difference between groups was not significant.

Conclusions

Patients respond to extra-articular steroid injections with gradual improvement over the course of the first week. An increase in pain, or flare reaction, in the days following a steroid injection was noted in 33% of patients. A pH-balanced injection did not significantly decrease the risk of a flare reaction.

### Subconjunctival mycetoma after sub-tenon's corticosteroid injection [^8cd591f4]. Cornea (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe a case of a subconjunctival mycetoma that developed after a patient received a sub-Tenon's injection of triamcinolone acetonide.

Methods

Case report.

Results

A 76-year-old white male presented with a subconjunctival mass in the area of a previous posterior sub-Tenon's corticosteroid injection for wet age-related macular degeneration. Microbiologic and pathologic analysis of the mass revealed the causative organism to be the pigmented fungus Exophiala jeanselmei.

Conclusion

This is the first published case of an Exophiala-associated subconjunctival mycetoma.
