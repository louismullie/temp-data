## Question

What property does a triangle have if the following relationship holds between two of its sides and the angle bisector of the third side:

[1/a] + [1/b] = [1/f_c]

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what property a triangle has if the relationship 1/a + 1/b = 1/f_c holds, where a and b are two sides and f_c is the length of the angle bisector of the third side. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard angle bisector length formula and how it relates the sides and the bisector. Then, I should substitute the given condition into that formula and simplify the algebra. Next, I will interpret the resulting equation geometrically to see what triangle property it implies. Finally, I will verify the logic and state the conclusion clearly, making sure I haven't missed any special cases or constraints.

> Let me first confirm the angle bisector length formula so I don't jump to conclusions. For a triangle with sides a, b, and c, the length of the angle bisector from vertex C to side c is given by f_c = [2ab/(a + b)] cos(C/2), where C is the angle opposite side c. This is the standard trigonometric expression for the internal angle bisector length in terms of the adjacent sides and the half-angle at the vertex [^notfound].

> Now, I need to substitute the given condition 1/a + 1/b = 1/f_c into the bisector formula. Wait, let me verify the algebra before proceeding. The left side simplifies to (a + b)/(ab), so the condition becomes (a + b)/(ab) = 1/f_c, which implies f_c = ab/(a + b). Setting this equal to the bisector formula, I get ab/(a + b) = (2ab cos(C/2))/(a + b). I can cancel ab/(a + b) from both sides, provided a and b are nonzero, which they must be as triangle side lengths, so this leaves 1 = 2 cos(C/2), or cos(C/2) = 1/2 [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the trigonometric implication carefully. If cos(C/2) = 1/2, then C/2 = 60°, which means C = 120°. Let me double-check that this is the only acute solution in the relevant range; yes, within 0° < C/2 < 90°, the unique solution is C/2 = 60°, so C = 120°. Therefore, the angle opposite the side whose bisector is f_c must be 120 degrees [^notfound].

> I will now examine what this means geometrically. The given relationship 1/a + 1/b = 1/f_c forces the angle between sides a and b to be 120°, so the triangle must contain a 120° angle. Let me consider whether this constrains the triangle type beyond that; it does not by itself force the triangle to be isosceles or equilateral, only that one angle is 120°. So the property is that the triangle is obtuse with a 120° angle at the vertex where the bisector is drawn, i.e., the vertex opposite the side labeled c in the bisector formula [^notfound].

> But wait, what if I made an algebraic misstep? Let me reconsider the cancellation step. I canceled ab/(a + b) from both sides; since a, b > 0 in a triangle, ab/(a + b) is never zero, so the cancellation is valid and the derivation stands. I should also confirm that the bisector formula I used is indeed the internal angle bisector and not an external one; yes, the expression f_c = (2ab cos(C/2))/(a + b) is the internal bisector length, which matches the context of the problem [^notfound].

> Final answer: The triangle has a 120° angle at the vertex where the angle bisector f_c is drawn. In other words, the angle between sides a and b is 120 degrees [^notfound].

---

The given relation ([1/a] + [1/b] = [1/f_c]) implies that the **angle opposite side (c) is 120°**. This follows from the angle bisector length formula (f_c = [2ab/(a + b)] cos(C/2)), which, when combined with the given relation, yields (cos(C/2) = 1/2), so (C = 120°). Therefore, the triangle has a **120° angle** at the vertex opposite side (c).

---

## Derivation

Start with the **angle bisector length formula** for side (c):

f_c = [2ab/(a + b)] cos(C/2)

where (C) is the angle opposite side (c).

Substitute the given relation ([1/a] + [1/b] = [1/f_c]) into the formula:

[1/f_c] = [(a + b)/ab]

f_c = [ab/(a + b)]

Now equate the two expressions for (f_c):

[ab/(a + b)] = [2ab/(a + b)] cos(C/2)

Cancel ([ab/(a + b)]) from both sides (since (a, b > 0)):

1 = 2 cos(C/2)

cos(C/2) = [1/2]

Solve for C:

C/2 = 60°

C = 120°

---

## Geometric interpretation

The relation ([1/a] + [1/b] = [1/f_c]) is a **specific condition** that forces the angle opposite side (c) to be 120°. This is a special case of the general angle bisector formula and does not generally hold for arbitrary triangles. It reflects a unique balance between the lengths of sides (a) and (b) and the length of the angle bisector (f_c).

---

## Conclusion

The triangle has a **120° angle** at the vertex opposite side (c). This is the unique property implied by the given relation between the two sides and the angle bisector of the third side.

### Experimental nonclassicality in a causal network without assuming freedom of choice [^e83d6c77]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Violation of a causal compatibility inequality

In order to demonstrate the nonclassicality of the experimental data relative to the triangle causal network, we seek to identify some causal inequalities, which must be satisfied by all distributions compatible with the classical triangle network but which are violated by our experimental statistics. To this end, we turn to the inflation technique for causal inference introduced in ref.

As detailed in the Methods, the inflation technique relates compatibility with a given causal structure to feasibility of a linear program (LP). If the LP related to an inflation of(see Fig. 5 (a)) is found to be infeasible, then evidently p is incompatible with. In our case, is taken to be the classical triangle scenario causal structure depicted in Fig. 1 (b).

Inflation technique for the triangle network.

a The second order inflation graph of the triangle network. Such an inflation doubles the number of latent variables relative to the triangle scenario, having six latent variables. The inflation quadruples the number of observable random variables of the triangle scenario, having twelve observable random variables { a (1), b (1), c (1), a (2), b (2), c (2), a (3), b (3), c (3), a (4), b (4), c (4) }. Distributions compatible with this inflated structure satisfy symmetry properties, and have marginals corresponding to products of triangle-compatible distribution. This can be exploited to derive suitable causal compatibility inequalities that are violated by the experimental data. b This plot depicts the 64 × 64 coefficientsfor a quadratic inequality of the form of Eq.

### Feasibility and coexistence of large ecological communities [^02d41162]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Shape of the feasibility domain

So far, we have focused on the volume of the parameter space resulting in feasiblity. However, two systems having the same Ξ can still have very different responses to parameter perturbations, just as two triangles having the same area need not to have sides of the same length (Fig. 1). The two extreme cases correspond to (a) an isotropic system in which if we start at the barycentre of the feasibility domain, moving in any direction yields roughly the same effect (equivalent to an equilateral triangle); (b) anisotropic systems, in which the feasibility domain is much narrower in certain directions than in others (as in a scalene triangle). For our problem, the domain of growth rates leading to coexistence is — once the growth rates are normalized — the (S −1)-dimensional generalization of a triangle on a hypersphere. For S = 3, this domain is indeed a triangle lying on a sphere as shown in Fig. 1. If all the S (S −1)/2 sides of this (hyper-)triangle are about the same length, then different perturbations will have similar effects on the system. On the other hand, if some sides are much shorter than others, then there will be changes of conditions which will more likely have an impact on coexistence than others. We therefore consider a measure of the heterogeneity in the distribution of the side lengths (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Note 10). The larger the variance of this distribution, the more likely it is that certain perturbations can destroy coexistence, even when Ξ is large and the perturbation small. This way of measuring heterogeneity is particularly convenient because it is independent of the initial conditions. Moreover, the length of each side can be directly related to the similarity between the corresponding pair of species (Supplementary Note 10), drawing a strong connection between the parameter space allowing for coexistence and the phenotypic space. As in the case of Ξ, this measure is a function of the interaction matrix and corresponds to a geometrical property of the coexistence domain.

Results

Geometry of the triangulated cylindrical origami

The TCO consists of repeating triangular arrays, which are characterized by valley crease lines (length a) and mountain crease lines (length b) as shown in Fig. 1b. Top and bottom surfaces of the TCO unit cell are n -sided polygons (e.g. n = 5 in Fig. 1) with side length c. Since the TCO is not a rigid foldable origami, folding/unfolding motions cause the warping of each facet, which may result in surface fatigue and damage under repeated usage. To overcome this issue while preserving the key characteristics of the TCO, we replace its surfaces with purely elastic truss members, which support tension/compression by using linear springs (Fig. 1c; Supplementary Movie 1 for the comparison between the paper- and truss-based TCO models). If we assume that the top and bottom surfaces always share the same rotational axis during folding/unfolding, we can characterize the shape of the unit cell by defining its height (h), relative angle between the top and bottom polygons (θ), and radius of the circle circumscribing the polygon (R). Note that for the sake of mathematical simplicity, θ is defined as an angle between OB and the perpendicular bisector of A a A b as shown in the top view of Fig. 1c. Letting h 0 and θ 0 be the initial height and relative angle respectively, we can express deformations of the structure by axial displacement u = −(h − h 0) where compression is defined to be positive, and rotational angle φ = θ − θ 0 (see Materials and Methods, and Supplementary Note 1 for more details on the modeling of the TCO).

### Increased tortuosity of basilar artery might be associated with higher risk of aneurysm development [^b21fb957]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The fourth is triangular index (TI), for which the curve is again divided into equal subcurves. Then, a triangle is built with vertices on each end of the subcurve and in its middle point. TI is defined as:where n is the number of subcurves, a and b are sides of triangles and c is its base. The last of the tortuosity descriptors is the inflexion count metrics (ICM), defined as:where n I represents the number of the curve's inflexion points. All used tortuosity descriptors are all presented in Fig. 1.

Additional measurements

We additionally measured diameters of both P1 segments of posterior cerebral arteries (PCAs) and diameters of both vertebral arteries (VAs) at a distance of 5 mm from the origin of BA. We also measured the diameter of BA in three locations: 2 mm from its origin, 2 mm before its bifurcation and halfway between those two locations. Additionally, we obtained the angle of BA bifurcation and its configuration, introduced by Rashad et al including hands-up, hands-neutral and hands-down configurations, as well as its mixed variants (hands-up/hands-neutral, hands-up/hands-down, hands-neutral/hands-down). Among patients with BA aneurysm, we measured aneurysm dome height and width, as well as its neck size. We also calculated dome-to-neck ratio, defined as aneurysm dome height/neck size.

### Invariance properties of bacterial random walks in complex structures [^031312fd]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The effect of size and shape

We have demonstrated that, for a fixed shape, the density of obstacles has a strong effect on the distribution of path lengths while leaving the mean value unchanged as long as the total internal accessible area remains the same.

We will now investigate the effects of shape and size on the path length distributions and again conclude that, although path distributions are very sensitive to the detailed geometry of the domain, mean path lengths and residence times can be accurately predicted using only the surface to perimeter ratio. We fabricate microstructures of circular, squared and triangular shapes all in four different sizes as shown in Fig. 2a. In all structures the obstacle density is fixed to N / S = 0.016 μm −2. All recorded trajectories are also plotted in Fig. 2a with a color map encoding the scaled path length L /. In Fig. 2b we plot for each structure the histogram of path lengths normalized by the expected valuein Eq. 4. As we move from circles to squares and then to triangles we observe that the corresponding histograms are characterized by larger frequencies for both short and long path lengths. The probability of short paths increases as we introduce convex corners and reduce their angle, as evidenced by the blue-violet color of the corners in squared and triangular structures. The presence of longer paths in triangles can be also understood noting that the normalized maximum straight paths for circles, square and triangles are respectively 4/ π,/ π and/ π (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Despite these qualitative and quantitative differences between histograms, mean path lengths are always close to 1 when normalized by the predicted valueas shown in Fig. 2b. The observed path length distributions can be very well reproduced by a Lorentz gas model where collisions with obstacles are described as instantaneous reorientation events. These events are assumed to occur with a constant probability per unit path length given by, where/ π is the rotational average cross section of line obstacles with length b (see Methods). For perfectly straight trajectories, circles and squares have path length distributions with a vertical asymptote. A strong peak is found at the location of this divergence and is progressively smeared as the linear size of the domain becomes larger than the mean free path. Upon increasing the size of the region a peak aroundappears due to bacteria that scatter close to the boundary, reorient and exit. The mix of these two types of trajectories gives rise to the observed double-peak structure. Differently for the triangle no asymptote is present in the P (L) for large λ, therefore only a peak atprogressively appears. These results show that P (L) depends strongly on the random walk properties (as the mean free path), and on the domain features (shape and size). Differently the mean valuesanddepend only on the surface to perimeter ratio of the domain as expressed by Eq. 4. Experimental values ofare shown Fig. 3a for all shapes and sizes. We find an excellent agreement with theory using the same value s = 6.3 μm 2 that was used previously to predict the experimental values ofas a function of the number of obstacles (see Fig. 1c). This value of s has also been used to calculateaccording to Eq. 5 which captures quantitatively well the experimental data as shown in Fig. 3b.

### The size of the Y: the multiple Y-V plasty revisited [^b5cbc27b]. Burns (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The multiple Y-V plasty is often used in the release of burn scar contracture bands. Although there are established views regarding its design, no attempts have yet been made to describe the mathematical principles upon which it is based. An understanding of the mathematics, however, should incur a greater ability to "fine tune" or "tailor" the outcome.

Method

Our standard method of design and execution is presented, and the mathematical properties underlying the technique are elucidated, using a simple trigonometric model.

Results

In a Euclidian plane, the equation describing the gain in length for a rectangular scar or contracture of length l and width a, to which the technique of multiple Y-V plasty has been applied, can be simplified to lx/a, where x is the only variable and represents the distance by which the component triangular V-shaped flaps have been advanced relative to one another.

Conclusion

This equation illustrates that (a) neither the angles of the Ys nor the number of triangles in the design play a role in the ultimate length gained and (b) the distance of advancement of the individual triangular flaps is the sole determinant of final length.

### Trigonometry in daily ultrasound practice [^c806ac21]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

We have read with interest the editorial by Piton et al. regarding application of Pythagoras' theorem in central venous cannulation. Geometry is at the base of our daily life and we should apply his theorems and axioms to obtain the best result in our daily practice.

We believe that trigonometry is another important branch of geometry in addition to Pythagoras' theorem that has to be taken into consideration while performing invasive procedures under ultrasound guidance. Sine, cosine and tangent are the basis of trigonometry, they represent the ratio between the sides of a right-angled triangle. Sin(α) is the ratio between side B and the hypotenuse (H) (Fig. 1), Cos(α) is the ratio between side A and the hypotenuse (H), and Tan(α) is the ratio between side B and side A. It is important to note that, for a given angle α, the ratio between the sides is unconnected from the triangle size.

Fig. 1
Internal jugular vein ultrasound anatomy. H hypotenuse; A and B are catheti of the triangle

As already stated by Piton, in our ultrasound daily practice, we constantly build right-angled triangles: the hypotenuse is the needle route, side A is the distance measured on the skin between needle insertion point and target projection on the skin, and side B is the depth of the target.

Side B is determined by the patient's anatomy and the operator cannot modify it. As reported by Schulman et al. needle/skin angulation between 30° and 45° is considered to be ideal while performing ultrasound procedure.

Trigonometry is helpful in determining which targets can be reached with such needle angulation. At 45° angulation tan(α) is equal to 1, meaning that side A and side B have to be equal. For example, if our target jugular internal vein is 2 cm deep, the needle has to be inserted 2 cm from the target. Generalizing, we have a good needle visualization whenever Tan(α) ≤ 1 with side B equal to or shorter than side A.

In conclusion, physicians have to take into account target depth while choosing the ultrasound linear probe of appropriate size to be able to visualize all needle routes and the needle skin entrance site.

### Strong coronal channelling and interplanetary evolution of a solar storm up to earth and mars [^14773ca0]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Visualizing a self-similar propagating ellipse

Figure 5a shows the geometry of an ellipse under the assumptions described above. The R (t) of the ellipse apex (the point of the ellipse farthest from the Sun along the ellipse central direction) is given by DBM. In this section, we derive equations for the ellipse semi-major axis a and semi-minor axis b as a function of R (t), the inverse aspect ratio f and the half width λ. We use f = b/a rather than a r = a/b because it simplifies the following calculation. The equations

follow from the definition of f and the definition of angle β, which is the angle between the semi-major axis a and the normal to the tangent at point T (Fig. 5a). The location of T is the point of tangency on the ellipse for a line originating at the Sun. It can be easily seen that β = λ by checking the sum of the angles of the small orange triangle in Fig. 5a in relation to a larger triangle (not highlighted) containing the angles λ and η. The polar angle of the ellipse θ is given by a relationship from general ellipse geometry between β and θ. It is important to emphasize that we further construct the ellipse based on this particular value of θ, for which a line with distance r connects the ellipse center C to point T. Combining equation (2) gives a relationship for the polar angle θ based on known parameters,

From the law of sines on the large orange-shaded triangle in Fig. 5a we derive:

Angle α follows from the angles of the orange-shaded triangle, and distance r from the definition of an ellipse in polar coordinates:

The last equation can be rewritten with the definition of f as

Introducing α from equation (5) and the last equation for r into equation (4) then eliminates the unknowns (α, r) and expresses b in function of known variables:

Equations (7) are the final description of the ellipse parameters. The minor axis b of the ellipse depends on all known variables (R (t), f, λ) through θ and ω, from equations (3) and (6). The major axis a then simply follows from the definition of f in equations (2). The heliocentric distance of the centre of the ellipse is parameter c (Fig. 5b), closing the model equations necessary for visualizing the ellipse.

### The representation of geometric cues in infancy [^3bf27a75]. Infancy (2008). Low credibility.

There is evidence that, from an early age, humans are sensitive to spatial information such as simple landmarks and the size of objects. This study concerns the ability to represent a particular kind of spatial information, namely, the geometry of an enclosed layout-an ability present in older children, adults, and nonhuman animals (e.g. Cheng, 1986; Hermer & Spelke, 1996). Using a looking-time procedure, 4.5- to 6.5-month-olds were tested on whether they could distinguish among the corners of an isosceles triangle. On each trial, the target corner was marked by a red dot. The stimulus (triangle with dot) appeared from different orientations across trials, ensuring that only cues related to the triangle itself could be used to differentiate the corners. When orientations were highly variable, infants discriminated the unique corner (i.e., the corner with the smaller angle and two equal-length sides) from a nonunique corner; they could not discriminate between the two nonunique corners. With less variable orientations, however, infants did discriminate between the nonunique corners of the isosceles triangle. Implications for how infants represent geometric cues are discussed.

### Theory of branching morphogenesis by local interactions and global guidance [^9246d0a7]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Such extrinsic guidance provides a simple theoretical mechanism to restrict neuronal growth to a domain characterized by a well-defined opening angle. Turning to experiments, we found that reconstructed neurons were typically also characterized by such angle, which we estimated as. Theoretically, the average opening anglesdecreased monotonically with increasing field strength f c (see Fig. 4 a for an illustration) with strikingly similar values both in the presence and absence of self-repulsion (see Fig. 4 b). Using a simple geometric argument -assuming in particular that this opening angle is determined by the changes in the angle to origin θ values of the active tips at the boundary of the branching network, we could approximate this angle by:whereis the radial distance of the furthermost branch from the origin of the network (fixed by the maximal time of network growth). With this approximation, we could fit the numerical data by using a single fit parameter χ (see Supplementary Note 2 for further details). From the fitted value of the external field f c = 0.6, we predict an opening angle of(mean ± SD). Although this overestimates the experimental value, we note that this prediction is based on a perfectly radial gradient in 360 ∘ without boundary, i.e. assuming neurons can branch backwards. When we confined the theory to a 180 ∘ hemispherical region, which seems to reflect the experimental geometries (Supplementary Fig. 11), we obtained average opening angles of, much closer to the data.

The strength of extrinsic guidance determines the territory of the branched structures in simulations, with minimal influence from local self-avoidance.

### Increased tortuosity of ACA might be associated with increased risk of ACoA aneurysm development and less aneurysm dome size: a computer-aided analysis [^f3471392]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sum of angle metrics

Calculation of SOAM begins from the division of curve into the subcurves of equal length. Then, for each subcurve, we calculate supplementary of the angle between lines connecting its center and ends. Angles are summed up and the result is normalized by the length of the entire curve:where φ indicates measured angles and n is its count. For a curve that is straighter, supplementary angles are larger and therefore the entire SOAM is larger. This descriptor is also sensitive to local tortuosity (Fig. 2 b).

Product of angle distance

The PAD is calculated using the below formula:

This descriptor defines global tortuosity which is the combination of deviation from the straight line given by RL and local angles metrics, which is given by the SOAM.

Triangular index

To calculate TI, the curve must be again divided into equal subcurves. Then, a triangle is built with vertices on each end of the subcurve and in its middle point. TI is calculated using the below formula:where n is the number of subcurves, a and b are the triangle sides, and c is its base. TI is smaller for more straight curves (Fig. 2 c).

Inflection count metrics

Inflection point is a point on a curve where it changes from being concave to being convex, or vice versa. ICM is defined with below formula:where n I is the number of curve's inflection points. That factor is more sensitive to global curvature than RL and is lower for more straight curves (Fig. 2 d).

Additional measurements

For each analyzed segment of ACA, we measured its diameter, which was defined as the shortest distance between the artery edge points in the selected region. In a similar way, we measured the diameter of C7 segment of ICA. We also obtained the length of A1–A3 ACA segments.

### Sagittal cephalometric evaluation without point nasion: sagittal G-triangle analysis [^ff16f411]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The second highlight of sagittal G-triangle analysis is that based on the Bo–X line, an equilateral triangle framework is constructed. In this framework, its 3 sides (Bo–X, X–K, and K–Bo) and 3 altitudes are of equal importance in reference as the Bo–X line. For example, in the sagittal G-triangle analysis, angle AXK has an equal role as angle AXBo in determining the maxilla position, but angle AXK has a much smaller absolute value. With this equilateral triangle framework as reference, any target line in the cephalometric film could find its nearest neighboring reference line among the 6 lines in the G-triangle framework (3 sides and 3 altitudes). All the measuring results in the G-triangle analysis are between −15° and 15°, a number range much easier for measuring and memory.

The third highlight of the sagittal G-triangle analysis is that the X–K side of the G-triangle could be used as a guided goal line for the sagittal evaluation. Based on the statistical analysis, our study revealed that both angles AXK and BXK have a normal range of approximately 0°. In an ideal case, as point B in the mandible is a bit posterior to point A in the maxilla in the sagittal direction, the conventional cephalometric measurements of points A and B have little difference. For example, in Steiner's analysis, the normal value of SNA is 82° and that of SNB is 80°. However, in the sagittal G-triangle analysis, the reference X–K line is sloping at a certain angle, so angles AXK and BXK have almost the same normal range. According to the position of points A and B to the X–K line, an easy sagittal evaluation could be deduced. The intermaxillary relationship of the maxilla and mandible could also be evaluated. Because sagittal G-triangle analysis provides a more precise reliable parameter for the assessment of the sagittal jaw relationship according to the harmonious facial profile, it can be a valuable tool when planning maxillofacial surgery for patients with sagittal skeletal deformities.

### Medial packing and elastic asymmetry stabilize the double-gyroid in block copolymers [^8119125e]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Methods

Medial strong segregation theory for double gyroid

The medial strong segregation theory calculation optimizes the SST free energy, Supplementary Eq. (11), over the variational family of generating gyroidal surfaces to determine and analyze thermodynamically preferred DG chain packing. Complete details on the construction of tessellating chain configurations and the variational algorithm are given in Supplementary Note 3–4.

We begin with a broad set of generating surfaces G withsymmetry; here we have chosen G as level sets of a three Fourier-mode expansion of the gyroid symmetry. From the medial map of G (for the double network) we generate the terminal boundaries of both domains, T A and T B, referring to the tubular and matrix domains respectively. The induced map between T A and T B approximates the mean trajectories of domain-spanning chains, which occupy local volumes approximated by triangular prismatic wedges, thus providing a complete tessellation of the DG structure. The location of the IMDS is then determined along each trajectory according to the constraints of volume balance and chain composition, resulting in mutually compatible terminal boundaries, IMDS, and trajectories, as shown in Fig. 2 b, from which we compute the geometric contribution to the free energy in Eq. (1). Notably, local volume balance generally requires some measure of tilt between trajectories and the IMDS, such that the terminal surfaces of the ultimate volume-balanced packing deviate at least slightly from the medial surfaces of the final IMDS. As shown in Fig. 2 c, variation of the generating surface leads to variation in compatible IMDS shapes and variable spreading of the terminal boundaries for fixed block composition f, which we then optimize over (see Supplementary Note 4).

Skeletal strong segregation theory ansatz for double gyroid

We employ a variant of the medial SST approach to model the DG assemblies whose terminal sets are constrained to lie along the skeletal graphs of the double network, in a effort to closely recapitulate and compare to prior results from ref. Complete details are provided in Supplementary Note 5. In brief, we construct a variational set of skeletal tessellations via projection of the terminal positions in the tubular domains from the "web-like" medial surfaces of double-gyroids to the nearby positions along the skeletal graph. Finally, we optimize the free energy over the free parameters of the map that takes points on the tubular domain medial surface to points on the skeletal graph.

During the synthesis of Tri18, we observed a few faint, low molecular weight bands on SDS–PAGE gels (Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 3) after purification with affinity chromatography and, to a lesser extent, after further purification by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Supplementary Table 3). To identify whether these were unreacted intermediates or side-products, these low molecular weight species were isolated by SEC and further analyzed by SDS–PAGE and STEM (Supplementary Fig. 2). These species were identified as monomeric, dimeric, and uncyclized trimeric 3HB structures based on their relative SDS–PAGE gel migration rates (i.e. molecular weights; Supplementary Fig. 2b) and STEM images (Supplementary Fig. 2c). The SEC-isolated monomeric 3HB had an apparent molecular weight ~15 kDa smaller than the unreacted, SI-flanked 3HB building blocks (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2b), suggesting the loss of both SI domains. This result is in agreement with previous reports of SI side reactions, in which Int C and/or Int N groups are cleaved off the proteins prior to normal SI ligation. Cleavage of SI domains without ligation could occur at several stages during the multi-step ligation reaction, generating monomers, dimers, or uncyclized trimers that can no longer react. Meanwhile, we also observed unreacted monomer, which can be explained by previously reported ligation yields of the SIs used (85–95%). Further engineering of SIs to improve SI ligation yield could improve the overall yield of triangular nanostructures.

### A three-dimensional actuated origami-inspired transformable metamaterial with multiple degrees of freedom [^8310cfb1]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Results

Characterization of the unit cell

We construct a unit cell by extruding the edges of a cube in the direction normal to each face (Fig. 2a). This results in a 3D structure with 24 faces connected by 36 edges of length L. If, as in the simplified model of rigid origami, we assume that the faces are rigid and the structure can only fold along the edges, such a unit has three degrees of freedom identified by the angles γ 1, γ 2 and γ 3 (Fig. 2a). Changing these three angles deforms the internal cube into a rhombohedron (a 3D geometry formed from six rhombi) and, more importantly, reconfigures the unit cell into many specific shapes. To describe them, we introduce the vectors p 1, p 2 and p 3, which span the internal rhombohedron (Fig. 2a)

where δ = [cos(γ 1)−cos(γ 2) cos(γ 3)]/sin(γ 3). It is important to note that, because of contact occurring between faces, not all combinations of γ 1, γ 2 and γ 3 are possible. All possible combinations of the three angles can be found by requiring the third component of p 3 to be real valued,

We first rewrite equation (4) as

and then solve it for γ 3 to obtain

where we have used 0 ≤ γ 1, γ 2, γ 3 ≤ π. Note that equation (6) defines a regular tetrahedron with vertices located at (γ 1, γ 2, γ 3) = (0, 0, 0), (π, π, 0), (π, 0, π) and (0, π, π) (Fig. 2b). Therefore, only the combinations of angles contained within this domain are attainable.

### Increased tortuosity of ACA might be associated with increased risk of ACoA aneurysm development and less aneurysm dome size: a computer-aided analysis [^589a48c2]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

ACA tracking

We analyzed A1, A2, and A3 segments of the ACA. In the first step, starting and ending point of the tracking were manually selected. Then, their nearest edge points were identified. Searching for other points was performed stepwise along the vessel axis: in the n th step, semi-ellipse shape-searching region was defined with center O n, major axis length a n, minor and axis length b n, and a direction vector. O n was defined as the midpoint between previously found edge points, was defined as, and ellipse axes were calculated with the given formulas:where d n is the distance between two previously selected points and θ n is the angle betweenand. Finding of more or less than two edge points in the n th step was treated as vessel crossing or branching, and points located in that step were not taken into consideration. Curve-connecting midpoints between each pair of edge points, representing the ACA course, were used for further analysis (Fig. 1).

Relative length

The first of used tortuosity descriptors is RL, calculated with the given formula:where l c is the curve length and l is the length of the straight line between the start and end points of the curve. RL is lower for curves which are more deviated from straightness (Fig. 2 a).

### Degenerate boundaries for multiple-alternative decisions [^996fe0bf]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The general decision threshold parameterization is thenwhereTaking the product of all components of P (t) j accomplishes two things. Firstly, it reduces threshold dimensionality by one, collapsing the decision space to the number of alternatives with non-zero belief. For example, for n = 4, if one alternative has a zero probability, the decision space and thresholds collapse to the n = 3 case (the planes shown in Fig. 1), constraining how the decision boundaries intersect with the outer faces. Secondly, it introduces the simplest form of nonlinearity, as the product of all elements P (t) j parameterizes curved boundaries.

Overall, the functionmodulates the curve parameterized by the product of posterior probabilities. The variableis the maximum absolute difference between the components of the vector P (t) j, which with the addition of a parameter β allows a range of boundary shapes, such as those in equations (15–18) below. Summing these components over all subspaces generalizes (14) to n -choices, for which it is normalized by the number of 3D subspaces using the multiplier.

The general parameterization, equation (14), has three parameters: θ is the intersection of the boundary with the edges in posterior probability space, because if there are only two choices with non-zero belief values, then the right-hand side of equation (14) is zero leaving F = θ; α directly tunes the amplitude of the function f or of the curve if f = 1; and β is a free parameter whose purpose depends on the function f. Clearly, we could include additional parameters, but consider only these three for tractability.

There is no prevailing method for learning arbitrary functions with stochastic rewards, so we use the general form given by equation (14) and a range of functions f over which to explore the optimality of nonlinear higher-dimensional decision boundaries. The considered functions are:Examples are shown in Fig. 2. The constant-valued boundaries are dashed in all subsequent examples for comparison. Note that setting α = 0 or β = 0 for any of (16–18) recovers the flat case (15).

### Theory of branching morphogenesis by local interactions and global guidance [^34973bae]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Comparison between analytical model and simulations

Importantly, Eq. (1) describing the probability of branch orientation attains a steady-state solution (∂ t P st (ψ, t) = 0) that is largely independent of the form of the external field, i.e. it applies generically to different geometries after defining the relative branch alignment with respect to the external field. This solution predicts that the alignment of angles with respect to the polarity of the external field will be determined by the von Mises distribution (circular normal distribution):with a concentration parameter given by ν ≡ μ f c / D, and I 0 (ν) is the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order zero. The fluctuations in the angular alignment as determined by the variance will thus follow a universal scaling approximately given by σ 2 ∝ D / μ f c that underlines the relative contribution of the local noise to the external guidance. For an axial (linear) field parallel to the horizontal axis, for instance, the above solution applies to the distribution of the local angles φ of the branch segments (Fig. 1 d). In a radial external field emerging from a central point of origin, however, the alignment of a branch is determined by the angle difference ψ ≡ φ − θ between its local angle φ and its angle θ with respect to the origin of the external field, and thus ψ, rather than φ, is predicted to follow the von Mises distribution (see Supplementary Figs. 4–9 for the alignment angles for different model assumptions). Comparing these analytical criteria with the numerical simulations led to excellent agreement without using any fit parameter (Fig. 1 d–f).

To summarize, the combination of analytical modelling and numerical simulations allows us to make a number of predictions for different topological and geometrical properties of branched structures: A key signature of external guidance is that branching angles should conform to a von Mises distribution while the overall branching structure in an axial field can adopt a well-defined conical domain in the absence of defined boundaries. Furthermore, a signature of the stochastic nature of branching and annihilating random walks is that even with external guidance, the local branch length or overall network size and shape should be highly variable to random branching events and local density-driven termination of tip growth.

### Invariant and smooth limit of discrete geometry folded from bistable origami leading to multistable metasurfaces [^a4d7097c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The hypar origami is not rigid foldable based on its original pattern. To analytically describe the geometry of each deformed corrugation, we assume that the deformations are isometric, and straight creases remain straight, which requires the introduction of at least one additional diagonal pleat in each trapezoidal panel to triangulate the pattern. We adopt the alternating asymmetric triangulation of Demaine et al.as it satisfies the reflection symmetry required by our present analytical model (see Supplementary Fig. 1). We parametrize a corrugation by one folding angle ρ ϵ [0, π] and two bending angles θ 1, θ 2 ϵ [0, π], considering panel width d and folding ridge length L, as shown in Fig. 2c. The dimensionless width w = (d / L) of a corrugation quickly vanishes away from the center. Denoting n as the number of square creases counted from the center, for a standard hypar pattern, we see that (d / L) = 1/(2 n), regardless of the actual dimension of the pattern. In the limit of w → 0, the twisting angle γ of a long corrugation becomes the average of θ 1 and θ 2. Due to orthogonality of the two symmetry planes, the virtual faces ΔABC and ΔD′E′F′ must be perpendicular to each other (see Fig. 2). Compatibility in radial directions further requires that θ 1 = θ 2. Detailed derivations are presented in Supplementary Note 1. Thus we have

The fact that θ 1 = θ 2 leads to ΔABC ≅ Δ D ′ E ′ F ′, which implies that ζ (r) and ξ (r) have the same constituents at the outer rims, and thus we may assume that ζ (r) and ξ (r) have the same shape, but opposite orientations (see Fig. 2d). Eventually, the twisted opening angle of a long corrugation (ψ ′ in Fig. 2b) becomes

We remark that the same identities resulting from an asymptotic analysis can be obtained using the other triangulation scheme, i.e. the asymmetric triangulation. The same conclusion based on the two triangulation schemes reveals that there are fundamental constructions of the folded hypar pattern, which are independent of local deformations between creases (i.e. within panels), as we take the limit to when each corrugation becomes a fiber on the homogenized surface.

The wrist's hose features equidistant symmetrical incisions on both sides (Fig. 10), each incision being rectangular. When the hose bends towards one side due to cable actuation, the rectangular incisions on the bending side deform into isosceles triangles. The bending angle of the wrist joint is determined by the number and spacing of the incisions, with the described wrist bending angle being ± 87.2°. Symmetrical incisions ensure the same stress and strain conditions when bending in either direction, but the length of the incisions limits the bending angle of each segment, allowing only left–right or up-down pivoting movements.

### Discovery of the exact 3D one-way wave equation [^0e0f81a9]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The standard wave equation describing symmetrical wave propagation in all directions in three dimensions, was discovered by the French scientist d'Alembert, more than 250 years ago. In the 20 th century it became important to search for 'one-way' versions of this equation in three dimensions - i.e., an equation describing wave propagation in one direction for all angles, and forbiting it in the opposite direction - for a variety of applications in computational and topological physics. Here, by borrowing techniques from relativistic quantum field theory - in particular, from the Dirac equation -, and starting from Engquist and Majda's seminal, approximative one-way wave equations, we report the discovery of the exact one-way wave equation in three dimensions. Surprisingly, we find that this equation necessarily - similarly to the innate emergence of spin in the Dirac equation - has a topological nature, giving rise to strong, spin-orbit coupling and locking, and non-vanishing (integer) Chern numbers.

### The 30-degree angle revisited [^eec48357]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The standard surgical ellipse, with 30 degrees apical angles and a length-to-width ratio of 2 or 3 to 1, works optimally on a flat surface. The same pattern, when used for excisions on strongly convex or concave surfaces, leads to distortions which may require significant revisions. The reason for these discrepancies is explainable by the mathematical differences between flat Euclidian geometry and curved non-Euclidian geometry. Understanding these basic mathematical principles as applied to cutaneous surgery should lead to better preoperative planning, fewer intraoperative surprises, and more pleasing results.

### Measurement of the hypotenuse of the vertical optic nerve head cup with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography for the structural diagnosis of glaucoma [^30261418]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

HVOC measurement

HVOC was measured by an experienced examiner. For each patient, the vertical B-scan with the largest identifiable vertical cup on the infrared imaging mode of the SD-OCT device was selected for HVOC measurement. The eye-tracking system was used to place the vertical line on the exact location selected by the examiner, and the ART mode was used for noise reduction. The 1:1 ratio was used to obtain B-scans. B-scans with a Q score < 20 were disqualified. Measurements were made using the caliper provided by the software. The length and depth of the cup were measured and formed the sides of a right triangle that were used to calculate the HVOC. The first line, which was measured at the BMO level starting at the innermost portion of the descending RNFL tissue (ILM level) and connecting to the opposite side, represented the length of the cup. A second line starting at the former line and ending at the deepest portion of the anterior prelaminar tissue at the middle third of the cup represented the depth of the cup. The Pythagorean theorem was then used to calculate the hypotenuse of the triangle: c 2 = a 2 + b 2, where c is the HVOC and a and b are the length and depth of the cup that represent the lengths of the two sides of the right triangle (Figure 1).

Statistical analysis

Baseline characteristics were compared using generalized estimating equations (GEE), which take into account the correlation between both eyes of the same individual. A generalized linear model, with coefficients obtained by GEE, was used to correlate and compare variables. A P -value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. SPSS, version 22.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA), was used for statistical analysis.

### Corneal cross-linking induces increased corneal refractive index, which generates measurement error of central corneal thickness [^426c2abe]. Ophthalmology Science (2026). Medium credibility.

Model 1: Side View

The camera image in the side view of an illuminated optical section of the cornea used by imaging technologies based on Scheimpflug geometry is illustrated in Figure 2. In this model, measurements of corneal thickness are obtained by extracting the apparent thickness of the slit-illuminated cornea and calculating the thickness of the cornea based on the refractive distortion present as viewed by a camera at a fixed, known observation angle. This is accomplished using principles of geometric optics and trigonometry. Major equations are provided here with details included in the Appendix.

Figure 2
Model 1 of side-view measurement of CCT representing Scheimpflug-geometry tomographic imaging of the cornea. The variable d s is the apparent corneal thickness in the Scheimpflug image, angle θ is the constant observation angle (45 o), and r is the known radius of curvature of the anterior cornea. The unknowns are the index of refraction of the cornea, n c and corrected CCT side view, t cs. CCT = central corneal thickness.

Based on triangle BGO in Figure 2, with angles, θi, (180−θ), and angle α, which can be defined by (α = θ – θi), the following equation results.where θi is the angle of incidence of a parallel light ray at point B, d s is observed apparent corneal thickness in the image, angle θ is the constant observation angle (45 o), and r is the known radius of curvature of the anterior cornea. Based on Snell's Law, angle θ r is defined by the following equation.where n c is the index of refraction of the cornea.

Based on triangle BCO in Figure 2, the corrected CCT from side view images, t cs can be calculated by substitution from previous equations for angles, θ r and α.

### On the role of initial velocities in pair dispersion in a microfluidic chaotic flow [^cb75a5d8]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Failure of the linear flow assumption

This raises questions regarding the extent to which elastic turbulence can be regarded as globally smooth, particularly in the presence of boundaries and mean flow. A velocity field consistent with linear flow behaviour would exhibitfor the second order structure function of the longitudinal velocity, where u denotes the relative velocity and u l = u ⋅ R / R; e.g. numerical simulations (Figs. 1 and 6 of ref.). In our flow, clear deviations from linearity are evident already at separations beyond 12 μm, less than 10% of the width and depth of the microfluidic channel, as can be learnt from Fig. 3; a comparison to previous experimental results is drawn in Supplementary Note 2. The inset of Fig. 3 presents the mean squared relative velocities without rescaling; we shall return to these profiles soon.

Fig. 3
Initial relative velocity dependence on the separation distance. The second moments of the relative velocity(blue left - triangles) and the separation velocity(green right-triangle), where u l = u ⋅ R / R, are plotted in the inset (right axis values are half the left ones) as function of the initial separation distance R 0; both ensemble averages are taken at the initial time t 0, when the pairs separation distance is closest to R 0. Rescaling these data by the squared initial separationreveals the deviation from the commonly applied assumption of linear velocity field, as presented on a logarithmic scale in the main plot (right axis values are one order of magnitude smaller than the left ones). Had 〈 u 2 〉 R ∝ R 2 held, the rescaled curves would have remained constant; this is clearly not the case. Indeed, thedata level off as R 0 approaches the smaller distances, providing supporting evidence for the linearity of u l with R at scales smaller than 12 μm. However, this does not hold beyond a tenth of the channel depth. A linear flow regime is not supported by the rescaled relative velocity data, which values keep increasing even for the smallest R 0 values explored here. Further note thatand(inset) are empirical estimators for the second order structure functions of the velocity and the longitudinal velocity, correspondingly; the former is the coefficient of the quadratic term in Eq. (2). The error bars in the inset (smaller than the marker) indicate the margin of error based on a 95% confidence interval

### Structure of the heterotrimeric membrane protein complex ftsB-ftsL-ftsQ of the bacterial divisome [^4a29856a]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

A notable feature of the V-shaped FtsBLQ structure is that the length of each branch is different: the FtsBL branch spans ~100 Å and the FtsQ branch ~120 Å (Supplementary Fig. 1). The crossing point of the two branches, however, is not at the very tip but somewhere in the middle of the continuous FtsBL coiled coil (Fig. 1d), forming an included angle of ~37°, where an interface between FtsB and FtsQ is revealed (Fig. 1c-e, Supplementary Fig. 1). In the other branch, the two globular domains of FtsQ, the Polypeptide Transport-Associated (POTRA) α domain and the C-terminal β domain, are rigidly connected together with the lowest B-factors observed at their interface (Supplementary Fig. 2b), and the least structural variation compared with the previous structures of the periplasmic part of FtsQ (PDB: and) (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Residues with the highest B-factors are found at the juxta-membrane linkers (α2-α3, β2-β3 and TM-β1) which are loosely packed (Supplementary Fig. 2c), suggesting that a swing motion is possible for the whole periplasmic part of FtsQ relative to its membrane anchor. Therefore, the two rigid periplasmic branches of FtsBLQ form an obtuse triangle with the plane of the membrane (49 Å and 70 Å in length and at ~37° angle) and are connected to the bendable FtsQ-TM and the unbendable FtsBL-TM on each side (Fig. 1e). Such a structure would most likely tilt down when inserted in the membrane (Fig. 1f), and a structural rearrangement to achieve a perpendicular insertion is possible yet at a cost of disrupting the protein-protein interface (Supplementary Fig. 2e).

### Degenerate boundaries for multiple-alternative decisions [^13c7a722]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Some example boundary parameterizations illustrate the range of possible boundary features and how they extend to multiple-choice decision tasks (Figs. 2 and 3). Each parameterization is a scaling of a flat boundary (Fig. 2, left column) denoted as the flat(θ) function, such that: (I) The function curve(θ, α) is the simplest parameterization of interest, with α the amplitude of the curve (Fig. 2, second column). (II) The function power(θ, α, β) has an additional parameter β that modulates a double curve or forms a central peak (Fig. 2, third column). (III) The oscillatory function oscil(θ, α, β) is a cosine with amplitude α and frequency β (Fig. 2, fourth column). We have chosen these parameterizations so that if β = 0, we recover the curve parameterization, and if α = 0, we recover the flat parameterization. These parameterizations apply to any number of choices n ≥ 2, with examples of the curve and oscil functions for 4AFCs shown in Fig. 3 a, b respectively. Note how these decision boundaries intersect with each 3AFC plane: each face in Fig. 3 a matches a panel in Fig. 2.

Fig. 3
Example boundaries for four choices.

Example decision boundaries are given by the curve parameterization (a) and the oscil parameterization (b). The colors/levels are different edge-intersection parameter values θ, using the same values as those in Fig. 2, where (a) is the N = 4 equivalent of the first curve example. Shading is used to visualize the shape of the boundary.

Overall, we have constructed a set of permutation-invariant, nonlinear decision boundaries that we will use as candidate functions to explore optimal decision rules. This raises the question of which parameter values give optimal boundaries within these parametrized subsets of boundaries.

### Distinct contributions of tensile and shear stress on E-cadherin levels during morphogenesis [^f49703b2]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Shear stress

Shear stress on the E-cadherin clusters was obtained from a microscopic model of the junction (Fig. 6a) as previously described. As illustrated in Fig. 6a, tension of the central junction is decomposed into cortical tensions at a -cell side and b -cell side of the junction:where x is the coordinate along the junction. While T is constant along the junction, cortical tensions θ a (x) and θ b (x) can vary along the junction in opposing gradients (red lines in Fig. 6a) as a result of the transfer of tension from one side of the junction to the other. This transfer of tension generates shear stress on E-Cadherin dimers. Therefore, shear stress at any given point along the junction is defined as the gradient of cortical tension. The average shear stress along the junction is. To relate shear stress to junctional tensions as obtained from mechanical inference, we assume that cortical tensions are single-valued, i.e. continuous, at vertices, from which we get the relation:

We solve equations above to get cortical tensions in terms of junctional tensions and substitute to the equation for shear stress to obtain the final expression of shear stress:where L is the length of the junction.

### Uncomputability of phase diagrams [^e853d9ad]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The phase diagram of a material is of central importance in describing the properties and behaviour of a condensed matter system. In this work, we prove that the task of determining the phase diagram of a many-body Hamiltonian is in general uncomputable, by explicitly constructing a continuous one-parameter family of Hamiltonians H(φ), where [Formula: see text], for which this is the case. The H(φ) are translationally-invariant, with nearest-neighbour couplings on a 2D spin lattice. As well as implying uncomputablity of phase diagrams, our result also proves that undecidability can hold for a set of positive measure of a Hamiltonian's parameter space, whereas previous results only implied undecidability on a zero measure set. This brings the spectral gap undecidability results a step closer to standard condensed matter problems, where one typically studies phase diagrams of many-body models as a function of one or more continuously varying real parameters, such as magnetic field strength or pressure.

### A simplified method to determine acetabular cup anteversion from plain radiographs [^1e16a4a8]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2004). Low credibility.

Plain radiographs are the most important diagnostic means for determining the indication and following up on total hip arthroplasty. The acetabular cup position can be easily determined by applying trigonometric functions. This report presents an even simpler method. The short axis of the projected ellipse is measured and related to the total cross-section of the projected cup along the short axis. This relationship correlates with acetabular cup anteversion angles and represents an inverse sinus function. A close linear correlation is seen within the most common interval from 10 degrees to 30 degrees. Anteversion is between 23 degrees to 24 degrees when the ellipse bisects the total acetabular cross-section. This means that simply measuring the length of the short ellipse axis and the total length of the projected cross-section along the short axis provides the radiographic acetabular anteversion. Nonorthogonal projected radiographs should be corrected first.

### A canonical stability-elasticity relationship verified for one million face-centred-cubic structures [^7f1a1637]. Nature (2012). Excellent credibility.

Any thermodynamically stable or metastable phase corresponds to a local minimum of a potentially very complicated energy landscape. But however complex the crystal might be, this energy landscape is of parabolic shape near its minima. Roughly speaking, the depth of this energy well with respect to some reference level determines the thermodynamic stability of the system, and the steepness of the parabola near its minimum determines the system's elastic properties. Although changing alloying elements and their concentrations in a given material to enhance certain properties dates back to the Bronze Age, the systematic search for desirable properties in metastable atomic configurations at a fixed stoichiometry is a very recent tool in materials design. Here we demonstrate, using first-principles studies of four binary alloy systems, that the elastic properties of face-centred-cubic intermetallic compounds obey certain rules. We reach two conclusions based on calculations on a huge subset of the face-centred-cubic configuration space. First, the stiffness and the heat of formation are negatively correlated with a nearly constant Spearman correlation for all concentrations. Second, the averaged stiffness of metastable configurations at a fixed concentration decays linearly with their distance to the ground-state line (the phase diagram of an alloy at zero Kelvin). We hope that our methods will help to simplify the quest for new materials with optimal properties from the vast configuration space available.

Basic stereological measurements — first-order parameters and probes identify that "First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D])". Measurements "are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D)". These probes create countable events in the image, and "Raw counts provide ratios… that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute measures for the lung or subcompartment".

### Three-dimensional wave breaking [^72fe3fe8]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

In phase-averaged forecasts, the local properties of individual waves are not resolved, but breaking must still be predicted. Therefore, parameters that are derived from measurements of individual waves may be used to diagnose but not predict the onset of wave breaking. Unlike global steepness, the local slope is a diagnostic not a predictive wave-breaking parameter. Linking the global breaking-onset steepnessto a single-parameter measure of spreading will lead to a breaking-onset parameterization that has the potential to be used predictively (Fig. 3c, f). The global steepness at which breaking onset occurs appears to be a linear function of Ω 1 (see Extended Data Table 2 for the parametric fitting coefficients). A simple parameterization like this, which links a property of the directional spectrum to the global steepness at which wave-breaking onset will occur, has the potential to predict when waves will break in the ocean in a stochastic, phase-averaged framework. However, Ω 1 is not necessarily a parameter that can be calculated quickly enough as a part of such large-scale models. Although not perfect, the fit in Fig. 3c may also describe the leading-order effect that increasing the directional spreading has on breaking-onset steepness as a function of Ω 0, a parameter that is simpler to calculate. Also note that large values of Ω 0, which correspond to near-axisymmetric conditions where this parameterization is less accurate, do not occur in the ocean in practice.

### A novel method of closed reduction and percutaneous pinning with six K-wires for intra-articular fractures of the distal radius [^df7810d4]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Percutaneous Pinning

Interfragmentary fixation is done by using six k-wires (size 1.6 mm) to create two triangles. The six k-wires are inserted percutaneously under the C-arm guidance, avoiding the radiocarpal joint and at the same time encircling all the comminuted metaphyseal fragments with the incorporation of the ulnar head and the distal radioulnar joint. On completion of the pinning, there should be at least two k-wires in each fracture fragment.

Creation of the first triangle is done as quickly as possible, based on the clinical judgment of the reduction and preoperative planning of the pinning from the prereduction radiographs. The first Kirschner wire is introduced from the radial styloid to the medial side of the proximal fragment at an angle of 40° to 60° with the long axis of the forearm and 10° to 20° dorsally to the horizontal plane. The second Kirschner wire is introduced from the lateral side of the proximal fragment toward the radio-lunate facet (die punch) in the same plane as that of the first. The third Kirschner wire is introduced from the medial side of the ulnar head to the radial styloid through the distal radioulnar joint. Once the first triangle is completed, the triangular Kirschner wire frame will encircle the comminuted triangular metaphyseal area and will prevent the loss of the achieved reduction. The accuracy of the reduction and position of the k-wires are checked at this stage with the C-arm, and if any correction of reduction or pinning is required, that portion alone can be corrected without disturbing the other pins (Figure 2, A and B).

The histograms (solid bars) are well-approximated by von Mises distributions (dashed lines) as for the local angle φ in a linear gradient (Fig. 1), and as predicted by the continuum model (with D ≃ 0.04 and μ ≃ 0.2). c Mean standard deviations (SDs) 〈 σ ψ 〉 of the angle difference ψ obtained from simulations are close to the mean SD of the experimental data (dotted horizontal line) for an external field strength of f c = 0.6. For comparison, the scaling of SD as a function of f c predicted by the von Mises distribution is displayed (dashed line). d Histograms of angle difference ψ rescaled by their corresponding SDs σ ψ (solid lines) are well-approximated by the von Mises distribution with unit SD (dashed line). e Angle difference distribution obtained from the experimental data from n = 8 networks (solid bars) compared with the von Mises distribution predicted by the theory for an external field strength of f c = 0.6 (dashed line). The latter value is inferred from the matching of theoretical and experimental values of the SDs displayed in (c), and no other fit parameter is used.

### Microscopic response to inhomogeneous deformations in curvilinear coordinates [^3649c2b2]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

A mechanical deformation of a continuum can be expressed as a generalized coordinate transformation of space. Consequently, the equations of electrostatics in deformable media must satisfy covariance requirements with respect to such transformations, a problem that has long been addressed in the context of general relativity. Here we show how these ideas can be incorporated into the framework of density-functional perturbation theory, providing access to the microscopic charge density and electrostatic potential response to an arbitrary deformation field. We demonstrate the power of our approach by deriving, in full generality, the surface contributions to the flexoelectric response of a finite object, a topic that has recently been a matter of controversy. The breakdown of translational periodicity produces consequences that might seem highly paradoxical at first sight: for example, the macroscopic bulk polarization does not always correspond to the physical surface charge.

### A general derivation and quantification of the third law of thermodynamics [^43738480]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The most accepted version of the third law of thermodynamics, the unattainability principle, states that any process cannot reach absolute zero temperature in a finite number of steps and within a finite time. Here, we provide a derivation of the principle that applies to arbitrary cooling processes, even those exploiting the laws of quantum mechanics or involving an infinite-dimensional reservoir. We quantify the resources needed to cool a system to any temperature, and translate these resources into the minimal time or number of steps, by considering the notion of a thermal machine that obeys similar restrictions to universal computers. We generally find that the obtainable temperature can scale as an inverse power of the cooling time. Our results also clarify the connection between two versions of the third law (the unattainability principle and the heat theorem), and place ultimate bounds on the speed at which information can be erased.

All errors are standard deviations. Those for the theory are estimated by bootstrapping (Methods: Statistical Analysis).

To predict the front speed and decay length, we solved Eqs. (1)-(3) in a co-moving frame. To facilitate solution, we made three well-justified assumptions in the distal front: we omitted the internal dendrite density (because terminal branches are in the majority), we dropped the collision term (because it is second order in density, which is small), we set the radial transport termto zero (because it decays as). Using an exponential trial solution, we obtained a constraint Eq. (16) on the allowed values ofversusas shown in Fig. 6c. The marginally stable solutionmust satisfy. This condition pinpoints the emerging front speedas the minimal speed along the-curve, which corresponds to a singular solution for the decay length.

### "Triangle method" for evaluating the morphological characteristics of the aortic arch in healthy mid-to-late pregnancy fetuses [^073afdca]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to apply the 2-dimensional grayscale ultrasound "triangle method" to evaluate the morphology of the aortic arch in healthy mid-to-late pregnancy fetuses.

Methods

A total of 317 healthy singleton fetuses at 20–38 +6 weeks of gestation were assessed. Using the long-axis view of the aortic arch, the "triangle method" was employed to measure the aortic arch length (sum of the 2 sides of a triangle), width, height, and angle. The aortic arch tortuosity (length/width) and height-to-width ratio were calculated. Healthy reference values for these morphological parameters were established, and their relationship to gestational age (GA) and cardiac valve annuli was explored.

Results

The length, width, and height of the aortic arch in healthy mid-to-late pregnancy fetuses increased significantly with GA (P < .05). Instead, no significant correlation was observed between GA or cardiac valve annuli and the aortic arch angle, tortuosity, or height-to-width ratio (P > .05), whose corresponding reference values were 69.2 ± 6.1°, 1.7 ± 0.1, and 0.7 ± 0.1, respectively.

Conclusions

The aortic arch angle, tortuosity, and height-to-width ratio in healthy mid-to-late pregnancy fetuses remain relatively stable during development.

### The apical angle: a mathematical analysis of the ellipse [^72ed30ec]. Dermatologic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The elliptical excision is a common surgical procedure. The dermatologic literature predominantly describes an excisional geometry with a 3:1 length:width ratio and an apical angle of 30 degrees.

Objective

To analyze the elliptical excision by applying mathematical principles and define the apical angle and its relationship to the length:width ratio.

Methods

We examined numerous examples of elliptical excisions as presented in the dermatologic literature. We analyzed the geometry of the excisions and defined it mathematically.

Results

The apical angle of a 3:1 elliptical excision is not 30 degrees. The true apical angle varies from 37 degrees to 74 degrees depending on excisional geometry.

Conclusion

The commonly presented apical angle of 30 degrees is incorrect and does not reflect the true apical angle of elliptical excisions.

### Electrically and mechanically driven rotation of polar spirals in a relaxor ferroelectric polymer [^5d443be9]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Polarization analysis based on PFM measurements

To obtain the nominal toroidal order evaluated by the local curvature, the obtained IP-PFM amplitude image was firstly divided into 33 × 33 arrays, and each region was then subjected to a recognition of potential domain walls and measurement of an averaged curvature radius.

To obtain polarization maps, angle-resolved IP-PFM images were first aligned to correct spatial distortion in nanoscale measurement. Positions with specific morphological characteristics were selected as reference points to determine the coordinate. After the correction, improved angle-resolved IP-PFM phase images would be divided into 64 × 64 arrays for deriving polarization maps. We did not use the data from a single pixel to improve statics. Each region in the arrays was assigned with a local orientation in a range 180° according to the direction of measurement axis. By deducing the serial angle-resolved images on a same region but with rotated measurement axes, we refined the orientation of each point within a range of 45°, and defined its orientation to be along the angular bisector.

The curl, divergence and Laplace operator of the polarization vector field P were further calculated to illustrate the feature of polarization distribution in toroidal polar microregions. The curl vector describes the z component of ∇ × Ρ, also written as:where z is the direction of film normal, and x-y plane describes the plane of PFM images.

Likewise, the divergence and the Laplace operator of P in x-y plane can be written as:

The partial derivatives of P mentioned above were calculated by a weighted least-squares fitting method. More specifically, the polarization component of the target point and its six surrounding points were fitted by first-order polynomial, given the Gaussian function f W (d) as the weighting function:where σ is set to be, d is the distance to the target point, and d 0 is the distance between two neighboring points.

### A modified reverse right-angled triangle osteotomy using the lateral approach for the treatment of posttraumatic cubitus varus deformity in children [^bbbb2306]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

During the time between October 2017 and May 2020, 22 elbows with posttraumatic cubitus varus deformity were treated by means of a modified reverse right-angled triangle osteotomy at the Department of Pediatric Orthopaedics of our hospital. All procedures were carried out by a single senior surgeon. The surgical indication was that the difference between the affected side and the healthy contralateral side was at least 20 degrees and the parents requested surgical treatment. The 22 patients involved included 6 female and 16 male patients with an average age of 10.3 years (range, 8 to 13 years) at the time of the osteotomy. The average time from injury to the osteotomy was 2.2 years (range, 1.1 to 3.2 years). Thirteen patients had a right-sided deformity and 9 had a left-sided deformity. All patients presented with an extension type of supracondylar fracture at the time of injury. The procedures were performed after the approval of the Institutional Ethics Committee and informed consent was obtained from the patients and their families.

Preoperative Planning and Operative Technique

Design drawing of paper simulated osteotomy was performed before surgery. The initial osteotomy was performed 0.5 to 1 cm superior to the olecranon fossa and perpendicular to the lateral rim of the distal humerus (line AB) (Fig. 1 A). The proximal end of the humerus osteotomy was resected with a reverse right-angled triangle so that the DAE angle was equal to the intended angle of correction (Fig. 1 B). The intended angle of correction was equal to the sum of the carrying angle of the normal side plus the varus angle of the affected side and the expectation of 5 degrees of correction loss after surgery. According to the relevant knowledge of the right triangle, the angle DBA was equal to the angle DAE, which was the expected correction angle. After the inverted right triangle, ADB was cut off at the proximal end of the humerus osteotomy, and the apex A of the distal humeral osteotomy segment was rotated inward and overlapped with the apex D to complete the distal humeral valgus osteotomy (Fig. 1 C).

### Two-dimensional membrane as elastic shell with proof on the folds revealed by three-dimensional atomic mapping [^12669a0e]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Comparison with continuum mechanics models

Previous studies on folded structures used the small deflection approximation, which is not appropriate for folds. In the framework of linear elastic continuum mechanics, bending stiffness/rigidity (D) is the resistance against bending deformation, it equals to the ratio between bending moment (M) and curvature (κ). For one dimensional pure bending as in Fig. 1a, the bending moment (M) is related to the curvature,

where D is the bending rigidity or bending stiffness, is angle of the section s. As the moment balance at the initial point O (Fig. 1a),

M O is the bending moment at point O, V O is the shear force exerted at O point, the direction is perpendicular to the 2D membrane. From the geometry in Fig. 1a, we know d x /d s = cos, and by differentiating equation (2) and use equation (1), we can get

Note one key boundary condition at the initial bending point O comes from the balance of the adhesion energy between two layers and strain energy caused by bending (see Supplementary Discussion for details), which yield a simple relationship

where W ad is the adhesion energy between the folded two layers. We then use a similar approach as found in ref.to normalize equation (3). After integration on equation (3) and applying the boundary condition in equation (4), we get

where, they are dimensionless values, and x and y are also normalized as. And using boundary conditions at point O and B (Fig. 1a), equation (5) can now be numerically solved.

Varying γ leads to different shapes of corresponding folds as show in Fig. 3. Our experimental reconstructed 3D folded structures for different kinds of membranes are then fitted with the continuum mechanics models. For instance, for WSe 2 and Graphene (Fig. 3a, b), we find the cross-section contour can all be fitted very well with the linear elastic models, with different γ. For all of our bending modulus measurements, we have selected the samples that both sides of the folds can be fitted well with the same continuum mechanics model (Supplementary Fig. 11). In addition to the horizontal folds, the continuum mechanics model can also be applied to vertical folds (buckled) for WS 2 (Figs 1b and 3c). However, in this case the boundary conditionis used.

### Properties of HIV-1 associated cholesterol in addition to raft formation are important for virus infection [^34383216]. Virus Research (2015). Low credibility.

The overall HIV-1 membrane lipid contents resemble lipid rafts, and we have previously demonstrated that raft-promoting properties of virus-associated cholesterol (with modifications in either the 3β-OH group or AB rings) are important for HIV-1 infectivity. As cholesterol is present in both rafts and non-rafts domains of HIV-1 membrane, we question whether the interpretation of rafts property of virus-associated cholesterol being an absolute requirement for HIV-1 function is too simplistic. The carbon side chain of cholesterol is the third component of cholesterol that can affect the fluidity of membrane depending on its context within the lipid membrane bilayers. In this work, we have used synthetic cholesterol analogues that have different lengths of carbon side chain for our investigation. In contrast to our previous report, we have found that cholesterol side chain analogues that lack in vitro defined raft promoting-property is able to support HIV-1 replication. More specifically, cholesterol analogues with side chains of intermediate length have greater capacity to support HIV-1 infection, suggesting HIV-1 is able to maintain function using cholesterol variants that promote a range of non-rafts- to rafts-properties. Our data demonstrate cholesterol properties other than raft-promoting function also contribute to the infectivity of HIV-1.

### Validation of monte carlo estimates of three-class ideal observer operating points for normal data [^26b6e5d9]. Academic Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

Traditional two-class receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis is inadequate for the complete evaluation of observer performance in tasks with more than two classes.

Materials and Methods

Here, a Monte Carlo estimation method for operating point coordinates on a three-class ROC surface is developed and compared with analytically calculated coordinates in two special cases: (1) univariate and (2) restricted bivariate trinormal underlying data.

Results

In both cases, the statistical estimates were found to be good in the sense that the analytical values lay within the 95% confidence interval of the estimated values about 95% of the time.

Conclusions

The statistical estimation method should be key in the development of a pragmatic performance metric for evaluation of observers in classification tasks with three or more classes.

### The nature of carotenoid S* state and its role in the nonphotochemical quenching of plants [^8eb02357]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Comparison between the lutein s-trans and s-cis dynamics

To understand the relationship between the conformational and electronic properties of Lut, we now analyze the structure of the s-trans and s-cis conformers in the ground state ensemble, i.e. at the initial conditions of the excited state dynamics. We focus our analysis on the following geometrical parameters of Lut: (i) the bond-length alternation (BLA); (ii) the two dihedral angles in the lumenal side (ds1 and ds2, Fig. 1); (iii) the distortion around the π -conjugated C = C bonds. For the latter, we define a D index (Supplementary Equation (4) in Supplementary Note 2) that quantifies the deviation from planarity: a larger distortion is associated to a larger value of D. The BLA coordinate is defined as the average difference between single and double bond lengths in the π -conjugated backbone and variations along this coordinate crucially impact on the Car electronic structure and its excited state properties.

Figure 3 a shows that in the ground state ensemble the maximum value of the BLA distributions of the s-trans and s-cis conformers is nearly the same, but the s-trans distribution is significantly broader than the s-cis one. Thus, molecular structures in the Lut s-trans conformation explore a larger configurational space already at the ground state. We anticipate that this trend will be kept throughout the SH simulations, both for the ensemble of molecular geometries visited on the S 1 state (S 1 active) and at the S 1 →S 0 hops.

### The cosine law to choose the correct forceps shaft length for macular surgery in highly myopic eyes [^ef404df6]. Retina (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To demonstrate a mathematical analogy between the Pythagorean theorem using the axial a-scan measurement, i.e., the distance between the central cornea and the sclerotomy, and the lengths of the forceps in eyes of patients with all axial lengths.

Methods

We used the Pythagorean equation (c 2 = a 2 + b 2) to calculate the adequate shaft length of the forceps to use in macular surgery, especially in highly myopic eyes, where c 2 represents the axial length (hypotenuse); b 2 the sum of the corneal ray and distance between the corneal limbus and the sclerotomy (base side); and a 2 the distance between the sclerotomy and the fovea (perpendicular side).

Results

We reproduced the cosine law to estimate the distance between the sclerotomy and the fovea. The distance between the sclerotomy and the foveal area is shorter than the axial length and can become smaller based on the distance from the sclerotomy to the corneal limbus.

Conclusion

This simple mathematical formula is useful when performing surgery in highly myopic eyes, in which there can be difficulties reaching the macular area.

### Diagnosis: making the best use of medical data [^aa53c8a5]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

To take the best possible care of patients, physicians must understand the basic principles of diagnostic test interpretation. Pretest probability is an important factor in interpreting test results. Some tests are useful for ruling in disease when positive or ruling out disease when negative, but not necessarily both. Many tests are of little value for diagnosing disease, and tests should be ordered only when the results are likely to lead to improved patient-oriented outcomes.

### Residual astigmatism produced by toric intraocular lens rotation [^0ec86701]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To analyze changes in the eye's refractive properties when a toric intraocular lens (IOL) rotates.

Setting

Fundación Oftalmológica del Mediterráneo, Valencia, Spain.

Design

Experimental study.

Methods

The matrix definition of astigmatism was used in this theoretical study and compared with another vector representation. Two methods were compared: (1) The cylinder, C, resulting from the addition of 2 cylinders C(1) and C(2) whose axes form an angle a, is obtained by the addition of 2 vectors of values C(1) and C(2) forming an angle 2a; (2) the power matrix, F, of a thin astigmatic dioptric system that decomposes naturally into 3 orthogonal components: the purely spherical part F(nes,) the ortho-astigmatism F(or), and oblique astigmatism F(ob).

Results

The residual cylinder was one third of the corneal astigmatism when a toric IOL rotated ± 10 degrees when the cylinder values for the cornea (C(1)) and IOL (C(2)) were equal. Nevertheless, in most cases C(1) is greater than C(2); therefore, the residual astigmatism did not change noticeably with small rotations. The angle of rotation, b, which annuls the astigmatism correction, could be obtained from the following: cos(π + 2b) = -r/2, with r being the ratio between the IOL and cornea cylinders.

Conclusions

The 2 methods gave equivalent results. When the IOL cylinder had a value different from that of the corneal astigmatism, a better choice would be a lower, rather than higher, cylinder value to reduce residual astigmatism. In general, toric IOL rotations less than 10 degrees changed the eye's refraction less than 0.50 diopter. Thus, small axis rotations are not an obstacle for satisfactory astigmatism correction with toric IOLs.

### Starting geometry creation and design method for freeform optics [^7d6e8280]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

We describe a method for designing freeform optics based on the aberration theory of freeform surfaces that guides the development of a taxonomy of starting-point geometries with an emphasis on manufacturability. An unconventional approach to the optimization of these starting designs wherein the rotationally invariant 3rd-order aberrations are left uncorrected prior to unobscuring the system is shown to be effective. The optimal starting-point geometry is created for an F/3, 200mm aperture-class three-mirror imager and is fully optimized using a novel step-by-step method over a 4×4 degree field-of-view to exemplify the design method. We then optimize an alternative starting-point geometry that is common in the literature but was quantified here as a sub-optimal candidate for optimization with freeform surfaces. A comparison of the optimized geometries shows the performance of the optimal geometry is at least 16× better, which underscores the importance of the geometry when designing freeform optics.

### Medial packing and elastic asymmetry stabilize the double-gyroid in block copolymers [^f3b7e627]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Strong segregation theory of the hexagonal columnar phase

To compute the SST free energy of the competitor Hex phase we use the method of ref. which considers a variable class of IMDS shapes — intermediate to circular and hexagonal shapes — and corresponding space-filling (so-called kinked-path) chain trajectories chain trajectories within domains. Complete details and subdomain packing analysis provided in Supplementary Note 6.

Finite segregation strength self-consistent field calculations

Self-consistent field (SCF) calculations of Lam, Hex and DG phases are done using the PSCF code as described in ref. Distributions of the free end junctions are computed from the SCF segment distribution functions as detailed in Supplementary Note 9. As detailed in Supplementary Note 8, the tilt of the chain trajectories is computed from the (polar) order parameter at the IMDS (i.e. regions composed equally of equal parts A and B segments), which is computed from spatial gradients of segment distribution functions as described in ref.

IDMS shape analysis

For the IMDS shape analysis, we adapted methods for calculating smooth approximations to curvature on a discrete meshes based on least-squares fitting of well-behaved quadric surfaces to small surface patches. The quadric surface fits provide for smooth evaluations of curvature that are local to each surface patch. We obtain a global curvature distribution by stitching together the collection of surface patches, averaging over individual patch curvature evaluations at the intersection of multiple patches. This algorithm also provides a route to smoothing over rough meshes, such as those that appear in the skeletal SST construction. This algorithm is described in detail in Supplementary Note 7 A. To construct the "band diagrams", we specify a set of cutting planes and find their intersections with a given meshed surface, yielding curved paths on the surface. We then identify the mesh edges that intersect each plane and use linear interpolation to evaluate vertex- or face-addressed data at the location where each edge intersects with a plane. This method is outlined in Supplementary Note 7 B.

End-exclusion zone corrected free energies

End-exclusion zone (EEZ) corrections to the parabolic brush theory calculations of chain stretching free energy, which are described in Supplementary Note 10, were found using the results of. We incorporated a look-up table and interpolation tool available in the supplementary code of that reference (available at 10.7275/rtvx-h237) to adjust the stretching free energy for each wedge in our medial SST calculations.

### Modelling the species-area relationship using extreme value theory [^10b0aaff]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The nested species-area relationship, obtained by counting species in increasingly larger areas in a nested fashion, exhibits robust and recurring qualitative and quantitative patterns. When plotted in double logarithmic scales it shows three phases: rapid species increase at small areas, slower growth at intermediate scales, and faster rise at large scales. Despite its significance, the theoretical foundations of this pattern remain incompletely understood. Here, we develop a theory for the species-area relationship using extreme value theory, and show that the species-area relationship is a mixture of the distributions of minimum distances to a starting sampling focal point for each individual species. A key insight of our study is that each phase is determined by the geographical distributions of the species, i.e., their ranges, relative to the focal point, enabling us to develop a formula for estimating the number of species at phase transitions. We test our approach by comparing empirical species-area relationships for different continents and taxa with our predictions using Global Biodiversity Information Facility data. Although a SAR reflects the underlying biological attributes of the constituent species, our interpretations and use of the extreme value theory are general and can be widely applicable to systems with similar spatial features.

### Complex bmapping with carr-purcell spin echoes and its application to electrical properties tomography [^2266f31e]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

A multi‐spin‐echo sequence with equidistant echo spacing is shown in Figure 1A, wheredenotes the flip angle of the refocusing pulse; stands for the RF phase; and TE denotes the echo time (also indicating the temporal spacing between the application of RF pulses). In the CP scheme, all excitations are applied along the same axis; thus, applies. In the CPMG scheme, excitation and refocusing pulses are perpendicular to each other, andapplies. For the experiments described in the following, a prototype of such a multi‐spin‐echo sequence was used. By changing the RF phase of the excitation, the sequence was run in either CP or CPMG mode.

2.1 B 1 + mapping with multi‐spin‐echo sequences

The echo amplitudes for both the CP and CPMG sequence as a function of the flip angle has been studied in the past. Zurderived analytic integral expressions for the n th echo intensity of CP, as well as CPMG, signals in the absence of relaxation from a vector model for the sequence's pseudo steady state:withandwhereis the phase accumulation of an isochromat during one TR, andis the equilibrium magnetization.

Despite the compact forms of Equations 1 and 2, it is not obvious how the B 1 + amplitude can be retrieved from the echo amplitudes of CP and CPMG echo trains. Using a generating functions formalism, Lukzen et al, showed that the asymptotic behavior of Equations 1 and 2 is of the following form:

### Mechanical instability at finite temperature [^f1dba381]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Many physical systems including lattices near structural phase transitions, glasses, jammed solids and biopolymer gels have coordination numbers placing them at the edge of mechanical instability. Their properties are determined by an interplay between soft mechanical modes and thermal fluctuations. Here we report our investigation of the mechanical instability in a lattice model at finite temperature T. The model we used is a square lattice with a φ(4) potential between next-nearest-neighbour sites, whose quadratic coefficient κ can be tuned from positive to negative. Using analytical techniques and simulations, we obtain a phase diagram characterizing a first-order transition between the square and the rhombic phase and different regimes of elasticity, as well as an 'order-by-disorder' effect that favours the rhombic over other zigzagging configurations. We expect our study to provide a framework for the investigation of finite-T mechanical and phase behaviour of other systems with a large number of floppy modes.

### Nonlinear wave propagation governed by a fractional derivative [^db5b4cd7]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The idea of fractional derivatives has a long history that dates back centuries. Apart from their intriguing mathematical properties, fractional derivatives have been studied widely in physics, for example in quantum mechanics and generally in systems with nonlocal temporal or spatial interactions. However, systematic experiments have been rare because the physical implementation is challenging. Here we report the observation and full characterization of a family of temporal solitons that are governed by a fractional nonlinear wave equation. We demonstrate that these solitons have non-exponential tails, reflecting their nonlocal character, and have a very small time-bandwidth product.

### A modified reverse right-angled triangle osteotomy using the lateral approach for the treatment of posttraumatic cubitus varus deformity in children [^aa5eb75a]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 2
A, Preoperative x-ray of 9-year-old boy of left-sided cubitus varus; (B and C) the same patient treated by a modified inverse right-angled triangle osteotomy and fixation by K -wires.

All the patients underwent follow-up by clinical–radiologic means at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperative period, respectively. The clinical and radiologic parameters were recorded in the postoperative period. The patient's clinical evaluation included measurement of varus angulation, carrying angle, and range of motion (ROM) of the elbow before surgery and at the final follow-up. Functional outcome was graded as per criteria described by Oppenheim et alas excellent, good, and poor. An excellent result included correction of the varus deformity to within 5 degrees of the contralateral elbow, motion to within 5 degrees of the preoperative flexion and rotation arcs, and no perioperative complications. A good result demonstrated a valgus position and motion to within at least 10 degrees of the preoperative arcs. A poor result was assigned to any case with a complication, residual varus, or loss of more than 10 degrees in any plane of motion compared with the preoperative examination. Radiologic evaluation included an anteroposterior view and a lateral view of the elbow on both sides with the contralateral side as a control. The carrying angle can be determined radiologically by the humerus-elbow-wrist (HEW) angle, which was measured on the anteroposterior view of the elbow. A line passed through the middle longitudinal axis of the lower 1/3 of the humerus, and then drew a second line between the radius and the ulna along the middle longitudinal axis of the upper 1/3 of the forearm. The extension lines of these 2 lines intersect at the supracondylar part and the intersection angle is the HEW angle (Fig. 3 A). The HEW angle was radiographically assessed before surgery and at the final follow-up. The lateral condylar prominence index (LCPI) was measured by drawing the longitudinal humeral axis to the transepicondylar line, which divided the transepicondylar line into lateral and medial parts (Fig. 3 B). Then the ratio of the difference between lateral and medial distance and total transepicondylar distance was calculated and called as LCPI.

### How to write an interpretation [^3d74107f]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2019). Medium credibility.

Every day we interpret examination findings and clinical tests with the aim of coming to a diagnosis. But how well do we interpret these tests? Whether it is a traditional examination technique used by doctors for centuries or a new cutting edge biomarker, the diagnostic landscape shifts over time. The aim of interpretations is to produce a library of evidence-based resources directing the use of clinical tests including examination techniques. In this article we discuss how best to tackle writing an interpretation. Interpretations are succinct evidence-based summaries that draw together research findings to provide practical answers for clinicians.

### How to use an article about a diagnostic test [^15ba9bd2]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Urologists frequently confront diagnostic dilemmas, prompting them to select, perform and interpret additional diagnostic tests. Before applying a given diagnostic test the user should ascertain that the chosen test would indeed help decide whether the patient has a particular target condition. In this article in the Users' Guide to the Urological Literature series we illustrate the guiding principles of how to critically appraise a diagnostic test, interpret its results and apply its findings to the care of an individual patient.

Materials and Methods

The guiding principles of how to evaluate a diagnostic test are introduced in the setting of a clinical scenario. We propose a stepwise approach that addresses the question of whether the study results are likely to be valid, what the results are and whether these results would help urologists with the treatment of their individual patients.

Results

Some of the issues urologists should consider when assessing the validity of a diagnostic test study are how the authors assembled the study population, whether they used blinding to minimize bias and whether they used an appropriate reference standard in all patients to determine the presence or absence of the target disorder. Urologists should next evaluate the properties of the diagnostic test that indicate the direction and magnitude of change in the probability of disease for a particular test result. Finally, urologists should ask a series of questions to understand how the diagnostic test may impact the care of their patients.

Conclusions

Application of the guides presented in this article will allow urologists to critically appraise studies of diagnostic tests. Determining the study validity, understanding the study results and assessing the applicability to patient care are 3 fundamental steps toward an evidence-based approach to choosing and interpreting diagnostic tests.

### Critical exponents and scaling invariance in the absence of a critical point [^7f60fa59]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

The paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition is classified as a critical phenomenon due to the power-law behaviour shown by thermodynamic observables when the Curie point is approached. Here we report the observation of such a behaviour over extraordinarily many decades of suitable scaling variables in ultrathin Fe films, for certain ranges of temperature T and applied field B. This despite the fact that the underlying critical point is practically unreachable because protected by a phase with a modulated domain structure, induced by the dipole-dipole interaction. The modulated structure has a well-defined spatial period and is realized in a portion of the (T, B) plane that extends above the putative critical temperature, where thermodynamic quantities do not display any singularity. Our results imply that scaling behaviour of macroscopic observables is compatible with an avoided critical point.

### Inverse poroelasticity as a fundamental mechanism in biomechanics and mechanobiology [^9e1c9f7f]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

3D discrete fiber network model

A recent planar network modelwas extended to 3D. Representative volume elements (RVEs) were created by seeding a spatial domain of V RVE = b RVE × b RVE × t RVE randomly with N I intersection points and connecting these, respectively, to other four intersections by straight lines. The amount of intersections N I was controlled by defining the intersection density ρ I so that

The connecting lines were generated using a weighted random selection process, where the weight p for each possible connector with length l, in-plane orientation α and out-of-plane orientation ϕ is given by a combination of probability distributionswith p α = 1 to account for in-plane isotropy of the membranes, whereas p φ was defined by a von-Mises distribution with concentration parameter β, and p l is a Poisson distribution, leading to networks with Poisson distributed fiber lengths of average length l s. Fibers were discretized by connector elements (CONN3D2) in Abaqus/Standard software (Abaqus 6.10EF1, Dassault Systèmes Simulia Corp. Providence, RI, USA). To account for the resistance of the network against volumetric deformation a single solid continuum element (C3D8) was superimposed on the network, similar to ref.but without any distortional stiffness. Its material properties were defined by the strain-energy functionwhere κ is a material parameter with dimension of stress. This model predicts increasing resistance to compression and limits the volume reduction to J *. Short range, soft elastic interaction between adjacent fibers through a weak matrix were represented by two additional connectors with low stiffness k m between intersections, respectively, isotropically distributed but chosen as short as possible. The non linear response of the fiber connectors was approximated by a tri-linear force-strain (F c − ε c) curve (Fig. 3h), representing the low compressive stiffness (k 0) for ε c < 0, the moderate stiffness (k b) during the bending-dominated straightening phase (0 < ε c < ε s), and the high tensile stiffness (k 1) of straight fibers (ε c > ε s). The RVE was subjected to homogeneous boundary conditions reflecting the macroscopic displacement and stress-free lateral faces in UA and EB tests. The computed reaction forces on the boundaries were used to compute the homogenized stress tensorand the orientation of the connector elements in the deformed RVE were extracted, processed with Matlab (Version R2013a) and represented as polar plots.

### Correlated electrons in delta-plutonium within a dynamical mean-field picture [^e42fbc2a]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

Given the practical importance of metallic plutonium, there is considerable interest in understanding its fundamental properties. Plutonium undergoes a 25 per cent increase in volume when transformed from its alpha-phase (which is stable below 400 K) to the delta-phase (stable at around 600 K), an effect that is crucial for issues of long-term storage and disposal. It has long been suspected that this unique property is a consequence of the special location of plutonium in the periodic table, on the border between the light and heavy actinides-here, electron wave-particle duality (or itinerant versus localized behaviour) is important. This situation has resisted previous theoretical treatment. Here we report an electronic structure method, based on dynamical mean-field theory, that enables interpolation between the band-like and atomic-like behaviour of the electron. Our approach enables us to study the phase diagram of plutonium, by providing access to the energetics and one-electron spectra of strongly correlated systems. We explain the origin of the volume expansion between the alpha- and delta-phases, predict the existence of a strong quasiparticle peak near the Fermi level and give a new viewpoint on the physics of plutonium, in which the alpha- and delta-phases are on opposite sides of the interaction-driven localization-delocalization transition.

### The rules of attractiveness: a study on the lower facial third [^4d564efe]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is considered attractive may not fall into the "norm", and it can vary from culture to culture and depending on the historical time, for this reason the standard cephalometric and antropometric references may not be sufficient in these cases. Lately some techniques have arose to popularity that are aimed to changing the frontal and lateral aspect of the facial lower third, such as V-line or the Chin-Wing Osteotomy technique, but no reference system exists at the moment to define to which extent a modification of the lower third falls within what is considered beautiful, and everything is left to the patient's will or to the surgeon's sensitivity. The aim of this article is to study which antropometric value is considered attractive by the most for what concerns the frontal shape of the lower third of the face. Twenty-four female models were enrolled in this study and the angle taken into consideration was the one at the intersection between the 2 lines connecting the cutaneous gonial angle of each side of the face and the most external part of the chin on the same side. Measures were made on pictures in frontal view. Two hundred two random examiners were asked to see the pictures and rate them as attractive or nonattractive. Results were then paired with the angles values. Among the models the higher angle measured was 107.5° (found in 1 individual) while the lower angle was 76° (found in 1 individual), the average measure calculated was 88.3° while the median angle was 89.5°. According to the result the subjects considered more attractive were those with an angle between 84.5 and 91.5 (92 for male examiners). This could be an important starting point for studies who can evaluate attractiveness from a numerical point of view.

### Simple spatial scaling rules behind complex cities [^23b5e063]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Spatial scaling

Our simple rules produce the AP, road network, and socioeconomic interaction distributions (see Fig. 1b, c). The AP distribution and its morphology are in good agreement with the real city of Greater London (see Fig. 1d).

The model allows us to quantify these predictions. According to the SA mechanism, when t is sufficiently large the spatial distribution of AP is approximatelywhere ρ (r, t) is the average density at distance r from the city centre, i.e. the seed node at position (0, 0), R (t) is the radius of the entire city at time t (see Fig. 2b and further details of the explicit form of ρ (r, t) are in Supplementary Note 1), and β is a parameter derived from C. The dependence of β on C (see Fig. 2a) can be derived by the non-linear fitting, and the simulation results are shown in Fig. 2b. Figure 2c shows that the collected data validate Eq. (4). The AP in the real data is defined as a mixture of working and residential populations according to their active duration in that region (see Methods). In the downtown area (i.e. when r / R (t) → 0), the AP density decays following the power law shown in Eq. (4) (see Fig. 2c). In contrast, residential population density decays exponentially as we move from city centre to urban fringe, as verified in previous researchand our data (see Supplementary Fig. 8). This reconciles the conflict between area-size allometry and the exponential decay of population from city centre to urban fringe found in the literature. To eliminate the influence of noise in the empirical data and allow an unbiased comparison of different quantities, we study the cumulative quantities in terms of the distance from the central area instead of the local density (see Fig. 3). Integrating Eq. (4) we obtainwhere P (r, t) is the cumulative AP within the concentric circle of the central area with radius r (see Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig. 7 for detailed derivations). This expression is approximately a power law with an exponent 2 − β when. This is consistent with the fractal city hypothesis, and the fractal dimension is 2 − β if the distributions of APs and buildings are similar. We can similarly calculate the cumulative road length and socioeconomic interactions asandTherefore the exponents of the cumulative length of the road network and socioeconomic interactions within the circle of radius r are 2 − β /2 and 2 − 3 β /2. These predictions are consistent with the data from Beijing and London shown in Fig. 3. Due to the need for high-resolution data, we use nighttime light as the proxy for socioeconomic interactions –. Although nighttime light data has some intrinsic disadvantages when representing high-resolution interactions (e.g. at a community level, because luminosity is also associated with road density and type of land use), it remains the best candidate among open-source data. We show that as long as the spatial resolution is not excessively high it is a good proxy (see Methods, Supplementary Figs. 10 and 12–14 and Supplementary Note 6 for further discussion). Thus based on Eqs. (5)–(7) we can obtain all the other spatial scaling exponents from any single observation.

### Critical exponents and scaling invariance in the absence of a critical point [^760713e6]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Scaling and characteristic lengths

As suggested by one of the reviewers, in a conventional ferromagnet scaling plots can also be written in such a way that the dependence on the correlation lengthis made explicit (ν being the corresponding critical exponent). Let us consider the following equations of state of a ferromagnet:

and

with F 1 (x) and F 2 (x) some scaling functions. In Fig. 5b, c the same data points shown in Fig. 4c are plotted in the representations defined above. Points falling in the grey zone are rendered in grey. Indeed, collapsing is observed for the coloured points while the grey ones spread out in the plot planes. Figure 5c appears very similar to Fig. 4c and basically the same considerations apply. Equation (7) leads instead to the plot in Fig. 5b that has a different shape.

If the spreading of grey points observed in all the scaling plots was due to the size of magnetic domains L acting as a cutoff for the correlation length, from equation (7) one would expect the following relation to be fulfilled in the patterned phase

with F 3 (x) andappropriate scaling functions. This scaling relation is not compatible with the one found in within the grey zone, which can be rewritten as

Equations (9) and (10) can be simultaneously fulfilled only for

This last relation is not obeyed by the 2D-Ising critical exponents β = 1/8, δ = 15 and ν = 1.

A more proper framework to discuss whether L acts as a cutoff for the correlation length is provided by the finite-size scaling (FSS) ansatz, according to which the magnetization M L (T) of a finite system of linear size L x should be related to the magnetization of the corresponding infinite systems M ∞ (T) by the law

### Fronts and waves of actin polymerization in a bistability-based mechanism of circular dorsal ruffles [^af3100a1]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Bistability

Neglecting the temporal and spatial derivatives, we find that (1)–(4) admit three uniform solutions (fixed points, denoted by asterisks) of which two are stable (and) and one is unstable. The solutionsappear in a saddle node (SN) bifurcation under variation of the total actin concentration(Fig. 3a), the latter being a useful control parameter also from a biological perspective. The explicit forms of the fixed points are given in Supplementary Note 3.

In the CDR-free basal state, all available actin is either incorporated into stress fibers and the cell cortex or exists in free monomeric form. Thus, the natural fixed point of the system is. We will show shortly that the phenomenon of CDRs corresponds to the transition of the system from statetowhere the latter is the state of CDR interiors.

Linear analysis and wave instability onset

Next we assume an infinite one-dimensional domain and perform a linear stability analysis to infinitesimal perturbations aboutand:

where P: = (B, F, G, I) and ω is the growth rate of perturbations characterized by wavenumbers q. Inserting (5) into (1)–(4) and collecting terms up to the linear order, we find via the dispersion relation ω (q) thatcan loose stability to waves (a.k.a. finite wavenumber Hopf bifurcation). The instability requires three fields of which at least two need to exhibit diffusion. We believe that among the three diffusing quantities, diffusion of I can be neglected as a first approximation. Nevertheless, we have verified that the results and conclusions indeed persist in presence of diffusion in I. In fact the addition of diffusion in I results in very minor quantitative modifications. Figure 3b shows the dispersion relation about the bifurcation onset A = A WI. A positive real part of ω (q) is identified with an instability of the respective q while the imaginary part indicates temporal oscillations that eventually result in traveling waves. Thus, for A > A WI the system is bistable. We note that a similar instability has been indeed conjectured as a plausible mechanism for actin waves although in the absence of bistability.

### High tip angle approximation based on a modified bloch-riccati equation [^346f756b]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

When designing a radio-frequency pulse to produce a desired dependence of magnetization on frequency or position, the small flip angle approximation is often used as a first step, and a Fourier relation between pulse and transverse magnetization is then invoked. However, common intuition often leads to linear scaling of the resulting pulse so as to produce a larger flip angle than the approximation warrants — with surprisingly good results. Starting from a modified version of the Bloch-Riccati equation, a differential equation in the flip angle itself, rather than in magnetization, is derived. As this equation has a substantial linear component that is an instance of Fourier's equation, the intuitive approach is seen to be justified. Examples of the accuracy of this higher tip angle approximation are given for both constant- and variable-phase pulses.

Edge detection and contour smoothing of particles imaged by dSTORM

Our goal now is to obtain a faithful contour of each particle and use it for measuring different geometric features such as the particle area, area overlap and deformations. To this end we must first segment the image, that is separate the particle from the background and determine the boundary. There are several methods in image analysis to accomplish this, all with their advantages and pitfalls. More sophisticated methods involve gradients or Laplacians of the image. What characterizes an edge is a sharp change in intensity, making derivatives well suited to capture their locations. We use the Laplacian of Gaussian edge detector in Matlab (MathWorks, Inc. USA), which allows for edges to be selected based on their strength, and not on image intensity values. It also produces closed contours without branching, unlike methods based solely on thresholding. The Laplacian of Gaussian edge detection consists of the following steps: first the image is smoothed by convolution with a Gaussian kernel, then the Laplacian (second derivative in 2D) is calculated and finally the zero-crossings are found which correspond to edges. Examples for the image segmentation done with this method, starting from a dSTORM image of a typical round and a more compressed and deformed particle are shown in Supplementary Fig. 8. The two particles also display different intensities (i.e. density of blinking events detected), yet we can see that the overall shapes and sizes are well captured, with a decrease in size and deformations clearly visible for the second example. Nonetheless, the presence of significant roughness of the contour remains an obstacle in characterizing shape deformations. Visual inspection of the original deformed particle image clearly suggest five corners and nearly flat facets and this are the features to isolate by image analysis. In order to smooth the particle contours while maintaining the prominent shape features we need to eliminate small scale shape fluctuations without significantly altering the overall larger scale shape and corners. To this end we use the method of Fourier descriptors, which has been used for a variety of applications involving image analysis. By taking the Fourier transform of the contour different spatial frequencies can be separated, then, by appropriate filtering, a smoothed contour can be retrieved and used as a starting point for further analysis. First, coordinates of the boundary pixels with respect to the particle′s center of mass are extracted from the segmented image and ordered counterclockwise. We thus obtain a discrete curve [x j, y j] with j = 1. N where N is the number of pixels. Then, the coordinates are transformed into complex numbers as z j = x j + iy j. Now the Fourier descriptors Z (k) are calculated using a discrete Fourier transform

### Editorial commentary: the power of interpretation: utilizing the P value as a spectrum, in addition to effect size, will lead to accurate presentation of results [^14424881]. Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistics have helped develop evidence-based medicine. Comparing groups and rejecting (or not) a null hypothesis is a main principle of the scientific method. Many studies have demonstrated that drawing conclusions based on the statistical result of a dichotomic P value instead of a spectrum can mislead us to conclude that there is "no difference" between two groups, or two treatments. In addition to the P value, the utilization of effect size (magnitude of difference between studied groups), may help us obtain a better global understanding of the statement "no effect". Although statistical significance does not mean clinical significance, by learning to adequately interpret data, we can disclose transparent results and conclusions, as we ward off our own bias. After all, without appropriate interpretation, we may be blinded from the truth.
