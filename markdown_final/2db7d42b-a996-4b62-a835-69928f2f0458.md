## Question

Hyperkalemia complications

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the complications of hyperkalemia, organized by severity, mechanism, and context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define hyperkalemia and stratify severity. Then, I should verify the immediate life-threatening cardiac complications and their electrophysiologic basis. Next, I will examine neuromuscular complications and their thresholds. After that, I need to assess systemic and renal consequences, including renal tubular acidosis and neuropathy. Then, I should review iatrogenic and treatment-related complications. I will now examine long-term outcomes and mortality associations, followed by recurrence patterns and risk stratification. Finally, I should integrate guideline-based implications for monitoring and management, and close with a concise synthesis that distinguishes acute versus chronic consequences and highlights modifiable drivers like RAAS inhibitor use and diet [^1157By8d] [^116EoAM1].

> Let me first confirm the definition and severity stratification, because everything downstream depends on this. Hyperkalemia is generally defined as serum potassium greater than 5.0 mmol/L, with severity categories varying by guideline; the UK Kidney Association uses mild greater than 5.5, moderate greater than 6.0, and severe greater than 6.5 mmol/L, while the ESC uses slightly lower cut points, and KDIGO emphasizes integrating potassium level with ECG changes to classify severity, which I should keep in mind to avoid overreliance on a single number [^1172XMC2] [^114ypRXH] [^113hTA5U].

> Now, I will examine the most dangerous complications, namely cardiac arrhythmias and arrest, and I need to ensure I anchor this in pathophysiology. Elevated extracellular potassium depolarizes the resting membrane potential, inactivates fast sodium channels, slows conduction, and predisposes to ventricular fibrillation, asystole, and pulseless electrical activity; this is why membrane stabilization with calcium is first-line in severe cases with ECG changes, and why guidelines advise continuous ECG monitoring for potassium greater than or equal to 6.5 mmol/L or with any hyperkalemic ECG changes [^111gKdBN] [^1124Vteu].

> Wait, let me verify the ECG correlation with potassium level, because I recall a common pitfall here. I initially thought ECG changes reliably track potassium severity, but hold on, that is not accurate; classic progression from peaked T waves to PR prolongation, QRS widening, and sine waves can occur, yet many patients with severe hyperkalemia have normal ECGs, and ECG changes are not linearly correlated with potassium concentration, so I should not rely on a normal ECG to exclude danger, especially when potassium is rising rapidly or the patient is unstable [^113hTA5U] [^115YW31T] [^111gKdBN].

> Next, I should review neuromuscular complications and confirm the thresholds. Ascending muscle weakness and flaccid paralysis can occur with severe hyperkalemia, typically around potassium greater than 7.0 mmol/L, and respiratory muscle involvement can precipitate respiratory failure; paresthesias may precede overt weakness, so I need to ask about limb heaviness, tingling, or dyspnea in patients with markedly elevated potassium [^113hTA5U].

> I will now examine systemic and renal consequences beyond the heart and nerves. Hyperkalemia can precipitate renal tubular acidosis, likely via impaired distal tubular hydrogen secretion, and chronic hyperkalemia has been associated with peripheral neuropathy in CKD cohorts; importantly, hyperkalemia — or fear of it — often leads to down-titration or discontinuation of RAAS inhibitors, which paradoxically worsens cardiorenal outcomes, so I should weigh this carefully when attributing causality to potassium alone [^1157By8d] [^111XW4c8] [^112Sp5EZ].

> Let me consider iatrogenic and treatment-related complications, and I should double-check the hypoglycemia risk with insulin. Hypoglycemia occurs in roughly 17% of ED patients receiving insulin for hyperkalemia, with higher risk when pretreatment glucose is low, insulin dose is high, or dextrose dose is insufficient; to mitigate this, I should favor 5 units of insulin or 0.1 units/kg with 50 g dextrose and monitor glucose for at least 4–6 hours, recognizing that insulin's effect may outlast dextrose [^112tSwGq] [^117RVpgL].

> Hold on, I should verify the role and risks of potassium binders, especially older agents. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate has been linked to serious gastrointestinal adverse events including bowel necrosis, whereas patiromer and zirconium cyclosilicate are generally better tolerated and effective for chronic control; in acute settings, patiromer can be considered when rapid gastrointestinal potassium removal is needed, but I need to ensure RAAS inhibitors are not abruptly stopped solely due to binder use, and I should discontinue patiromer if RAAS therapy is stopped to avoid masking rebound hyperkalemia [^117Ak97J] [^115hJrrW] [^112T6QDP].

> Next, I should review long-term outcomes and mortality associations, and I need to be cautious about causality. Large observational cohorts show a U-shaped relationship between potassium and mortality in CKD, with increased all-cause mortality beginning around potassium greater than 5.5 mmol/L and rising further with higher levels; however, hyperkalemia also functions as a marker of illness severity, and some signals persist after adjustment, suggesting both direct toxicity and confounding by comorbidity burden and RAAS inhibitor exposure [^115B7JKF] [^1164Cw7N] [^114ndiGF].

> I should confirm recurrence patterns because they shape follow-up intensity. After an episode of severe hyperkalemia, recurrence is common within 6 months, especially in CKD and heart failure, and potassium trajectories after discharge track mortality; therefore, I need to plan close laboratory surveillance and consider preventive strategies such as binder therapy and optimized RAAS management rather than reflexively stopping beneficial drugs [^115B7JKF] [^117BrjRe].

> Let me integrate guideline-based implications for monitoring and management, and I should verify the thresholds for urgent action. Severe hyperkalemia greater than or equal to 6.5 mmol/L warrants urgent hospital assessment and continuous ECG monitoring, with a standardized 5-step approach: stabilize the membrane, shift potassium intracellularly, remove potassium from the body, address precipitants, and reassess; in patients on RAAS inhibitors, I should check urea and electrolytes 1–2 weeks after initiation or dose titration and consider dose reduction only if potassium is 5.5–5.9 mmol/L, while avoiding discontinuation whenever possible to preserve cardiorenal benefit [^111rrGqp] [^1148w6NC] [^117D6kdv] [^113pqGhr].

> But wait, what if the patient is on hemodialysis or presents with cardiac arrest; I need to ensure I tailor therapy. In hemodialysis patients with severe hyperkalemia, urgent dialysis is indicated, but if dialysis is delayed, standard pharmacologic therapies including IV calcium should be initiated; in cardiac arrest where hyperkalemia is suspected or known, calcium chloride is preferred for membrane stabilization alongside standard ALS, and I should actively consider hyperkalemia as a reversible cause during resuscitation [^1114vbYY] [^1156gGZL] [^111LFAxS] [^1179NdyX].

> Finally, I will synthesize the complications succinctly to ensure internal consistency. Acute complications include life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, asystole, and conduction blockade driven by membrane depolarization and inactivation of fast sodium channels; severe neuromuscular weakness and respiratory failure can occur at higher potassium levels; systemic consequences include renal tubular acidosis and neuropathy; iatrogenic complications include insulin-associated hypoglycemia and binder-related GI adverse effects; chronic consequences include increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, recurrent hyperkalemia, and underuse of RAAS inhibitors with attendant cardiorenal harm, all of which argue for proactive surveillance, risk stratification, and selective use of modern potassium binders to maintain disease-modifying therapy [^111gKdBN] [^113hTA5U] [^1157By8d] [^112Sp5EZ] [^117BrjRe].

Hyperkalemia causes **life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias** (ventricular fibrillation, asystole, and pulseless electrical activity) [^111gKdBN] and **sudden cardiac death** [^114wT2Gr], especially when potassium rises rapidly or is severely elevated [^11415M5d]. It also causes **progressive neuromuscular weakness** [^113hTA5U] and ascending flaccid paralysis, including respiratory muscle involvement, which can lead to respiratory failure [^113hTA5U]. Additional complications include metabolic acidosis, impaired renal function, and treatment-related hypoglycemia from insulin therapy [^112tSwGq]. Severe hyperkalemia is associated with **high short-term mortality** [^117Jznpv] and long-term cardiovascular events, particularly in patients with CKD or heart failure [^11512bk5] [^115LazZF].

---

## Cardiac complications

Cardiac complications are the **most critical and immediately life-threatening** consequences of hyperkalemia:

- **Ventricular fibrillation (VF)**: Rapid, chaotic ventricular activity causing hemodynamic collapse and sudden cardiac death [^notfound].

- **Asystole**: Complete absence of ventricular activity, leading to cardiac arrest [^notfound].

- **Pulseless electrical activity (PEA)**: Electrical activity without effective mechanical contraction, resulting in cardiac arrest [^notfound].

- **Sudden cardiac death (SCD)**: Strongly associated with severe hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with CKD or heart failure [^115B7JKF].

---

## Neuromuscular complications

Hyperkalemia significantly affects neuromuscular function, leading to **ascending flaccid paralysis** — progressive weakness beginning distally and advancing proximally, potentially involving respiratory muscles and causing respiratory failure [^113hTA5U] — and **paresthesias**, characterized by tingling or numbness, particularly in the extremities [^113hTA5U].

---

## Metabolic and renal complications

Hyperkalemia is associated with several **metabolic and renal complications**:

- **Metabolic acidosis**: Hyperkalemia can cause or exacerbate metabolic acidosis, further impairing cardiac and neuromuscular function [^notfound].

- **Impaired renal function**: Hyperkalemia often coexists with acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD), complicating management and increasing morbidity and mortality [^1164Cw7N].

- **Renal tubular acidosis**: Hyperkalemia can induce renal tubular acidosis, further impairing renal function and electrolyte balance [^111XW4c8].

---

## Treatment-related complications

Treatment of hyperkalemia can itself lead to **complications**:

- **Hypoglycemia**: Intravenous insulin therapy, commonly used to shift potassium intracellularly, can cause significant hypoglycemia, particularly in patients without diabetes or with low baseline glucose levels [^112tSwGq] [^117RVpgL].

- **Gastrointestinal complications**: Potassium-binding resins, such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate, can cause gastrointestinal adverse effects, including nausea, vomiting, and rarely intestinal necrosis [^112VbaDG].

---

## Clinical outcomes and mortality

Hyperkalemia is associated with **significant clinical outcomes and mortality**:

- **Short-term mortality**: Severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 6.5 mmol/L) is associated with high short-term mortality, particularly in hospitalized patients [^117Jznpv].

- **Long-term cardiovascular events**: Hyperkalemia is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events, including heart failure exacerbations, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death [^1164Cw7N] [^115LazZF].

- **Recurrent hyperkalemia**: Patients experiencing hyperkalemia are at high risk of recurrence, necessitating ongoing monitoring and management [^115B7JKF].

---

Hyperkalemia leads to **life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias**, neuromuscular weakness, metabolic disturbances, and treatment-related complications. It is associated with **high short-term mortality** and long-term cardiovascular events, especially in patients with CKD or heart failure.

### How dangerous is hyperkalemia? [^1179Cqu6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder appreciated with greater frequency in patients with renal disease, heart failure, and with use of certain medications such as renin angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors. The traditional views that hyperkalemia can be reliably diagnosed by electrocardiogram and that particular levels of hyperkalemia confer cardiotoxic risk have been challenged by several reports of patients with atypic presentations. Epidemiologic data demonstrate strong associations of morbidity and mortality in patients with hyperkalemia but these associations appear disconnected in certain patient populations and in differing clinical presentations. Physiologic adaptation, structural cardiac disease, medication use, and degree of concurrent illness might predispose certain patients presenting with hyperkalemia to a lower or higher threshold for toxicity. These factors are often overlooked; yet data suggest that the clinical context in which hyperkalemia develops is at least as important as the degree of hyperkalemia is in determining patient outcome. This review summarizes the clinical data linking hyperkalemia with poor outcomes and discusses how the efficacy of certain treatments might depend on the clinical presentation.

Background and Objectives

Hyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Prompt recognition and expeditious treatment of severe hyperkalemia are expected to save lives. This review is intended to provide intensivists and other interested clinicians with an understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies hyperkalemia, and a rational approach to its management.

Methods

This article reviews and analyzes literature relevant to the pathophysiology and management of severe hyperkalemia. Methods include search of MEDLINE, and bibliographic search of current textbooks and journal articles.

Results and Conclusions

A more complete understanding of potassium homeostasis in recent years has led to new approaches to the management of severe hyperkalemia. The physiologically based sequential approach still applies. The efficacy, pitfalls, and risks of the agents available for use at each step in the sequence are critically reviewed. Rational use of the available tools will allow clinicians to successfully treat severe hyperkalemia.

### Tailoring treatment of hyperkalemia [^112Sp5EZ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disorder that may be rapidly life-threatening because of its cardiac toxicity. Hyperkalemia risk factors are numerous and often combined in the same patient. Most of the strategies to control serum potassium level in the short term have been used for decades. However, evidence for their efficacy and safety remains low. Treatment of hyperkalemia remains challenging, poorly codified, with a risk of overtreatment, including short-term side effects, and with the priority of avoiding unnecessary hospital stays or chronic medication changes. Recently, new oral treatments have been proposed for non-life-threatening hyperkalemia, with encouraging results. Their role in the therapeutic arsenal remains uncertain. Finally, a growing body of evidence suggests that hyperkalemia might negatively impact outcomes in the long term in patients with chronic heart failure or kidney failure through underdosing or withholding of cardiovascular medication (e.g. renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors). Recognition of efficacy and potential side effects of treatment may help in tailoring treatments to the patient's status and conditions. In this review we discuss how treatment of hyperkalemia could be tailored to the patient's conditions and status, both on the short and mid term.

Hyperkalemia represents a widespread and potentially lethal condition that affects millions of people across their lives. Despite the prevalence and severity of the condition, there are no consensus guidelines on the treatment of hyperkalemia or even a standard definition. Herein, we provide a succinct review of what we believe to be the most significant misconceptions encountered in the emergency care of hyperkalemia, examine current available literature, and discuss practical points on several modalities of hyperkalemia treatment. Additionally, we review the pathophysiology of the electrocardiographic effects of hyperkalemia and how intravenous calcium preparations can antagonize these effects. We conclude each section with recommendations to aid emergency physicians in making safe and efficacious choices for the treatment of acute hyperkalemia.

### Disorders of potassium [^114WHxyU]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Potassium disorders are the most common electrolyte abnormality identified in clinical practice. Presenting symptoms are similar for both hypo- and hyperkalemia, primarily affecting the cardiac, neuromuscular, and gastrointestinal systems. Generally, mild hypokalemia is the most common potassium disorder seen clinically; however, severe complications can occur. Hyperkalemia is less common but more serious, especially if levels are rising rapidly. The etiologies and treatments for both hypo- and hyperkalemia are discussed, with special emphasis on the role medications play in the etiologies of each.

Hyperkalemia is a common and potentially lethal disorder. Given its variable presentation, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease. The present case highlights key physiologic mechanisms in the development of hyperkalemia and provides an outline for emergent treatment. In this context, we discuss specific mechanisms of action of available treatments of hyperkalemia.

1 INTRODUCTION

Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome with high morbidity and mortality that has acquired pandemic dimensions, affecting more than 38 million people worldwide. 1 In addition, the progressive nature of HF makes it a leading cause of hospitalization, due to the deleterious effects of sustained neurohormonal activation and comorbidities. 2 Electrolytic disturbances, most usually of potassium levels, very often accompany HF, are a hindrance to the optimization of medication and impose a further burden on the patient. Since potassium plays a major role in cardiac excitability and arrhythmias, dyskalemia is an important clinical problem that is associated with significant life‐threatening complications. 3, 4 Although the definition is not consistent always, hyperkalemia is generally defined as a serum potassium level > 5.0 to 5.5 mEq/L and can be further classified as mild (5.6‐6.0 mEq/L), moderate (6.1‐7.0 mEq/L), and severe (> 7.0 mEq/L). Potassium secretion is highly dependent on renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) activity and renal perfusion, as well as sodium availability to the distal nephron. Hyperkalemia represents both a direct risk for cardiovascular morbidity and a potential biomarker of adverse prognosis and disease severity. Patients with HF are at particularly high risk for hyperkalemia, which is likely to reflect some medical comorbidity, especially renal dysfunction. In addition, it is one of the most common factors that impede the optimum pharmaceutical approach to HF, leading to underuse of renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), which are the drugs that offer the most help and have changed the outcomes of HF patients. 5 Unfortunately, some additional independent risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus (DM), advanced age and renal insufficiency, that exacerbate all‐cause and in‐hospital mortality and hospitalizations in HF patients, also further increase the risk of hyperkalemia. At the opposite end of the scale is hypokalemia, which can also be observed in HF patients and can increase the risk of mortality, mainly via arrhythmogenic complications. 6, 7, 8 Thus, both high and low potassium levels are unacceptable in HF patients. Data from the literature highlight the need for careful potassium monitoring, especially in the presence of comorbidities, with special emphasis being placed on patients with a low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). 5

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: foe or friend? [^1156aaAN]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The extent to which hyperkalemia is implicated in the morbidity of HF patients is difficult to assess, since it may be asymptomatic and may only be discovered through routine blood screening, or as a consequence of the condition leading to hospitalization (eg, infection, dehydration, or deteriorating kidney function), rather than causing the hospitalization itself. Patients at high risk for hyperkalemia are often those with disease states such as HF and CKD, who also stand to benefit most from RAASi. However, most clinical trials have excluded patients with advanced CKD, who are those at the highest risk for hyperkalemia; consequently, we lack evidence regarding the therapeutic management and long‐term outcomes in this population.

Key messages

- Severe hyperkalemia occurs with diverse precipitating factors in patients with various medical conditions.

- An increased in-hospital mortality rate is significantly associated with severe underlying disease and coexisting medical conditions as well as with severe hyperkalemia itself.

- More importantly, the mortality rate is higher in patients with normal baseline renal function than in those with underlying CKD.

### Hyperkalemia: pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^1157By8d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

There have been significant recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain potassium homoeostasis and the clinical consequences of hyperkalemia. In this article we discuss these advances within a concise review of the pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences of hyperkalemia. We highlight aspects that are of particular relevance for clinical practice. Hyperkalemia occurs when renal potassium excretion is limited by reductions in glomerular filtration rate, tubular flow, distal sodium delivery or the expression of aldosterone-sensitive ion transporters in the distal nephron. Accordingly, the major risk factors for hyperkalemia are renal failure, diabetes mellitus, adrenal disease and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or potassium-sparing diuretics. Hyperkalemia is associated with an increased risk of death, and this is only in part explicable by hyperkalemia-induced cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to its well-established effects on cardiac excitability, hyperkalemia could also contribute to peripheral neuropathy and cause renal tubular acidosis. Hyperkalemia-or the fear of hyperkalemia-contributes to the underprescription of potentially beneficial medications, particularly in heart failure. The newer potassium binders could play a role in attempts to minimize reduced prescribing of renin-angiotensin inhibitors and mineraolocorticoid antagonists in this context.

### Updates on medical management of hyperkalemia [^117FVX6D]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hyperkalemia is a potentially fatal electrolyte disorder, more commonly present when the potassium excretion capacity is imparied. Hyperkalemia can lead to adverse outcomes, especially due to severe cardiac arrhythmias. It can also impair the cardiovascular effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASis) and potassium rich diets, as hyperkalemia frequently leads to their discontinuation.

Recent Findings

Potassium is a predictor of mortality and should be monitored closely for patients who are at risk for hyperkalemia. Acute hyperkalemia protocols have been revised and updated. Randomized trials have shown that the new anti-hyperkalemic agents (patiromer and zirconium cyclosilicate) are effective hyperkalemia treatment options. The use of anti-hyperkalemic agents may allow for a less restrictive potassium diet and lower RAASi discontinuation rates.

Summary

Hyperkalemia should be monitored closely for high-risk patients, as it is associated with adverse outcomes. New therapies have demonstrated effective control, offering hope for potential use in patients that would benefit from diet or medications associated with an increase in serum potassium, indicating that the use of hyperkalemic agents can be associated with better outcomes.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: foe or friend? [^11512bk5]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a frequent and sometimes life-threatening condition that may be associated with arrhythmia and cardiac dysfunction in patients with heart failure (HF). High potassium levels in HF represent both a direct risk for cardiovascular complication and an indirect biomarker of the severity of the underlying disease, reflecting neurohormonal activation and renal dysfunction. Evaluating the prevalence and significance of hyperkalemia in HF patients is essential for optimizing the use of potassium sparing agents, such the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, which represent a well-established cornerstone and life-saving therapy. In this review we discuss recent findings and current concepts related to the epidemiology, pathological mechanisms and implications of hyperkalemia, as well as novel therapeutic approaches to counteract it in patients with HF. The balance between optimizing life-saving potassium sparing medication and minimizing hyperkalemia-associated risk is much needed in patients with HF. Although older potassium-binding agents are associated with serious adverse events, novel potassium-binding drugs are effective in lowering potassium levels and are generally well tolerated. Novel potassium-binding drugs, such as patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, may help to optimize therapy in HF and achieve guideline-recommended doses. Hyperkalemia is common in HF patients and is associated with a poorer prognosis and an increased risk of cardiovascular complications: Contrariwise, "moderate" potassium levels go with a better prognosis, while the emergence of new drugs, potassium binders, could allow target doses of RAASi to be achieved.

### The management of hyperkalemia in patients with cardiovascular disease [^113km3w7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The development of hyperkalemia is common in patients with cardiac and kidney disease who are administered drugs that antagonize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). As the results of large-scale clinical trials in hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and congestive heart failure demonstrate benefits of RAAS blockade alone or, in some cases, in combination therapies, the incidence of hyperkalemia has increased in clinical practice. Although there is potential for adverse events in the presence of hyperkalemia, there also are potential benefits of RAAS blockers that support their use in high-risk patient populations. Management of hyperkalemia may be improved by identifying the levels of potassium that may potentially induce harm and using appropriate strategies to avert the levels that may be dangerous or life threatening.

### Hyperkalemia treatment standard [^11415M5d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disturbance in both inpatient and outpatient clinical practice. The severity and associated risk depends on the underlying cause and rate of potassium (K+) increase. Acute hyperkalemia requires immediate attention due to potentially life-threatening manifestations resulting from the rapid increase in plasma K+ concentration. Treatment is initially focused on stabilizing the cardiac membrane, followed by maneuvers to shift K+ into the cells, and ultimately initiating strategies to decrease total body K+ content. Chronic hyperkalemia develops over a more extended period of time and manifestations tend to be less severe. Nevertheless, the disorder is not benign since chronic hyperkalemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The approach to patients with chronic hyperkalemia begins with a review of medications potentially responsible for the disorder, ensuring effective diuretic therapy and correcting metabolic acidosis if present. The practice of restricting foods high in K+ to manage hyperkalemia is being reassessed since the evidence supporting the effectiveness of this strategy is lacking. Rather, dietary restriction should be more nuanced, focusing on reducing the intake of nonplant sources of K+. Down-titration and/or discontinuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors should be discouraged since these drugs improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and proteinuric kidney disease. In addition to other conservative measures, K+ binding drugs and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors can assist in maintaining the use of these drugs.

### Pharmacological interventions for the acute management of hyperkalaemia in adults [^114mdtLH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperkalaemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disturbance which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and death. Renal replacement therapy is known to be effective in treating hyperkalaemia, but safe and effective pharmacological interventions are needed to prevent dialysis or avoid the complications of hyperkalaemia until dialysis is performed.

Objectives

This review looked at the benefits and harms of pharmacological treatments used in the acute management of hyperkalaemia in adults. This review evaluated the therapies that reduce serum potassium as well as those that prevent complications of hyperkalaemia.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 18 August 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs looking at any pharmacological intervention for the acute management of hyperkalaemia in adults were included in this review. Non-standard study designs such as cross-over studies were also included. Eligible studies enrolled adults (aged 18 years and over) with hyperkalaemia, defined as serum potassium concentration ≥ 4.9 mmol/L, to receive pharmacological therapy to reduce serum potassium or to prevent arrhythmias. Patients with artificially induced hyperkalaemia were excluded from this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

All three authors screened titles and abstracts, and data extraction and risk of bias assessment was performed independently by at least two authors. Studies reported in non-English language journals were translated before assessment. Authors were contacted when information about results or study methodology was missing from the original publication. Although we planned to group all studies of a particular pharmacological therapy regardless of administration route or dose for analysis, we were unable to conduct meta-analyses because of the small numbers of studies evaluating any given treatment. For continuous data we reported mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included seven studies (241 participants) in this review. Meta-analysis of these seven included studies was not possible due to heterogeneity of the treatments and because many of the studies did not provide sufficient statistical information with their results. Allocation and blinding methodology was poorly described in most studies. No study evaluated the efficacy of pharmacological interventions for preventing clinically relevant outcomes such as mortality and cardiac arrhythmias; however there is evidence that several commonly used therapies effectively reduce serum potassium levels. Salbutamol administered via either nebulizer or metered-dose inhaler (MDI) significantly reduced serum potassium compared with placebo. The peak effect of 10 mg nebulised salbutamol was seen at 120 minutes (MD -1.29 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.64 to -0.94) and at 90 minutes for 20 mg nebulised salbutamol (1 study: MD -1.18 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.54 to -0.82). One study reported 1.2 mg salbutamol via MDI 1.2 mg produced a significant decrease in serum potassium beginning at 10 minutes (MD -0.20 mmol/L, P < 0.05) and a maximal decrease at 60 minutes (MD -0.34 mmol/L, P < 0.0001). Intravenous (IV) and nebulised salbutamol produced comparable effects (2 studies). When compared to other interventions, salbutamol had similar effect to insulin-dextrose (2 studies) but was more effective than bicarbonate at 60 minutes (MD -0.46 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.10; 1 study). Insulin-dextrose was more effective than IV bicarbonate (1 study) and aminophylline (1 study). Insulin-dextrose, bicarbonate and aminophylline were not studied in any placebo-controlled studies. None of the included studies evaluated the effect of IV calcium or potassium binding resins in the treatment of hyperkalaemia.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence for the acute pharmacological management of hyperkalaemia is limited, with no clinical studies demonstrating a reduction in adverse patient outcomes. Of the studied agents, salbutamol via any route and IV insulin-dextrose appear to be most effective at reducing serum potassium. There is limited evidence to support the use of other interventions, such as IV sodium bicarbonate or aminophylline. The effectiveness of potassium binding resins and IV calcium salts has not been tested in RCTs and requires further study before firm recommendations for clinical practice can be made.

CONSEQUENCES OF HYPERKALEMIA

The most notorious consequence of hyperkalemia is that of potentially fatal cardiac dysrhythmia. However, there are several other consequences worthy of discussion. Hyperkalemia is associated with increased mortality (although we do not know whether hyperkalemia causes increased mortality outside of the context of cardiac arrhythmia in extreme hyperkalemia). Consequently, hyperkalemia — or the fear of hyperkalemia — may prompt changes in prescribing practice (e.g. avoiding RAS blockade and MRAs). Finally, recent data show that hyperkalemia can cause renal tubular acidosis and may contribute to peripheral neuropathy in CKD patients.

Mortality: epidemiology

Large observational studies demonstrate an association between hyperkalemia and an increased risk of death. In a meta-analysis of data from > 1.2 million individuals with CKD, serum [K +] exhibited a U-shaped relationship with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, with a nadir at ∼4.2 mM. The adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was ∼1.22 for [K +] > 5.5 mM. This association persisted after adjustment for a large number of covariates. However, as there have been no large interventional studies testing the effects of potassium-lowering therapies (or of plasma [K +] targets) per se on mortality, we do not know whether this association is due to residual confounding (i.e. whether or not mild-to-moderate hyperkalemia causes an increased risk of death).

The most plausible mechanism whereby hyperkalemia could cause death is by the induction of fatal cardiac arrhythmia. In patients with acute myocardial infarction, hyperkalemia did indeed increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. However, there are some observations to suggest that any mortality risk associated with hyperkalemia cannot be solely attributed to arrhythmogenic death. For example, in a racially diverse population of community-dwelling older adults, hyperkalemia was not associated with sudden cardiac death, whereas it was associated with death from cancer and other non-cardiac causes. Moreover, adverse outcomes have been associated with higher plasma [K +] values that remain well within the reference range. Therefore we still have much to learn about the methodology of epidemiological studies in this area and/or the pathogenic consequences of hyperkalemia.

### Severe hyperkalemia requiring hospitalization: predictors of mortality [^116A99hS]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Severe hyperkalemia, requiring hospitalization and prompt treatment, occurs in patients with diverse medical conditions; precipitating factors also vary. The mortality rate increases in patients with greater differences between the admission and highest serum K + levels, in patients with MOF or cardiac arrest (or both) at the time of hyperkalemia diagnosis, in those with severe underlying diseases, in those with coexisting medical conditions, and in those who develop AKI from normal baseline renal function, as opposed to those with underlying CKD, with or without AKI.

Consequently, controlling and maintaining the serum K + level within a safe range have great importance in the clinical setting. Determining additional risk factors for severe hyperkalemia may be valuable and instructive to clinicians in the identification of high-risk patients and in the effective management of severe hyperkalemia.

### Management of hyperkalemia: an update for the internist [^112sDH5S]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a clinically important electrolyte abnormality that occurs most commonly in patients with chronic kidney disease. Due to its propensity to induce electrophysiological disturbances, severe hyperkalemia is considered a medical emergency. The management of acute and chronic hyperkalemia can be achieved through the implementation of various interventions, one of which is the elimination of medications that can raise serum potassium levels. Because many such medications (especially inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system) have shown beneficial effects in patients with cardiovascular and renal disease, their discontinuation for reasons of hyperkalemia represent an undesirable clinical compromise. The emergence of 2 new potassium-binding medications for acute and chronic therapy of hyperkalemia may soon allow the continued use of medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors even in patients who are prone to hyperkalemia. This review article provides an overview of the physiology and the pathophysiology of potassium metabolism and hyperkalemia, the epidemiology of hyperkalemia, and its acute and chronic management. We discuss in detail emerging data about new potassium-lowering therapies, and their potential future role in clinical practice.

### Long-term mortality and trajectory of potassium measurements following an episode of acute severe hyperkalaemia [^115B7JKF]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What is already known about this subject?

severe hyperkalaemia is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with a higher risk of short-term adverse clinical events such as ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Information about the long-term clinical consequences after an episode of severe hyperkalaemia remains scarce; and
we conducted a retrospective observational study that evaluated the long-term the trajectory of potassium and risk of mortality in patients with acute severe hyperkalaemia (K > 6 mEq/L).

What this study adds?

severe hyperkalaemia may occur in patients who did not have chronic kidney disease (25% of our patients);
after developing severe hyperkalaemia, recurrent hyperkalaemia is a frequent finding, especially during the first 6 months after the discharge;
following an acute severe hyperkalaemia episode, potassium trajectories predict the risk of death; and
during the post-discharge follow-up, transitioning from normal to higher potassium levels or persisting high values was associated with higher risk of death.

What impact this may have on practice or policy?

this study strengthens the importance of close clinical and potassium monitoring after an episode of acute hyperkalaemia; and
it reinforces the fact that new and well-tolerated treatments after discharge from a hyperkalaemia-related hospitalization should be strongly considered.

### An evidence-based narrative review of the emergency department management of acute hyperkalemia [^111ncDVe]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The normal range for potassium is within narrow limits. Hyperkalemia is an electrolyte disorder that frequently affects patients in the emergency department (ED), and can result in significant morbidity and mortality if not identified and treated rapidly.

Objective

This article provides an evidence-based narrative review of the management of hyperkalemia, with focused updates for the emergency clinician.

Methods

We searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases for articles in English published in peer-reviewed journals and indexed up until May 2020. We used multiple search terms, including hyperkalemia, potassium, acute hyperkalemia, emergency department, dyskalemia, potassium disorders, kidney disease, epidemiology, electrolyte disturbance, severe hyperkalemia, and emergency management.

Discussion

In the ED, interventions aimed to protect patients from the immediate dangers of elevated serum potassium are divided into the following: stabilizing cardiac membrane potentials, reducing serum potassium levels through shift from the extracellular fluid to intracellular fluid, and elimination of potassium through excretion via urinary or fecal excretion. Calcium is widely recommended to stabilize the myocardial cell membrane, but additional research is necessary to establish criteria for use, dosages, and preferred solutions. Redistribution of potassium ions from the bloodstream into the cells is based on intravenous insulin or nebulized β2-agonists.

Conclusions

Hyperkalemia is a frequent electrolyte disorder in the ED. Because of the risk of fatal dysrhythmia due to cardiac membrane instability, hyperkalemia is a medical emergency. There is a lack of scientific evidence on the optimal management of hyperkalemia and more research is needed to establish optimal strategies to manage acute hyperkalemia in the emergency department.

### An international Delphi consensus regarding best practice recommendations for hyperkalaemia across the cardiorenal spectrum [^1172XMC2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperkalaemia is a potentially life‐threatening medical condition of elevated blood potassium levels; 3.5–5.0 mEq/L is considered the normokalaemic range in adults, while instances of hyperkalaemia > 5.5 mEq/L are more clearly associated with adverse clinical outcomes. There is no universally accepted definition for hyperkalaemia severity. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommend using a lower cut‐off for mild (> 5.0 mEq/L), moderate (> 5.5 mEq/L), or severe (> 6.0 mEq/L) hyperkalaemia, for closer monitoring of patients who may be at risk of hyperkalaemic complications. Other guidelines, such as those endorsed by the UK Renal Association (UKRA), utilise a more stringent outcome‐associated definition (mild: > 5.5 mEq/L, moderate: > 6.0 mEq/L, and severe: > 6.5 mEq/L). Most individuals with hyperkalaemia (particularly those with mild hyperkalaemia) are asymptomatic but when symptoms do occur, they tend to be non‐specific. Untreated, severe hyperkalaemia can result in life‐threatening cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, paralysis, and mortality.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: foe or friend? [^1164YN3F]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, hyperkalemia has been associated with both increased and decreased mortality risk in various trials. 20, 28, 29, 30 This largely depends on the clinical substrate, that is, whether hyperkalemia is coming from renal dysfunction or due to potassium sparing drugs. The latter is associated with improved prognosis in specific populations and avoidance of hypokalemia. This may explain why a high potassium level may be protective especially in the long term. In contrast, in critically ill patients and in patients with chronic kidney disease, high potassium levels are associated with high rates of arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. Notwithstanding, published studies demonstrating an association of mortality with hyperkalemia are largely limited to retrospective analyses and have no design to provide evidence of causation.

Hoss et al. suggested that spironolactone and loop diuretic therapy appear to be safe in patients with high‐normal potassium levels, HF and reduced renal function and are associated with an improved outcome. 29

### Management of hyperkalemia with insulin and glucose: pearls for the emergency clinician [^117RVpgL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperkalemia is a common, potentially lethal clinical condition that accounts for a significant number of emergency department (ED) visits. Insulin and dextrose are frequently used to manage patients with hyperkalemia.

Objective

This narrative review evaluates several myths concerning hyperkalemia treatment with insulin and dextrose in the ED and provides recommendations based on the current evidence.

Discussion

Hyperkalemia is a life-threatening condition requiring emergent therapy. One of these therapies includes insulin with glucose. However, hypoglycemia after insulin use is a frequent complication during hyperkalemia management. The published literature suggests that low pretreatment glucose, no history of diabetes mellitus, female gender, abnormal renal function, and lower body weight increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Several strategies can reduce the risk of hypoglycemia with insulin therapy, which include using insulin 5 units or 0.1 units/kg instead of 10 units, administering dextrose 50 g instead of 25 g, or administering dextrose as a prolonged infusion instead of a rapid intravenous bolus. Because insulin may have a duration of action that exceeds dextrose, patients receiving insulin for hyperkalemia should be monitored for hypoglycemia hourly for at least 4–6 h after administration.

Conclusion

Several myths surround hyperkalemia management with insulin and dextrose. This review evaluates the evidence concerning insulin and glucose for hyperkalemia and suggests several modifications to insulin and dextrose dosing to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.

### Hyperkalemia and the risks of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^115LazZF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Hyperkalemia, defined as an elevated serum potassium concentration (> 5.0 mmol/L), is commonly observed in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) owing to their diminished excretory capacity. The presence of hyperkalemia, particularly moderate‐to‐severe hyperkalemia, has consistently been shown as a risk factor for poor cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CKD, including an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; a composite outcome of all‐cause mortality, hospitalized myocardial infarction, or hospitalized stroke) and hospitalization for other cardiovascular events and heart failure. However, most published studies lacked optimal control of confounding; thus, the validity and strength of the associations described have remained questionable. Furthermore, although patients with CKD often receive medications that increase serum potassium concentrations (specifically, renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system inhibitors [RAASi]) that can slow CKD progression and reduce cardiovascular risk, these medications may trigger or exacerbate hyperkalemia, making hyperkalemia more common among patients with CKD than in other populations. In clinical practice, RAASi are often dose reduced or discontinued when hyperkalemia develops, potentially reducing longer‐term cardiovascular and kidney benefits that may be derived from these drugs.

To confirm or refute the previously described association between hyperkalemia and related cardiovascular events in a population vulnerable to hyperkalemia, this study employed a rigorous double‐matching approach to control for confounding. We also examined the association between hyperkalemia and cardiovascular events in 2 highly clinically relevant subgroups — patients with mild hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.0 and < 5.5 mmol/L) and patients treated with RAASi, including angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. The primary study end point was MACE plus (MACE+), which was defined as a composite outcome that included all‐cause mortality along with nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure in the hospital setting. Secondary end points included (1) a composite of new onset atrial fibrillation and other atrial and ventricular arrythmias; and (2) heart failure alone. MACE (without heart failure) was assessed as an exploratory end point.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^113hTA5U]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyperkalemia:

- **Definition**: Hyperkalemia is defined as an increase in serum potassium levels > 5.0 mmol/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of hyperkalemia involves disruptions in potassium balance due to excess potassium intake, impaired potassium excretion, or transcellular shifts. The etiology is often multifactorial, with impaired renal function, medication use, and hyperglycemia being the most common contributors.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyperkalemia in the US is estimated at 1,550 per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Mild and moderate hyperkalemia are usually asymptomatic. Severe cases may manifest as muscle weakness, ascending paralysis, heart palpitations, and paresthesias. ECG changes associated with hyperkalemia include peaked T waves, P-wave flattening, PR-interval prolongation, widening of the QRS complex, and sine waves.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of hyperkalemia is dependent on the severity of the condition and the promptness of treatment. Severe untreated hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.

### Consensus-based recommendations for the management of hyperkalemia in the hemodialysis setting [^112Ruzdf]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia (serum K + > 5.0 mmol/L) is commonly observed among patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis and associated with increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Current international guidelines may not reflect the latest evidence on managing hyperkalemia in patients undergoing hemodialysis, and there is a lack of high-quality published studies in this area. This consensus guideline aims to provide recommendations in relation to clinical practice. Available published evidence was evaluated through a systematic literature review, and the nominal group technique was used to develop consensus recommendations from a panel of experienced nephrologists, covering monitoring, dietary restrictions, prescription of K + binders, and concomitant prescription of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. Recent studies have shown that K + binders reduce the incidence of hyperkalemia, but further evidence is needed in areas including whether reduced-K + diets or treatment with K + binders improve patient-centered outcomes. Treatment of hyperkalemia in the hemodialysis setting is complex, and decisions need to be tailored for individual patients.

### Consequences of recurrent hyperkalemia on cardiovascular outcomes and mortality [^117BrjRe]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia (HK), an electrolyte disorder characterized by abnormally high levels of serum potassium (K+), is an established complication of reduced renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or acute renal failure. Serious clinical outcomes of HK include muscle weakness, paralysis, cardiovascular (CV) abnormalities (eg, conduction abnormalities, arrhythmia, and atrial fibrillation), and death.

In the United States, the prevalence of HK is 1.6% in the general population but higher in individuals with certain comorbid conditions such as hypertension (2.6%), stage 3 CKD (5.0%), and heart failure (HF) (9.6%).CKD is a known risk factor for HK recurrence, defined as ≥ 2 HK events (serum K+ concentration > 5.0 mEq/l) ≥ 7 days apart; in 1 study, over one-half of patients with stage 3 or 4 CKD had recurrent HK over a 6-month follow-up period. Additionally, among patients diagnosed with HF who had an HK episode, the proportion experiencing a second, third, or fourth HK episode was 43%, 54%, and 60%, respectively. Thus, patients with CKD including those with concomitant HF are at high risk of recurrent HK.

HK, CKD, and CV outcomes are interconnected through regulatory mechanisms that govern the CV and renal systems including the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. As such, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASis), beta-blockers, and other pharmacologic agents used to treat HF and CKD can contribute to the development of HK. Among new RAASi users who experienced an HK event, more than one-third of (37%) had a recurrence within 6 months; the rates were even higher in patients with CKD (40%) and chronic HF (49%). The occurrence and recurrence of HK has been identified as a risk factor for poor renal outcomes, CV events, and death in patients with CKD and HF. Previous research has demonstrated an increased risk of adverse CV outcomes in patients with CKD, but it is unclear how this is impacted by recurrent HK in patients with stage 3 or 4 CKD.

### Patiromer induces rapid and sustained potassium lowering in patients with chronic kidney disease and hyperkalemia [^117Ak97J]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia may induce lethal cardiac arrhythmias. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially when treated with inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), have a high risk of hyperkalemia. Treatment of severe hyperkalemia involves pharmacologic stabilization of the cardiac membranes, moving potassium into cells, and finally removal of potassium from the body. With impaired renal function, removal of body potassium is limited to dialysis or augmentation of gastrointestinal potassium excretion.

Sodium polystyrene sulfonate and calcium polystyrene sulfonate have been utilized to increase fecal potassium excretion; however, despite their long history of clinical use, there is little evidence from prospective clinical trials demonstrating their efficacy; moreover, they may cause serious, life-threatening gastrointestinal adverse effects. The serious gastrointestinal adverse events, in combination with milder adverse reactions, including poor palatability, make these agents difficult for patients to tolerate, thereby limiting their utility in chronic care settings. As a consequence of the limitations to the use of medicines in chronically hyperkalemic individuals, clinicians frequently face the dilemma of reducing the dose of, or discontinuing, their patients' RAAS inhibitors (RAASis) in order to manage serum potassium elevations. In doing so, the physician is often forced to choose between the established benefit of RAASis in patients with CKD and the avoidance of a potentially life-threatening hyperkalemic complication.

Hyperkalemia in CKD — practice points emphasize awareness of variability in potassium measurement and local formulary constraints, note no recommendations for timing to recheck potassium or for managing hyperkalemia, and provide dietary guidance. In CKD G3–G5 with emergent hyperkalemia, implement an individualized approach including dietary and pharmacologic interventions with assessment and education through a renal dietitian or an accredited nutrition provider. Provide advice to limit the intake of foods rich in bioavailable potassium (e.g., processed foods) for people with CKD G3–G5 who experience hyperkalemia or when it is an emerging issue and for individuals with kidney failure receiving dialysis when intakes of potassium are variable, and consider dietary and pharmacologic strategies during disease periods in which hyperkalemia risk may be a concern.

### Hyperkalemia is associated with increased mortality among unselected cardiac intensive care unit patients [^114ndiGF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Although the association between hyperkalemia and adverse outcomes in this population may be explained by direct harmful effects of elevated potassium levels, we hypothesize that elevated potassium levels more likely serve as a marker to identify high‐risk patients with higher illness severity or more severe comorbidities. Potassium is essential for normal cardiac myocyte function including impulse conduction and coordinated myocardial contraction. 19 As such, disturbances in potassium levels can predispose patients to arrhythmia, which may account for the increased mortality rate and more frequent arrhythmia diagnoses seen in our patients with hypokalemia and hyperkalemia. 19, 20 However, we observed an increase in mortality at mildly elevated potassium levels below those usually associated with direct cardiac toxicity, indicating that arrhythmia alone is not the primary reason for the increase in mortality seen in our population. 21 Our patients with hypokalemia and hyperkalemia had higher illness severity; patients with hyperkalemia also had worse renal function. This implies that potassium abnormalities identify sicker patients with increased risk of mortality, and the effects of hypokalemia on mortality appeared to be mediated primarily by illness severity. Hyperkalemia remained associated with higher short‐ and long‐term mortality after adjustment for illness severity and markers of renal function, implying that hyperkalemia may identify patients with more dangerous forms of renal dysfunction. Our observed relationships between AKI severity and the mortality effects of hyperkalemia may suggest that renal tubular potassium‐handling abnormalities leading to hyperkalemia could be more important as a determinant of outcomes than the effect of reduced clearance alone or could modify the effects of reduced clearance on outcomes; this would explain why patients with severe AKI (and therefore severely reduced clearance) did not demonstrate an association between admission potassium levels and in‐hospital mortality. Hyperkalemia may modify the safety or efficacy of standard guideline‐directed medical therapies for patients with HF or ACS such as angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, potentially contributing further to adverse outcomes. 22, 23, 24

### Hyperkalemia and the risks of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^115gTidH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Proposed mechanisms linking hyperkalemia to cardiovascular disease in patients with CKD have long been based on increased levels of aldosterone secretion due to higher serum potassium concentrations. The acutely elevated serum potassium levels associated with hyperkalemia can therefore lead to kidney inflammation and fibrosis and has been associated with a higher risk of cardiac arrhythmia, caused by disruptions of myocardial action potentials that can interrupt typical heart rhythms. Although this underlying pathway may partially explain the observed outcomes, the majority of patients with hyperkalemia in the current study had mild or moderate hyperkalemia at the index date, which suggests that hyperkalemia increases the risk of cardiovascular events through multiple mechanisms. Though a prior study examining the impact of mild hyperkalemia compared with normokalemia on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure in the United States and Canada between 1991 and 1993 found no association between mild hyperkalemia and cardiovascular‐related hospitalization, the sample size was smaller and the follow‐up duration was shorter relative to the present study, which may explain the difference between findings. Together, the overall evidence suggests that hyperkalemia is implicated as an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease in a population with CKD.

### Potassium binding for conservative and preservative management of chronic kidney disease [^112ng2Kw]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hyperkalemia is a life-threatening complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Risk factors include advanced kidney impairment, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, and consumption of a K-enriched diet. High-K diets provide health benefits to include reductions in blood pressure, stroke risk, and osteoporosis. Individuals at the highest risk for developing hyperkalemia are those who would benefit most from high K diets. Inhibitors of the renin — angiotensin — aldosterone system (RAASi) are effective in reducing cardiovascular events and slowing the progression of CKD, yet hyperkalemia is a risk factor. Discussed are new strategies facilitating use of both high-K diets and pharmacology to preserve kidney function and reduce cardiovascular events.

Recent Findings

Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and patiromer are new K-binding drugs approved for the treatment of hyperkalemia. Both are efficacious in the short-term and long-term treatment of hyperkalemia. These binders are effective in treating hyperkalemia while facilitating RAASi therapy.

Summary

Hyperkalemia is a life-threatening condition. New K-binding drugs allow for optimal use of pharmacological therapy, such as RAASi, enhancing their cardiorenal protection. Health benefits from consumption of high K foods may also be enhanced by use of these binders. In conclusion, there are new well tolerated and effective K-binding agents for acutely and chronically managing hyperkalemia.

### Rhabdomyolysis: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^116SnkjX]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

What complications should be suspected by clinicians treating rhabdomyolysis?

Recommendation

Clinicians should monitor for a variety of complications, ranging from an asymptomatic elevation of muscle protein to an accumulation of electrolyte imbalances, edema, and toxic cellular components. Morbidity can present early or late, including hyperkalemia, hepatic dysfunction, cardiac dysfunction, AKI, acute renal failure (ARF), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and compartment syndrome. AKI is the most common systemic complication of rhabdomyolysis and is responsible for most of the morbidity and mortality associated with rhabdomyolysis.

Discussion

In rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia is the most significant electrolyte abnormality. Hepatic dysfunction occurs in approximately 25% of patients with rhabdomyolysis. Proteases released from injured muscle may be implicated in hepatic inflammation. Cardiac symptoms may be secondary to electrolyte abnormalities, such as severe hyperkalemia, and range from dysrhythmia to cardiac arrest.

The overall mortality among inpatients with CK > 5000 IU/L is approximately 14%. ARF develops in up to 15% of patients. Among those requiring RRT, mortality may be as high as 59%. Additionally, the release of intracellular products may activate the clotting cascade, leading to DIC in patients with rhabdomyolysis. This presentation is often subclinical with prolonged coagulation studies, thrombocytopenia, and elevated fibrin degradation studies without significant bleeding or thrombosis. Compartment syndrome may be an early or late complication, resulting from direct muscle injury or vigorous muscle activity. This complication occurs primarily due to limited muscle expansion from enveloping tight fascia. A delay of more than 6 hours in diagnosing this complication can lead to irreversible muscle damage or death.

Can prediction scoring be used in rhabdomyolysis?

Recommendation

The risk of AKI, RRT, and/or in-hospital mortality in patients with rhabdomyolysis can be estimated using admission demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables. Risk prediction scores may not directly influence treatment; however, they may be useful in estimating prognosis and setting expectations.

As no single laboratory value is sufficient to predict the course of rhabdomyolysis, a combined index of metrics, the McMahon Score (table 1), may be calculated at admission for prognostication. A score greater than or equal to 6 is predictive of a need for high-volume fluid resuscitation, RRT, and death.

### Hyperkalemia in dialysis patients [^117ADNFa]. Seminars in Dialysis (2001). Low credibility.

Serious hyperkalemia is common in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and accounts for considerable morbidity and death. Mechanisms of extrarenal disposal of potassium (gastrointestinal excretion and cellular uptake) play a crucial role in the defense against hyperkalemia in this population. In this article we review extrarenal potassium homeostasis and its alteration in patients with ESRD. We pay particular attention to the factors that influence the movement of potassium across cell membranes. With that background we discuss the emergency treatment of hyperkalemia in patients with ESRD. We conclude with a review of strategies to reduce the risk of hyperkalemia in this population of patients.

### Potassium management with finerenone: practical aspects [^114ypRXH]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

2 SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND

2.1 Definition of hyperkalemia

Hyperkalemia can be classified as acute (as occurring in an emergent setting), chronic, or recurrent, depending on the onset and number of hyperkalemia episodes that have occurred. The decision of whether emergency therapy is warranted is largely based on subjective clinical judgement. The lack of robust and evidence‐based treatment guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia in the emergency department poses a challenge for treatment.

Although the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), and other organizations, such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and Hearth Failure Society of America (HFSA)have issued guidelines, the concentration of potassium that is labelled as hyperkalemia varies. Serum potassium concentrations of 5.0,5.5, or 6.0 mmol/Lare commonly used cutoffs for the definition of hyperkalemia.

The KDIGO controversies' conference report defines the severity of hyperkalemia by both serum potassium concentration and ECG changes. The most common ECG change is peaked T waves, followed by QRS prolongation. Hyperkalemia is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on potassium concentration and the presence or absence of ECG changes. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 5.0–5.9 mmol/L are typically defined as mild and ≥ 6.0–6.4 mmol/L as moderate. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 6.5 mmol/L are typically defined as severe.

### Frequency and predictors of hyperkalemia in patients ≥ 60 years of age with heart failure undergoing intense medical therapy [^111pQ93Y]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a concern in heart failure (HF), especially in older patients with co-morbidities. Previous studies addressing this issue have focused mainly on younger patients. This study was aimed at determining the frequency and predictors of hyperkalemia in older patients with HF undergoing intense medical therapy. Frequency and predictors of hyperkalemia were defined in patients (n = 566) participating in the Trial of Intensified versus Standard Medical Therapy in Elderly Patients with Congestive Heart Failure, in which patients ≥ 60 years of age were randomized to a standard versus an intensified N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide-guided HF therapy. During an 18-month follow-up 76 patients (13.4%) had hyperkalemia (≥ 5.5 mmol/L) and 28 (4.9%) had severe hyperkalemia (≥ 6.0 mmol/L). Higher baseline serum potassium (odds ratio [OR] 2.92 per mmol/L), baseline creatinine (OR 1.11 per 10 μmol/L), gout (OR 2.56), New York Heart Association (NYHA) class (compared to NYHA class II, IV OR 3.08), higher dosage of spironolactone at baseline (OR 1.20 per 12.5 mg/day), and higher dose changes of spironolactone (compared to no dose change: 12.5 mg, OR 1.45; 25 mg, OR 2.52; > 25 mg, OR 3.24) were independent predictors for development of hyperkalemia (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). In conclusion, hyperkalemia is common in patients ≥ 60 years of age with HF undergoing intense medical therapy. Risk is increased in patients treated with spironolactone, in addition to patient-specific risk factors such as chronic kidney disease, higher serum potassium, advanced NYHA class, and gout. Careful surveillance of serum potassium and cautious use of spironolactone in patients at risk may help to decrease the incidence of potentially hazardous complications caused by hyperkalemia.

Although hyperkalemia was increased in both trials, the incidence of hyperkalemia‐related adverse events with clinical impact was low, with hyperkalemia‐related permanent treatment discontinuation in only 1.7% of patients receiving finerenone versus 0.6% with placebo. Potassium intake was not restricted during the trials, but finerenone or placebo was withheld in cases where potassium concentrations > 5.5 mmol/L were detected until potassium concentrations fell to < 5.0 mmol/L. With a robust potassium management strategy guided by regular monitoring of serum potassium, there were no hyperkalemia‐related deaths in more than 13,000 patients over a median follow‐up of 3 years.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115h7Ejq]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia occur when serum potassium levels are less than 3.5 mEq per L or greater than 5.0 mEq per L, respectively. The World Health Organization recommends a potassium intake of at least 3,510 mg per day for optimal cardiovascular health. Hypokalemia is caused by decreased intake, renal losses, gastrointestinal losses, or transcellular shifts. Severe features of hypokalemia that require urgent treatment include a serum potassium level of 2.5 mEq per L or less, electrocardiography abnormalities, or neuromuscular symptoms. The underlying cause should be addressed, and potassium levels replenished. An oral route is preferred if the patient has a functioning gastrointestinal tract and a serum potassium level greater than 2.5 mEq per L. Hyperkalemia is caused by impaired renal excretion, transcellular shifts, or increased potassium intake. Electrocardiography identifies cardiac conduction disturbances but may not correlate with serum potassium levels. Emergent treatment is recommended for patients with clinical signs and symptoms (e.g., muscle weakness, paralysis) or if electrocardiography abnormalities are present. Acute treatment may include intravenous calcium, insulin, sodium bicarbonate, diuretics, and beta agonists. Dialysis may be considered in the presence of end-stage renal disease, severe renal impairment, or ongoing potassium release. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are newer potassium binders and may be used in chronic or acute hyperkalemia. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is associated with serious gastrointestinal adverse effects. Long-term management of potassium disturbances includes correcting underlying conditions, dietary counseling, and adjusting causative medications.

### Development and outcomes of hyperkalemia in hospitalized patients: potential implications for care [^117Jznpv]. American Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

While severe hyperkalemia is commonly encountered, its manifestation in hospitalized patients and related outcomes are unclear. We aimed to examine development of hyperkalemia in hospitalized patients and associated outcomes.

Methods

Data from a county hospital electronic health record were used to assess all inpatient admissions, 2012–2016, for non-dialysis-dependent patients with ≥ 1 K value for development of hyperkalemia. Unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for associations of the maximum K value with in-hospital mortality and adjusted ORs were calculated for death associated with hyperkalemia.

Results

In 47,018 individual patient hospitalizations, 1.3% had a maximum K ≥ 6.0 mEq/L and 4.2% < 3.5 mEq/L. Fifth and 95th percentiles for maximum K values were 3.5 and 5.3 mEq/L. For high-K patients with a prior K value, the mean (SD) of the immediate pre-maximum K value was 5.0 ± 1.0 mEq/L, and the mean difference in K values (immediate pre-maximum to maximum) was 1.5 ± 1.1 mEq/L; mean duration between these two K tests was 10.7 ± 14.9 hours. Compared with maximum K values 3.5 to 4.0 mEq/L, ORs for death were 37.1 (95% confidence intervals, 25.8–53.3) for K 6.0 to < 6.5, 88.6 (56.8–138.2) for K ≥ 7.0, and 18.9 (4.3–82.2) for K < 3.0 mEq/L. In adjusted models, the OR for death for K ≥ 6.0 mEq/L was 4.9 (3.7–6.4).

Discussion/Conclusions

Peak K values ≥ 6.0 mEq/L were associated with mortality. Values tended to increase rapidly, limiting opportunities for detection and treatment. Systems-based approaches to detect life-threatening hyperkalemia should be studied.

Surgeons are increasingly faced with patients suffering from complicated pathology in multiple organ systems, to which multiple therapeutic agents with complex adverse effects are often prescribed. We face a daily challenge in maintaining an up-to-date knowledge of these complications. Heparin is widely used in surgical practice, yet our awareness of its adverse effects, other than bleeding and thrombocytopenia, remains poor. We will present an example of heparin-induced hyperkalemia following administration for cardiopulmonary bypass and intraaortic balloon pump prophylaxis. This is a rare but serious complication of heparin therapy, not usually reported in the context of a cardiac surgical patient. We will also discuss the renal physiology leading to hyperkalemia and the options available for its management.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115KhjSU]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are common electrolyte disorders caused by changes in potassium intake, altered excretion, or transcellular shifts. Diuretic use and gastrointestinal losses are common causes of hypokalemia, whereas kidney disease, hyperglycemia, and medication use are common causes of hyperkalemia. When severe, potassium disorders can lead to life-threatening cardiac conduction disturbances and neuromuscular dysfunction. Therefore, a first priority is determining the need for urgent treatment through a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory, and electrocardiography findings. Indications for urgent treatment include severe or symptomatic hypokalemia or hyperkalemia; abrupt changes in potassium levels; electrocardiography changes; or the presence of certain comorbid conditions. Hypokalemia is treated with oral or intravenous potassium. To prevent cardiac conduction disturbances, intravenous calcium is administered to patients with hyperkalemic electrocardiography changes. Insulin, usually with concomitant glucose, and albuterol are preferred to lower serum potassium levels in the acute setting; sodium polystyrene sulfonate is reserved for subacute treatment. For both disorders, it is important to consider potential causes of transcellular shifts because patients are at increased risk of rebound potassium disturbances.

Implications

Serum potassium concentration should be measured immediately before operation to detect hyperkalemia in heart failure patients treated with spironolactone.

### Potassium-lowering agents for the treatment of nonemergent hyperkalemia: pharmacology, dosing and comparative efficacy [^113JTAg6]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia represents a common and potentially life-threating electrolyte abnormality, a complication frequently observed in patients with heart failure, kidney disease, diabetes or in those receiving drug therapies influencing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Elevated serum potassium levels are often the result of impaired urinary potassium elimination, inadequate or reduced cellular potassium uptake, severe heart failure, use of medications influencing potassium levels in the circulation, or, more commonly, a combination of these factors. Strategies for the treatment of nonemergent hyperkalemia include the use of cation-exchange resins, polymers or other novel mechanisms of potassium trapping, including sodium polystyrene sulfonate, patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. These agents differ in their pharmacology and mechanism of action, clinical efficacy, including onset and extent of potassium-lowering effect, dosage and administration, and potential safety and adverse effect profiles. In this review, an evaluation of these characteristics, including clinical evidence and safety concerns, in the management of nonemergent hyperkalemia will be explored.

### Population epidemiology of hyperkalemia: cardiac and kidney long-term health outcomes [^1164Cw7N]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

The population burden and long-term implications of hyperkalemia have not been comprehensively studied. We studied how often and where hyperkalemia occurs as well as its independent association with survival and long-term cardiac and kidney health.

Study Design

Population-based cohort study of adult residents of Grampian, United Kingdom.

Setting & Participants

Among the 468,594 adult residents (2012–2014), 302,630 people with at least 1 blood test were followed until 2019.

Exposure

Hyperkalemia was defined as serum potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L. Adjustment for comorbidities, demographics, measures of acute and chronic kidney function, and medications prescribed before measurement of serum potassium.

Outcome

All-cause mortality, cardiac events, and kidney failure.

Analytical Approach

Description of the annual incidence of hyperkalemia and the characteristics associated with its occurrence, and adjusted Cox proportional hazards (PH) analysis to evaluate the independent long-term association of hyperkalemia with all-cause mortality among people who survived ≥ 90 days after blood testing. Cause-specific PH models were fit to evaluate the association of hyperkalemia with cardiac events/death, noncardiac death, and kidney failure. Effect modification by level of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at the time of blood testing was explored.

Results

The annual population incidence of hyperkalemia was 0.96 per 100 person-years. This represented 2.3%, 2.1%, and 1.9% of people with at least one blood test in 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively. Two-thirds of episodes of hyperkalemia occurred in the community. The hyperkalemia rate was 2-fold higher for each 10-year greater age. Those with hyperkalemia were 20 times more likely to have concurrent acute kidney injury (AKI), and 17 times more likely to have an eGFR of < 30 mL/min/1.73 m². Throughout 5 years of follow-up evaluation (2,483,452 person-years), hyperkalemia was associated with poorer health outcomes. This association held across all levels of kidney function and was irrespective of concurrent AKI, but was stronger among those with a baseline eGFR of ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m² (P for interaction < 0.001). The adjusted HRs (hyperkalemia vs no hyperkalemia) for people with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² were 2.3 (95% CI, 2.2–2.5) and 1.5 (95% CI, 1.3–1.6) for mortality; 1.8 (95% CI, 1.6–1.9) and 1.4 (95% CI, 1.2–1.6) for cardiac events; and 17.0 (95% CI, 9.3–31.1) and 2.0 (95% CI, 1.5–2.8) for kidney failure, respectively.

Limitations

The observational nature of this study limits evaluation of causal relationships.

Conclusions

There is a substantial burden of hyperkalemia in the general population. Hyperkalemia is associated with poorer long-term health outcomes, especially kidney outcomes, that are independent of other established risk factors.

### Management of hyperkalaemia in chronic kidney disease [^114C8jgq]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2014). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalaemia is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), in part because of the effects of kidney dysfunction on potassium homeostasis and in part because of the cluster of comorbidities (and their associated treatments) that occur in patients with CKD. Owing to its electrophysiological effects, severe hyperkalaemia represents a medical emergency that usually requires prompt intervention, whereas the prevention of hazardous hyperkalaemic episodes in at-risk patients requires measures aimed at the long-term normalization of potassium homeostasis. The options for effective and safe medical interventions to restore chronic potassium balance are few, and long-term management of hyperkalaemia is primarily limited to the correction of modifiable exacerbating factors. This situation can result in a difficult trade-off in patients with CKD, because drugs that are beneficial to these patients (for example, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system antagonists) are often the most prominent cause of their hyperkalaemia. Maintaining the use of these beneficial medications while implementing various strategies to control potassium balance is desirable; however, discontinuation rates remain high. The emergence of new medications that specifically target hyperkalaemia could lead to a therapeutic paradigm shift, emphasizing preventive management over ad hoc treatment of incidentally discovered elevations in serum potassium levels.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: probably not O"K" [^111b1mZi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is routinely defined as a serum potassium level > 5 mmol/L and is a common occurrence in patients with acute and chronic heart failure (HF). For example, prior work has demonstrated that hyperkalemia is present in ≈9% of patients admitted for acute HF, 1 and the total annual charges for Medicare admissions related to a primary diagnosis of hyperkalemia are substantial, with estimates as high as $697 million in 2011. 2 Elevated potassium levels may affect the activity of myocardial potassium channels, leading to more rapid membrane depolarization. The downstream effects of this may translate into slower myocardial electrical conduction, resulting in malignant tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias. Hyperkalemia, especially with potassium levels > 5.5 mmol/L, has been consistently linked to poor clinical outcomes in patients with HF. 3, 4 Recent estimates from the PARADIGM‐HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure) trial suggest the incidence of hyperkalemia in a trial population receiving treatment with renin‐angiotensin system inhibition (RASi) was ≈16% over a median follow‐up time of 27 months, despite a highly selected and carefully monitored clinical trial population. 5 Similarly, in a large cohort from the United Kingdom of 19 194 patients with new‐onset HF, 11% developed hyperkalemia during a 4‐year follow‐up. 6 Multiple prior analyses of clinical trials and population‐based studies identify renal dysfunction, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the use of mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRAs) and RASi as major risk factors for hyperkalemia. Given that 5.7 million people in the United States alone have HF and this number is increasing, there is an overwhelming number of patients at risk for hyperkalemia and associated adverse events. 7 Patients with HF are at a particularly high risk for hyperkalemia, which is likely reflective of their medical comorbidity, including renal dysfunction. In addition, several of the current medical therapies for the management of HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF) add to this risk. These include cornerstone therapies, such as the following: (1) RASi, including angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor inhibitors with or without neprilysin inhibition; and (2) MRAs, such as spironolactone and eplerenone. Whether a consequence of a real or perceived risk of hyperkalemia, evidence supports that these therapies are underused, and when used there is suboptimal dose titration. 8, 9 Although there are data to support that mild hyperkalemia (potassium level, 5–5.5 mmol/L) in the setting of RASi and MRA therapy might not be associated with poor clinical outcomes, hyperkalemia in HF remains a major clinical dilemma. 3, 10

### Hypoglycemia as a complication of intravenous insulin to treat hyperkalemia in the emergency department [^112tSwGq]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Complications associated with the emergency department (ED) management of hyperkalemia are not well characterized. The goals of this study were to describe the frequency of hypoglycemia following the use of insulin to shift potassium intracellularly and to examine the association of key variables with this complication.

Methods

Adult ED patients (≥ 18 years old) with hyperkalemia (> 5.3 mmol/L) were identified in the electronic medical record over a 5-year period at the study site. Patient characteristics, laboratory results, and treatments in the ED were captured. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was utilized to determine independent associations with the development of hypoglycemia.

Results

1307 encounters were identified where hyperkalemia was present. Hypoglycemia (defined as a glucose < 70 mg/dL) occurred in 68/409 (17%) of patients given insulin, compared to 4% of patients who did not receive insulin. Lower glucose prior to insulin (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.90; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.85 to 0.96), higher doses of insulin (aOR 1.07; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.15) and lower doses of D50 (aOR 0.98; 95% CI 0.97 to 0.99) were independently associated with hypoglycemia in the multivariate analysis. Age, history of diabetes, and history renal failure were not independently associated.

Conclusion

Hypoglycemia is a frequent complication of treatment with IV insulin in the ED. Interventions such as standardized protocols to assist with the ED management of hyperkalemia should be developed; their efficacy and safety should be compared.

### Hyperkalemia: pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^111x4uMn]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The introduction of new potassium binders (patiromer and zirconium cyclosilicate) has refocused attention on hyperkalemia. There have also been significant recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain potassium homoeostasis and the clinical consequences of hyperkalemia. In this article we aim to present these recent advances in the context of a concise review of the pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences of hyperkalemia. We will highlight aspects that are of particular relevance for clinical practice.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^116pRo5x]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 — steps to manage hyperkalemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) specify that for potassium > 5.5 mmol/L in CKD, recommended actions are to review non-RAASi culprit medications and discontinue when possible, consider appropriate moderation of dietary potassium intake, and use diuretics when appropriate and risk of volume depletion is low.

### Pivotal clinical trials, meta-analyses and current guidelines in the treatment of hyperkalemia [^112vUSSL]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia (HK) is the most common electrolyte disturbance observed in patients with advanced stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), is a potentially life-threatening clinical condition due to an increased risk of fatal arrhythmias, and strongly impacts the quality of life and prognosis of CKD patients. Moreover, while renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASIs) represent the most cardio-nephro-protective drugs used in clinical practice, the treatment with these drugs per se increases serum potassium (sK) values, particularly when heart failure and diabetes mellitus coexist. In fact, the onset or recurrence of HK is frequently associated with not starting, down-titrating or withdrawing RAASIs, and is an indication to begin renal replacement treatment in end-stage renal disease. Current strategies aimed at preventing and treating chronic HK are still unsatisfactory, as evidenced by the relatively high prevalence of HK also in patients under stable nephrology care, and even in the ideal setting of randomized clinical trials. Indeed, dietary potassium restriction, the use of sodium bicarbonate or diuretics, the withdrawal or down-titration of RAASIs, or the administration of old potassium binders, namely sodium polystyrene sulphonate and calcium polystyrene sulphonate, have limited efficacy and are poorly tolerated; therefore, these strategies are not suitable for long-term control of sK. As such, there is an important unmet need for novel therapeutic options for the chronic management of patients at risk for HK. The development of new potassium binders may change the treatment landscape in the near future. This review summarizes the current evidence on the treatment of chronic HK in cardio-renal patients.

### Hyperkalemia | AAFP… [^111ysrgx]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

If the elevation is shown to be real, the next step is to consider: the effects of medications, including increased potassium intake; the impaired distribution of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular space; or the impaired renal excretion of potassium. All three factors often are present. 13 ACE inhibition also decreases cardiovascular mortality in high-risk patients, particularly in those with diabetes. 14, 15 However, patients who take a combination of ACE inhibitors and spironolactone are prone to hyperkalemia 8; hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism may contribute as well. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decrease renin secretion, leading to decreased potassium secretion.

The addition of NSAIDs in these patients can impair renal function to the degree of inducing life-threatening hyperkalemia. Thus, NSAIDs should be taken with caution in patients with diabetes or renal failure. 10, 16. 24 Management Factors necessitating emergent treatment of hyperkalemia include changes on ECG, a rapid rise of serum potassium, decreased renal function, and the presence of significant acidosis. ECG changes in a patient with hyperkalemia are an ominous portent of potentially fatal arrhythmias. However, hyperkalemia can be life threatening even if the ECG is normal, 25, 26 and about one half of patients with potassium levels exceeding 6. 0 mEq per L have a normal ECG.

1. Caution should be used in patients who take digoxin because calcium has been reported to worsen the myocardial effects of digoxin toxicity. 2, 3 Some experts suggest using a slower calcium infusion for 20 to 30 minutes in patients with hyperkalemia who are on digitalis therapy.

28–30 An alternative is to consider using magnesium instead of calcium to stabilize the myocardium.
29. The principal side effects are hypertension and f luid retention, which may respond to an added diuretic. Although the question of appropriate treatment duration with f ludrocortisone has never been studied, one approach to management would be to slowly taper f ludrocortisone on an outpatient basis, and reinstate f ludrocortisone if potassium rises.

### Acute treatment of hyperkalemia… [^117LTsys]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the best acute treatment of an elevated serum potassium level. Evidence-Based Answer According to disease-oriented evidence, insulin and intravenous glucose, inhaled albuterol, and dialysis are the best treatment options; the first two may be given in combination. Bicarbonate or resins are not recommended for routine use, particularly without one of the more effective agents listed above. Practice Pointers Acute treatment of hyperkalemia falls into the still considerable "widely used but little studied" category of medical interventions. No study has reported outcomes that matter to patients, such as the likelihood of death or cardiac arrhythmias. The available literature focuses largely on the ability of interventions to lower serum potassium levels acutely. The Cochrane review by Mahoney and colleagues applies to patients with a significantly elevated potassium level.

Each patient acts as his or her own control, so it is possible to have a much smaller sample size and still obtain statistically significant results. Only four studies used blinding, and only four concealed allocation to treatment groups adequately. Most of the patients studied had acute or chronic renal failure and were receiving hemodialysis. Nebulized or inhaled albuterol proved effective; a dose of 20 mg was more effective than 10 mg in lowering potassium levels, and both doses were better than placebo. Intravenous albuterol and levalbuterol were no more effective than inhaled albuterol. The combination of insulin with intravenous glucose was effective, as was dialysis. In one study, the combination of insulin, glucose, and inhaled albuterol was more effective than insulin and glucose alone. Although potassium-binding polystyrene resins such as Kayexalate are widely used, only one study evaluated their effectiveness in the acute setting, and they proved ineffective.

Adding bicarbonate to insulin and glucose was helpful in one study but not in another. A review of the National Guideline Clearinghouse Website did not identify any practice guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia. Recommendations from textbooks vary considerably. For example, Griffith's 5-Minute Clinical Consult 2005 1 recommends dextrose and insulin, sodium bicarbonate, and polystyrene resins but does not mention inhaled beta agonists.

### Hyperkalemia in hospitalized patients… [^115YW31T]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

There were 127 episodes of hyperkalemia during the observation-only phase and 115 during the notification phase. No patients died or had life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Electrocardiographic abnormalities consistent with hyperkalemia were observed in only 14% of episodes. Renal failure, drugs, and hyperglycemia contributed to most episodes. Conclusions Although treatment of hyperkalemia was frequently suboptimal, no serious arrhythmias and no deaths complicated management of 242 episodes of severe hyperkalemia. A narrowly targeted effort to improve physician management of a disorder with discrete treatment options did not improve therapy. HYPERKALEMIA is a frequent occurrence in hospitalized patients, with a reported incidence of 1. 1 to 10 patients per 100 hospitalized. 1–3 Without warning, hyperkalemia may cause nearly any dysrhythmia.

4 Estimates of deaths caused by hyperkalemia in the general population are unavailable; in patients with end-stage renal disease in the United States, hyperkalemia accounted for 1. 9% of mortality in
1993. 5 Higher rates have been reported in a comparable European population.
6. Six patients had a widened QRS complex, and 26 had peaked T waves. Overall, 33 tracings had any change suggestive of hyperkalemia, on the basis of physician review. The prevalence of ECG changes was independent of the severity of hyperkalemia. In patients with potassium values less than 6. 8 mmol/L, 23 of 54 tracings showed changes, whereas 10 of 18 tracings in patients with higher potassium values had characteristic hyperkalemic changes. There was no difference in use of medications between the 2 phases except for a greater use of sodium bicarbonate at potassium levels of 6. 5 mmol/L or more. The results were sobering.

In the initial and purely observational phase of the study, only 39% of episodes satisfied the published criteria in all 3 phases. Treatment was more attentive in the ICU, where two thirds of all episodes were treated appropriately; only a quarter of ward cases were similarly well managed. Times to treatment were also shorter in the ICU. Overall, however, treatment of patients with more severe hyperkalemia did not have a higher pass rate than treatment of patients with a lesser degree of hyperkalemia.
