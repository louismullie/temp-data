## Question

A 28-year-old woman presents to your dermatology clinic with a 2-year history of multiple plantar warts on her right foot. She has previously tried over-the-counter salicylic acid, cryotherapy at another clinic, and topical imiquimod, all without significant improvement. She is frustrated by the persistent pain and discomfort. She asks about other treatment options, specifically mentioning that she read about laser therapy online.

Based on current guidelines, how would you counsel this patient regarding the use of pulsed dye laser therapy for her recalcitrant warts?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to counsel a 28-year-old woman with recalcitrant plantar warts about pulsed dye laser (PDL) therapy, including its efficacy, safety, alternatives, and how guidelines position it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether her warts qualify as recalcitrant. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about PDL for cutaneous warts. Next, I will appraise the quality and magnitude of evidence for PDL efficacy, especially in plantar disease. After that, I need to check safety, tolerability, and practical considerations like cost and access. Finally, I will compare PDL with reasonable alternatives and synthesize a balanced, patient-centered recommendation with clear next steps and follow-up expectations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. She has multiple plantar warts persisting for 2 years despite salicylic acid, cryotherapy, and imiquimod, which meets criteria for recalcitrant warts and justifies escalation beyond first-line therapies, particularly given pain and functional impact on the sole [^e451efbe] [^38de40bc].

> Next, I should review guideline positions before diving into studies. The AAFP guideline advises that PDL may be considered for recalcitrant warts, but notes that effectiveness is unproven, which signals a weak, conditional recommendation rather than a strong endorsement [^e451efbe]. The British Association of Dermatologists similarly allows consideration of PDL for cutaneous warts without specifying plantar outcomes, again reflecting limited evidence rather than a directive to use it routinely [^09c8cc02].

> Now, I will examine the evidence base for PDL efficacy. Wait, let me verify the range of response rates. Observational series and reviews report highly variable clearance with PDL, roughly 47% to 100% across mixed wart types, with many studies small, uncontrolled, and heterogeneous in methods and endpoints, which limits certainty and generalizability to plantar warts specifically [^c1c39844] [^e5483abe]. In a prospective series of 120 patients, overall clearance was about 49.5% and plantar warts specifically around 47.6%, reinforcing modest average efficacy and substantial interpatient variability [^1bb35deb]. A separate prospective study of 73 patients reported up to 89% remission after multiple sessions, but again this was uncontrolled and not plantar-specific, so I should be cautious about overinterpreting those higher figures [^f402fe4a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about plantar-specific performance. I need to check whether plantar warts respond less well. Pediatric data show lower clearance for plantar warts compared with other sites, around 69% in one series, and broader syntheses note that plantar warts are notoriously difficult to treat, with PDL showing variable and often lower response than on thinner skin sites, which aligns with the lower end of the 47–100% spectrum seen in reviews [^12d326de] [^c1c39844]. This helps set expectations that plantar lesions may require more sessions and still have a meaningful nonresponse rate.

> I should confirm safety and tolerability. PDL is generally well tolerated, with transient purpura, erythema, and discomfort as the most common effects; scarring is uncommon but possible, and pain can be significant enough to limit adherence in some series, which matters for plantar warts where weight-bearing adds discomfort [^e5483abe] [^f402fe4a]. Let me reconsider the practicalities: multiple sessions are usually needed, costs are higher than simple topical or cryotherapy, and access varies by center, all of which should be discussed upfront in shared decision-making [^e5483abe] [^e89ba597].

> Next, I should review alternatives with stronger or different evidence profiles. Intralesional immunotherapy, particularly Candida antigen and vitamin D3, shows promising cure rates around 66–80% in systematic reviews and can treat multiple lesions systemically, though evidence quality varies and availability differs by region [^7dd0ac1e]. Photodynamic therapy has supportive data in some studies and is guideline-endorsed as a consideration for recalcitrant warts, though again evidence is mixed and access may be limited [^be95f7ee]. Nano-pulse stimulation achieved about 44% clearance in plantar warts with low recurrence in a controlled study, suggesting a reasonable nondestructive option where available, albeit with modest efficacy relative to other modalities [^74b0ff95]. Combination approaches, such as PDL followed by intralesional bleomycin, have shown high response in small series but carry more pain and cost and should be reserved for carefully selected cases after discussing trade-offs [^eb272d74] [^591cc689].

> But wait, what if we revisit first-line options with optimized technique? Aggressive cryotherapy and salicylic acid remain foundational, and some data suggest that more aggressive cryotherapy regimens or pairing with salicylic acid can improve outcomes, though pain and blistering rise and plantar cure rates remain modest on average, which explains why many patients seek alternatives after several failures [^e0127d2d] [^6a01e92d]. I should double-check that we have truly optimized these basics before escalating, including paring and appropriate intervals, to avoid prematurely attributing failure to treatment refractoriness [^6d3a391f].

> I will now synthesize a balanced recommendation. Given guideline caution and the modest, variable efficacy of PDL for plantar warts, PDL is a reasonable second- or third-line option after informed consent about uncertain benefit, multiple sessions, cost, and potential pain, especially if the patient prioritizes avoiding destructive or injection-based therapies and accepts a trial-and-error approach [^e451efbe] [^09c8cc02]. I should emphasize that response is unpredictable, with roughly 47–70% clearance in plantar-focused data, and that 3–5 sessions may be needed before judging efficacy, aligning with series suggesting many respond by session 2–5 and some require up to 10–12 treatments [^1bb35deb] [^f402fe4a].

> Let me outline a practical plan and contingencies. If proceeding with PDL, I would set expectations for 2–3 week intervals, discuss pre-treatment analgesia options, and plan to reassess after 3 sessions to decide continuation or pivot. If PDL is unavailable or declined, I would offer intralesional immunotherapy or consider photodynamic therapy where accessible, reserving combination laser–bleomycin for highly selected refractory cases after shared decision-making about pain and cost [^7dd0ac1e] [^be95f7ee] [^eb272d74]. Throughout, I should reinforce that no modality guarantees clearance and that recurrence remains possible, which supports a stepwise, patient-centered approach with clear stop criteria and follow-up checkpoints [^c1c39844].

> In summary, I need to ensure the patient understands that PDL is an acceptable but unproven option for recalcitrant plantar warts, with expected clearance around 47–70% after multiple sessions, minimal scarring risk, and manageable pain, while alternatives like intralesional immunotherapy or photodynamic therapy may offer higher or different benefit profiles at the expense of injections or specialized equipment. Shared decision-making that incorporates her preferences, access, and tolerance for uncertainty is essential before committing to a laser pathway [^e451efbe] [^09c8cc02] [^c1c39844] [^7dd0ac1e] [^be95f7ee].

---

Pulsed dye laser (PDL) is a **reasonable option** for recalcitrant plantar warts after failure of first-line therapies, with **modest efficacy** and a favorable safety profile [^e451efbe] [^c1c39844]. Clearance rates vary widely (about 47–89%) [^1bb35deb] [^f402fe4a], and multiple sessions are often needed; pain, transient purpura, and rare scarring can occur [^e5483abe]. PDL is **not first-line** and should be considered when salicylic acid, cryotherapy, and immunotherapy have failed or are unsuitable [^e451efbe] [^09c8cc02]. Discuss costs, access, and the need for repeat treatments, and consider alternatives such as intralesional bleomycin or photodynamic therapy if available [^7dd0ac1e] [^be95f7ee].

---

## Mechanism of action

PDL targets vascular structures within warts, **selectively destroying dilated capillaries** that nourish the lesion, thereby inducing ischemia and necrosis of the wart tissue [^f402fe4a]. This vascular-selective approach minimizes damage to surrounding healthy tissue, contributing to its favorable safety profile [^e5483abe].

---

## Clinical evidence for efficacy

Several studies have evaluated PDL efficacy in treating recalcitrant plantar warts, with **variable results**:

- **Prospective study (120 patients)**: Overall clearance rate of 49.5%; plantar warts specifically had a clearance rate of 47.6% [^1bb35deb].
- **Prospective study (73 patients)**: 89% achieved remission after a maximum of 10 sessions, with 63% remission after 2–5 sessions [^f402fe4a].
- **Pediatric study (61 children)**: 69% clearance for plantar warts, with 75% remaining wart-free at 24 months [^12d326de].

These studies highlight **significant variability in response rates**, likely due to differences in patient populations, treatment protocols, and follow-up durations [^c1c39844].

---

## Safety and tolerability

PDL is generally well tolerated, with **minimal adverse effects**. Common side effects include:

- **Transient pain**: Typically mild to moderate, manageable with topical anesthetics or cooling devices [^e5483abe].
- **Purpura**: Temporary bruising at the treatment site, resolving within 1–2 weeks [^e5483abe].
- **Rare scarring**: Occurs infrequently, particularly with higher fluences or aggressive treatment parameters [^12d326de].

Overall, PDL has a **favorable safety profile**, especially compared to more invasive procedures such as surgical excision or CO2 laser therapy [^c1c39844].

---

## Comparison with other treatments

PDL is typically considered when first-line treatments such as salicylic acid, cryotherapy, or immunotherapy fail. Comparative effectiveness includes:

| **Treatment modality** | **Efficacy** | **Safety profile** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Salicylic acid | Moderate (50–70%) | Minimal | First-line therapy |
| Cryotherapy | Moderate (50–70%) | Moderate (pain, blistering) | First-line therapy |
| Immunotherapy (e.g. Candida antigen) | High (66–80%) | Minimal | Second-line therapy |
| PDL | Variable (47–89%) | Minimal | Second-line therapy |
| Intralesional bleomycin | High (67–99%) | Moderate (pain, nail dystrophy) | Second-line therapy |

---

PDL offers a **non-invasive alternative** with a favorable safety profile, but its efficacy is variable and generally lower than immunotherapy or intralesional bleomycin [^7dd0ac1e] [^027126b6].

---

## Practical considerations

- **Number of sessions**: Multiple sessions (typically 2–5) are often required to achieve clearance, with treatments spaced 2–4 weeks apart [^f402fe4a].
- **Cost and accessibility**: PDL treatments can be expensive and may not be universally available, limiting access for some patients [^e5483abe].
- **Patient selection**: Ideal candidates are those with recalcitrant warts who have failed or cannot tolerate first-line therapies.

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) and the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) suggest that PDL may be considered for recalcitrant warts, but **evidence for its effectiveness remains limited** [^e451efbe] [^09c8cc02]. Expert consensus indicates that PDL should be reserved for cases where conventional treatments have failed or are contraindicated [^e451efbe].

---

## Patient counseling points

When discussing PDL therapy with patients, the following points should be emphasized:

- **Modest efficacy**: Clearance rates vary, and multiple sessions may be necessary [^c1c39844].
- **Favorable safety**: Minimal adverse effects, with transient pain and purpura being the most common [^e5483abe].
- **Cost and accessibility**: Treatments can be costly and may require referral to specialized centers.
- **Alternative options**: Intralesional immunotherapy, photodynamic therapy, or intralesional bleomycin may be considered if PDL is unavailable or ineffective [^7dd0ac1e] [^be95f7ee] [^027126b6].

---

Pulsed dye laser therapy is a **reasonable option** for recalcitrant plantar warts, particularly after failure of first-line treatments. While it offers a favorable safety profile, its efficacy is modest and variable, and multiple sessions may be required. Patients should be counseled regarding its limitations, costs, and alternative treatment options.

### Pulsed dye laser treatment for viral warts: a study of 120 patients [^1bb35deb]. The Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

A prospective, non-blinded, non-randomized study on 120 wart patients treated with pulsed dye laser was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pulsed dye laser treatment for viral warts and to demonstrate the proper application and effective technique of this method. The overall clearance rate was 49.5%. The clearance rates of flat warts, periungual warts, plantar warts and common warts were 67.6%, 51.1%, 47.6% and 44.3%, respectively. Overall, the response rates of pediatric warts, recalcitrant warts and old warts were superior to those of adult warts, simple warts and non-old warts, respectively; however, those trends were not statistically significant. We concluded that pulsed dye laser treatment is a safe, tolerable and relatively effective treatment method for viral warts. Pulsed dye laser treatment may be a more efficacious method for flat warts and recalcitrant periungual warts, and it can be an effective modality for newly-developed warts. The highest clearance rate was noted at a fluence of 9.5 J/cm2 (P < or = 0.05) and it is recommended that practitioners perform pulsed dye laser treatments for viral warts at the fluences of 9.0-9.5 J/cm2. A replacement of pulsed dye laser treatment should be considered unless prominent improvement is observed after three treatment sessions.

Plantar warts are among the most common skin conditions and are classically resistant to treatment. To perform an evidence-based evaluation of the efficacy and safety of available treatment options for plantar warts, we conducted a systematic review of PubMed and Cochrane databases to identify large interventional and observational studies involving more than 100 patients who were treated for plantar warts from inception to October 2020. We identified only nine contributions meeting our inclusion criteria (N ≥ 100), representing 1,657 adult and pediatric patients with plantar warts. Treatments included in this review were topical keratolytic agents, cryotherapy, laser therapies, and intralesional and systemic treatments. Our evidence-based review of the larger studies suggests keratolytic agents and destructive treatments, in particular salicylic acid and cryotherapy, remain the primary treatments for plantar warts. Treatment with pulsed dye laser had the lowest rate of recurrence. Newer treatments and intralesional treatments were not represented owing to lack of large studies involving these modalities.

### Pulsed dye laser therapy in the treatment of warts: a review of the literature [^e5483abe]. Dermatologic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Warts or verrucae vulgaris are common cutaneous infections with currently no definitive curative treatments available.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of pulsed dye laser (PDL) in the treatment of warts.

Materials and Methods

A literature search was performed using the PubMed and MEDLINE databases. A search using {(Wart[s], verruca or condylomata)} AND [(Pulsed dye laser)] was used. Forty-four articles were identified as relevant to this review.

Results

Simple warts were very responsive to PDL, being treated successfully in over 95% of patients. Facial and anogenital warts also demonstrated excellent outcomes. Recalcitrant warts, displayed significant variability in their response, ranging between 50% and 100% across all articles. The response rates seen in peripheral warts (involving the hands and feet) were also very variable, ranging between 48% and 95%. Recurrence rates at 4 months of follow-up were documented as 0% to 15%. Complications have been described as very few and rare, the main ones being topical discomfort and erythema.

Conclusion

Pulsed dye laser is a safe and effective modality in the treatment of warts that can be applied to most body parts. Cost and availability remain a limitation to the use of PDL; however, this modality can be used when other more traditional and accessible treatments have failed.

### Pulsed dye laser treatment is effective in the treatment of recalcitrant viral warts [^f402fe4a]. Dermatologic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Verrucae vulgaris can be removed in a variety of ways but a specific therapy of choice has not yet been developed. Doctors are faced with a challenge, especially in the treatment of recalcitrant warts. It has been suggested that the success of pulsed dye laser treatment lies in the fact that warts contain an increased number of dilated blood vessels.

Methods

Seventy-three patients (42 female, 31 male) with verrucae vulgaris on their hands or feet (1:1.5) were given a maximum of 12 treatments with a flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser every 2 weeks over a period of 24 weeks until complete clearance had been achieved. A laser energy density of 8 to 12 J/cm2 with a spot size of 5 mm and a pulse duration of 450 microsec were used. The minimum follow-up period was 6 months.

Results

A total of 15.1% patients achieved complete clearance after 1 session and 47.9% after 2 to 5 sessions, resulting in a remission of 63.0% patients after a maximum of 5 treatment sessions. A remission of 23.3% patients was seen after 6 to 9 treatments and a total of 89.0% of patients showed remission after a maximum of 10 sessions. Only three patients (4.1%) failed and five patients (6.9%) stopped the treatment on account of pain/noncompliance. Only one patient, from a group of patients treated between January 2003 and April 2004, has relapsed.

Conclusion

Pulsed dye laser treatment is effective and safe in the treatment of recalcitrant viral warts.

### Effectiveness of pulsed dye laser in the treatment of recalcitrant warts in children [^12d326de]. Dermatologic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

To determine the efficacy and safety of the 585-nm pulsed dye laser (PDL) in the treatment of recalcitrant warts in children.

Methods and Material

Retrospective survey of the medical records of children with recalcitrant warts who were treated with PDL between March 1995 through January 1999 at the Children's Memorial Hospital outpatient subspecialty center, Chicago, Illinois.

Results

Sixty-one children with recalcitrant warts were treated with PDL; 75% of them had total clearance of warts after an average of 3.1 treatment sessions. Overall success rates were 100% for both perineal and perianal and face-only warts, 93% for hands, 69% for plantar warts, 67% when both face and extremities were involved, and 60% when multiple extremities were involved. Pain and other side effects were minimal. Mild scarring occurred in 2% of patients; 75% of patients remained free of warts after a follow-up period of 24 months or longer.

Conclusion

PDL therapy is an effective, safe alternative therapy for treatment of recalcitrant warts in children, with few side effects and a low long-term recurrence rate.

### Laser treatment of epidermal and dermal lesions [^7674dd81]. Dermatologic Clinics (2002). Low credibility.

The CO2 laser is a versatile and effective tool for the treatment of warts and various other epidermal and dermal lesions where there is no easily targeted chromophore other than water. The development of high peak-power short-pulsed or rapidly scanned resurfacing CO2 lasers has significantly improved the safety and efficacy of this treatment modality. Many lesions amenable to CO2 laser vaporization, however, can be treated by other, far less expensive methods, and it is the laser surgeon's responsibility to use the CO2 laser only when it is demonstrably the best treatment option. The pulsed dye laser has some utility for selected recalcitrant warts. Because of their greater safety margin and more precise ablation, resurfacing CO2 and Er:YAG lasers are replacing the continuous wave CO2 laser for the ablation of many superficial lesions.

### Pulsed dye laser and intralesional bleomycin for the treatment of recalcitrant cutaneous warts [^eb272d74]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Viral warts are a common ailment. Clinicians often combine multiple treatments to boost efficacy. One such novel combination is pulsed dye laser with bleomycin intralesionally (PDL+BI), described for the successful treatment of single hand warts.

Objective

To evaluate PDL+BI for the treatment of poor prognosis hand and foot warts.

Study Design/Patients and Methods

This 4-year retrospective case series examined the efficacy of PDL+BI used consecutively on patients whose warts were treated with this modality alone. PDL 595nm was used in stacking mode to achieve hemorrhagic blistering prior to intralesional bleomycin (1mg/ml normal saline).

Results

Twenty cases (65% male, age 13-62, mean age 42) were identified. Two (10%) were immunocompromised. Twenty five percent of warts affected hands, 55% feet, 20% both. Thirty five percent were solitary >1cm(2) , 40% were multiple or mosaic verucae. The mean duration was 5.1 years (0.5-15). Seventy five percent received local anesthetic. Mean number of treatments was two. Post-operative pain varied from none to severe, sometimes causing difficulty in walking. Blistering and crusting disappeared after 17 days (range 7-42). Outcome had a mean follow-up of 24 months (3-53) with 60% complete response, 15% partial, 25% no response. Mean satisfaction level was 7 (range 0-10, 10 highest). Outcome was better with local anesthetic (complete response 75%) as it permitted more aggressive treatment. Patients that had both anesthetic and repeat treatment sessions experienced 92% complete response.

Conclusion

PDL+BI offers a novel method for treatment of recalcitrant warts, but local anesthetic and repeat treatments are recommended.

### Photodynamic therapy: new treatment for therapy-resistant plantar warts [^99601230]. Dermatologic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Plantar wart treatment remains a challenging one. Various treatment modalities have been previously used and are still in current use. The problem remains in the degree of response to these treatments and the side effects associated with them.

Objective

The aim of this study was to test a new treatment modality for therapy-resistant plantar warts.

Methods

Thirty-one patients with 48 plantar warts were randomly selected from the Department of Laser Therapy, Medical Centre Maastricht, The Netherlands. The mean age of the patients was 29 years (range 6-74 years). The mean incubation time was 6.8 hours, and the mean treatment time was 18.7 minutes per wart. Each wart was treated an average of 2.3 times, with a median fluence of 100 cm2.

Results

Forty-two of 48 (88%) warts showed a complete response. A trend was found between total clearance and size of the warts, age of the patient, and the mean treatment time. No significant side effects were seen postoperatively.

Conclusion

This study showed that recalcitrant plantar warts were successfully treated with no significant side effects; however, the user needs sufficient experience for this new effective treatment application.

### Laser treatment of nongenital verrucae: a systematic review [^c1c39844]. JAMA Dermatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Although cutaneous warts are common lesions, full remission is not always achieved with conventional therapies. Laser modalities including carbon dioxide (CO2), erbium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er:YAG), pulsed dye (PDL), and Nd:YAG have been investigated as alternative treatments for warts.

Objective

To review the use and efficacy of lasers for treating nongenital cutaneous warts.

Evidence Review

Published randomized clinical trials (RCTs), cohort studies, case series, and case reports involving laser treatment of nongenital warts were retrieved by searching PubMed with no date limits. Quality ratings of studies were based on a modified version of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine scheme for rating individual studies. A higher emphasis was placed on RCTs and prospective cohort studies with large sample sizes and detailed methodology.

Findings

There were 35 studies published between 1989 and 2015 that comprised an aggregate of 2149 patients. Simple and recalcitrant nongenital warts treated with lasers show variable response rates (CO2 laser, 50%-100%; Er:YAG laser, 72%-100%; PDL, 47%-100%; and Nd:YAG laser, 46%-100%). Current RCTs suggest that PDL is equivalent to conventional therapies such as cryotherapy and cantharidin. Combination therapies with lasers and other agents including bleomycin, salicylic acid, and light-emitting diode have shown some success.

Conclusions and Relevance

Lasers can be an effective treatment option for both simple and recalcitrant warts. The lasers most studied for this purpose are CO2, PDL, and Nd:YAG, and of these, PDL has the fewest adverse effects. Currently, use of lasers for wart treatment is limited by lack of established treatment guidelines. Future studies are needed to compare laser modalities with each other and with nonlaser treatment options, and to establish optimal treatment protocols.

### Treatment of nongenital cutaneous warts [^9635fdd8]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Numerous treatments for nongenital cutaneous warts are available, although no single therapy has been established as completely curative. Watchful waiting is an option for new warts because many resolve spontaneously. However, patients often request treatment because of social stigma or discomfort. Ideally, treatment should be simple and inexpensive with low risk of adverse effects. Salicylic acid has the best evidence to support its effectiveness, but it is slow to work and requires frequent application for up to 12 weeks. Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen is a favorable option for many patients, with cure rates of 50 to 70 percent after three or four treatments. For recalcitrant warts, Candida or mumps skin antigen can be injected into the wart every three to four weeks for up to three treatments. More expensive treatments for recalcitrant warts are offered in many dermatology offices. Photodynamic therapy with aminolevulinic acid has the best evidence of effectiveness compared with pulsed dye laser, intralesional bleomycin, and surgical removal using curettage or cautery.

### Pulsed dye laser therapy for pediatric warts [^71c5cfba]. Pediatric Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Viral wart infections constitute one of the most common pediatric skin diseases, and various modalities have been used to manage them. Although pulsed dye laser therapy is known to be a safe and efficacious modality, the reported cure rates for this method have varied, and no studies have reported treatment of pediatric patients alone. This prospective, nonblinded, nonrandomized study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pulsed dye laser therapy for pediatric warts. We found that this method is safe, relatively effective, and worth considering as an additional therapeutic option for viral warts in children, although not as a first-line therapy.

### Long-pulsed neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser versus cryotherapy for the treatment of cutaneous warts: a randomized controlled trial [^c97787d7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Observational studies have shown promising therapeutic effects of long-pulsed neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet (LP-Nd:YAG) laser on warts.

Objective

To evaluate whether LP-Nd:YAG laser was superior to cryotherapy for cutaneous warts.

Methods

In this study, 150 adult patients with warts were randomized equally to receive laser or cryotherapy every 3 to 4 weeks, for a maximum of 4 sessions. The primary outcomes were the cure rates at 16 weeks and 6 months; secondary outcomes included time to clearance of warts and treatment-related adverse effects.

Results

There was no difference in the cure rate for laser versus cryotherapy at 16 weeks (54.1% vs 46.7%, respectively) and 6 months (59.5% vs 57.3%, respectively). However, time to clearance of warts, up to 16 weeks and 6 months, tended to be shorter for laser versus cryotherapy (P = .04 and .08, respectively). Post hoc analyses showed a significantly higher cure rate for laser versus cryotherapy in 3 subgroups of human papillomavirus 2/27/57-induced recalcitrant warts but not in their counterpart subgroups. Laser had more mild adverse effects.

Limitations

Single center.

Conclusions

The overall therapeutic effects of LP-Nd:YAG laser were similar to cryotherapy, but laser may be more effective to relatively recalcitrant warts and may be associated with shorter time to clearance of warts.

### Cutaneous warts: an evidence-based approach to therapy [^18b4b297]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Cutaneous warts are a common presenting complaint in children and adolescents. Common, plantar, or flat warts are cutaneous manifestations of the human papillomavirus. The treatment of warts poses a therapeutic challenge for physicians. No single therapy has been proven effective at achieving complete remission in every patient. As a result, many different approaches to wart therapy exist. These approaches are discussed to demonstrate the evidence supporting common therapies and provide a guideline for physicians. Evidence supports the at-home use of topical salicylic acid and physician-administered cryotherapy. Intralesional immunotherapy for nongenital cutaneous warts may be an option for large or recalcitrant warts.

---

### Local treatments for cutaneous warts: systematic review [^0c92d978]. BMJ (2002). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the evidence for the efficacy of local treatments for cutaneous warts.

Methods

Systematic review of randomised controlled trials.

Main Outcomes Measures

Total clearance of warts and adverse effects such as irritation, pain, and blistering.

Study Selection

Randomised controlled trials of any local treatment for uncomplicated cutaneous warts. All published and unpublished material was considered, with no restriction on date or language.

Results

50 included trials provided generally weak evidence because of poor methods and reporting. The best evidence was for topical treatments containing salicylic acid. Data pooled from six placebo controlled trials showed a cure rate of 75% (144 of 191) in cases compared with 48% (89 of 185) in controls (odds ratio 3.91, 95% confidence interval 2.40 to 6.36). Some evidence for the efficacy of contact immunotherapy was provided by two small trials comparing dinitrochlorobenzene with placebo. Evidence for the efficacy of cryotherapy was limited. No consistent evidence was found for the efficacy of intralesional bleomycin, and only limited evidence was found for the efficacy of topical fluorouracil, intralesional interferons, photodynamic therapy, and pulsed dye laser.

Conclusions

Reviewed trials of local treatments for cutaneous warts were highly variable in methods and quality, and there was a paucity of evidence from randomised, placebo controlled trials on which to base the rational use of the treatments. There is good evidence that topical treatments containing salicylic acid have a therapeutic effect and some evidence for the efficacy of dinitrochlorobenzene. Less evidence was found for the efficacy of all the other treatments reviewed, including cryotherapy.

### Paring and intense pulsed light versus paring alone for recalcitrant hand and foot warts: a randomized clinical trial with blinded outcome evaluation [^fbc662e5]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Treatment of recalcitrant viral warts remains a therapeutic challenge. Intense pulsed light (IPL) has been suggested effective to clear wart tissue. The objective was in a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of paring followed by IPL versus paring alone for recalcitrant hand and foot warts.

Materials and Methods

Eighty-nine patients with recalcitrant hand and foot warts were included and randomized (1:1) to three treatments at 3-week intervals with either paring of warts followed by IPL or paring of warts alone. IPL was given with the Ellipse Flex IPL system (Danish Dermatologic Development A/S, Hørsholm, Denmark, 400-950 nm, 5.5 millisecond pulse duration in double pulses with a 2 millisecond interval, 26.0-32.5 J/cm(2) repetitive passes). The primary outcome was complete and partial clearance of warts evaluated by blinded photo assessment at 6 weeks after final treatment. Secondary outcomes were treatment related pain and adverse reactions.

Results

We found no significant difference in clearance of warts between the two intervention groups (OR 1.64, 95% confidence interval 0.62-4.38). Paring followed by IPL resulted in complete or partial clearance of wart tissue in nine (22%) and five patients (12.2%) versus five (13.5%) and four patients (10.8%) from paring alone. Mostly plantar warts were treated (92.1%). The pain intensity after paring and IPL was moderate and significantly higher than the pain intensity after paring alone (P<0.0005). No adverse reactions were observed from the two interventions.

Conclusion

Paring followed by IPL did not differ significantly from paring alone in clearance of recalcitrant hand and foot warts but caused significantly more pain.

### Pulsed dye laser treatment of genital warts [^6479cb86]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Genital warts represent benign epithelial proliferations induced by human papillomavirus. The goal of treatment is the clearance of visible warts. Different regimens are available. Flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser (FPDL) represents one of many treatment options for the management of viral warts (verrucae vulgares), its effectiveness being comparable with that of conventional therapies. We evaluated the effectivity of FPDL light for the treatment of genital warts.

Study Design/Materials and Methods

A prospective study was performed to examine the efficacy of FPDL in untreated genital warts in which 22 patients were included.

Results

All patients showed complete remission after 1.59 (1-5) laser sessions and no scarring was observed.

Conclusions

This study demonstrate that FPDL is a simple and safe, cost and time saving alternative treatment option for genital warts and should be listed in genital warts treatment guidelines.

### Complete resolution of recalcitrant periungual verruca vulgaris using laser-assisted drug delivery [^117f60f4]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Coates et alreported 2 cases of plantar VV treated with Er:YAG and topical cidofovir. In the first case, there was a 60% reduction in tumor size with areas of complete clearance after 9 treatments with Er:YAG and cidofovir, whereas the second case underwent 4 treatments of pulse dye laser with no improvement followed by 5 sessions of Er:YAG and cidofovir, showing 80% clearance on the sole of the right foot, with the fourth toe on the right foot achieving 100% clearance. The use of Er:YAG LADD of cidofovir for periungual VV has not been well documented; our case demonstrates successful treatment with 100% resolution, highlighting an uncommon and effective approach for a challenging lesion location.

The mechanism behind the success of LADD is likely related to the many microchannels with diameters of 430 μm and depth of 450 μm created by the laser which facilitate the penetration of topical cidofovir, allowing the drug to reach the entire viral wart more effectively. An additional advantage of this approach was the excellent tolerability; the patient reported minimal discomfort during the procedure, did not require topical or local anesthesia, and required only minimal wound care, allowing him to continue his daily activities without interruption between sessions.

This case demonstrates complete resolution of recalcitrant periungual VV following treatment with LADD using fractionated Er:YAG laser and topical cidofovir. The excellent clinical outcome, coupled with minimal discomfort and downtime, underscores the potential of this modality as an option for treatment-resistant warts. Further studies are warranted to validate its efficacy in broader patient populations.

### Pulsed dye laser and intralesional bleomycin for treatment of resistant viol hand warts [^591cc689]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Viral warts affect 7-10% of the population and are a major burden on time and resources of dermatology departments everywhere. Some warts prove resistant to multiple therapies, and this is particularly common in the immunosuppressed patient. Numerous treatments are available, but no one treatment has emerged as the treatment of choice. Bleomycin has been shown to be effective in treating warts, but administration can be difficult with risk of local complications. To demonstrate a new technique for easily and safely administrating bleomycin into warts, we undertook an open study to assess the practicality, efficacy, and tolerability of pulsed dye laser immediately followed by intralesional bleomycin in resistant viral hand warts.

Study Design/Materials and Methods

Ten subjects, all with resistant viral hand warts of at least 3 years duration were recruited. Four subjects were on long-term immunosuppressant drugs. Eighteen warts treated in total. Area of the wart was anaesthetized with 1% lignocaine, then treated with a pulsed dye laser (7 mm spot, fluence 10 J/cm2). Immediately following this bleomycin (0.5 IU/ml) was injected into the base of the wart. Monthly follow-up and treatment until satisfactory clearance.

Results

Sixteen out of eighteen warts cleared (89%). Eight out of ten warts in the immunosuppressed subjects cleared. The remaining two warts responded partially to two treatments, but the patient was happy with the result and did not wish further treatment. All warts in the immunocompetent subjects cleared. No serious side effects were seen.

Conclusions

The initial treatment of the wart with pulsed dye laser serves to "prepare" the wart for the bleomycin injection, which can then be given very easily. This ensures the drug is deposited into the base of the wart where it is most needed and minimises the risk of infiltration of normal skin or the operative environment. This method of combining pulsed dye laser and intralesional bleomycin appears to be a safe, rapid, well tolerated, and successful treatment for resistant hand warts. It has proven to be effective in warts in immunosuppressed patients and at difficult sites (e.g., subungual warts). These findings need confirmation from a larger controlled study.

### Laser therapy in cutaneous and genital warts: a review article [^226d0250]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Traditional treatment modalities for wart require long-term treatment course and usually have high recurrence rates and unwanted side effects. In this review article, we evaluated different types of laser therapy in the treatment of warts. Published articles since 2000 up to July 2020 about laser therapy in genital and non-genital warts were searched and assessed. Fifty articles were selected for the final review, including 22 pulsed dye laser (PDL), 10 neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd: YAG), 3 erbium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er: YAG), 14 carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) laser and one systematic review. Complete response rates were different in terms of laser type used (0%-100%, 9.1%-100%, 83.3%-100%, and 59.15%-100% for PDL, Nd: YAG, Er: YAG, and CO 2 laser, respectively). There was no significant difference between conventional treatment modalities and laser therapy regarding efficacy and recurrence rate. Combination of lasers with keratolytic agents, immunomodulators and photodynamic therapy can be helpful especially in immunosuppressed patients, refractory, and recurrent lesions. PDL has the lowest occurrence of adverse effects relative to other types of lasers.

### The treatment of facial verrucae with the pulsed dye laser [^68054fd4]. The Laryngoscope (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To evaluate the treatment of facial verrucae with the pulsed dye laser.

Study Design

A prospective, nonrandomized, nonblinded pilot study evaluating the treatment of facial verrucae with the pulsed dye laser.

Methods

Twelve patients with facial verrucae (four recalcitrant) were identified and followed in the study in the setting of a tertiary referral center. The treatment consisted of the flash-lamp pumped pulsed dye laser (585 mn) with a spot size of 5 mm at fluences between 9.0 and 13 J/cm. Each lesion received one or two pulses with 2 mm of surrounding normal skin included in the treatment. One patient had paring prior to pulse treatment. The patients were examined 3 to 4 weeks after each procedure, and clinical assessment of the lesion was documented.

Results

Patient ages ranged from 18 to 47 years. Four patients had refractory lesions, and eight patients had never undergone previous treatment. All 12 patients had full resolution of their facial warts after one to three treatment sessions. No complications such as scarring, alopecia, or recurrence were encountered. Follow-up ranged from 10 to 33 months.

Conclusions

Pulsed dye laser therapy is highly effective and safe therapy for facial verrucae. This method appears to selectively destroy warts without damaging surrounding skin.

### Laser-assisted delivery of topical cidofovir in the treatment of plantar warts [^5d4226f0]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Recalcitrant plantar warts pose a therapeutic challenge. Cidofovir is a viral DNA polymerase inhibitor that has been used in treatment of verrucae with greater success than traditional treatments in some cases. Laser-assisted drug delivery enhances drug penetration beyond the epidermis and is particularly well-suited, though under-utilized, to target palmoplantar verrucae. We report the use of an erbium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er:YAG) ablative fractional laser (AFL) followed by topical cidofovir in treating recalcitrant plantar warts. Two patients were treated with a 2940-nm Er:YAG laser at depths of 1.2-1.5 mm followed by topical application of cidofovir 75 mg/mL. Both patients exhibited a significant reduction in lesion size and improvement in symptoms. AFL-assisted delivery of topical cidofovir represents a promising therapeutic option for recalcitrant plantar warts.

### Efficacy of cryotherapy for plantar warts: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d7e63050]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Literature search

One‐hundred‐fifty‐three non‐duplicate articles were identified in the initial search strategy. Title and abstract review excluded 127 articles, while a full‐text review excluded an additional 17 articles. Fourteen RCTs were included in this systematic review as outlined in the PRISMA flow diagram (Figure 1).

FIGURE 1 
Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta‐analyzes (PRISMA) flow diagram of the literature search and study selection for the systematic review of cryotherapy in plantar warts

3.2 Study characteristics and risk of bias

The 14 RCTs included 1084 participants with a mean of 77 subjects per study. All studies were published between 1984 and 2020. Only two studies reported the total number of warts treated.

Cryotherapy was compared with 40% trichloroacetic acid solution (TCA),or laser,in two trials, duct tape,intralesional bleomycin,topical 10% formaldehyde soaks,adapalene 0.1% gel,CPS formulation,radiofrequency ablation,salicylic acid,acyclovir cream,or placeboin one trial. In addition, studies carried out by Albalat et al.and Leow et al.compared the efficacy of two modalities of cryotherapy.

All studies were randomized controlled trials and therefore had a level of evidence of 1b and grade of recommendation A according to the Oxford Center for Evidence‐Based Medicine (OCEBM) classification(Table 1).

### Long-pulsed 1064-nm neodymium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser treatment for refractory warts on hands and feet [^65bb1665]. The Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Common warts (verruca vulgaris) are the most commonly seen benign cutaneous tumors. However, warts in the hands and feet regions often respond poorly to treatment, some are resistant to more than 6 months of treatment with currently available modalities, including cryotherapy, being defined as refractory warts. We investigated the usefulness of long-pulsed neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (LP-Nd:YAG) treatment for refractory warts. The clinical trial was conducted on 20 subjects (11 male, nine female) with a total of 34 lesions (periungual/subungual areas, plantar areas, fingers and/or toes). All the subjects suffered from refractory warts despite conventional treatments for more than 6 months. The patients were administrated up to six sessions of treatment, at intervals of 4 weeks between sessions, with an LP-Nd:YAG at a spot size of 5 mm, pulse duration of 15 msec and fluence of 150-185 J/cm(2) . Evaluation of the treatment results at 24 weeks after the initial treatment showed complete clearance of the refractory warts in 56% of the patients. Histological evaluation showed separation of the dermis and epidermis at the basement membrane with coagulated necrosis of the wart tissue in the lower epidermis, as well as coagulation and destruction of the blood vessels in the papillary dermis following the laser irradiation. No scarring, post-hyperpigmentary changes or serious adverse events were documented. Our preliminary results show that LP-Nd:YAG treatments are safe and effective for refractory warts of hands and feet, causing minimal discomfort, and is a viable treatment alternative.

### Treatment of anogenital warts by pulsed dye laser [^4cdb1d24]. Dermatologic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of anogenital warts is difficult in that the disease spectrum is wide. Moreover, varying degrees of improvement are obtained.

Objective

To study the treatment of persistent anogenital warts by pulsed dye laser.

Methods

Pulsed dye laser was used with the following settings: spot size 7 mm, pulse duration 1500 microsec, and fluence 7.5 J/cm2. Two different wavelengths were used: 585 and 595 nm.

Results

Lesions healed completely using both wavelengths after one treatment.

Conclusion

Pulsed dye laser has been found to be safe, effective, satisfactory, and less traumatic compared to other options for treatment of perianal warts in children.

### Pulsed dye laser treatment for facial flat warts [^5c7d8f20]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

The facial flat wart is not only a contagious viral disease, but also a cause of a distressing cosmetic problem. Although there are many therapeutic options, including salicylic acid, imiquimod, cryotherapy, retinoids, intralesional immunotherapy, and topical 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy among others, no monotherapy has been proved to achieve complete remission in every case. Treatment with pulsed dye laser (PDL) seems to be a promising therapeutic option. To assess the efficacy and safety of PDL in a series of patients with viral flat warts on the face, in this prospective study, 32 patients were treated with PDL at 595-nm wavelength, a laser energy density of 9 or 14J/cm(2) with a spot size of 7 or 5mm, respectively, with air cooling and a pulse duration of 0.5millisecond. A complete response was noted in 14 patients (44%), and an excellent response was observed in 18 patients (56%) with 1-year follow-up, with only four recurrences. No significant side effects were reported except intense transitory purpuric response. We consider that PDL is a good option of treatment for flat warts on the face due to its good clinical results, fast response, and low incidence of side effects.

### Management of difficult-to-treat warts: traditional and new approaches [^9d4b3a2c]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Warts are regularly treated by dermatologists, and while many respond readily to first-line treatments, others may represent a therapeutic challenge. Large, deep, numerous, and extensive warts; treatment-resistant lesions with higher risk for side effects, such as hypopigmentation; or patients unable to tolerate or comply with our treatment regimen, may need alternative treatment options. In this work we review the characteristics of select modalities that should be considered for difficult-to-treat warts. We discuss efficacy and tolerability data as well as practical features that can guide us to select the best treatment for every scenario. Novel approaches, still in an investigational phase, are also discussed to illustrate potential future directions of wart treatment.

2.5 Statistical analysis

The patient was the unit of analysis for all studies. Studies reporting similar interventions were combined for meta‐analysis. Thus, the meta‐analysis was conducted in four subgroups: (1) keratolytics; (2) physical treatments; (3) antivirals, chemotherapy, and retinoids; and (4) placebo and others treatments. Review Manager v5.4.1 was used to analyze the data with the Mantel–Haenszel method for dichotomous outcomes according to a fixed‐effect or random‐effects model. Estimates of the intervention's effects are expressed as odd ratio (OR) (95% CI). Heterogeneity was estimated clinically and methodologically, and when Higgins' I 2 exceeded 50%, a random‐effects model was used.

The significance of any discrepancies in the estimates of the treatment effects from the different trials was assessed by means of the Cochrane test for heterogeneity and the I 2 statistic.

### The diverse methods of bleomycin delivery in cutaneous warts: a literature review [^027126b6]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Bleomycin is a useful treatment option for recalcitrant verrucae. Several different methods of bleomycin delivery have been described, including intralesional injection, intralesional injection combined with laser, microneedling, multiple puncture and adhesive tape. We reviewed the literature to evaluate the various methods of bleomycin administration to treat warts, including the different doses, instruments and procedures used. Intralesional injection (cure rate ranged from 67.8% to 99.23%) and topical bleomycin with multipuncture or microneedling methods (63.6% to 100%) were found to be effective in the treatment of warts. Overall, pain is significantly less with microneedling and multipuncture techniques compared with intralesional injection. Bleomycin injection combined with pulsed dye laser, electroporation, or by other methods, such as, microneedle patches or adhesive tape do not seem to be more beneficial than bleomycin administered by intralesional injection, multipuncture or microneedling techniques.

### A comparative study: superficial shaving combined with photodynamic therapy versus cryotherapy in the treatment of recalcitrant plantar warts [^63c1a90a]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Plantar warts are a viral infectious lesion on the foot. The regression of plantar warts can be challenging despite the presence of a variety of available treatment modalities. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been recommended for the treatment of plantar warts. However, the effect of PDT in the treatment of plantar warts is not clear. Thus, we compared the efficacy of combining superficial shaving with PDT (SS-PDT) with that of cryotherapy in the treatment of recalcitrant plantar warts.

Study Design/Materials and Methods

Forty-six patients with 271 warts received SS-PDT, and 26 patients with 147 warts received cryotherapy. For the SS-PDT group, the lesions were shaved in situ, and PDT was performed immediately. For the cryotherapy group, appropriate pressure was applied by freezing rod to fully freeze the lesion tissue. The overall clinical response effects, recurrence rates, adverse events, patient satisfaction and the quality of life were assessed.

Results

The SS-PDT group achieved a 91.3% success rate (defined as >50% on clearance) after treatment for 6 months, whereas only 23.1% of treatment in the cryotherapy group was successful. After 6 months of follow-up, the recurrence rate in the SS-PDT group was significantly lower than that in the cryotherapy group (8.7% vs. 76.9%, P<0.001). The patients with SS-PDT were more satisfied with the treatment than the patients with cryotherapy (8.8±1.4 vs. 4.9±1.4, P<0.001). Moderate pain was the main adverse event in SS-PDT, and cryotherapy may cause severe pain and blistering.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that superficial shaving combined with PDT is promising as a safe and effective therapy for patients with plantar warts, especially for patients with multiple recalcitrant warts. Lasers Surg. Med. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### Efficacy of cryotherapy for plantar warts: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^95caf8ff]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Plantar warts are benign tumors caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) infection of the epidermal cellswith an estimated annual incidence of 14%.The HPV types most frequently detected on the foot are 1, 2, 4, 10, 27, and 57.

A wide variety of treatments, such as cryotherapy, salicylic acid, cantharidin, bleomycin, intralesional immunotherapy, and/or laser are used, but none have been shown to be highly effective in all patients.The aim of most treatments is to destroy the affected epidermal cells, through a chemical burn or damage of the wart tissue by applying physical methods, which damages healthy perilesional tissue and causes pain in patients.But sometimes the cell damage is not sufficient to destroy the latent virus in adjacent cells.As a result, treatments sometimes fail, leading to recalcitrant and recurrent warts.This recurrence leads 2% of the general population to seek annual medical attention due to pain and limitation of some activities, aesthetic reasons, and prevention of infections to other areas of the body or other people.,

Cryotherapy is considered by most of healthcare providing facilities as the treatment of choice in common wart management.It is the most common method for treating wartsand it is based on the destruction of infected tissue by the application of liquid nitrogen‐induced cold, producing a sharp, localized freezing, followed by a slow thawing.The advantages of using cryotherapy are rapid application and cost‐effectivenessalthough pain, dyspigmentation, scar formation, delayed healing, and/or relapses are potential side effects.

Recent systematic reviews of the range of treatments for plantar warts continue to consider cryotherapy together with salicylic acid as one of the treatments of choice.However, this traditional method appears to produce lower cure rates (45.61%) than alternative treatments, such as laser (79.36%), a combination of cantharidin 1%, podophyllotoxin 5%, and salicylic acid 30% (CPS formulation) (97.82%), or topical antivirals (72.45%).

Currently, no specific systematic review using a meta‐analysis of the efficacy of cryotherapy in plantar warts has been published. The objectives of this systematic review and meta‐analysis were to assess cryotherapy efficacy when compared with other interventions to treat plantar warts.

### Saturated saline immersion for the treatment of refractory plantar warts: an open-label, one-arm, single-center trial [^e3a0a500]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Treating plantar warts (PWs) presents a significant challenge due to frequent treatment failures and recurrences. Current therapeutic approaches, such as salicylic acid, cryotherapy, and laser treatment, are destructive. There is a lack of painless and non-invasive treatment options for PWs.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of daily saturated saline immersion PWs over 6 months.

Methods

This single-arm clinical trial enrolled 17 participants with PWs and failed standard treatments, who underwent daily 30-minute saturated saline immersion for 8 weeks. Effectiveness and safety were assessed.

Results

After saturated saline immersion treatment, 98.3 % of lesions (232/236) cleared, and 88.2 % of participants (15/17) achieved complete remission (95 % CI 63.3-97.4 %) at week 8 compared to baseline. No recurrences occurred during the 6-month follow-up.

Limitations

Single-arm design lacking active comparators, limited long-term follow-up for durability assessment.

Conclusion

Daily saturated-salt-water immersion achieved high lesion- and patient-level clearance rates with painless and no short-term recurrence. Randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm these findings.

### Complete resolution of recalcitrant periungual verruca vulgaris using laser-assisted drug delivery [^6e7189f5]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A multitude of treatments and guidelines have been established for VV; however, some cases of recalcitrant VV do not respond to traditional treatment modalities and can significantly affect a patient’s quality of life.A prior study demonstrated that topical cidofovir can have a 55.2% clearance rate when used alone, with no recurrence of lesions observed between 2 months and 3 years’ posttreatment. This highlights its role as an effective treatment option for recalcitrant nongenital VV. Similarly, studies have explored the use of the Er:YAG laser for male genital warts, in which patients undergoing multiple sessions for genital warts achieved good success rates; 61 out of 102 patients achieved a complete response in 12 months of treatment.

LADD has a broad range of applications, and a recent systematic review demonstrated its efficacy in enhancing the topical absorption of drugs. Fractional lasers (ablative and nonablative) are commonly utilized in combination with topical agents for LADD.The review also mentions how the side effects seen from LADD are oftentimes the side effects from the laser itself, including pain, crusting, and erythema. Of note, to our knowledge, none of the studies reported any systemic side effects or systemic adverse events, including no systemic toxicity from the absorption of the topicals.

### Efficacy of cryotherapy for plantar warts: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d7906402]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

In addition, intralesional cryotherapy appears to be more effective than spray‐on cryotherapy, and no differences in efficacy between two rounds of 10‐s and four rounds of 5‐s freeze–thaw cycles in cryotherapy were found.

A 2011 systematic review and meta‐analysis on the efficacy of topical treatments for skin warts concluded that cryotherapy (cure rate: 45%–75%) should be considered as second‐line treatment with salicylic acid (cure rate: 0%–87%) as the first‐line treatment.By contrast, in a recent systematic review, cure rates in plantar warts were found to be higher with cryotherapy (45.61%) than salicylic acid (13.6%).This difference might also be due to the different characteristics of plantar skin and plantar warts.Moreover, cure rates with cryotherapy were also higher than with tape (15%) but low compared to other treatments such as CPS formulation (97.82%), immunotherapy (68.14%), laser (79.36%), topical antivirals (72.45%), and intralesional bleomycin (83.37%).In another recent systematic review of large interventional and observational studies (more than 100 patients per study), the authors concluded that cryotherapy and salicylic acid remain the first‐choice treatments despite having lower efficacy than novel treatments such as laser.Other novel treatments, such as intralesional injections including intralesional immunotherapy, are promising but were not represented owing to lack of large studies.The paucity of RCTs included in each comparison is a limitation in drawing conclusions on the efficacy of cryotherapy compared to other treatments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study Design

This study was designed to determine if NPS energy is safe and effective for the clearance of cutaneous non‐genital verrucae. This was a multicenter, unblinded, non‐significant risk study under the supervision of the Advarra Institutional Review Board (Protocol #: NP‐WP‐010) and registered under(NCT04554394). It conforms with the US Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects. Verrucae were treated with an applicator that best matched the size of the verruca and delivered the energy listed in Table 1. Follow‐up visits were at 7, 30, 60, 90, and 120 days after the initial session for measurements and photography. Four additional sessions were allowed at 30‐day intervals if evidence of the verrucae remained.

Table 1 
Energy Applied With Each Applicator

Subjects

A total of 62 subjects with a mean age of 47 years participated in this study. A total of 257 study verrucae (195 treated and 62 untreated controls) with an average of 4.1 verrucae per subject were enrolled and evaluated at 60‐days post last treatment. Nine subjects discontinued prematurely, and one study center closed after the Day 30 visit due to the restrictions imposed by the COVID‐19 pandemic. Data were available from 58 subjects at Day 30, 53 at Day 60, 50 subjects on Day 90, and 53 subjects at Day 120. Of the 257 verrucae, 73% were common, 20.6% were plantar and 6.4% were flat verrucae, and the predominant locations were the hand (49.1%) and foot (29.6%). 63.5% of these verrucae were considered recalcitrant (Table 2).

INTRODUCTION

Non‐genital verrucae (verruca vulgaris) are common benign lesions resulting from the infection of epidermal cells with the human papillomavirus (HPV). They appear as thickened, round, raised papules on the skin. Common verrucae are most often seen on the hands and present as skin‐colored papules with a rough “verrucous” surface. Flat verrucae are most often seen on the backs of the hands and on the legs and appear as slightly elevated, small plaques that are skin‐colored or light brown. Plantar verrucae occur on the soles of the feet and look like very thick callouses.

Current treatments for common and flat verrucae involve the destruction of the infected cells. Chemical approaches include daily topical salicylic acid, topical cantharidin, or intralesional injections of agents with immune activity or cell‐killing activity. Physical destruction modalities include freezing the verrucae with liquid nitrogen cryotherapy and burning them off with electrodessication or laser treatment.

### Efficacy of cryotherapy for plantar warts: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^41e40d30]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

2 MATERIAL AND METHODS

This systematic review and meta‐analyses were performed in accordance with the general guidelines and recommendations made by preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta‐analyzes (PRISMA).

2.1 Literature search

Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science were systematically searched in July of 2021. The following search terms together with the Boolean operator “AND”: “plantar warts,” “treatment,” and “cryotherapy” were used.

2.2 Article selection

Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of the effects of cryotherapy of plantar warts, in male and/or female patients of any age, published in English or Spanish, from the first article published until July 2021.

Title and abstract review were performed independently by two reviewers. Any discrepancies between the two reviewers were discussed with a third reviewer. Articles were excluded in which the treatment was carried out on common and/or genital warts and in which the cure rate of any of the topical treatment was not recorded.

2.3 Data extraction

Two reviewers independently reviewed full texts for inclusion, and data extraction of the included articles was performed. The following outcomes were collected from each study: (1) type of study, (2) demographic data (number subjects, age, and sex), (3) topical interventions, (4) type of treatment (chemical, physical, antiviral, and immunotherapy), (5) complete cure rate (%), and (6) the number of treatment sessions.

2.4 Quality assessment and risk of bias

The type of study was also recorded and classified according to levels of evidence and grades of recommendation proposed by the Oxford Center for Evidence‐Based Medicine (OCEBM).

The risk of bias was estimated for two experienced reviewers independently (SGO and FJAA) using the Cochrane Collaboration's toolfor assessing risk of bias, according to six specific domains: (1) random‐sequence generation (selection bias), (2) allocation concealment (selection bias), (3) blinding (performance bias and detection bias), (4) incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), (5) selective reporting (reporting bias), and (6) other biases (including supposed financial support). Each domain was evaluated for low, high, or unclear risk for bias. Any discrepancies between the two reviewers were discussed with a third reviewer.

### Safety and efficacy of nano-pulse stimulation treatment of non-genital, cutaneous warts (verrucae) [^74b0ff95]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

This study describes the effects of nano‐pulse stimulation (NPS) technology on the common verruca with the objectives of demonstrating efficacy and safety. NPS technology applies nanosecond pulses of non‐thermal electrical energy to induce highly localized regulated cell death in the cellular structures of the targeted zone with negligible effects on surrounding non‐cellular structures. Previous clinical studies applying NPS to common, benign skin lesions have demonstrated safety and efficacy in clearing seborrheic keratoses and sebaceous hyperplasia.

Study Design/Materials and Methods

Sixty‐two subjects were enrolled at a total of five sites. One hundred and ninety‐five study verrucae up to 10 mm wide were treated with NPS delivered by a console‐based handheld applicator (CellFX® System; Pulse Biosciences) and follow‐ups occurred every 30 days with the option to retreat at 30, 60, and 90 days. There were 62 untreated controls and 46% of the treated verrucae were recalcitrant.

Results

Overall, 75.3% (70/93) of the common verrucae, 72.7% (8/11) of the flat verrucae, and 43.8% (14/32) of the plantar verrucae treated with NPS were completely clear by 60 days following the last treatment and did not recur within the 120‐day observation period. The majority (54%) of verrucae cleared with a single NPS procedure. The most common treatment site reactions were erythema (50.5%) and eschar formation (23.4%) on Day 30 and on Day 120 mild erythema was present in 14% of the cases and hyperpigmentation in 18.5%. No serious adverse events were reported. A particle counter was used during 11 NPS procedures on verrucae and no significant plume generation was detected during these procedures.

Conclusions

NPS is a safe and effective procedure for removing non‐genital, cutaneous verrucae. Lasers Surg. Med. © 2021 The Authors. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.

### Efficacy of cryotherapy for plantar warts: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^42f8fb99]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, one RCT enrolled 119 patients and compared the effects of cryotherapy spray versus intralesional cryotherapy,and other RCT enrolled 49 patients and compared two different liquid nitrogen cryotherapy regimes.Clinical improvement differed significantly favoring the intralesional cryotherapy (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.09–0.48), and no differences in efficacy between two rounds of 10‐s and four rounds of 5‐s freeze–thaw cycles in cryotherapy (OR 3.26, 95% CI 0.13–83.90) were found.

### Management of cutaneous warts: an evidence-based approach [^e4a710d8]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Cutaneous warts are benign epidermal proliferations caused by human papillomavirus infection. Treatment aims to cure the patient's physical and psychological discomfort, and to prevent the spread of infection by contact with other body areas or with other individuals. Among the available medical and destructive therapeutic options for cutaneous warts, none is uniformly effective or virucidal. Moreover, in most cases the safety and efficacy of these treatment options has not been assessed in randomized controlled trials, so that the reproducibility of many of the listed treatments is difficult to evaluate and a possible placebo effect cannot be ruled out. This article provides indications for the management of patients with cutaneous warts through an evidence-based approach, considering a first-, second-, and third-line therapy for each clinical form. The first line includes medical treatments useful to cure single, or few, and/or small common warts of short duration (<1 year). If these treatments have failed or are contraindicated, cryotherapy may be considered as second-line therapy. For recurrent or difficult-to-treat lesions, a third-line of therapy includes a variety of alternative therapeutic options that are in clinical use but are not necessarily approved by the US FDA, and their use may be further limited by adverse effects.

### Efficacy of cryotherapy for plantar warts: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^aeff5134]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Regarding the level of evidence and the degree of recommendation of the included studies, all were controlled and RCTs with a level of evidence of 1b and degree of recommendation A. In 10/14 and 11/14 of the included studies, a high risk‐of‐bias in the blinding of results and of participants and/or professionals respectively was found. A high risk‐of‐bias in the allocation concealment in 4/14 studies and high risk of bias in the random sequency in 1/14 studies was found. In general, in all studies a medium or high risk of bias in some of the items was observed, mainly due to lack of information. Even though all studies were randomized clinical trials, the high risk of bias in the blinding of patients and professionals together with the lack of information in most of the studies limits the conclusions of this review with meta‐analysis. In the meta‐analysis by Bertolotti et al.concerning the efficacy of cryotherapy for anogenital warts, they also found a high risk of bias in blinding. The authors consider blinding of the practitioner applying a non‐pharmacological treatment to be difficult and recommend the design of strategies for future RCTs, such as not informing participants of the study objectives until the end of the study.

Another limitation of the present study is the total cure rate was only analyzed and other aspects, such as partial clearance, number of sessions, time to cure, patient satisfaction, quality of life during treatment, and cost‐effectiveness ratios were not considered. Many of these variables were also not reported in most other studies. In addition, the intensity of cryotherapy and duration of application or form of application (spray or swab) was not sufficiently standardized in the RCTs. The lack of studies of each treatment was another limitation when making the subgroups since not enough articles could be found to be able to analyze each intervention separately from cryotherapy. Therefore, we grouped the treatments into four major subgroups (keratolytics, physical treatments, antiviral, chemotherapy, and retinoids, and placebo and others). For this reason, heterogeneity was high in most of the subgroups.

### Emerging intralesional treatments for plantar warts: a systematic review [^7dd0ac1e]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Therapies for plantar warts remain subjective and unclear, which has led to continual pursuit of an optimal treatment. As a consequence, many intralesional therapies have emerged over the last decade. This warrants a systematic review from a clinical lens which provides updates on intralesional treatment options for plantar warts from the last decade.

Methods

A PubMed/MEDLINE literature search was performed, in accordance with PRISMA reporting guidelines for systematic reviews. Original peer-reviewed articles on safety/efficacy of intralesional plantar wart treatments, published from January 2012 to January 2021, were considered for inclusion.

Results

Twenty-6 studies were included and the following intralesional modalities were identified (median cure rates): vitamin D3 (80%), bleomycin (74%), 5-fluorouracil (59%), Candida antigen (66%), zinc sulfate (70%), and purified protein derivative (67%).

Conclusion

Intralesional vitamin D3, in particular, demonstrated promising results as a potential second- or even first-line agent although not accessible in the United States. Candida antigen and bleomycin are less effective than intralesional vitamin D3, but given their greater accessibility and superiority to cryotherapy, should continue to be considered for treating recalcitrant plantar warts. Moreover, the quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, showing success in case reports, warrants further attention for both the treatment and prevention of plantar warts.

### Treatment of genital lesions with diode laser vaporization [^1f43d17f]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Laser therapy has been shown to be effective in a number of conditions, with probably the largest body of work conducted to examine the efficacy of laser surgery for the removal of different oral lesions such as simple soft tissue surgery (e.g. frenectomy, gingival contouring plasty) [,-], vascular lesions (e.g. hemangiomas, telangiectasias) and pigmented lesions. Other areas where lasers have become a key option for treatment include cosmetic applications such as laser hair removal and laser tattoo removal, and various dermatological applications, including conditions such as syringoma, xanthelasma palpebrarum, recalcitrant warts, rhinophyma, epidermal nevi, condyloma and intraepithelial neoplasia and milia [-]. These studies have suggested a number of advantages of laser surgery over traditional scalpel surgical procedures, such as greater precision, a relatively bloodless surgical and postsurgical course, sterilization of the surgical area, minimal swelling and scarring, coagulation, vaporization, cutting, minimal or no suturing, and less or no postsurgical pain.

There have been few studies to date that have examined the efficacy of laser therapy as a destructive therapy for genital warts [-]. Because warts are vascular, laser therapy should result in instant coagulation and therefore provide bloodless removal of the lesion. The few studies of genital lesions conducted to date suggest clearance rates ranging between 23% and 52% for carbon dioxide and pulse dye laser therapy; however recurrence rates as high as 77% have also been reported. However, the description of the use of laser diode vaporization in urological applications is still limited, and further work is required to fully understand the effectiveness of laser diode vaporization as a treatment for various urological conditions. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the efficacy of diode laser vaporization treatment in genital lesions.

### Intralesional human papillomavirus vaccine for the treatment of recalcitrant cutaneous warts [^9827ff32]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is ubiquitously distributed in the population worldwide and its most frequent clinical presentation is cutaneous warts. Despite various treatment options currently available, many patients experience persistent and refractory disease. We sought to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety profile of intralesional HPV 9-valent vaccine for the treatment of recalcitrant warts. A retrospective study was performed for all cases of cutaneous warts treated with intralesional 9-valent HPV vaccine between January 2017 and March 2021. Epidemiologic, clinical, and treatment data, including safety and effectiveness scores, were reviewed. Our cohort was composed of 20 patients: 13 adults and seven children. Twelve patients (60%) displayed a complete response whereas 8 patients (40%) showed a partial response. Older age was associated with a better response to treatment, while a history of laser therapy was associated with a worse prognosis. Adverse events were local, transient, and negligible. No systemic adverse effects were reported. Intralesional 9-valent HPV vaccine may be considered for the treatment of recalcitrant cutaneous warts. Controlled studies are required to confirm these results.

### Cryotherapy versus salicylic acid for the treatment of plantar warts (verrucae): a randomised controlled trial [^93e6d36b]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Outcome measurements

Primary outcome

The primary outcome was complete clearance of all plantar warts at 12 weeks after randomisation. Clearance of plantar wart was defined as the restoration of normal skin on close inspection. Digital photographs of the plantar wart(s) were taken at baseline and at the outcome assessment. The photographs were assessed by two assessors who were blind to treatment allocation. They independently assessed the photographs for each participant to determine whether the plantar wart had cleared. Any discrepancies were referred to a third assessor. If no photographs were available for a participant, however, then the blinded outcome assessment undertaken at the site was used. If neither of these were available for a participant, the patient’s self reported outcome recorded in the week 12 patient questionnaire or on the “Verrucae gone form” was used.

Secondary outcomes

Secondary outcomes included (a) complete clearance of all plantar warts at 12 weeks after controlling for age, whether the plantar wart had been treated previously, and type of wart and (b) a second model to explore the effect of patient preferences, (c) with clearance of plantar wart at six months, (d) number of warts at 12 weeks, (e) time to clearance of wart, (f) patient satisfaction with the treatment, and (g) adverse events. Questionnaires were administered by post or were completed on line at one, three, and 12 weeks and six months.

### Safety and efficacy of nano-pulse stimulation treatment of non-genital, cutaneous warts (verrucae) [^fe95ed6f]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This multicenter study represents the first controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of NPS technology in the treatment of cutaneous non‐genital verrucae. Previous studies treating other skin lesions have demonstrated that NPS induces regulated cell death to cellular components in the epidermis and dermis while sparing the acellular dermal matrix. The clinical results from this study indicate that the HPV‐infected epidermal cells of all three major types of non‐genital verrucae were effectively cleared. The 75.3% NPS clearance rate for common verrucae compares quite favorably with the 49% clearance rate reported in the literature for cryotherapy. More importantly, this clearance rate required only one or two procedure sessions for 72% of the verrucae whereas cryotherapy often requires more treatments. Moreover, NPS had a 63.5% clearance rate when treating recalcitrant verrucae. The clearance rate for plantar verrucae was only 43.8% and this lower clearance rate is most likely due to the much thicker stratum corneum on the bottom of the foot preventing the short (2 mm) microneedles from reaching the entire verruca. Ongoing studies using 3‐mm‐long microneedles are in support of this hypothesis thus far.

Another common challenge with verrucae is their high recurrence rate when treated with cryotherapy. None of the 195 verrucae treated with NPS recurred over the 120‐day observation period, suggesting that the NPS‐cleared verrucae may exhibit a lower rate of recurrence than that observed with other treatment methods.

### Efficacy of cryotherapy for plantar warts: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e518a74e]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Recent systematic reviews of plantar warts continue to consider cryotherapy as one of the treatments of choice, but this method appears to have lower cure rates than alternative treatments. A systematic review using meta‐analyses of the efficacy of cryotherapy in plantar warts treatment was performed. Systematic electronic searches were conducted. The primary endpoint was complete clearance of plantar warts. Risk‐of‐bias assessment was based on Cochrane Handbook recommendations. Meta‐analyses used Review Manager v5.4.1 software. Cryotherapy appears to have lower cure rates than other treatments (odds ratio [OR] 0.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12–0.78) with substantial heterogeneity (I 2 = 80%). A second subgroup analysis had low heterogeneity (I 2 = 28.2%). Subgroup analysis showed that plantar wart cure rates were significantly lower with cryotherapy compared to the physical treatment group (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01–0.49) with substantial heterogeneity (I 2 = 79%), and antiviral, chemotherapy, and retinoid group (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.14–0.66) without heterogeneity (I 2 = 0%). Intralesional versus spray‐on cryotherapy appears to be more effective (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.09–0.48). No difference in efficacy between two rounds of 10‐s and four rounds of 5‐s freeze–thaw cycles in cryotherapy was found. Evidence of the superiority of antivirals and chemotherapy over cryotherapy in the treatment of plantar warts was found. However, no evidence supports the superiority or inferiority of cryotherapy compared to other treatments.

### Safety and efficacy of nano-pulse stimulation treatment of non-genital, cutaneous warts (verrucae) [^96488a34]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The new, non‐thermal, cell‐focused modality of NPS exhibits a 75.3% clearance rate of common verrucae, 72.7% of flat verrucae, and 43.8% of plantar verrucae, with the majority clearing in one NPS session. Additionally, none of these cleared verrucae recurred within the 120‐day observation period. Most were cleared with only one or two procedure sessions in which the delivery of NPS pulses was less than a minute long. There were no serious adverse reactions and the result of all the NPS procedures was scar‐free, re‐epithelialized skin.

There have been anecdotal reports that local hyperthermia was effective in the treatment of viral warts. We conducted a randomized, patient-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to test the effect of local hyperthermia (44 degrees C for 30 min a day for 3 consecutive days plus 2 additional days 2 weeks later) on plantar warts. By the end of 3 months, 53.57% of patients (15/28) in the treatment group and 11.54% of patients (3/26) in the control group were cured (P < .01). The effect was not influenced by patient age, duration of disease, or number or size of lesions.

### Combination of carbon dioxide laser therapy and artificial dermis application in plantar warts: human papillomavirus DNA analysis after treatment [^99f6175a]. Dermatologic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Various laser therapies have been used to treat viral warts, and numerous successful results have been reported, but plantar warts are notoriously difficult to treat and eradicate.

Materials & Methods

This study included 35 lesions in 31 patients (17 female, 14 male) with plantar warts. We used a carbon dioxide (CO₂) laser for incisions, and the defect was covered with artificial dermis. Follow-up periods ranged from 3 to 12 months. Overall, we examined the presence or absence of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) DNA in the lesional skin of all cases and at the excisional site after treatment in 20 cases.

Results

Thirty-one of 35 lesions (88.6%) achieved complete clearance after one treatment session. We observed local recurrence in four lesions (11.4%). The application of salicylic acid was effective in treating minor recurrent cases. After complete remission, HPV DNA was not detected in the upper epidermis of the postoperative site. No significant scars or severe pain were seen in any patients.

Conclusion

A combination of CO₂ laser therapy and artificial dermis application effectively treated the majority of plantar warts after one treatment, with complete and rapid clearance and no persistent pain. The authors have indicated no significant interest with commercial supporters.

### Cryotherapy versus salicylic acid for the treatment of plantar warts (verrucae): a randomised controlled trial [^0bca11c4]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

All analyses were conducted on an intention to treat basis, including all patients in the groups to which they were randomised. Analyses were conducted in SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, NC, USA) and SPSS version 17.0.2 (SPSS) using two sided significance tests at the 5% significance level for the primary outcome measure and 1% significance level for secondary outcome measures.

Primary analysis

The primary analysis compared the clearance rate of all plantar warts at 12 weeks between the two randomised groups using a χ 2 test. Cohen’s κ measure of inter-rater agreement was used to assess agreement between the two assessors of the photographs for clearance.

Secondary analysis

A logistic regression model was used to adjust the primary analysis for important prognostic variables (age, whether the plantar wart had been previously treated, and type of wart). We also extended the primary outcome model to explore the effect of patient preferences by including preference and an interaction term between preferred treatment and randomised treatment. The complete clearance of all plantar warts at six months was analysed in the same way as the primary outcome with adjustments for the same covariates. We used negative binomial regression to compare the number of plantar warts at 12 weeks between the two treatment groups with adjustment for the number of plantar warts at baseline. These models are used to estimate the number of occurrences of an event when the event has Poisson variation with over-dispersion.

The time to clearance of plantar warts was derived as the number of days from randomisation until the date of clearance, as detailed from the participant’s self reported questionnaire. Participants whose plantar warts had not cleared were treated as censored, and we calculated their duration in the trial from their date of trial exit, date of last available assessment, or the 183 days to trial cessation, as appropriate. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the time to clearance of plantar warts between the two groups adjusting for the same covariates as for the primary outcome. The Cox proportional hazard assumption was tested globally by the correlation of Schoenfeld residuals and survival time (or ranked survival time) and separately for each covariate through the correlation of Schoenfeld scaled residuals and survival time (or ranked survival time). Non-significant correlation indicates that there is not enough evidence that the proportional hazard assumption has been violated.

Data on patient satisfaction with the treatment and adverse events were summarised by treatment group but no statistical analyses were performed.

### Outcomes of a modified intralesional bleomycin technique for recalcitrant warts: a case series [^1191af85]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, our case series shows that a low-dose “paint and poke” intralesional bleomycin technique can effectively clear refractory warts in immunocompromised patients, including those with CKD. Notably, the use of this technique, distributing a small total dose across the wart, likely underpins the high tolerability and absence of systemic side effects observed in our CKD patients. We achieved a 90.9% clearance rate using 0.1 U/mL bleomycin delivered via superficial multipuncture, with only mild and transient side effects and no systemic toxicity.

Although our sample size was small, the high efficacy observed suggests the modified bleomycin technique is promising for recalcitrant warts in CKD patients. Results should be confirmed in larger studies, but this series demonstrates that a low-dose, broad-distribution approach can yield clearance rates on the order of prior reports’ upper range, even in immunocompromised hosts. Our result supports the idea that lower doses are sufficient when paired with enhanced delivery techniques. Our findings build on prior research supporting bleomycin for recalcitrant warts, and suggest that this protocol balances safety and efficacy well.

We advocate further controlled studies to optimize technique, clarify the role of mechanical immune stimulation, and compare outcomes across treatment modalities like cryotherapy, candida antigen, or laser. Until then, clinicians may consider incorporating this approach into the armamentarium for difficult warts, particularly when conventional therapies fail or pose safety concerns.

### Photodynamic therapy using light-emitting diodes for the treatment of viral warts [^ada65aae]. The Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Photodynamic therapy with topical 5-aminolevulinic acid is an effective and safe treatment for actinic keratosis and superficial non-melanoma skin cancer. Further, some studies have reported good efficacy when using photodynamic therapy to treat viral warts. The light-emitting diode is an incoherent, narrow-spectrum light source. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of photodynamic therapy using a light-emitting diode for viral warts. Six patients with a total of 41 foot and hand warts were recruited in this study. They were treated with 20% 5-aminolevulinic acid cream under occlusion for 5 h. Thereafter, the treated area was irradiated with the light from a red light-emitting diode (633 +/- 6 nm) with a dose of 126 J/cm(2). This treatment was repeated at 2- or 3-week intervals. The rate of improvement observed in patients was 68.3%. The adverse effects included mild to moderate pain and erythema, which was well-tolerated by all six patients. No patients withdrew from the study due to the adverse effects. Photodynamic therapy with topical 5-aminolevulinic acid using the light from a red light-emitting diode has the advantage of non-invasiveness, minimal associated adverse reactions, and production of good results in a significant proportion of cases: therefore, it is an alternative treatment for recalcitrant viral warts.

### Patient with papillomatous lesions [^f0ce6a93]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 2: How can the papillomatous lesions seen in this condition be managed? 
A. Ongoing monitoring
B. Cryotherapy
C. Surgical intervention
D. Laser therapy
E. All the above

Answers: 
A. Ongoing monitoring – Incorrect. Although this is a reasonable treatment option, it is not the only correct answer. These papillomatous lesions are benign and do not require excision unless symptomatic or functionally impairing.
B. Cryotherapy – Incorrect. While cryotherapy is considered a possible treatment for these lesions, it is not the only intervention used. Furthermore, while this is less invasive than surgical excision, concerns regarding possible recurrence and feasibility for larger lesions do exist.
C. Surgical intervention – Incorrect. Surgical intervention such as excision or curettage has demonstrated good results in the management of Goltz syndrome associated papillomas and is a treatment option, but depending on their location and patient preference, it might not be necessary or possible.
D. Laser therapy – Incorrect. Different laser therapies, such as CO 2 laser vaporization and pulsed dye laser, have been shown efficacious in the management of these papillomas.
E. All the above – Correct. All the above treatment strategies can be used depending on patient preference, location, and functional impairment.

### Safety and efficacy of nano-pulse stimulation treatment of non-genital, cutaneous warts (verrucae) [^7c2be79a]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Two‐thirds of the treatments (65.6%, 128/195) were performed with a 5 mm tip and very few had concomitant curettage (95.4%, 186/195). Overall, 75.3% (70/93) of the common verrucae, 72.7% (8/11) of the flat verrucae, and 43.8% (14/32) of the plantar verrucae treated with NPS were completely clear by 60 days following the last procedure and did not recur within the 120‐day observation period. Moreover, 71% (50/70) of those completely cleared common verrucae were cleared with only a single procedure session and 94% (66/70) were cleared after two procedure sessions. 76.6% (49/64) of previously untreated verrucae were completely clear by 60 days after the last session as compared with 59.7% (43/72) of the treated recalcitrant verrucae (Fig. 2). This contrasts with only 24.5% of the control verrucae clearing by 120 days.

Treatment Site Reactions

Immediately after the procedure, mild erythema and mild edema were observed regardless of location.

The edema subsided over a few days and by Day 30, the most common site reactions were erythema (50.5%) and eschar formation (23.4%) (Table 3). By 60 days post last procedure, most treated regions reverted to normal appearance, but some still exhibited mild erythema (14%) and mild hyperpigmentation (22.8%). Examples of these transient skin reactions can be seen in the photographs illustrating five verruca treatments (Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6). By 120 days post‐treatment, the treated regions appeared normal and scar‐free (Figs. 3, 4).

### Real-life treatment of cutaneous warts with cantharidin podophyllin salicylic acid solution [^7dafa702]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Table 3 
Overview of studies regarding treatment of cutaneous warts with topical application of CPS1, CPS2, or CPS3 solution

This was the first study evaluating treatment outcomes after topical application of CPS1 solution for the management of cutaneous warts in children versus adults. As this study shows, children more often than adults seek treatment for warts due to social and cosmetic inconveniences. Children are more difficult to treat as painful treatments are poorly tolerated and should preferably be avoided (Sterling et al. 2014). In daily practice, this can be challenging for both doctor and patient. Therefore, a distinction between children and adults is crucial in evaluating and choosing an adequate, satisfactory, and effective topical treatment for cutaneous warts (Bruggink, Eekhof, et al. 2013 ; Sterling et al. 2014). A review of the management of cutaneous warts in children proposed salicylic acid 25–35% as the preferred treatment for children with large, multiple, or periungual warts due to easy daily application at home and mild side effects. Cryotherapy was viewed as another simple and easy treatment, however often poorly tolerated by children due to pain, scarring and post‐inflammatory hyper‐ or hypopigmentation. They also considered cantharidin to be a valuable option for the treatment of cutaneous warts in children (Gerlero & Hernández‐Martín, 2017). The current study shows that CPS1 solution is a safe, rather quick, well tolerated and highly appreciated treatment for warts in children. However, application of the CPS1 solution by trained health care professionals is mandated (Torbeck et al. 2014). Still, costs for treatment of warts could be greatly reduced, as only limited treatment sessions (median number of 3) are needed to achieve complete resolution of warts in children compared to cryotherapy. In addition, the recurrences reported for CPS1 solution (10.6 and 19.4% for children and adults, respectively) are roughly lower or comparable to other treatments of cutaneous warts with duct tape (75%), cryotherapy (13.3–25%), 5% 5‐fluorouracil (13–15%), and pulsed dye laser (0–36%; Dhar, Rashid, Islam, & Bhuiyan, 2009 ; Gladsjo et al. 2009 ; Salk et al. 2006 ; Veitch, Kravvas, & Al‐Niaimi, 2017 ; Wenner et al. 2007 ; Youn, Kwon, Park, Kim, & Kim, 2011). Two studies reported no recurrences after treatment of cutaneous warts with CPS2 solution (Table 3) (Becerro de Bengoa Vallejo et al. 2008 ; Kaçar et al. 2012). Recurrences of cutaneous warts after topical treatment with salicylic acid are unknown. As the protocol for treatment with CPS1 solution is rather simple, one could wonder about the place of this treatment in the therapeutic arsenal of cutaneous warts. CPS1 solution could be a promising second line treatment for cutaneous warts in hospitals (and primary care) following ineffective first line treatment with salicylic acid, particularly in children.

### Efficacy of cryotherapy for plantar warts: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^528c5897]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this study is the first systematic review consisting of a meta‐analysis that evaluates the efficacy of cryotherapy for the treatment of plantar warts.

This systematic review with meta‐analysis of the efficacy of cryotherapy in patients with plantar warts indicated that cryotherapy appears to have lower cure rates than other treatments in most randomized clinical trials published so far. However, the high heterogeneity (I 2 = 80%) allowed us to conclude that no evidence supports the superiority or inferiority of cryotherapy when compared to other treatments. When we performed a meta‐analysis by subgroups (keratolytics, physical treatments, antiviral, chemotherapy, and retinoids, and placebo and others), heterogeneity between subgroups was low (I 2 = 28.2%), and the cure rates of plantar warts were significantly lower with cryotherapy compared to the physical treatment group and the antiviral, chemotherapy, and retinoids group. The high heterogeneity (I 2 = 79%) of the results of the meta‐analysis of the physical treatment subgroup allowed us to conclude that no evidence supports the superiority of this group over cryotherapy. In contrast, the zero heterogeneity (I 2 = 0) found in the meta‐analysis of the antiviral and chemotherapy treatment subgroup does provide evidence for the superiority of these treatments over cryotherapy. In both the keratolytic and placebo groups, no statistically significant findings to support the superiority or inferiority of cryotherapy was found, but these results are also inconclusive due to the high heterogeneity found in both groups (I 2 = 54% and I 2 = 83%, respectively).

### Topical treatments for cutaneous warts [^e0127d2d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Viral warts are a common skin condition, which can range in severity from a minor nuisance that resolve spontaneously to a troublesome, chronic condition. Many different topical treatments are available.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of local treatments for cutaneous non-genital warts in healthy, immunocompetent adults and children.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to May 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2010), AMED (from 1985), LILACS (from 1982), and CINAHL (from 1981). We searched reference lists of articles and online trials registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of topical treatments for cutaneous non-genital warts.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials and extracted data; a third author resolved any disagreements.

Main Results

We included 85 trials involving a total of 8815 randomised participants (26 new studies were included in this update). There was a wide range of different treatments and a variety of trial designs. Many of the studies were judged to be at high risk of bias in one or more areas of trial design.Trials of salicylic acid (SA) versus placebo showed that the former significantly increased the chance of clearance of warts at all sites (RR (risk ratio) 1.56, 95% CI (confidence interval) 1.20 to 2.03). Subgroup analysis for different sites, hands (RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.43 to 5.01) and feet (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.55), suggested it might be more effective for hands than feet.A meta-analysis of cryotherapy versus placebo for warts at all sites favoured neither intervention nor control (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.65 to 3.23). Subgroup analysis for different sites, hands (RR 2.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 15.94) and feet (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.07), again suggested better outcomes for hands than feet. One trial showed cryotherapy to be better than both placebo and SA, but only for hand warts.There was no significant difference in cure rates between cryotherapy at 2-, 3-, and 4-weekly intervals.Aggressive cryotherapy appeared more effective than gentle cryotherapy (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.15), but with increased adverse effects.Meta-analysis did not demonstrate a significant difference in effectiveness between cryotherapy and SA at all sites (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.71) or in subgroup analyses for hands and feet.Two trials with 328 participants showed that SA and cryotherapy combined appeared more effective than SA alone (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.43).The benefit of intralesional bleomycin remains uncertain as the evidence was inconsistent. The most informative trial with 31 participants showed no significant difference in cure rate between bleomycin and saline injections (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.78).Dinitrochlorobenzene was more than twice as effective as placebo in 2 trials with 80 participants (RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.38 to 3.26).Two trials of clear duct tape with 193 participants demonstrated no advantage over placebo (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.51 to 4.05).We could not combine data from trials of the following treatments: intralesional 5-fluorouracil, topical zinc, silver nitrate (which demonstrated possible beneficial effects), topical 5-fluorouracil, pulsed dye laser, photodynamic therapy, 80% phenol, 5% imiquimod cream, intralesional antigen, and topical alpha-lactalbumin-oleic acid (which showed no advantage over placebo).We did not identify any RCTs that evaluated surgery (curettage, excision), formaldehyde, podophyllotoxin, cantharidin, diphencyprone, or squaric acid dibutylester.

Authors' Conclusions

Data from two new trials comparing SA and cryotherapy have allowed a better appraisal of their effectiveness. The evidence remains more consistent for SA, but only shows a modest therapeutic effect. Overall, trials comparing cryotherapy with placebo showed no significant difference in effectiveness, but the same was also true for trials comparing cryotherapy with SA. Only one trial showed cryotherapy to be better than both SA and placebo, and this was only for hand warts. Adverse effects, such as pain, blistering, and scarring, were not consistently reported but are probably more common with cryotherapy.None of the other reviewed treatments appeared safer or more effective than SA and cryotherapy. Two trials of clear duct tape demonstrated no advantage over placebo. Dinitrochlorobenzene (and possibly other similar contact sensitisers) may be useful for the treatment of refractory warts.

Fig. 6 
Recalcitrant plantar verruca treated previously with cryotherapy on a 22‐year‐old female with Fitzpatrick class II skin type. (A) Before procedure; (B) Day 60; (C) Day 90. Mild flaking was observed on Day 60. All white scale bars indicate 5 mm.

Approximately half of the treated verrucae were located on the hand and a typical photographic montage is shown in Figure 3. An example of a pair of knee verrucae that were treated is in Figure 4. Plantar verrucae are particularly difficult to eliminate with most common treatments but 43% of those treated with NPS were cleared (Figs. 5 and 6).

Adverse Events (AEs)

Eight subjects reported nine treatment‐related AEs: transient numbness which improved by Day 7 and was gone by Day 62, suspected infection, pain during the procedure, and numbness and edema. None of the AEs were severe and all had resolved by study end. No medical intervention was required for any of these.

Procedural Pain

Each subject was asked to score their pain during the treatment on an 11‐point scale in which 0 indicates no pain and 10 the worst imaginable pain. Two‐thirds of verruca treatments were rated as 0–4, indicating minimal to tolerable pain and only 15% of the treatments were rated above 6. Treatment location was also a factor with the hand exhibiting higher average pain scores than any of the other treatment regions. Differences in pain scores were most likely attributed to differences in the 2% lidocaine injection volumes and the depth of injection.

Absence of Plume Generation

Eleven verruca procedures were monitored with a condensation particle counter located within 18 inches of the treated area. No significant plume could be detected during these procedures, which both minimizes the likelihood of airborne viral DNA and differentiates NPS from verruca treatment methods currently used.

### Comparing therapy costs for physician treatment of warts [^e89ba597]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

To compare the cost of several common modalities used to treat non-genital warts in immunocompetent patients, we identified studies published in English using standard search strategies and evaluated the literature for the following common non-genital wart therapies: cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen, carbon dioxide and pulsed-dye laser therapy, topical squaric acid, intralesional bleomycin, intralesional interferon alpha injections, and intralesional immunotherapy with Candida antigens. Standard treatment algorithms, compiled by dermatologists experienced in the treatment of patients with moderate wart burdens, were utilized for cost-comparison analyses. Based on the cost analysis model, the least expensive treatment option for non-genital warts were carbon dioxide laser therapy (157 dollars) and Candida antigen injections (190 dollars). The other treatment modalities examined ranged from 495 dollars (bleomycin) to 1227 dollars (interferon alpha). Although treatment with the carbon dioxide laser therapy is the least expensive, pain and post-procedure complications limit the use of this modality.

### Enhanced efficacy of photodynamic therapy with methyl 5-aminolevulinic acid in recalcitrant periungual warts after ablative carbon dioxide fractional laser: a pilot study [^5b5d94dd]. Dermatologic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with aminolevulinic acid (ALA) has been used to improve recalcitrant periungual warts, but most lesions achieved complete remission after more than four sessions, and some lesions did not respond to the method. In this pilot study, the potential for synergistic effects of the combination of ablative carbon dioxide (CO(2)) fractional laser and methyl 5-ALA (MAL)-PDT for the treatment of recalcitrant periungual warts was examined.

Materials and Methods

Twelve Korean patients (8 women and 4 men aged 20-45, mean age 27.9) with a total of 40 periungual warts were enrolled in the present study. The lesions were treated using an ablative CO(2) fractional laser. Immediately after each fractional treatment, MAL was applied on the periungual warts, and 3 hours later, such areas were illuminated with a red light at a dose of 50 J/cm(2) for 15 minutes.

Results

After a mean of 2.2 treatments per wart, a mean clearance of 100% was achieved in 36 (90%) warts. Two warts (5%) had 50% clearance, and two (5%) showed no response after three treatments. There were no recurrences of the warts that had achieved 100% clearance during the follow-up period of 6 months. Most of the treatments had no severe side effects during or after their administration. CONCLUSION> A potential for enhanced clinical results when using combined ablative CO(2) fractional laser and MAL-PDT for the treatment of periungual warts was shown in this pilot study.

### Treatment of cutaneous viral warts in children: a review [^db3b257c]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Viral warts or verruca are very common skin infections in children. Although benign, lesions can be extensive, painful, bleed, or lead to cosmetic disfigurement. Although spontaneous resolution can occur, parents often bring their children for treatment, especially when they are symptomatic. Many publications have assessed the efficacy and safety of treatment of warts in adults. However, treatment in children can be challenging due to their immune responses and lower threshold for pain. We review the current literature on the methods, efficacy, and side effect profile of common treatment modalities for cutaneous viral warts in children. There is evidence that salicylic acid and cryotherapy are effective, and although cryotherapy is more effective, there is a higher risk of side effects such as pain and blistering. Combination treatment with salicylic acid and cryotherapy may reduce these side effects. Although there is limited data, other treatment options such as cantharidin, immunotherapy and other mechanical therapies, for example, carbon dioxide lasers, may also be considered, especially for recalcitrant lesions.

### Treatment of cutaneous warts: an evidence-based review [^8a444c9e]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Cutaneous warts are common skin lesions caused by human papillomavirus infection. Treatment is aimed at relieving the patient's physical and psychological discomfort and at preventing the spread of infection by autoinoculation. Among the available medical and destructive therapeutic options for cutaneous warts, none is uniformly effective or virucidal. Moreover, in most cases their safety and efficacy has not been assessed in double-blind, controlled clinical trials, so that the reproducibility of many of the listed treatments is difficult to evaluate and a possible placebo effect cannot be ruled out. The aim of this article is to describe the outcome of current therapies for each clinical wart type according to evidence-based medicine studies published in the literature. For each clinical form, the existing treatments are classified as first-, second-, and third-line therapy. First-line therapy includes medical treatments (salicylic acid, silver nitrate, glutaraldehyde) that are useful to treat a single wart or a few and/or small common warts of short duration (less than 1 year). If these treatments have failed or are contraindicated, cryotherapy may be considered as second-line therapy. For recurrent or difficult-to-treat lesions, third-line therapy includes a variety of alternative therapeutic options (topical, intralesional, systemic, and physical destruction) that are generally off-label (not US FDA approved), and whose use is limited by drawbacks or adverse effects. From pooled evidence-based medicine data, it is possible to conclude that significantly higher remission rates may be expected only with cryotherapy and salicylic acid used in combination.

### Treatment of genital lesions with diode laser vaporization [^a0197ad8]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

In our study we have evaluated the effect of diode laser vaporization for the treatment of genital warts. The treatment protocol used in our study is comparable to that used in the previous small studies examining pulsed dye laser therapy for the treatment of genital warts. We found only a small incidence of recurrence after laser diode treatment. Recurrence rates in previous studies have varied largely, with one study reporting a recurrence rate of 12.6% at one month post-laser therapy, whilst others have reported recurrence rates as high as 77% using carbon dioxide laser and pulsed dye laser. Variation in reported recurrence rates may partially reflect the varying follow-up times within the individual studies. Some minimal discomfort and oedema was observed during the immediate period post–laser treatment, as expected and in line with findings in previous studies. Notably, we also observed no long-term complications in any of the patients enrolled in the study, which is in line with previous reports of the excellent safety profile of laser therapy as a treatment for genital warts. Importantly our study supports reports in the literature that laser treatment decreases post-operative pain by sealing nerve endings and reduces blood loss by cauterizing blood vessels.

We found no evidence of infection in any of the patients within our study. This may be expected since laser beams have a natural sterilization effect, causing the evaporation of bacteria, viruses and fungi within the immediate vicinity of the beam and therefore decreasing the possibility of local infection.

### Fractional laser-assisted topical imiquimod 5% cream treatment for recalcitrant common warts in children: a pilot study [^ca4570fb]. Dermatologic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Conventional treatments for warts like cryotherapy are limited by the pain during procedures, especially in pediatric patients. Imiquimod is a topical immune response modifier, but the thick stratum corneum of common warts prevents drug permeation through skin.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of fractional laser/topical 5% imiquimod cream for the treatment of warts in children.

Methods

Eleven pediatric patients with multiple recalcitrant common warts were included. Lesions were treated using an ablative fractional 2,940-nm Er:YAG laser at 1- or 2-week interval. After each laser treatment session, imiquimod 5% cream was self-applied once daily 5 days a week. Response and adverse effects were assessed 2 weekly until complete clearance or up to maximum of 48 weeks. Pain during fractional laser was assessed using a visual analogue scale (0-10).

Results

Eight of the 11 (72.7%) children experienced complete clearance. Mean duration was 29.7 (16-48) weeks, and the mean number of fractional laser was 17.5 (8-37). No significant adverse effect was observed. Pain visual analogue scale during fractional laser was 2.4 (1-4) compared to 6.2 (5-8) during cryotherapy.

Conclusion

This pilot study indicates that fractional laser-assisted topical imiquimod may provide benefit for recalcitrant warts in children.

### Plantar warts treated with an immune response modifier: a report of two cases [^b8abe9e7]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Viral warts are the most common disease of the skin and are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Plantar warts, a manifestation of infection by HPV-1, -2 and -4, tend to be smoother and flatter than common warts and can also be painful when pressure is applied. A variety of local treatments, including topical salicyclic acid, cryotherapy, topical 5-fluorouracil, intralesional interferons and photodynamic therapy, are available to treat plantar warts. Here we report two cases of plantar warts, which had been previously treated without success. Total clearance of the warts was observed in both cases after treatment with imiquimod 5% cream over a period of 12 weeks. No evidence of local skin reactions was observed in either case during the treatment period. Recurrent lesions were not evident in the follow-up period for each patient.

### Efficacy of intralesional immunotherapy for the treatment of warts: a review of the literature [^06013467]. Dermatologic Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Warts are common epidermal growths caused by human papillomavirus that often cause significant discomfort and embarrassment. Current treatment options include topical therapies, cryotherapy, laser vaporization, and surgical excision. Many of these options are destructive and may result in scarring, while less aggressive approaches can lead to lesion recurrence. Additionally, these local modalities are not practical for patients with a large number of warts. Systemic approaches such as immunotherapy have demonstrated success in treating multiple lesions by combining a targeted approach with upregulation of the host immune system. An extensive literature review was performed to evaluate the various vaccine antigens that have been used intralesionally to treat cutaneous and anogenital warts. The specific intralesional immunotherapies that have been studied include: Candida albicans; measles, mumps, and rubella; Trichophyton; and tuberculin antigens such as purified protein derivative, Mycobacterium w vaccine, and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin. Intralesional vaccine injection represents a safe, effective, and tolerable treatment for warts, including recalcitrant and anogenital warts. This approach has been somewhat overlooked in the past despite substantial evidence of high response rates with a low side effect profile. Large comparative trials are necessary to determine the most effective immunotherapy treatment option as well as the most appropriate dosing parameters.

### Complete resolution of recalcitrant periungual verruca vulgaris using laser-assisted drug delivery [^ec9795bf]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Verruca vulgaris (VV), also known as the common wart, is linked to human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes 2 and 4. VV is benign and affects up to 30% of children and 12.9% of adults, with disease duration potentially lasting 2 years or more.There are various guidelines regarding treatment approaches for VV; most commonly, first-line treatments include salicylic acid, cryotherapy, topical 5-fluorouracil, cantharidin, podophyllin solution, and duct tape occlusion.Cidofovir, an antiviral agent that induces apoptosis of HPV-infected cells, is a topical treatment that has shown promise in the setting of VV.Prior studies have shown successful treatment of recalcitrant VV with intralesional cidofovir; however, this approach often requires multiple painful injections. VV in the periungual locations has a hyperkeratotic surface that limits the efficacy of topical treatments due to poor drug penetration. In such cases, the use of an ablative laser can facilitate drug delivery by disrupting the stratum corneum and allowing the topical agent to reach the base of the lesion more effectively.

Herein, we present a patient with recalcitrant VV successfully treated with laser-assisted drug delivery (LADD) using erbium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er:YAG) laser therapy and topical cidofovir, achieving 100% clearance of the lesion. Although LADD with topical cidofovir has been described in the treatment of VV, this is an uncommon case demonstrating successful treatment of a periungual wart using this method.

### Laser treatment of male genital dermatoses [^02d7dfb4]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Laser therapy has emerged as a valuable treatment modality for various male genital dermatoses, offering precise targeting of pathological tissue while minimising damage to surrounding healthy structures. Different laser systems, including CO2, Nd: YAG, and PDL lasers, have effectively treated conditions such as condylomata acuminata, lichen sclerosus, angiokeratomas, and other male genital conditions. This review evaluates the current evidence for laser interventions across different male genital dermatoses, examining treatment protocols, efficacy data, and safety considerations. While CO2 laser has successfully been used to treat genital warts and hyperkeratotic lesions, vascular-specific lasers like PDL and Nd: YAG have proven effective for vascular and pigmented disorders. However, the evidence base predominantly comprises case reports, small case series, and retrospective studies, with limited high-quality randomised controlled trials. Treatment outcomes are generally promising and tolerable, but standardised protocols and robust comparative studies are needed to establish optimal treatment parameters and long-term efficacy.
