## Question

Are there any new advancements in the management of polycystic kidney disease (PKD)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the latest advancements in the management of polycystic kidney disease, with emphasis on ADPKD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching framework provided by the new KDIGO 2025 ADPKD guideline. Then, I should verify the key domains of progress: disease-modifying therapy, hypertension management, CKD care, pain management, extrarenal manifestations, diagnostics and risk stratification, and emerging therapies. Next, I will examine pediatric and reproductive considerations, and finally, I should double-check areas of controversy and reconcile any apparent contradictions before concluding with practical takeaways and a concise summary of the most impactful advances.

> Let me first confirm the foundational shift: the release of the first KDIGO ADPKD guideline in 2025 is a major milestone that standardizes nomenclature, diagnosis, prognosis, and comprehensive management across renal and extrarenal manifestations, and it explicitly recommends offering eligible patients participation in clinical trials, which signals an active pipeline and evolving evidence base [^117TJQpX] [^116NJi6Z].

> I will now examine disease-modifying therapy, and I need to ensure I accurately reflect tolvaptan's role and limitations. Tolvaptan remains the only FDA-approved therapy to slow kidney function decline in adults at risk of rapidly progressing ADPKD, with randomized trials showing approximately a 1 mL/min/1.73 m²/year reduction in eGFR decline and real-world cohorts suggesting sustained benefit over years, though long-term hard outcomes remain limited and tolerability is constrained by aquaresis and hepatotoxicity risk requiring REMS and monthly LFTs [^114aGQH9] [^117C6URF] [^116rmgJP] [^114D7U1u] [^115G9XKj]. Wait, let me verify the volume effects: I initially thought tolvaptan durably slows TKV growth, but hold on, TEMPO 4:4 and subsequent analyses indicate the TKV difference accrues mainly in year 1 and is not sustained long term, so I should correct that impression and emphasize that the durable clinical signal is on eGFR trajectory rather than sustained TKV suppression [^116rmgJP] [^115tv8FB].

> Next, I should review hypertension management, because this is a cornerstone with newly specified targets. For adults aged 18–49 with preserved kidney function and high blood pressure, KDIGO recommends a home BP target of ≤ 110/75 mmHg if tolerated, while for those ≥ 50 years, a target mean systolic BP < 120 mmHg is advised, with RAAS blockade as first-line and avoidance of dual RAAS blockade. Lifestyle measures including sodium restriction, weight management, and hydration are emphasized, and resistant hypertension warrants evaluation for secondary causes [^114PkTMF] [^113Kgq8z] [^113pZQTC] [^114cdHmv] [^117U17Cq] [^112KVwg3]. I should double-check that these thresholds align with contemporary reviews; yes, recent summaries reinforce these aggressive BP targets as part of optimal ADPKD care [^116Ud9dG].

> Let me consider general CKD care principles and where ADPKD diverges. KDIGO advises that CKD management in ADPKD largely mirrors other CKD, with attention to anemia, mineral metabolism, and volume status, but it explicitly recommends against SGLT2 inhibitors to slow eGFR decline in ADPKD and against mTOR inhibitors for kidney protection, reflecting mechanistic concerns and lack of supportive disease-specific outcomes data. Diabetes should be managed per CKD standards, but again, SGLT2 inhibitors are not advised for ADPKD progression modification at this time [^116beczN] [^115jfgC1] [^113Nb8GM] [^1139hoiD]. Hold on, I should verify the rationale for SGLT2 inhibitors: osmotic diuresis may stimulate vasopressin and theoretically worsen cyst dynamics, and ongoing trials are evaluating safety and efficacy, so current guidance remains cautious pending disease-specific outcomes [^115bE5SF].

> I will now examine pain management, where KDIGO introduces a structured, stepwise approach. First, exclude non-cystic etiologies and complications. Then prioritize nonpharmacologic, noninvasive options. If inadequate, escalate to stepwise pharmacologic therapy. For refractory pain attributable to dominant cysts, consider minimally invasive interventions such as cyst aspiration/sclerosis or laparoscopic decortication. Reserve nephrectomy for severe intractable pain in advanced disease. And integrate multidisciplinary care, with emerging options like spinal cord stimulation or neuromodulatory blocks in selected refractory cases [^115EQVki] [^114L6wpG] [^115LPTjY] [^113Qfv8t] [^114HJaDC] [^1155NCsh] [^114VvVnX] [^113xmbJv]. Wait, let me verify that these neuromodulatory strategies are indeed new practice points; yes, KDIGO 2025 expands the interventional armamentarium for intractable pain in ADPKD [^114VvVnX].

> Next, I should review extrarenal manifestations, especially polycystic liver disease and vascular anomalies. For symptomatic polycystic liver disease, somatostatin analogs can be considered when no better options exist to slow cyst growth. Cyst infection management should favor prolonged antibiotic courses of 4–6 weeks. And patients with aortic root or thoracic aortic dilatation should receive standard cardiovascular risk reduction including smoking cessation, statin therapy, and antihypertensive therapy with beta-blockade and RAAS inhibition [^115mhtJB] [^116zLets]. I need to ensure I capture the hepatopancreatic commentary as well. Recent expert commentary highlights the need for multidisciplinary care and acknowledges gaps in pancreatic cyst follow-up guidance, reinforcing the systemic nature of ADPKD [^114UTKYk].

> I should confirm diagnostic and risk stratification advances. KDIGO endorses targeted next-generation sequencing panels for genetic testing and supports the use of disease-specific risk tools such as the Mayo Imaging Classification to identify rapid progressors who benefit most from tolvaptan; importantly, hypertension often precedes clinical ADPKD diagnosis by years in PKD1/PKD2 carriers, suggesting a role for early identification strategies in high-risk populations [^113unydX] [^116Ud9dG] [^112M2sLS]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about screening; while data are compelling, population screening still requires careful implementation and ethical-legal frameworks, but the temporal signal is strong and actionable in clinical practice [^112M2sLS].

> Now, I will examine emerging therapies and the clinical trial landscape. Multiple novel classes are under investigation, including AMPK activators like metformin, GLP-1 receptor agonists, bempedoic acid, dietary strategies such as ketogenic diets and caloric restriction, and genetic approaches including anti-miR-17 and PC1-correcting agents; however, mechanistic uncertainty persists for GLP-1 RAs given potential cAMP elevation, and ongoing trials will clarify safety and efficacy in ADPKD-specific contexts [^115U4Hos] [^115zVugp]. I should double-check that KDIGO's trial recommendation aligns with this pipeline; yes, KDIGO explicitly encourages eligible patients to participate in trials, reflecting the anticipated evolution beyond tolvaptan monotherapy [^116NJi6Z].

> Let me consider pediatric and reproductive health, since these are often overlooked. ADPKD and ARPKD can present across the lifespan, necessitating structured transition protocols and early therapeutic consideration where appropriate. Prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are increasingly feasible for family planning, and pediatric risk tools exist to inform prognosis and timing of interventions, underscoring the need for age-appropriate counseling and surveillance [^115dbPSU] [^112Gef8X] [^113Ljhoz]. I should confirm that these pediatric perspectives are integrated with adult guidance. KDIGO 2025 addresses pediatric issues and reproductive planning, supporting a lifespan approach to care [^117TJQpX].

> But wait, what about areas of controversy and apparent contradictions. SGLT2 inhibitors remain a point of debate: while general CKD guidelines herald their benefits, KDIGO 2025 advises against their use to slow ADPKD progression due to theoretical harms via vasopressin stimulation; nonetheless, several trials are underway, and future guidance may pivot if disease-specific outcomes are favorable, so shared decision-making and trial enrollment are prudent for interested patients [^115jfgC1] [^115bE5SF]. Similarly, while tolvaptan is effective, its long-term impact on hard outcomes like dialysis or transplant is not yet proven, and patient selection, tolerability, and REMS compliance are critical, reinforcing the need for experienced centers and careful counseling [^117DsncS] [^115G9XKj].

> In summary, the most impactful advancements include the inaugural KDIGO 2025 ADPKD guideline unifying care standards, intensified and age-stratified BP targets with RAAS-first therapy, a refined stepwise pain algorithm including neuromodulatory options, clarification of tolvaptan's durable eGFR benefit versus limited TKV effects, explicit guidance against SGLT2 inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors for ADPKD progression, endorsement of genetic testing and MIC-based risk stratification, and a robust pipeline of emerging therapies with active recruitment to trials. Collectively, these advances shift ADPKD care toward earlier risk identification, aggressive risk-factor modification, and precision therapeutics within multidisciplinary frameworks [^117TJQpX] [^114PkTMF] [^113Kgq8z] [^114VvVnX] [^115jfgC1] [^113Nb8GM] [^113unydX] [^116NJi6Z].

---

The most significant recent advance in PKD management is the **KDIGO 2025 guideline** [^117TJQpX], which introduces **stricter BP targets** (≤ 110/75 mmHg for ages 18–49 with preserved kidney function; < 120 mmHg systolic for ≥ 50 years) [^114PkTMF] [^113Kgq8z] and **refined tolvaptan use** for rapid progressors with shared decision-making [^1153iZu3]. Tolvaptan remains the only FDA-approved disease-modifying therapy [^115VXYCC], slowing eGFR decline by ~1 mL/min/year [^116rmgJP] and delaying dialysis by 1.5–7.3 years depending on baseline eGFR [^115ZBoEK]. Emerging therapies such as SGLT2 inhibitors [^115bE5SF], GLP-1 receptor agonists [^115zVugp], and RNA-based agents are under study but are not yet recommended for routine care [^115U4Hos]. Management now emphasizes **early genetic testing** [^113unydX], structured pain care [^112FZkwe], and coordinated care for extrarenal complications, including polycystic liver disease and intracranial aneurysms [^117TJQpX].

---

## Updated clinical guidelines and recommendations

The **KDIGO 2025 guideline** [^117TJQpX] is the first international standard for ADPKD care, providing comprehensive recommendations on diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of renal and extrarenal manifestations [^117TJQpX].

---

### Blood pressure management

Stricter BP targets are recommended: **≤ 110/75 mmHg** (home monitoring) for patients aged 18–49 years with preserved kidney function (CKD G1–G2) [^114PkTMF] and **< 120 mmHg systolic** for patients aged ≥ 50 years if tolerated [^113Kgq8z]. First-line therapy remains **RAAS blockade** with ACE inhibitors or ARBs [^113pZQTC]; dual RAAS blockade is not recommended [^114cdHmv].

---

### Disease-modifying therapy

Tolvaptan use is recommended for patients with **rapidly progressing ADPKD** (eGFR decline > 3 mL/min/year or Mayo Imaging Classification 1C–1E) [^116Ud9dG], with individualized decision-making and close monitoring for hepatotoxicity and aquaretic effects [^1153iZu3] [^115G9XKj].

---

### Management of extrarenal manifestations

Polycystic liver disease should be managed with **somatostatin analogs** for severe symptomatic cases [^notfound], and **intracranial aneurysms** warrant screening and management according to family history and risk factors [^notfound].

---

## Novel therapeutic agents and interventions

Several **new therapies** are under investigation, though none have supplanted tolvaptan as standard care:

| **Therapy** | **Mechanism** | **Current status** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| SGLT2 inhibitors | Reduce intraglomerular pressure, metabolic reprogramming | Phase 2/3 trials | Not recommended pending further evidence [^115bE5SF] [^115jfgC1] |
| GLP-1 receptor agonists | Metabolic modulation, anti-inflammatory | Early trials | Potential benefit in obesity/metabolic syndrome [^115zVugp] |
| RNA-based therapies (e.g. miR-17 inhibitors) | Genetic targeting | Preclinical/early clinical | Promising but early [^115U4Hos] |
| HDAC inhibitors | Modulate apoptosis, autophagy, fibrosis | Preclinical | Broad therapeutic potential, early stage [^117TiE2J] |

---

## Advances in diagnostic tools and biomarkers

- **Genetic testing**: Targeted next-generation sequencing panels are recommended for definitive diagnosis and family planning [^113unydX] [^112Gef8X].

- **Imaging**: Mayo Imaging Classification (MIC) [^116Ud9dG] refines risk stratification and guides therapy decisions [^116Ud9dG].

- **Biomarkers**: Research into urinary and plasma biomarkers (e.g. MCP-1, YKL-40) is ongoing but not yet clinically validated [^notfound].

---

## Improved patient outcomes and quality of life

- **Tolvaptan**: Slows eGFR decline by ~1 mL/min/year and delays dialysis by 1.5–7.3 years depending on baseline eGFR [^115ZBoEK] [^116rmgJP].

- **Blood pressure control**: Intensive BP targets reduce cardiovascular risk and slow kidney function decline [^116aRYMW].

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Coordinated management of renal, hepatic, and neurological complications improves quality of life [^notfound].

---

## Ongoing clinical trials and research

Multiple **phase 2/3 trials** are evaluating SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and RNA-based therapies, aiming to expand disease-modifying options and improve long-term outcomes [^115U4Hos] [^115bE5SF].

---

## Challenges and limitations

Key challenges include **limited long-term safety data** for emerging therapies, significant heterogeneity in disease progression, and barriers to accessing genetic testing, tolvaptan, and specialized care [^1146UjSi] [^112Gef8X] [^1168g8nK].

---

## Future directions

Future priorities include **personalized medicine** using genetic and biomarker stratification, development of novel agents targeting cAMP signaling and fibrosis, and broader access to genetic testing, tolvaptan, and multidisciplinary care [^115VXYCC] [^115U4Hos] [^112Gef8X].

---

The most significant recent advance is the **KDIGO 2025 guideline**, which standardizes care with stricter BP targets and refined tolvaptan use, while emerging therapies and improved diagnostics are reshaping management.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global health priority affecting 10%–12% of the population (over 850 million people) with the number of affected individuals projected to increase rapidly over the next few decades. The prevalence of CKD is higher in those over 60 years of age, as well as in individuals with increased body mass index, diabetes and hypertension. Having CKD has significant negative implications for both life expectancy and quality of life, especially as a core component of the increasingly recognized cardio-kidney-metabolic multimorbidity syndrome. The 2024 Report from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study using 2021 data shows that CKD is the 11th leading cause of death, with 1.53 million deaths, with a further 2.1 million cardiovascular deaths attributable to CKD. CKD is also expected to rise from the 23rd leading cause of disease burden worldwide in 2022 to the 10th by 2050. However, much of the kidney disease burden globally, and its impact on outcomes of other conditions, remains uncounted, therefore these numbers are likely conservative estimates.

The new 2024 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of CKD, 12 years on from the previous guideline in 2012, are a very welcome update which emphasize both the advancements in the fields and the remaining gaps to fill. The document is an impressive text at 198 pages with 937 references, with multiple associated documents including supplementary material, executive summary and takeaway message summaries.

The purpose of this article is not to summarize the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline but, on behalf of the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) group of the European Renal Association (ERA), to highlight some of what is new and relevant, especially in the European context. Given the rapidly evolving and expanding field of treatment for CKD [for example, the FLOW trial data on Semaglutide, a Glucagon Like Peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1ra), on kidney disease progression which was published after the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline], we chose to focus on the remaining Achilles' heel of the global push to improve CKD care and outcomes — the first step towards effective management of the disease — evaluation and risk assessment in people with CKD.

Risk prediction in people with CKD — In people with CKD G3–G5, "we recommend using an externally validated risk equation to estimate the absolute risk of kidney failure (1A)". For referral decisions, "A 5-year kidney failure risk of 3%–5% can be used to determine need for nephrology referral in addition to criteria based on eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) or urine ACR (albumin-to-creatinine ratio), and other clinical considerations". For care planning, "A 2-year kidney failure risk of > 10% can be used to determine the timing of multidisciplinary care", and "A 2-year kidney failure risk threshold of > 40% can be used to determine the modality education, timing of preparation for kidney replacement therapy (KRT) including vascular access planning or referral for transplantation". Scope notes state, "risk prediction equations developed for use in people with CKD G3–G5, may not be valid for use in those with CKD G1–G2", and to "Use disease-specific, externally validated prediction equations in people with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)".

Introduction

Kidney disease (KD) is common in the developed world and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Autosomal dominant polycystic KD (ADPKD) is the most common genetic form of KD, affecting approximately 1 in 500–1 in 1,000 individuals worldwide, and the fourth leading cause of end-stage KD (ESKD). The majority of ADPKD cases are due to mutations in the gene PKD1, with a smaller percentage attributed to PKD2. PKD1 encodes PC1, which is a transmembrane protein that likely regulates calcium intake by physically interacting with PC2, encoded by PKD2. While the precise mechanism by which loss of function (LoF) variants in PKD1 and PKD2 contribute to ADPKD is not fully understood, most patients presenting with ADPKD have a mutation in one of these two genes. The clinical manifestation of ADPKD is characterized by the presence of cysts within the renal parenchyma, leading to a constellation of symptoms that can impact quality of life and overall health. Most patients present with at least two kidney cysts by age 40 years. In contrast, other forms of chronic KD (CKD) do not typically present with cysts. However, in all cases, damage to the kidneys results in hypertension (HTN), which leads to cardiovascular damage and morbidity, which further damages the kidneys and other tissues.

### Can GLP-1 receptor agonists slow the progression of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease? [^115zVugp]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

One of the initial preliminary studies utilized two ADPKD mouse models and showed that treatment with Semaglutide delayed cyst growth, reduced total kidney volume, and decreased renal recruitment of macrophages as well as the expression of fibrotic markers, thereby improving prognosis. University of Colorado, Denver, is set to initiate the first clinical trial aimed at assessing the efficacy, safety, and mechanisms of dual GLP-1 RAs and GIP RAs (tirzapetide) in ADPKD treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT06582875, Registration Date 2024–08–30). This study marks a pivotal step toward exploring metabolic modulation as a disease-modifying strategy in ADPKD.

While the study is expected to be completed by June 30, 2029, several critical questions remain unanswered. Multiple reports have shown that treatment with GLP-1 RAs lead to elevated cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels in both in vitro and in vivo studies. This is concerning, as increased cAMP is a well-established driver of cyst growth and expansion in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). These findings underscore the need for further mechanistic studies to clarify the effects of GLP-1 RAs in the context of ADPKD. This highlights that the net effect of GLP-1 RAs on human ADPKD kidneys remains uncertain, and current evidence is primarily extrapolated from non-cystic kidney disease models. Key disease manifestations, such as cyst dynamics, total kidney volume progression, and long-term kidney function, require thorough evaluation in clinical trials. Safety is another major concern. Gastrointestinal side effects like nausea and vomiting could compromise hydration, which is crucial for managing ADPKD. Reports of dehydration and acute kidney injury, particularly in patients with reduced renal reserve, highlight the need for caution. Currently, Tolvaptan, a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist, is the only FDA-approved drug for ADPKD. However, its efficacy decreases with increasing visceral adiposity. This suggests that GLP-1 RAs, known to reduce visceral fat, might offer additional benefits. Yet, the potential for overlapping side effects and opposing cAMP mechanisms when combining GLP-1 RAs with Tolvaptan raises concerns about untested pharmacological interactions (Table 1). Additionally, identifying ADPKD patient subgroups most likely to benefit from GLP-1 RAs is critical for optimizing their clinical application. Those with obesity or metabolic syndrome may see the greatest benefit, while lean, metabolically healthy individuals may gain little and face unnecessary risk. As of now, the rationale for repurposing GLP-1 RAs in ADPKD remains emerging, and ongoing clinical trials will be essential to determine their safety, efficacy, and therapeutic relevance in this disease context.

### Tolvaptan (Jynarque) [^116rmgJP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The trial met its prespecified primary endpoint of 3-year change in TKV (p < 0.0001). The difference in TKV between treatment groups mostly developed within the first year, the earliest assessment, with little further difference in years two and three. In Years 4 and 5 during the TEMPO 3:4 extension trial, both groups received JYNARQUE and the difference between the groups in TKV was not maintained. Tolvaptan has little effect on kidney size beyond what accrues during the first year of treatment.

The relative rate of ADPKD-related events was decreased by 13.5% in tolvaptan-treated patients, (44 vs. 50 events per 100 person-years; hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.97; p = 0.0095). As shown in the table below, the result of the key secondary composite endpoint was driven by effects on worsening kidney function and kidney pain events. In contrast, there was no effect of tolvaptan on either progression of hypertension or albuminuria. Few subjects in either arm required a radiologic or surgical intervention for kidney pain. Most kidney pain events reflected use of a medication to treat pain such as use of paracetamol, tricyclic antidepressants, narcotics and other non-narcotic agents.

The third endpoint (kidney function slope) was assessed as slope of eGFR during treatment (from end of titration to last on-drug visit). The estimated difference in the annual rate of change in those who contributed to the analysis was 1.0 mL/min/1.73 m²/year with a 95% confidence interval of (0.6, 1.4). Of the subjects enrolled in the trial, 5% of subjects in the tolvaptan arm and 2% in the placebo arm either had missing baseline data or discontinued from treatment prior to the end of the titration visit and hence were excluded from the analysis. In the extension trial, eGFR differences produced by the third year of the TEMPO 3:4 trial were maintained over the next 2 years of JYNARQUE treatment.

The efficacy profile was generally consistent across subgroups of interest for this indication; few Black or African-American patients were enrolled in the trial.

### Prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic kidney disorders [^112Gef8X]. Kidney International (2025). Medium credibility.

In recent years, advances in genetic sequencing techniques and in the analysis of sequencing data have significantly improved our ability to diagnose genetic kidney diseases. Identification of the disease-causing genetic variant(s) is crucial not only for prognostication and personalized management, but also for providing genetic counseling and guiding family planning decisions. It is particularly important that patients desiring children receive advice on their reproductive choices early, ideally before conception. This concise review focuses on the options available for prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing in the context of monogenic kidney diseases, including the latest progress and the legal and ethical issues associated with these reproductive technologies. Although these tests could be performed for all monogenic disorders where the disease-causing variant(s) has (have) been identified in the index patient, invasive prenatal testing is currently primarily performed for severe childhood-onset monogenic kidney disorders. Noninvasive prenatal diagnosis for monogenic disorders is a rapidly developing field that promises to provide an accurate and acceptable alternative to invasive procedures once several technical challenges have been addressed. Preimplantation genetic testing allows for the selection and implantation of embryos free from the disease-causing genetic variants, significantly lowering the risk of affected pregnancies. This option is becoming more popular among individuals with monogenic kidney diseases, particularly those with disorders that manifest later in life, such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. This review covers the procedure, its outcomes, and the technical, ethical and legal challenges of preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic kidney diseases.

### The long-term effect of tolvaptan treatment on kidney function and volume in patients with ADPKD [^117QYW33]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What was known:

The only available therapy to ameliorate autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease progression is tolvaptan, a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist.
Long-term data in a real-life setting of tolvaptan treatment on kidney function and volume are sparse.

This study adds:

We found that tolvaptan attenuated long-term kidney function decline but seemed not to influence kidney growth.
We identified lower urine osmolality during treatment, a higher daily osmolar intake and use of diuretics as determinants of better tolvaptan treatment efficacy.

Potential impact:

Tolvaptan is effective in reduction of kidney function decline in a real-life setting.
The determinants of treatment effect may help guide patient selection and establishment of treatment goals in these patients.

### The long-term effect of tolvaptan treatment on kidney function and volume in patients with ADPKD [^114D7U1u]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Hypothesis

The only therapy to ameliorate disease progression in patients with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is tolvaptan, a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist. Real-life data on long-term tolvaptan are sparse and limited by restricted follow-up, small patient groups, or lack of a control group. We studied the long-term effect of tolvaptan on kidney function and kidney growth in real-life patients and controls. Moreover, we investigated determinants of long-term treatment efficacy.

Methods

Data from the prospective DIPAK cohort and retrospective OBSERVA cohort were pooled. eGFR was measured at least yearly and total kidney volume (TKV) at least every 3 years. Treatment effects from the start to 6 weeks after initiation of tolvaptan were analyzed as 'acute slope'. After this, endpoints were analyzed as 'chronic slope'. As a control group, we included all patients who were not treated with tolvaptan, assessing change in endpoints before and during theoretical treatment (based on the average time of tolvaptan initiation in tolvaptan-treated patients).

Results

615 patients (48 ± 12 years, 58.2% female) were included in the full analysis, of which 105 (17.1%) were treated with tolvaptan. The average duration of treatment was 6.1 ± 4.7 years (range: 0.8 to 15.9). After matching, two groups of 92 patients remained for matched analysis. In this analysis, tolvaptan reduced eGFR decline during chronic slope by 14.0% (-4.36 to -3.75 mL/min/1.73 m²/year, P = 0.03), versus a decrease of 1.0% (-4.16 to -4.12 mL/min/1.73 m²/year, P = 0.9) in the control group. Long-term TKV growth did not significantly change during tolvaptan treatment (5.05 to 5.59%/year P = 0.6). In subgroup analyses, patients with a higher mean osmolar intake had a larger treatment effect of tolvaptan.

Conclusion

In this study, with real-life patient data, long-term follow-up, and a well-matched control group, we found that tolvaptan attenuated long-term kidney function decline but seemed not to influence kidney growth.

The primary endpoint was the intergroup difference for rate of change of TKV normalized as a percentage. The key secondary composite endpoint (ADPKD progression) was time to multiple clinical progression events of: 1) worsening kidney function (defined as a persistent 25% reduction in reciprocal serum creatinine during treatment from end of titration to last on-drug visit); 2) medically significant kidney pain (defined as requiring prescribed leave, last-resort analgesics, narcotic and anti-nociceptive, radiologic or surgical interventions); 3) worsening hypertension (defined as a persistent increase in blood pressure category or an increased anti-hypertensive prescription); 4) worsening albuminuria (defined as a persistent increase in albumin/creatinine ratio category).

At baseline, average estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 82 mL/min/1.73 m²(CKD-Epidemiology formula) and mean TKV was 1692 mL (height adjusted 972 mL/m). Approximately 35% had an eGFR of 90 mL/min/1.73 m² or greater, 48% had an eGFR between 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m², 14% had an eGFR of 45 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m², and 3% had an eGFR of < 45 mL/min/1.73 m². The subjects' mean age was 39 years, 48% were female, 84% were Caucasian, 13% were Asian, and 1.7% were Black or African-American. Approximately 80% had hypertension and approximately 71% were taking an agent that acts on the renin-angiotensin system. Of the 770 subjects who submitted to genetic analysis in TEMPO 3:4's open-label extension, 749 (97%) had an identifiable mutation in the PKD1 (656 or 88%), or PKD2 (93 or 12%) gene.

### Peritoneal dialysis care for people with diabetes, polycystic kidney disease, or advanced liver disease [^113pctna]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

People treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) often have complicating conditions that require careful management. Three such conditions are reviewed in this article-diabetes mellitus, polycystic kidney disease, and chronic liver disease. Each of these conditions requires an understanding of both its effect on the delivery of the PD and the effect of the PD on the condition itself. In diabetes, glucose absorption from the dialysate complicates metabolic control and affects salt and water management and patient outcome. There is particular benefit in clinical care being delivered through a multidisciplinary team that involves both kidney and diabetes experts. In relation to polycystic kidney disease, a key issue is the potential for increased intraperitoneal pressure due to the combined effect of the enlarged polycystic organs and the presence of the dialysis solution, and therefore, the PD prescription requires to be managed with a particular focus on limiting that pressure. For patients with liver disease, key issues include nutritional support because PD can add to protein losses already consequent on the liver disease itself. Considered approaches are required to manage ascites and reduce infection risk and the potential for hernias and leaks to develop. Mortality in this group is unfortunately high-however, PD may present a better management option than hemodialysis in many patients-particularly in those where the liver disease is complicated by low BP, clotting abnormalities, or troublesome ascites. Overall, the choice to use PD in patients with these complicating conditions should be based on shared decision making with the patient and their family members informed by high-quality information in which risks, benefits, and management strategies are clearly presented.

An update on the efficacy of tolvaptan in ADPKD

In 2017, the TEMPO 4:4 study, an open-label extension of TEMPO 3:4, examined the long-term effects of tolvaptan over 24 months. While tolvaptan effectively maintained kidney function, the reduction in total kidney volume (TKV) was not sustained, possibly due to the non-randomised design and unadjusted baseline characteristics in the study. The Replicating Evidence of Preserved Renal Function: An Investigation of Tolvaptan Safety and Efficacy in ADPKD (REPRISE) trial enrolled patients aged 18–55 with baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 25–65 ml/min/1.73 m² and those aged 56 to 65 years old with a baseline eGFR 25–44 ml/min/1.73 m². At 1-year follow-up, tolvaptan slowed eGFR decline by 1.27 ml/min/1.73 m² in all groups except those aged over 55 years and, with early-stage CKD. Evidence for the effectiveness of tolvaptan among people from ethnic backgrounds other than white was limited; only 4% of study participants in TEMPO 3:4 were described as black compared to over 80% described as white. Further research is needed in people from black and Hispanic ethnic backgrounds since they are reported to reach kidney failure earlier and are less likely to receive a pre-emptive kidney transplant compared to people from a white ethnic background.

A retrospective analysis from an expert centre (Mayo Clinic) provided up to 11 years long-term follow-up for 97 people with ADPKD treated with tolvaptan (median 4 years, range 1.1–11.2 years). When compared to matched controls from other studies, the predicted eGFR decline mirrored results from TEMPO 3:4 and REPRISE. Finally, secondary analysis of TEMPO 3:4 showed additional benefits to slowing the decline in kidney function, with a reduction in kidney pain events and urinary tract infections compared to placebo.

### Commentary: tolvaptan for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)-an update [^113JC4f3]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) affects up to 70 000 people in the UK and the most common inherited cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). It is generally a late-onset multisystem disorder characterised by bilateral kidney cysts, liver cysts and an increased risk of intracranial aneurysms. Approximately 50% of people with ADPKD reach ESKD by age 60. Disease-associated pain, discomfort, fatigue, emotional distress and, impaired mobility can impact health-related quality of life. The approval of tolvaptan, a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist, has greatly advanced the care for people with ADPKD, shifting the focus from general chronic kidney disease management to targeted therapeutic approaches. While guidance from NICE and SMC provides a foundational framework, this is not clear or comprehensive enough to offer practical guidance for healthcare professionals in real-world settings. This commentary expands on the previous United Kingdom Kidney Association (UKKA) commentary in 2016 with an updated evidence base, the incorporation of real-world data and expert opinion to provide practical guidance to healthcare professionals. Through co-development with people affected by ADPKD, it now incorporates valuable patient perspectives and offers practical recommendations for the UK kidney community seeking to harmonise the quality of care of all people with ADPKD.

### Histone deacetylases and their inhibitors in kidney diseases [^117TiE2J]. Molecular Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have emerged as key regulators in the pathogenesis of various kidney diseases. This review explores recent advancements in HDAC research, focusing on their role in kidney development and their critical involvement in the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), acute kidney injury (AKI), autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), and diabetic kidney disease (DKD). It also discusses the therapeutic potential of HDAC inhibitors in treating these conditions. Various HDAC inhibitors have shown promise by targeting specific HDAC isoforms and modulating a range of biological pathways. Their protective effects include modulation of apoptosis, autophagy, inflammation, and fibrosis, underscoring their broad therapeutic potential for kidney diseases. However, further research is essential to improve the selectivity of HDAC inhibitors, minimize toxicity, overcome drug resistance, and enhance their pharmacokinetic properties. This review offers insights to guide future research and prevention strategies for kidney disease management.

### Hypertension increases PPV for polycystic kidney disease in PKD1 and PKD2 variant carriers [^112M2sLS]. HGG Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the leading genetic form of KD. Although rare causal variants in the PKD1 and PKD2 genes have been identified, their penetrance and the disease progression and outcome are known to vary, and treatment efficacy in these carriers lags compared to patients with other forms of chronic KD (CKD). To develop a population screening strategy with high sensitivity to individuals likely to develop disease, we characterize the presentation and progression of ADPKD in variant carriers, identified in a multi-center all-comers cohort, as well as the UK Biobank. We show that the positive predictive value of hypertension for future diagnosis of KD is extremely high: 74% and 66% for PKD1 and PKD2, respectively. It is also highly preemptive, with hypertension occurring an average of 11 years before a KD diagnosis. Using pre-disease time point measurements of kidney function prior to their ADPKD diagnosis, we find that PKD1 and PKD2 variant carriers show significantly decreased kidney function (EGFR) an average of 5 years before their clinical diagnosis. Unlike other CKD patients, 54% of variant carriers with hypertension meet the diagnostic threshold for CKD years prior to their disease diagnosis, and their EGFRs are statistically indistinguishable from variant carriers who have already been diagnosed. These findings suggest that a population screening strategy using a combination of targeted sequencing and routine monitoring could identify cases of ADPKD with high sensitivity and support initiating treatment years prior to the current standard of care.

### Tolvaptan (Jynarque) [^113woLhx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Tolvaptan is a selective vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist with an affinity for the V2-receptor that is 1.8 times that of native arginine vasopressin (AVP). Tolvaptan affinity for the V2-receptor is 29 times that for the V1a-receptor. Decreased binding of vasopressin to the V2-receptor in the kidney lowers adenylate cyclase activity resulting in a decrease in intracellular adenosine 3′, 5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations. Decreased cAMP concentrations prevent aquaporin 2 containing vesicles from fusing with the plasma membrane, which in turn causes an increase in urine water excretion, an increase in free water clearance (aquaresis) and a decrease in urine osmolality. In human ADPKD cyst epithelial cells, tolvaptan inhibited AVP-stimulated in vitro cyst growth and chloride-dependent fluid secretion into cysts. In animal models, decreased cAMP concentrations were associated with decreases in the rate of growth of total kidney volume and the rate of formation and enlargement of kidney cysts. Tolvaptan metabolites have no or weak antagonist activity for human V2-receptors compared with tolvaptan.

### Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: a review [^116Ud9dG]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by progressive development of kidney cysts and is the most common inherited kidney disorder worldwide. ADPKD accounts for 5% to 10% of kidney failure in the US and Europe, and its prevalence in the US is 9.3 per 10 000 individuals.

Observations

ADPKD is typically diagnosed in individuals aged 27 to 42 years and is primarily caused by pathogenic variants in the PKD1 (78%) or PKD2 (15%) genes. Most persons with ADPKD have an affected parent, but de novo disease is suggested in 10% to 25% of families. More than 90% of patients older than 35 years have hepatic cysts, which may cause abdominal discomfort and occasionally require medical or surgical intervention. Hypertension affects 70% to 80% of patients with ADPKD, and approximately 9% to 14% develop intracranial aneurysms, which have a rupture rate of 0.57 per 1000 patient-years. Approximately 50% of individuals with ADPKD require kidney replacement therapy by 62 years of age. The severity of kidney disease can be quantified using the Mayo Imaging Classification (MIC), which stratifies patients based on total kidney volume adjusted for height and age and ranges from 1A to 1E. Patients with MIC 1C to MIC 1E have larger kidneys because of more rapid growth (6%-10% per year) compared with those with MIC 1A and 1B (1%-5% per year) and have earlier progression to kidney replacement therapy, which occurs at a mean age of 58.4 years for MIC 1C, 52.5 years for MIC 1D, and 43.4 years for MIC 1E. Optimal management of ADPKD includes systolic blood pressure lower than 120 mm Hg for most patients, but lower than 110/75 mm Hg for patients with MIC 1C to 1E who have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and are younger than 50 years, dietary sodium restriction (< 2000 mg/d), weight management, and adequate hydration (> 2.5 L daily). The vasopressin type 2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan reduces the annual rate of eGFR decline by 0.98 to 1.27 mL/min/1.73 m2 and is indicated for patients with MIC 1C to 1E or an eGFR decline greater than 3 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year to slow disease progression and delay the onset of kidney failure.

Conclusion

ADPKD is the most common genetic kidney disease worldwide and is characterized by progressive development of kidney cysts. Patients typically have hypertension and liver cysts, and 9% to 14% develop intracranial aneurysms. First-line treatment includes blood pressure control, dietary and weight management, and adequate hydration. Tolvaptan reduces the rate of eGFR decline for those at high risk of rapid progression to kidney failure.

CKD IN MEN AND WOMEN

Although it is becoming increasingly clear that CKD is more common among women than men, at least in part to their longer life expectancy, there still appear to be major differences in terms of detection, monitoring, referral and therapy-related adverse event rates. In a North European study, women with newly detected CKD were less likely to be monitored for their kidney function, receive a clinical diagnosis, be referred to nephrologist care or initiate antiproteinuric treatment compared with equal men. Such differences are worrisome and should be further investigated (and if present corrected) in other countries.

### The long-term effect of tolvaptan treatment on kidney function and volume in patients with ADPKD [^115tv8FB]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Due to renal cyst formation and growth, patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) develop kidney function decline, ultimately resulting in the need for kidney replacement therapy in the majority of patients. At the moment, the only available therapy to ameliorate ADPKD progression is tolvaptan, a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist. The TEMPO (Tolvaptan Efficacy and Safety in Management of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease and Its Outcomes) 3:4 study, a 36-month randomized controlled trial, showed that tolvaptan treatment resulted in a 26% reduction in the rate of kidney function decline in patients with preserved kidney function. Later, in the REPRISE (Replicating Evidence of Preserved Renal Function: an Investigation of Tolvaptan Safety and Efficacy in ADPKD) study, tolvaptan proved to be renoprotective in patients with ADPKD and impaired kidney function during 12-month treatment.

Besides ameliorating the rate of kidney function decline, the TEMPO 3:4 trial suggested a 49% reduction in total kidney volume (TKV) growth. Initially, this was attributed to a long-lasting reduction in the rate of kidney volume growth by tolvaptan. However, the TEMPO 4:4 study suggested that tolvaptan induces predominantly short-term effects on kidney volume, after which cyst growth continues at more or less the same rate as before treatment. These conflicting data make clear that the long-term effect of tolvaptan on growth of kidney volume has to be investigated more thoroughly.

These effects of tolvaptan obtained in randomized clinical trials should preferably be confirmed and put into perspective in a real-life setting. Generally speaking, real-life studies better represent real clinical practice, because they are characterized by a lower treatment adherence, longer treatment duration, and inclusion of patients with lower risk for rapid disease progression and more comorbidities compared with clinical trials. Of note, long-term data in a real-life setting of tolvaptan treatment on kidney function are sparse, especially on TKV. In addition, most of these studies had a relatively short duration of follow-up, included only a limited number of patients and/or lacked a control group. With our study, we aimed to investigate the long-term effect of tolvaptan on kidney function and volume in a large cohort of real-life patients with ADPKD with a reasonable duration of follow-up and including data of a (matched) control group. In addition, we aimed to study determinants of tolvaptan efficacy.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) tolvaptan referral and patient selection — the Work Group suggests early referral of ADPKD patients to a nephrology provider to identify those most likely to benefit from tolvaptan therapy, noting challenges in identifying candidates because ADPKD has variable penetrance and rates of kidney function decline vary widely; appropriate patient selection emphasizing the ability to tolerate side effects, maintain adequate hydration, comply with frequent lab monitoring, and retain uninterrupted access to the medication with support from a committed nephrology provider experienced in managing tolvaptan are preferred; risks for significant harm must be weighed against the potential benefit (approximately 1 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year slower decrease in eGFR), and other potential benefits to early referral include risk mitigation for other ADPKD complications (e.g., subarachnoid hemorrhage, cyst rupture, cyst hemorrhage, cyst infection, nephrolithiasis), opportunities for genetic testing which may be important in pre-conception counseling, determination of which patients would benefit from care by multidisciplinary PKD clinics, and improvement in pre-emptive kidney transplantation; primary care providers can play a critical role in facilitating early nephrology referral for high-risk ADPKD patients, and considerations also include access to nephrology subspecialty care, high medication cost, and resource use due to the need for frequent monthly labs.

Because of the risk of serious liver injury, use is contraindicated in patients with a history, signs or symptoms of significant liver impairment or injury. This contraindication does not apply to uncomplicated polycystic liver disease which was present in 60% and 66% of patients in TEMPO 3:4 and REPRISE, respectively. No specific exclusion for hepatic impairment was implemented in TEMPO 3:4. However, REPRISE excluded patients with ADPKD who had hepatic impairment or liver function abnormalities other than that expected for ADPKD with typical cystic liver disease [see Contraindications (4)].

8.7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment

Efficacy studies included patients with normal and reduced renal function [see Clinical Studies (14)]. TEMPO 3:4 required patients to have an estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min, while REPRISE included patients with eGFRCKD-Epi25 to 65 mL/min/1.73 m².

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common genetic cause of kidney failure. Scientific advances have improved the approach to diagnosis, prognosis, and management of renal and extrarenal manifestations. The combination of total kidney volume, kidney function, and the genetic mutation (if known), predicts risk for progression to kidney failure, thereby identifying patients in whom disease modifying therapy is recommended. Currently there is one therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for slowing ADPKD progression, the V2 receptor antagonist, tolvaptan. Other therapies are under active investigation for ADPKD. This Core Curriculum discusses diagnosis and management of the renal and extrarenal manifestations seen in ADPKD including acute and chronic pain and cyst infection and polycystic liver disease and intracranial aneurysm. Management of hypertension and women's health and pregnancy management in ADPKD are covered. This review was aligned with the findings of the recently published Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guideline for the Evaluation, Management, and Treatment of ADPKD.

RISK ASSESSMENT IN PEOPLE WITH CKD

A summary of the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline recommendation statements and practice points on the risk assessment of people with CKD is presented in Table 2.

Table 2:
Summary of recommendation statements and practice points relevant to risk assessment in people with CKD in the 2024 KDIGO Guideline and differences from the 2012 KDIGO Guideline.

Monitoring of CKD

Monitoring eGFR and albuminuria in both adults and children with CKD is important not only to update staging for prognosis but also to guide clinical decisions. Because the KDIGO CKD staging classification based on eGFR and albuminuria is based on future kidney failure risk, their recommendation is to monitor those at higher risk of progression more frequently (e.g. they suggest monitoring kidney function and albuminuria once annually to people with CKD G1A2, but thrice annually to people with CKD G1A3, and consider even increasing this depending on the underlying aetiology of CKD). While the recommendation makes sense, the challenge lies in its implementation. European healthcare systems, as in other parts of the world, are affected by a severe under-recognition of CKD. While creatinine is measured in healthcare for many indications (and in most European healthcare systems eGFR is automatically reported), albuminuria screening and monitoring is still the bottleneck. For example, in a North European evaluation of processes of CKD care, only about a third of patients with incident CKD stages 3–5 received albuminuria monitoring within the following 18 months. Strategies to improve monitoring rates could involve educational campaigns to primary care and general physicians as well as individuals at high risk of CKD. Indeed, the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline helpfully provides a list of at-risk individuals (Table 3). Economic incentives have been successfully shown in the UK to improve monitoring rates. In settings with less access to laboratory services, utilisation of novel and accurate POCT tools could also be potentially useful.

Background

Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary kidney disease with an estimated prevalence ranging from 1 in 1000 to 1 in 2500. Variants in two genes, PKD1 and PKD2, encoding for polycystin-1 or polycystin-2 account for 75–85% and 15–25% of genetically resolved cases respectively. Reduced polycystin function leads to increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate signalling, which is a key driving mechanism for cyst growth and fluid secretion. ADPKD is generally a late-onset multisystem disorder characterised by bilateral kidney cysts, liver cysts and an increased risk of intracranial aneurysms. Less common manifestations include pancreatic cysts, seminal vesicle cysts, and mitral valve prolapse amongst others. Progressive cyst development and growth ultimately leads to kidney dysfunction with approximately 50% of people requiring kidney replacement therapy by age 60. ADPKD can impose a significant burden on health-related quality of life due to pain, discomfort, fatigue, emotional distress and, limiting daily activities.

Tolvaptan is a short-acting vasopressin 2 receptor antagonist that blocks vasopressin signalling leading to a reduction in cAMP in cystic kidney tissues. The landmark Tolvaptan Efficacy and Safety in Management of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (TEMPO) 3:4 trial, conducted between 2007 and 2012, represented a major breakthrough in the management of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD). This trial supported the approval of tolvaptan by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) for people with rapidly progressing ADPKD. NICE recommended starting treatment at CKD stages 2–3, while SMC allowed initiation from stages 1–3. As of February 2023, Otsuka reports that tolvaptan has been licensed in over 43 countries including Australia, the European Union, Japan, and the United States, among others.

Since the 2016 commentary by the UKKA, there have been significant developments including clinical trials, post-hoc analysis, risk assessment tools, broader access to genetic testing, and availability of real-world data, all of which warrant an update to incorporate these advances. For this reason, the following recommendations were prepared on behalf of the UKKA working group for the management of ADPKD with tolvaptan and endorsed by the UKKA.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

It is now over 12 years since the launch of the KDIGO 2012 CKD Guideline and so the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline is a very welcome authoritative update. However, despite the timescale involved it is regrettable that awareness, diagnosis and coding of CKD remains very poor across European countries and globally. Reasons for this lack of awareness of the need for CKD diagnosis and monitoring, despite estimation of GFR and uACR being enshrined not only in all CKD guidelines but also in multiple other guidelines including those for diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease for many years, are not really understood. However, it is likely that multiple barriers in combination conspire to maintain the current situation. We live in an era where we now have multiple treatments that can reduce the progression of CKD and modify the risk of the most important associated risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The importance of early and accurate identification of individuals with CKD is now more important than ever.

This apparent lack of awareness within healthcare systems of the importance of CKD needs to be tackled as an urgent health priority across Europe. At the same time as addressing the lack of awareness of CKD amongst healthcare practitioners in general, it would seem sensible that people with concerns about their kidneys for whatever reason, and especially those considered at risk of CKD, should be empowered to seek clinical advice and be tested for kidney health. The KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline helpfully provides specific guidance on this (Table 3). Overall, the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline should be seen as much more than just another document. It should be seen as a call to action across Europe to improve the prevention, detection and treatment of CKD. The guidelines are much more than just words.

REPRISE: A Phase 3, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized Withdrawal Trial in Later-Stage ADPKD

REPRISE (NCT02160145) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized withdrawal trial in adult patients (age 18 to 65 years) with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an eGFR between 25 and 65 mL/min/1.73 m² if younger than age 56 years, or eGFR between 25 and 44 mL/min/1.73 m², plus eGFR decline > 2.0 mL/min/1.73m2/year if between age 56 to 65 years. Subjects were to be treated for 12 months; after completion of treatment, patients entered a 3-week follow-up period to assess renal function. The primary endpoint was the treatment difference in the change of eGFR from pre-treatment baseline to post-treatment follow-up, annualized by dividing by each subject's treatment duration.

Prior to randomization, patients were required to complete sequential single-blind run-in periods during which they received placebo for 1 week, followed by tolvaptan titration for 2 weeks, and then treatment with tolvaptan at the highest tolerated dose achieved during titration for 3 weeks. During the titration period, tolvaptan was up-titrated every 3 to 4 days from a daily oral dose of 30 mg/15 mg to 45 mg/15 mg, 60 mg/30 mg and up to a maximum dose of 90 mg/30 mg. Only patients who could tolerate the two highest doses of tolvaptan (60 mg/30 mg or 90 mg/30 mg) for the subsequent 3 weeks were randomized 1:1 to treatment with tolvaptan or placebo.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2025 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation, Management, and Treatment of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is a long-awaited development and the first KDIGO guideline addressing a genetic kidney disease. The approval of tolvaptan as targeted therapy for ADPKD in 2015, marked a pivotal advancement, and galvanized towards a structured approach in research and clinical care. Considering the systemic nature of ADPKD guidance for the management of extrarenal manifestations is of special importance for nephrologists and requires interdisciplinary collaboration. In this regard, cysts in other organs, particularly the liver, are the most common extrarenal finding. While most liver cysts are incidental findings on routine imaging, both cyst infections and severe polycystic liver disease accompanying ADPKD come with a high disease burden and challenges in management. In contrast, pancreatic cysts in ADPKD are usually completely asymptomatic, but raise questions about the need for follow-up. This commentary provides an overview of the most important recommendations and practice points on hepatopancreatic cysts provided by the KDIGO guideline with the aim to contribute to implementation and to highlight remaining gaps in guidance, clinical care and research.

Referral to a nephrologist in diabetes with chronic kidney disease should be considered when urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) rises and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) declines continuously, when the etiology of kidney disease is uncertain, for difficult management issues (anemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, significant increases in albuminuria despite good blood pressure management, metabolic bone disease, resistant hypertension, or electrolyte disturbances), or for advanced kidney disease (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) requiring discussion of renal replacement therapy for ESKD. The threshold for referral may vary depending on the frequency with which the health care professional encounters people with diabetes and kidney disease, and health care professionals should also educate people with diabetes about the progression and risks of CKD, the likely prognosis, the benefits of proactive treatment of blood pressure and blood glucose, and the potential need for renal replacement therapy.

Study population

In total, 615 patients (48 ± 12 years, 58.2% female) were included. Of these patients, 105 were treated with tolvaptan (tolvaptan group) and 510 were not (no tolvaptan group) (Table 1). At baseline, patients in the tolvaptan group were younger (43 ± 8 vs 49 ± 12 years, P < .001), less often female (41.9% vs 61.6%, P < .001) and more often treated with renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors (78.1% vs 62.0%, P = 0.002). These patients also had larger kidneys [htTKV 1094 (755–1502) vs 840 (496–1352) mL/m, P < .001] and more often a PKD1 truncating mutation (P < .001). The 24-h urine osmolality was similar (366 ± 170 vs 394 ± 139 mOsm/kg, P = 0.2), as well as osmolar intake (P = 0.2). The mean duration of tolvaptan treatment was 6.1 ± 4.7 years (range 0.8–15.9 years), and patients received tolvaptan in a dose of 90/30 mg (84.8%), 60/30 mg (8.6%) or 45/15 mg (6.7%) daily. The urine osmolality decreased in the tolvaptan group from 366 ± 170 to 162 ± 73 mOsm/kg during treatment and the mean 24-h urine volume changed from 2608 ± 1023 mL before treatment to 5092 ± 1597 mL during treatment. During tolvaptan use, patients collected an average of five 24-h urine samples (range 0 to 18 samples). Assuming a 24-h urine osmolality threshold of < 300 mOsm/kg to indicate use of tolvaptan, approximately 90% (n = 68) of the 76 patients with urine osmolality measurements available had a 100% adherence rate. Only four patients had an adherence rate of < 75% and no patient had an adherence rate of < 50%. Whether or not patients still used tolvaptan at the last recorded observation is reported in Supplementary data, Table S1. The majority of patients (n = 67, 63.8%) still used tolvaptan at the end of follow-up, but tolvaptan was discontinued in 23 (21.9%) patients due to end-stage kidney disease, in 6 (5.7%) patients due to aquaresis-associated side-effects, in 4 (3.8%) due to loss of energy and fatigue, in 1 (1.0%) due to elevated transaminases and in 4 (3.8%) due to other reasons. In patients who were treated with tolvaptan for < 0.5 year (n = 30), a third (n = 10, 33.3%) used tolvaptan at the end of follow-up, in seven (23.3%) patients tolvaptan was discontinued due to aquaresis-associated side-effects, in one (3.3%) due to elevated transaminases and in five (16.7%) due to other reasons.

### Hypertension increases PPV for polycystic kidney disease in PKD1 and PKD2 variant carriers [^115FKHWh]. HGG Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the leading genetic form of KD. Although rare causal variants in the PKD1 and PKD2 genes have been identified, their penetrance and the disease progression and outcome are known to vary, and treatment efficacy in these carriers lags compared to patients with other forms of chronic KD (CKD). To develop a population screening strategy with high sensitivity to individuals likely to develop disease, we characterize the presentation and progression of ADPKD in variant carriers, identified in a multi-center all-comers cohort, as well as the UK Biobank. We show that the positive predictive value of hypertension for future diagnosis of KD is extremely high: 74% and 66% for PKD1 and PKD2, respectively. It is also highly preemptive, with hypertension occurring an average of 11 years before a KD diagnosis. Using pre-disease time point measurements of kidney function prior to their ADPKD diagnosis, we find that PKD1 and PKD2 variant carriers show significantly decreased kidney function (EGFR) an average of 5 years before their clinical diagnosis. Unlike other CKD patients, 54% of variant carriers with hypertension meet the diagnostic threshold for CKD years prior to their disease diagnosis, and their EGFRs are statistically indistinguishable from variant carriers who have already been diagnosed. These findings suggest that a population screening strategy using a combination of targeted sequencing and routine monitoring could identify cases of ADPKD with high sensitivity and support initiating treatment years prior to the current standard of care.

ABSTRACT

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2024 Guideline for Identification and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a welcome development, coming 12 years after the paradigm-changing 2012 guidelines. We are living in an unprecedented era in nephrology with novel therapies, including sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, now being proven in multiple randomized controlled clinical trials to reduce both the progression of CKD and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline is aimed at a broad audience looking after children and adults with CKD and provide practical and actionable steps to improve care. This commentary reviews the guideline sections pertaining to the evaluation and risk assessment of individuals with CKD from a European perspective. We feel that despite the last guideline being published 12 years ago, and the fact that the assessment of CKD has been emphasized by many other national/international nephrology, cardiology and diabetology guidelines and societies, the diagnosis and treatment of CKD remains poor across Europe. As such, the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline should be seen as an urgent call to action to improve diagnosis and care of children and adults with CKD across Europe. We know what we need to do. We now need to get on and do it.

### The expanding role of GLP-1 receptor agonists: a narrative review of current evidence and future directions [^116Hgb7h]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), originally developed for the management of type 2 diabetes, have gained prominence in managing obesity, offering clinically meaningful weight loss of 15–20% in many clinical trials. The approval of liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide for chronic weight management has significantly expanded their use. Beyond their effects on glycemic control and weight loss, GLP-1 RAs are now being evaluated for a range of other conditions, including cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, obstructive sleep apnea, knee osteoarthritis, polycystic ovary syndrome, neurodegenerative disease, and substance abuse disorders. Despite these advancements, several challenges persist. Long-term safety concerns, particularly regarding potential risks to the thyroid and gallbladder, are still being explored. Additionally, weight regain after treatment discontinuation and reductions in lean mass have raised new clinical concerns, while issues surrounding cost and accessibility present barriers to the widespread adoption of these drugs. This review explores the evolving role of GLP-1 RAs, highlighting their benefits beyond weight loss, key safety and policy considerations, and future directions for optimizing their use.

### SGLT2 inhibitors in ADPKD: mechanistic insights and therapeutic promise [^115bE5SF]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited kidney disorder and a leading cause of kidney failure worldwide. Disease progression is driven by cyst expansion, tubular injury, and maladaptive metabolic and hemodynamic changes. Tolvaptan remains the only FDA-approved disease-modifying therapy, yet its tolerability and safety profile highlight the need for additional strategies. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), initially developed for glycemic control, have demonstrated robust kidney- and cardio- protective effects across diverse patient populations, including those without diabetes. By lowering intraglomerular pressure, metabolic reprogramming, and attenuating hypoxic microenvironment and inflammation, SGLT2i target mechanisms that are relevant to ADPKD. However, concerns that SGLT2i may provoke osmotic diuresis and activate vasopressin led to systematic exclusion of patients with ADPKD from pivotal outcome trials. The 2025 KDIGO ADPKD guidelines explicitly advise against the use of SGLT2i for slowing kidney function decline in ADPKD. In this review, we examine mechanistic intersections between SGLT2i and ADPKD pathophysiology, summarize available preclinical and early clinical data, and discuss ongoing large trials designed to address safety and efficacy of SGLT2i in patients with ADPKD. We also highlight the importance of genetic heterogeneity, as most ongoing trials are enriched for rapid progressors carrying PKD1 or PKD2 pathogenic variants, while other genotypes such as DNAJB11, ALG8, and ALG9, often associated with greater interstitial fibrosis, are underrepresented. Substratification of patients by genotype, risk of progression, and comorbidities will be essential to guide precision application of SGLT2i. Whether SGLT2i can ultimately be positioned as an adjunctive or standalone therapy for ADPKD remains unresolved.

### Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: a review… [^112oWKqc]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Chebib FT, Hanna C, Harris PC, Torres VE, Dahl NK. Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease: A Review. JAMA. 2025; 333: 1708–1719. doi: 10.1001/jama.2025.0310 Importance. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is characterized by progressive development of kidney cysts and is the most common inherited kidney disorder worldwide. ADPKD accounts for 5% to 10% of kidney failure in the US and Europe, and its prevalence in the US is 9. 3 per 10 000 individuals. Observations ADPKD is typically diagnosed in individuals aged 27 to 42 years and is primarily caused by pathogenic variants in the PKD1 or PKD2 genes. Most persons with ADPKD have an affected parent, but de novo disease is suggested in 10% to 25% of families. More than 90% of patients older than 35 years have hepatic cysts, which may cause abdominal discomfort and occasionally require medical or surgical intervention.

Hypertension affects 70% to 80% of patients with ADPKD, and approximately 9% to 14% develop intracranial aneurysms, which have a rupture rate of 0. 57 per 1000 patient-years. Approximately 50% of individuals with ADPKD require kidney replacement therapy by 62 years of age. The severity of kidney disease can be quantified using the Mayo Imaging Classification, which stratifies patients based on total kidney volume adjusted for height and age and ranges from 1A to 1E. Patients with MIC 1C to MIC 1E have larger kidneys because of more rapid growth compared with those with MIC 1A and 1B and have earlier progression to kidney replacement therapy, which occurs at a mean age of 58. 4 years for MIC 1C,
52. 5 years for MIC 1D, and 43. 4 years for MIC 1E.

Optimal management of ADPKD includes systolic blood pressure lower than 120 mm Hg for most patients, but lower than 110/75 mm Hg for patients with MIC 1C to 1E who have an estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and are younger than 50 years, dietary sodium restriction, weight management, and adequate hydration. The vasopressin type 2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan reduces the annual rate of eGFR decline by 0. 98 to

1. 27 mL/min/1.73 m² and is indicated for patients with MIC 1C to 1E or an eGFR decline greater than 3 mL/min/1.73 m² per year to slow disease progression and delay the onset of kidney failure. Conclusion ADPKD is the most common genetic kidney disease worldwide and is characterized by progressive development of kidney cysts. Patients typically have hypertension and liver cysts, and 9% to 14% develop intracranial aneurysms.

First-line treatment includes blood pressure control, dietary and weight management, and adequate hydration. Tolvaptan reduces the rate of eGFR decline for those at high risk of rapid progression to kidney failure. Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

Safety considerations

Many concerns regarding the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in PKD patients have been raised. The most important concern is the stimulation of vasopressin release secondary to SGLT2 inhibitor-induced osmotic diuresis, which could worsen rather than improve cystic disease. Another safety issue associated with SGLT2is in ADPKD is their potential to exacerbate hypovolemia, hypernatremia, and acute kidney injury when combined with tolvaptan, which prevents vasopressin-mediated water reabsorption.

Another issue is the risk of genitourinary infection with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors. An increasing number of infections affecting kidney cysts may have potentially severe consequences, including faster disease progression.

Recommendations by Kasralainy nephrology group (KANG)

Trials to assess the feasibility of SGLT2 inhibitors in ADPKD are just beginning. Therefore, until further evidence is available, SGLT2 inhibitors should not be used in ADPKD patients outside of clinical trials. These recommendations align with the conclusions of the few available published preclinical trials.

Various renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors

Limitations of the study

This review is limited by the small sample sizes and short follow-up durations in many of the included studies, which complicates the evaluation of the long-term efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in kidney diseases. Additionally, the majority of studies have focused primarily on diabetic kidney disease with proteinuria, with insufficient data on non-diabetic conditions such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), renal anemia, renal bone disease, and lupus nephritis, which limits the generalizability of the findings. The use of various study designs, including observational and retrospective analyses, introduces potential biases, thereby affecting the robustness of the conclusions. Moreover, the paucity of data from low- and middle-income countries further restricts the applicability of these findings across diverse populations.

### Therapies in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: beyond tolvaptan [^115U4Hos]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a progressive genetic disorder characterized by cyst formation, kidney enlargement, and eventual kidney failure. While tolvaptan remains the only FDA-approved therapy targeting disease progression, there is a growing pipeline of novel therapies. This review explores emerging interventions aimed at modifying cystogenesis, metabolic reprogramming, and kidney function decline.

Recent Findings

Recent preclinical and early clinical studies have identified promising therapeutic avenues including AMPK activators (e.g., metformin), SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and bempedoic acid. Dietary interventions such as ketogenic diets and caloric restriction show potential for reducing cyst burden and preserving kidney function. RNA-based therapies targeting miR-17 and PC1-correcting agents like VX-407 offer genetically targeted treatment approaches. Several of these interventions are in ongoing phase 2 or 3 clinical trials evaluating their safety and efficacy and are discussed in this review.

Summary

The treatment landscape for ADPKD is rapidly evolving, with multiple innovative therapies advancing toward clinical implementation. Integration of pharmacologic, dietary, and genetic strategies represents a comprehensive approach to modifying disease trajectory. Further large-scale, long-term studies are essential to validate these approaches and optimize individualized patient care.

### Tolvaptan (Jynarque) [^112CZhpK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients were maintained on their highest tolerated dose for a period of 12 months but could interrupt, decrease and/or increase as clinical circumstances warranted within the range of titrated doses. All patients were encouraged to start drinking an adequate amount of water at screening and continuing through the end of the trial to avoid thirst or dehydration.

A total of 1519 subjects were enrolled in the study. Of these, 1370 subjects successfully completed the pre-randomization period and were randomized and treated during the 12-month double-blind period. Because 57 subjects did not complete the off-treatment follow-up period, 1313 subjects were included in the primary efficacy analysis.

For subjects randomized, the baseline, average estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 41 mL/min/1.73 m²(CKD-Epidemiology formula) and historical TKV, available in 318 (23%) of subjects, averaged 2026 mL. Approximately 5%, 75% and 20% had an eGFR 60 mL/min/1.73 m²or greater, between 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2, and between 25 and 29 mL/min/1.73 m², respectively. The subjects' mean age was 47 years, 50% were female, 92% were Caucasian, 4% Black or African-American and 3% were Asian, 93% had hypertension, and 87% of subjects were taking antihypertensive agents affecting the angiotensin converting enzyme or receptor. Of the 115 (8%) of subjects who had prior genetic tests, only 54 (47%) knew their results with 48 (89%) of these having PKD1 and 6 (11%) having PKD2 mutations.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

JYNARQUE was shown to slow the rate of decline in renal function in adult patients at risk of rapidly progressing ADPKD in two trials: TEMPO 3:4 in patients at earlier stages of disease and REPRISE in patients at later stages. The findings from these trials, when taken together, suggest that JYNARQUE slows the loss of renal function progressively through the course of the disease.

TEMPO 3:4: A Phase 3, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized Trial in Early, Rapidly-Progressing ADPKD

In TEMPO 3:4 (NCT00428948), 1445 adult patients (age > 18 years) with early (estimated creatinine clearance [eCrCl] ≥ 60 mL/min), rapidly-progressing (total kidney volume [TKV] ≥ 750 mL and age < 51 years) ADPKD (diagnosed by modified Ravine criteria) were randomized 2:1 to treatment with tolvaptan or placebo. Patients were treated for up to 3 years; patients who discontinued medication prematurely were only required to attend clinic visits to assess renal function for up to 42 days after treatment withdrawal and to attend telephone visits at all scheduled visits for up to 36 months. Patients who completed treatment at the 3-year visit had treatment interrupted for 2 to 6 weeks to assess renal function post treatment. Patients received treatment twice a day (first dose on waking, second dose approximately 9 hours later). Patients were initiated on 45 mg/15 mg, and up-titrated weekly to 60 mg/30 mg and then to 90 mg/30 mg as tolerated. Patients were to maintain the highest tolerated dose for 3 years, but could interrupt, decrease and/or increase as clinical circumstances warranted within the range of titrated doses. All patients were encouraged to drink adequate water to avoid thirst or dehydration and before bedtime.

### New insights in the pathophysiology and treatment of hypertension in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^111gdrnR]. Kidney International (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a frequent and early manifestation in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), significantly associated with kidney function decline and cardiovascular outcomes. ADPKD-related hypertension arises from mechanisms unique to the disease, including renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation driven by cyst expansion and endothelial dysfunction. Recent studies highlight the importance of early diagnosis and optimal BP management in ADPKD. The 2025 KDIGO guideline recommends a BP target of ≤ 110/75 mm Hg in hypertensive patients aged 18–49 years with preserved kidney function, and < 120 mm Hg systolic BP in older adults when tolerated. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors remain the first-line antihypertensive therapy, while emerging strategies hold promise for addressing specific mechanisms and refractory cases. Special populations, including children and pregnant women, present unique challenges and require tailored management strategies. This review synthesizes the latest insights into the pathophysiology and management of hypertension in ADPKD, underscoring the need for personalized approaches and future research to refine therapeutic options.

### Polycystic kidney disease in children: the current status and the next horizon [^115dbPSU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) are inherited disorders that share many features such as kidney cysts, hypertension, urinary concentrating defects, and progressive chronic kidney disease. Underlying pathogenic mechanisms for both include cilia dysfunction and dysregulated intracellular signaling. ADPKD has been traditionally regarded as an adult-onset disease, whereas ARPKD has been classically described as an infantile or childhood condition. However, clinicians must recognize that both disorders can present across all age groups ranging from fetal life and infancy to childhood and adolescence, as well as adulthood. Here we highlight the points of overlap and distinct features for these disorders with respect to pathogenesis, diagnostic modalities (radiological and genetic), clinical assessment, and early therapeutic management. In particular, we consider key issues at two critical points for transition of care, i.e., fetal life to infancy and adolescence to adulthood. These timepoints are poorly covered in the extant literature. Therefore, we recommend guiding principles for transitions of clinical care at these critical junctures in the lifespan. While there is no cure for polycystic kidney disease (PKD), recent insights into pathogenic mechanisms have identified promising therapeutic targets that are currently being evaluated in a growing portfolio of clinical trials. We summarize the key findings from these largely adult-based trials and discuss the implications for designing child-focused studies. Finally, we look forward to the next horizon for childhood PKD, highlighting gaps in our current knowledge, and discussing future directions and strategies to attenuate the full burden of disease for children affected with PKD.
