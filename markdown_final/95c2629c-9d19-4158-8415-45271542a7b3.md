## Question

patient hypoxic, refractory for diuretic, previous PE what are the guidelines of getting a CTA

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to obtain a CTPA in a hypoxic patient whose hypoxemia is refractory to diuretics and who has a prior PE, and what the guidelines recommend in this scenario. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate risk stratification and whether this is "high-risk" PE requiring emergent imaging. Then, I should verify how to estimate pretest probability with clinical prediction rules. Next, I need to check whether a D-dimer has any role here. After that, I will examine the optimal first-line imaging test and its alternatives. I should confirm anticoagulation timing while diagnostic work-up proceeds. Finally, I will review interpretation of CTPA results and what to do if clinical suspicion remains high despite negative imaging, and I should consider how the history of prior PE shifts thresholds for testing and treatment decisions [^113vNAQD].

> Let me first confirm hemodynamic status, because that determines urgency and the initial test choice. At first glance, I might be tempted to label severe refractory hypoxemia as "high-risk PE" even if the blood pressure is normal; wait, let me verify the ESC/ERS definition — high-risk PE is defined by shock or persistent hypotension, so refractory hypoxemia alone does not fulfill the high-risk category, although it should heighten urgency and prompt emergent imaging and monitoring, with bedside echocardiography considered if CT is not immediately available [^111m2sux] [^113vNAQD]. I need to ensure that if the patient is unstable or decompensates, I prioritize bedside echo or emergency CTPA based on feasibility while initiating supportive care and moving quickly toward reperfusion therapy if true high-risk PE is confirmed or overwhelmingly likely [^111m2sux] [^113vNAQD].

> Next, I should review pretest probability, and I need to be deliberate here. Validated tools such as Wells or revised Geneva are recommended to categorize PE likelihood; a prior PE meaningfully increases pretest probability and, with refractory hypoxemia not explained by left-sided failure, will often place the patient at least in the intermediate, and not infrequently in the high, category even before labs are drawn [^113vNAQD] [^115v1mMw]. Hold on, let me not jump to conclusions — gestalt can mislead, so formal scoring helps anchor decisions and downstream test interpretation; nonetheless, with a prior PE and concerning presentation, I should plan for direct imaging and avoid delays that add little value [^113vNAQD] [^114cys15].

> I should double-check the role of D-dimer here. In patients with high clinical probability, the ESC/ERS guideline advises against ordering D-dimer because a normal result cannot safely exclude PE and would only delay imaging; D-dimer is intended for low or intermediate probability (with age-adjusted thresholds where appropriate) to safely avoid imaging, not for high-probability scenarios like this one [^117Kqscd] [^112UjLr8]. So, I need to ensure we skip the D-dimer in a high-probability patient and proceed to definitive imaging without delay [^115yzD9T].

> Now, I will examine the imaging choice. CTPA is the major first-line diagnostic modality in suspected PE because it is fast, widely available, and directly visualizes pulmonary arterial filling defects; V/Q scanning is preferred mainly when iodinated contrast is contraindicated (e.g., severe renal dysfunction, contrast allergy) or in pregnancy with a normal chest X-ray, while bedside transthoracic echocardiography is prioritized if the patient is unstable and cannot undergo immediate CT [^115v1mMw] [^116oyr9V] [^111m2sux]. Let me verify there are no contraindications to iodinated contrast; if none are present, urgent CTPA is appropriate in this presentation with at least intermediate to high pretest probability [^115v1mMw].

> I should confirm test performance and interpretive nuance. CTPA has high sensitivity and specificity for clinically significant PE and can also reveal alternative or concomitant diagnoses contributing to hypoxemia; in high-probability contexts its positive predictive value is high, but I must remain cautious with isolated subsegmental findings and ensure they fit the clinical picture [^113tcSXs] [^115kSPmA]. Wait, what if the CTPA is negative despite persistent severe hypoxemia and high suspicion? A normal CTPA safely excludes PE in most patients, but with discordant clinical data, guidelines support considering additional testing such as V/Q SPECT or serial evaluation rather than prematurely abandoning the diagnosis, especially if technical factors could have limited image quality [^1156t4bK] [^115v1mMw].

> While arranging imaging, I need to ensure timely anticoagulation. In patients with intermediate-to-high clinical suspicion, the ESC/ERS guideline recommends starting therapeutic anticoagulation while the diagnostic work-up is in progress unless there is a major bleeding risk, which reduces the risk of clot propagation during the evaluation window [^112u5zuH]. Hold on, I should verify bleeding risks carefully; if true high-risk PE with shock is identified or strongly suspected, systemic thrombolysis may be indicated, and even "absolute" contraindications can become relative in life-threatening PE, a balance that requires senior-level risk-benefit judgment [^113vNAQD] [^1137M9zX].

> I will now examine next steps based on CTPA results. If CTPA shows segmental or more proximal filling defects, the diagnosis is established and full-dose anticoagulation is indicated with consideration of reperfusion therapy if hemodynamics deteriorate; if CTPA is negative and clinical suspicion has dropped with an alternative explanation found, PE can be excluded and anticoagulation stopped in the absence of another indication [^113ioWLG] [^115v1mMw]. But wait, if CTPA is negative yet the patient remains severely hypoxic and PE suspicion persists, I should verify image quality and consider V/Q SPECT or repeat imaging, and I may add lower-extremity ultrasound to look for proximal DVT that would justify treatment even if chest imaging remains equivocal [^115v1mMw] [^1112brcF].

> Let me consider the special impact of a prior PE on decision thresholds. A history of prior PE raises the pretest probability, lowers the utility of D-dimer, and supports a strategy of proceeding straight to imaging in moderate-to-high suspicion presentations; I need to ensure that documentation reflects this elevated baseline risk to justify expedited testing and empiric anticoagulation while awaiting definitive imaging [^113vNAQD] [^115v1mMw]. Hold on, I should also remain mindful of overtesting in low-risk groups, but in this particular scenario the balance clearly favors rapid CTPA rather than extended rule-out strategies [^114cys15].

> Bottom line, synthesizing all of this: In a hypoxic, diuretic-refractory patient with a prior PE, I should assume at least intermediate, and often high, pretest probability; skip D-dimer; initiate therapeutic anticoagulation if bleeding risk is acceptable; and obtain urgent CTPA as the first-line test, using bedside echocardiography if unstable or V/Q imaging if CT contrast is contraindicated; then tailor therapy based on CTPA findings and clinical evolution, escalating to reperfusion strategies if true high-risk PE is confirmed or imminent [^111m2sux] [^112u5zuH] [^115v1mMw] [^113ioWLG].

In a patient with refractory hypoxia, prior PE, and diuretic-refractory symptoms, **CTPA is indicated when clinical suspicion for recurrent PE is high or intermediate** [^111m2sux] [^113ioWLG]. Do not delay imaging for D-dimer in **high-probability cases** [^117Kqscd]; initiate anticoagulation while awaiting results [^112u5zuH]. If CTPA is contraindicated [^115yzD9T], use V/Q SPECT [^117XvE2U] or compression ultrasound [^113vNAQD] as alternatives.

---

## Clinical assessment and pretest probability

Use **clinical prediction rules** such as Wells or revised Geneva [^112kKbjQ] to stratify PE probability [^116ZX9Dd]. In hypoxic, diuretic-refractory patients with prior PE and **high clinical suspicion** [^115yzD9T], pretest probability is often high or intermediate.

---

## Indications for CTA in suspected recurrent PE

According to ESC 2019, obtain CTPA when:

- **High clinical probability**: Immediate CTPA [^111m2sux] or bedside echocardiography if unstable.
- **Intermediate probability**: CTPA if D-dimer is positive [^113ioWLG] or unavailable.
- **Low probability**: CTPA if D-dimer is positive [^112UjLr8].

---

## Special considerations in patients with prior PE

Because **prior PE** increases recurrence risk, maintain a low threshold for imaging [^112kKbjQ]. In **refractory hypoxia**, strongly consider CTPA [^115yzD9T] if no alternative explanation exists.

---

## Contraindications and alternative imaging modalities

Contraindications include **severe renal impairment, contrast allergy, and pregnancy**; alternatives include **V/Q SPECT** [^1112brcF] [^117XvE2U] or **compression ultrasound** for proximal DVT [^113vNAQD].

---

## Risks and benefits of CTA

The **benefits** of CTA include high sensitivity/specificity [^113tcSXs], rapid diagnosis [^115yzD9T], and guidance for management, whereas the **risks** include radiation exposure [^113tcSXs], contrast nephropathy, and allergic reactions [^115yzD9T] [^114cys15].

In patients with a low or intermediate clinical probability but a positive D-dimer, and in patients with a high or likely clinical probability, lung imaging is required. The two main imaging modalities are:

- **V/P imaging**: V/P SPECT (ventilation/perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography) or, in rare situations, planar scintigraphy (V/P planar). Occasionally, perfusion-only lung scanning is performed. V/P SPECT may also be combined with low-dose computed tomography (CT), referred to as V/P SPECT/CT.
- **CTPA**: Computed tomography of the pulmonary arteries.

Invasive pulmonary angiography is no longer regarded as the gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE) due to its limited sensitivity and specificity, as well as wide interobserver variability.

Transthoracic echocardiography was discussed in previous guidelines for hemodynamically unstable patients. A recent review underscores the need for further research on this topic.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) leads to loss of perfusion to the area corresponding to the volume supplied by the occluded end artery, which may include a whole lung, a lobe, a lung segment, or a subsegment. Generally, the bronchial circulation maintains the viability of the embolized volume, and ventilation remains largely intact. Accordingly, V/P SPECT exploits the unique pulmonary arterial segmental anatomy.

The segmental map includes the two lungs in four coronal slices and two sagittal slices for each lung. A bronchopulmonary segment is conical with its apex towards the hilum and its base projected onto the pleural surface.

### Advances in the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism [^113xn5sB]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

The diagnostic management of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is complicated by its heterogeneous clinical presentation. Diagnostic algorithms, combining clinical probability estimation with D-dimer testing and imaging tests, are very safe to exclude PE, although at the cost of a high number of CT examinations. In view of cost and time savings, as well as safety issues, several attempts have recently been undertaken to reduce the number of required imaging tests. Especially the age-adjusted D-dimer threshold has greatly improved the potential for non-invasive exclusion of PE.

Once the diagnosis of PE is established, the immediate initiation of anticoagulant therapy is of vital importance. A new generation of direct oral anticoagulants, which overcomes the main disadvantages of conventional vitamin K antagonists, has recently emerged. Risk stratification of hemodynamically stable PE patients using clinical decision rules, cardiac biomarkers, or imaging tests aids physicians in determining the most appropriate treatment approach for the individual patient. This is essential to differentiate patients at low risk of adverse outcomes, who may be safely treated at home, from intermediate-risk patients, who require closer monitoring and for whom recent studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of systemic thrombolytic therapy.

This article reviews recent advances and challenges that remain in the diagnostic work-up and initial management of acute, clinically stable PE.

### Nonspecific tests for pulmonary embolism [^112nfW7r]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Many tests have been proposed as useful in the diagnostic evaluation of suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), but nonspecific tests for PE can only add to the level of suspicion one has for the diagnosis. As Anderson indicates, "virtually all clinical and laboratory findings neither diagnose nor exclude the diagnosis of PE. They merely serve to heighten suspicion of the diagnosis and prompt the clinician to pursue additional diagnostic studies". D-dimer measurement is promising as a test to exclude PE in young healthy outpatients, and further study and improvements in technology can clarify the usefulness of the different methods of performing this assay. For now, diagnostic algorithms for PE should continue to incorporate multiple tests and decision points, but the standard remains specialized imaging techniques.

### New methods for estimating pretest probability in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^115EMbar]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The clinical assessment of the probability of pulmonary embolism is a key step in proposed diagnostic strategies for pulmonary embolism because the interpretation of noninvasive test results is conditional on the pretest probability derived from the presence or absence of clinical factors. The past year has brought important progress in the general area of clinical prediction of pulmonary embolism with the publication of two new, simple clinical prediction rules. Each of the prediction rules includes a total of seven clinical variables that, when combined, allow for the categorization of patients into categories of low, intermediate, or high pretest probability of pulmonary embolism.

Although these clinical prediction rules are perhaps only slightly better than the estimates of experienced clinicians, they provide an explicit method for estimating the probability of PE as an adjunct to diagnostic testing. Further validation work is now needed to assess how well these new prediction rules perform in settings other than the derivation sites.

### Pretest risk assessment in suspected acute pulmonary embolism [^113Urgm1]. Academic Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

To assess the pretest practices of US clinicians treating patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE), a survey was conducted among 855 randomly selected physicians from three professional organizations. Participants were asked to estimate the frequency and method of determining the likelihood of PE before requesting confirmatory studies. They reported their awareness of four published clinical practice guidelines related to acute PE and selected options for further diagnostic testing after reviewing clinical data from three hypothetical patients with low, intermediate, and high probability of acute PE.

Completed surveys were received from 240 physicians practicing in 44 states. Although the majority (98.3%) reported assessing the pretest probability of PE before testing, slightly more than half did so routinely. Approximately 72.5% preferred an unstructured approach to pretest assessment, whereas 22.9% utilized published prediction rules. Most respondents (93.0%) were aware of at least one published guideline for assessing acute PE, but only 44.2% reported using one or more in their daily practice. Clinicians who used published prediction rules, routinely estimated pretest probability, or employed at least one practice guideline were more likely to request additional testing when presented with a low probability clinical scenario. No significant differences in testing frequency or preferences were observed for intermediate or high probability clinical scenarios.

In conclusion, the majority of clinicians surveyed utilize an unstructured approach when estimating the pretest probability of acute PE.

### Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for the detection of pulmonary embolism (PE) among trauma patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114yScLa]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Regarding the limited resources and complications, CTPA continues to be the gold standard for diagnosing PE. It is suggested for use in patients who are highly suspected of having PE and are characterized by relevant clinical features and laboratory findings. The usual procedure for a suspected PE in a non-traumatized patient involves excluding PE using either subjective clinical judgment or objective criteria, such as a risk score model. Society standards for both emergency and internal medicine suggest that if the pretest likelihood of a PE is minimal and accompanied by a normal D-dimer, PE may be ruled out.

In trauma patients, the significance of a D-dimer in diagnosing PE is uncertain because traumatic damage can lead to increased D-dimers regardless of the presence of a pulmonary embolism. One of the most well-known clinical-based scoring systems for assessing the probability of PE is the Wells criteria. As shown by Buchanan et al, although Wells criteria among PE-predicting risk scoring models appeared to have the highest area under the curve of 0.65 for trauma patients, it failed to predict PE optimally. In addition, in a population of patients with femur fractures, the simplified Wells score showed no significant difference between PE and non-PE groups.

These findings contrast with the results of a recent meta-analysis of 8947 patients, which showed the acceptable capability of Wells and Geneva rules, as well as D-dimer level, to diagnose PE. It should be noted that the meta-analysis findings are not limited to trauma patients.

Assessment of pretest clinical probability

Clinical probability for pulmonary embolism (PE) can be assessed either empirically by clinical judgment (holistically) or by clinical prediction rules. The foremost tools for this are Wells' and the revised Geneva scores, both of which have been adequately validated and recommended by the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM), the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). For both scores, simplified and validated versions are available. Usually, patients are clinically stratified into two or three risk categories: unlikely/likely and low/intermediate/high, with increasing prevalence of PE.

- **D-dimer testing**: Plasma D-dimer, a breakdown product of fibrin clot, is regularly elevated not only in patients with venous thromboembolism but also in those with myocardial infarction, stroke, infection, inflammation, cancer, and during pregnancy. The specificity of the D-dimer test is low, and a positive D-dimer test does not confirm PE. However, the D-dimer test is very sensitive. Therefore, when the D-dimer is below a predefined cut-off value (i.e. < 500 μg/L with correction for age), it can be used to exclude PE in patients with either low to intermediate or unlikely clinical probability. However, in persistent and old PE cases, the D-dimer test can be negative. In patients with a high or likely clinical probability, the D-dimer has no discriminating power and should not be measured.

In a recent randomised clinical trial including 1916 patients with suspected PE, evaluated by clinical judgment (holistically) to be at very low risk for PE, the use of the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC) safely excluded PE.

### EANM guideline for ventilation/perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and beyond [^1112brcF]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). High credibility.

These guidelines update the previous EANM 2009 guidelines on the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). Relevant new aspects include:

- **Quantification of defects**: Involves quantification of PE and other ventilation/perfusion defects.
- **Follow-up and chronic conditions**: Discusses follow-up of patients with PE and chronic PE.
- **Comorbid diagnoses**: Describes additional pulmonary physiological changes leading to diagnoses of left ventricular heart failure (HF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia.

The diagnosis of PE should be reported when a mismatch of one segment or two subsegments is found. For ventilation, Technegas or krypton gas is preferred over diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) in patients with COPD. Tomographic imaging with V/P SPECT has higher sensitivity and specificity for PE compared with planar imaging. The absence of contraindications makes V/P SPECT an essential method for the diagnosis of PE. When V/P SPECT is combined with a low-dose CT, the specificity of the test can be further improved, especially in patients with other lung diseases. Pitfalls in V/P SPECT interpretation are discussed. In conclusion, V/P SPECT is strongly recommended as it accurately establishes the diagnosis of PE even in the presence of diseases like COPD, HF, and pneumonia and has no contraindications.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: Best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^115j6zVt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) can be a severe disease and is difficult to diagnose due to its nonspecific signs and symptoms. As a result, testing patients with suspected acute PE has increased dramatically. However, the overuse of some tests, particularly computed tomography (CT) and plasma d-dimer measurement, may not improve care while potentially leading to patient harm and unnecessary expense.

The literature search encompassed studies indexed by MEDLINE (1966–2014; English-language only) and included all clinical trials and meta-analyses on diagnostic strategies, decision rules, laboratory tests, and imaging studies for the diagnosis of PE. This document is not based on a formal systematic review but instead seeks to provide practical advice based on the best available evidence and recent guidelines. The target audience for this paper is all clinicians; the target patient population is all adults, both inpatient and outpatient, suspected of having acute PE.

- **Best practice advice 1**: Clinicians should use validated clinical prediction rules to estimate pretest probability in patients for whom acute PE is being considered.

- **Best practice advice 2**: Clinicians should not obtain d-dimer measurements or imaging studies in patients with a low pretest probability of PE and who meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria.

- **Best practice advice 3**: Clinicians should obtain a high-sensitivity d-dimer measurement as the initial diagnostic test in patients who have an intermediate pretest probability of PE or in patients with a low pretest probability of PE who d

### Age and sex-dependent trends in pulmonary embolism testing and derivation of a clinical decision rule for young patients [^115RjrNu]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Despite the low prevalence of pulmonary embolism (PE) in young adults, these individuals are frequently imaged for PE, which involves radiation exposure and substantial financial cost. This study aims to determine the use and positive proportions for PE imaging by age, differences in clinical presentation of PE by age, and the projected impact of an age-targeted decision rule.

The design involves the analysis of two national population-based datasets: the 2009 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample, a 20% sample of US emergency departments (EDs), and the 2003–2006 Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) dataset, a multisite cohort of ED patients with suspected PE from 12 US EDs.

The results indicate that the prevalence of PE was 10 times lower in young patients (18–35 years) than in older patients (> 65 years) (0.06% vs. 0.60%, p < 0.001). However, young patients were imaged for PE almost as frequently as older patients (2.3% vs. 3.2%), resulting in a lower proportion of positive examinations in young adults compared to older adults (2.3% vs. 17.4%, p < 0.001 in women; 4.0% vs. 21.4%, p < 0.001 in men). Clinical predictors of PE varied by age, with tachycardia being a significant predictor of PE in older patients (OR: 1.2–1.9, p < 0.001), but not young patients. Fever was a significant predictor only in young patients (OR: 1.4–7.2, p < 0.01). A modification of the previously described PERC rule to include age-specific risk factors could reduce PE imaging by 51% in young patients, with a missed PE rate of 0.6% in those excluded from imaging.

These findings underscore the frequent imaging of young patients for PE and their lower positive imaging rate.

### All contraindications to thrombolysis for life-threatening pulmonary embolus should be considered relative [^1137M9zX]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). High credibility.

Acute massive pulmonary embolism (PE) can be fatal; however, timely thrombolytic therapy can be lifesaving. Guidelines advocate the use of thrombolysis for massive PE in patients with an acceptable bleeding-risk profile. Nonetheless, estimating what constitutes an acceptable bleeding risk in those with life-threatening PE is a clinical challenge, and even contraindications considered 'absolute' may present a lesser risk than leaving PE untreated. We discuss the case of a 77-year-old man who received thrombolysis for a massive PE 4 weeks following admission with a significant intracerebral bleed. There was rapid resolution of hypotension and hypoxia, and he survived to be discharged home. This case is used to illustrate that no potential therapy should be discounted in patients faced with acute life-threatening PE. Decisions to thrombolyse patients with traditional contraindications — even those considered absolute — must be taken by clinicians able to weigh relative risks.

### An official American Thoracic Society/Society of Thoracic Radiology clinical practice guideline: Evaluation of suspected pulmonary embolism in pregnancy [^116oyr9V]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of maternal mortality in the developed world. Prevention of death from PE in pregnancy requires a high index of clinical suspicion, along with appropriate prophylaxis and therapy, followed by a timely and accurate diagnostic approach.

- **Methods**: To provide guidance on this important health issue, a multidisciplinary panel of major medical stakeholders was convened to develop evidence-based guidelines for evaluation of suspected pulmonary embolism in pregnancy using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. In the formulation of the recommended diagnostic algorithm, the important outcomes were defined to be diagnostic accuracy and diagnostic yield. The panel placed a high value on minimizing cumulative radiation dose when determining the recommended sequence of tests.

- **Results**: Overall, the quality of the underlying evidence for all recommendations was rated as very low or low, with some of the evidence considered for recommendations extrapolated from studies of the general population. Despite the low-quality evidence, strong recommendations were made for three specific scenarios: performance of chest radiography (CXR) as the first radiation-associated procedure; use of lung scintigraphy as the preferred test in the setting of a normal CXR; and performance of computed-tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) rather than digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in a pregnant woman with a nondiagnostic ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) result.

The recommendations presented in this guideline underscore the importance of careful assessment and the use of specific diagnostic procedures to minimize risk while ensuring effective evaluation of suspected pulmonary embolism in pregnancy.

### Diagnosis and exclusion of pulmonary embolism [^112XvjVG]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Failure to test for pulmonary embolism (PE) can be a lethal mistake, as PE produces symptoms similar to many other diseases. However, overtesting for PE has negative consequences.

- **Objectives**: Use published evidence to create a rational and safe diagnostic approach for ambulatory and emergency patients with suspected PE in 2017.

- **Findings**: Pulmonary embolism need not be pursued in patients with no symptoms of PE in the present or recent history (e.g. dyspnea, chest pain, cough, or syncope) and consistently normal vital signs. When clinicians have a low clinical suspicion for PE or a Wells score of less than 2, they can reasonably exclude PE using the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC rule). For patients with a "PE-unlikely" pretest probability (Wells or simplified revised Geneva score of less than 5), PE can be ruled out with normal or age-adjusted D-dimer concentrations. Patients not meeting these criteria should undergo pulmonary vascular imaging, with options including computerized tomographic pulmonary angiography, planar, and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).

- **Conclusions**: A thoughtful algorithm for PE exclusion and diagnosis requires pretest probability assessment in all patients, followed by selective use of clinical criteria, quantitative D-dimer testing, and pulmonary vascular imaging.

### ACR appropriateness criteria acute chest pain-suspected pulmonary embolism [^115v1mMw]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a common and important clinical condition that cannot be accurately diagnosed based solely on signs, symptoms, and history. The diagnosis of PE has been facilitated by technical advancements and multidetector CT pulmonary angiography, currently the major diagnostic modality used. Ventilation and perfusion scans remain largely accurate and useful in certain settings. Lower-extremity ultrasound can substitute by demonstrating deep vein thrombosis; however, if negative, further studies to exclude PE are indicated. In all cases, correlation with the clinical status, particularly with risk factors, improves not only the accuracy of diagnostic imaging but also overall utilization. Other diagnostic tests have limited roles.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Best clinical practice: Current controversies in pulmonary embolism imaging and treatment of subsegmental thromboembolic disease [^1111gEjg]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) affects over 600,000 patients per year in the United States. Evaluation includes clinical decision rules, laboratory tests, and several imaging modalities. The diagnosis of PE has risen in recent years, particularly for subsegmental PE (SSPE). Controversy exists concerning the diagnosis and treatment of these lesions.

We sought to provide emergency physicians with a review of the controversies surrounding PE testing and the diagnosis and treatment of SSPE. With the rise of computed tomography (CT) testing for PE, diagnosis has increased. Providers often omit risk stratification in favor of D-dimer or imaging, which does not have literature support. The detection of PE has risen by 80%, and this increased testing is associated with several risks, including contrast reaction, nephropathy, and increased radiation. SSPE diagnosis has risen with improved imaging technology, but the literature shows low interobserver agreement on the diagnosis of true SSPE. Studies disagree on the clinical significance and dangers of this PE subset.

The American College of Chest Physicians 2016 guidelines recommend withholding anticoagulation for SSPE with low risk for recurrent thrombus and no concurrent deep vein thrombosis. Patients at high risk for recurrent venous thromboembolism or with deep vein thrombosis warrant anticoagulation. Ultimately, the provider is responsible for appropriate evaluation with risk stratification and selective testing.

Subsegmental PE presents a quandary, as the literature differs in showing harm despite increased detection.

### Derivation and validation of a 4-level clinical pretest probability score for suspected pulmonary embolism to safely decrease imaging testing [^116E86x2]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

In patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), overuse of diagnostic imaging is an important point of concern. The objective was to derive and validate a 4-level pretest probability rule (4-Level Pulmonary Embolism Clinical Probability Score [4PEPS]) that makes it possible to rule out PE solely on clinical criteria and optimized D-dimer measurement to safely decrease imaging testing for suspected PE.

This study included consecutive outpatients suspected of having PE from US and European emergency departments. Individual data from three merged management studies (n = 11,114; overall prevalence of PE, 11%) were used for the derivation cohort and internal validation cohort. The external validation cohorts were taken from two independent studies: the first with a high PE prevalence (n = 1548; prevalence, 21.5%) and the second with a moderate PE prevalence (n = 1669; prevalence, 11.7%). A prior definition of pretest probability target values to achieve a posttest probability of less than 2% was used based on the negative likelihood ratios of D-dimer. Data were collected from January 2003 to April 2016, and analyses were conducted from June 2018 to August 2019.

The main outcomes and measures were the rate of PE diagnosed during the initial workup or during follow-up and the rate of imaging testing.

Of the 5588 patients in the derivation cohort, 3441 (61.8%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 52 (18.5) years. The 4PEPS comprises 13 clinical variables scored from -2 to 5. It results in the following strategy: (1) very low probability of PE.

### EANM guideline for ventilation/perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and beyond [^115kSPmA]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Computed tomography angiography of the pulmonary artery (CTPA) involves imaging the pulmonary arteries during the passage of intravenously injected iodinated contrast material. Pulmonary emboli are visualized as filling defects, caused by emboli within otherwise homogeneously contrast-filled pulmonary arteries. CTPA is easy to perform in a few minutes.

CTPA should be embedded in decision strategies that are based on assessing the clinical likelihood of pulmonary embolism (PE). It confirms the diagnosis of PE in clinically high-probability patients (positive predictive value, PPV > 95%). However, when there is a high pretest probability of PE and a negative CTPA, data on diagnostic accuracy are inconsistent; CTPA is overused in many patients with low prevalence of PE. A pulmonary embolism located centrally in the pulmonary circulation can be detected by CTPA with a high PPV. The PPV decreases at segmental and subsegmental levels. When the clinical probability of PE is low or intermediate, CTPA may overdiagnose PE, leading to a low negative predictive value (NPV).

CTPA has the potential to visualize additional pathologies other than PE, such as pneumothorax, pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, pleural disease, aortic dissection, and pathologies of the spine and rib cage. In cases of PE, CT is capable of depicting signs of right heart strain, which is of prognostic importance.

### Finding an alternative diagnosis does not justify increased use of CT-pulmonary angiography [^112zHoby]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Methods

We determined the total number of CTPA performed in patients older than 18 years and their results, categorized as either positive or negative for PE, for each year from 2000 to 2010 in a 500-bed academic teaching hospital in New York City. The study was approved by the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System's institutional review board, which waived the need for informed consent.

We studied in detail the medical records of patients who underwent CTPA in three index years: 2000, 2005, and 2008. The year 2000 was chosen as a baseline reference year; 2005 was the first calendar year after the hospital obtained an additional CT scanner, and 2008 followed the publication of the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis II (PIOPED II) and its recommendations. We reviewed all available records for the year 2000 (74 records) and a random sample representative of all CTPA performed in 2005 and 2008, totaling 850 studies reviewed for 2005 and 2008. We excluded CT chest angiograms performed for other reasons, such as aortic dissection. Demographic data, clinical presentation, risk factors for thromboembolic disease, documentation of pre-test probability of PE, use of therapeutic anticoagulation, and results of CTPA were abstracted from patients' medical records. Since increased use of CTPA may be replacing that of V/Q scans, we also determined the number of V/Q scans performed for the diagnosis of PE from 2000 to 2010.

- **Assessment of pre-test probability of PE**: We assigned pre-test probability to all subjects using the Revised Geneva Score (RGS).

### CT imaging in acute pulmonary embolism: diagnostic strategies [^117RAADB]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTA) has increasingly become accepted as a widely available, safe, cost-effective, and accurate method for a quick and comprehensive diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Pulmonary catheter angiography is still considered the gold standard and final imaging method in many diagnostic algorithms. However, spiral CTA has become established as the first imaging test in routine clinical practice due to its high negative predictive value for clinically relevant PE. Despite the direct visualization of clot material, depiction of cardiac and pulmonary function in combination with the quantification of pulmonary obstruction helps to grade the severity of PE for further risk stratification and to monitor the effect of thrombolytic therapy.

Because PE and deep venous thrombosis are two different aspects of the same disease, additional indirect CT venography may be a valuable addition to the initial diagnostic algorithm if this was positive for PE. Demonstration of the extent and localization of deep venous thrombosis has an impact on clinical management. Additional and alternate diagnoses add to the usefulness of this method. Using advanced multislice spiral CT technology, some practitioners have advocated CTA as the sole imaging tool for routine clinical assessment in suspected acute PE, which will simplify standards of practice in the near future.

### Management dilemmas in acute pulmonary embolism [^114wjHRa]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

Several guidelines on acute pulmonary embolism (PE) have been published; however, guidance for various scenarios that challenge physicians in the management of acute PE is often not easily accessible within these guidelines. Our institution operates an integrated PE service involving both respiratory and hematology physicians, alongside a large tertiary pulmonary hypertension service. We frequently receive referrals for complex acute PE cases from other centers. In this review, we discuss the most clinically challenging scenarios.

### Revised paradigm for acute pulmonary embolism prognostication and treatment [^115QhrmF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

A certain estimated rate of PE-related serious complications shortly after PE could lead to a recommendation of systemic thrombolytic therapy, assuming that it is the most effective and immediately available treatment and that the estimated risk of bleeding is outweighed by the benefit. The threshold of estimated short-term PE-related serious complication risk for providing catheter-directed therapies might be lower because the percutaneous treatment might have a lower bleeding risk than systemic thrombolysis. A critical review and interpretation of available literature and ongoing RCTs will help reach a consensus for these thresholds.

We propose an approach for producing practical, useful, and consensus risk classification for clinicians and researchers. We will bring together a consensus group that will include representatives of major scientific societies leading the world in promoting and supporting clinical and scientific PE research. We will ensure patient partner participation during the process. To obtain consensus on important issues/questions, which include but are not limited to those highlighted above, we plan to use a modified Delphi method.

At an initial face-to-face meeting, we will discuss a proposed methodology for producing therapy-stratified risk classification for guiding acute PE management recommendations. Through an iterative process, we will develop and rank a list of key issues and questions related to acute PE therapy. We will use virtual meetings to conduct sequential rounds addressing the key questions with open discussion of results.

### Targeting the initial investigation and management in cases of acute pulmonary embolism [^116VPpG9]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Symptomatic pulmonary embolism has a > 10% mortality rate in the early stages if left untreated. Patients presenting with the symptom complex including pleuritic chest pain, dyspnoea, haemoptysis, and evidence of venous thromboembolic disease may warrant investigation. A serum d-dimer measurement has high sensitivity and low specificity, and thus is useful for ruling out PE as a cause of these symptoms if the diagnosis is unlikely. A CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is both sensitive and specific and is thus ideal for the definitive diagnosis of PE. CTPA is limited by a lack of resources and the high dose of radiation required for this test.

The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline on venous thromboembolic diseases (published June 2012) advises the use of a 2-level Well's score to determine which of these diagnostic tests is required. A low score (unlikely PE) should be investigated with d-dimer first, and CTPA in the event of a positive d-dimer. A high score (likely PE) should be investigated with a CTPA as soon as possible. In either case, if a CTPA is indicated but has been delayed, an interim therapeutic dose of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) should be given.

Close adherence to this guideline is important for quality of care for several reasons:

- **Patients with likely PE who have an inappropriate d-dimer test**: Will delay treatment with LMWH significantly. Urgent blood tests can take more than one hour from deciding to take the sample to having the result.
- **Efficient ruling out of PE in patients**: Allows for timely investigation of alternative diagnoses.

### Finding an alternative diagnosis does not justify increased use of CT-pulmonary angiography [^115hXup1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Patients undergoing CTPA in 2008 were significantly younger and less acutely ill compared to those in 2000 and 2005, as evidenced by their higher oxygen saturation and lower respiratory rate. Moreover, patients in 2008 were much less likely to have any risk factors for thrombosis or a prior history of venous thromboembolism. There was an increase in the use of CTPA in patients with chest pain and for "other" indications. The increase in the number of scans ordered was accompanied by a significant drop in the diagnosis of PE from 22.6% in 2000 to 13% in 2010.

We also noted a change in the size and location of pulmonary emboli detected over time: in 2008, a greater proportion of PE was found distal to the lobar arteries in the segmental or subsegmental branches. Since younger patients and women may be more at risk from the potential carcinogenic effects of ionizing radiation, we also examined age and gender in our sample. The number of CTPAs performed on women under the age of 40 years increased significantly over the study period. While 11.8% of all CTPAs performed were on women less than 40 years of age, the presence of a PE in this cohort was lower than in all CTPAs reviewed (9.1% versus 17.7%).

- **Table content removed**: Demographics, signs and symptoms, risk factors, and prior medical history by year for 850 patients undergoing CT angiography were summarized.
- **Table content removed**: CTPA positivity rate and location of pulmonary emboli were analyzed.

Central PE was defined as PE in the pulmonary trunk, right or left main pulmonary arteries, or lobar arteries, while PE in segmental or subsegmental branches was noted separately.

### Clinical validity of a normal pulmonary angiogram in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism — a critical review [^116985vB]. Clinical Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

To determine the validity of a normal pulmonary angiogram in the exclusion of pulmonary embolism (PE), this study focused on the safety of withholding anticoagulant therapy in patients with a normal pulmonary angiogram.

A review of English reports published between 1965 and April 1999 was carried out. Eligible articles described prospective studies involving patients with suspected PE and a normal pulmonary angiogram who remained untreated and were followed up for a minimum of three months. Articles were evaluated by two authors using pre-defined criteria for strength of design. Endpoints consisted of fatal and non-fatal re-thromboembolic events. A sensitivity analysis was performed by removing one study at a time from the overall results and by comparing pre- and post-1990 publications.

Among 1,050 patients in eight articles included in the analysis, re-thromboembolic events were described in 18 patients (1.7%, 95% CI: 1.0–2.7%). These were fatal in three patients (0.3%, 95% CI: 0.02–0.7%). The recurrence rate of PE decreased from 2.9% (95% CI: 1.4–6.8%) before 1990 to 1.1% (95% CI: 0.5–2.2%) after 1990.

The ability to exclude PE by angiography appears to have improved over the years, as indicated by the recurrence rate of PE. The low recurrence rate of PE supports the validity of a normal pulmonary angiogram for the exclusion of PE.

### Derivation and validation of a 4-level clinical pretest probability score for suspected pulmonary embolism to safely decrease imaging testing [^116ZBqZ5]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Another means to limit CTPA overuse is to optimize D-dimer testing. The ADJUST-PE study prospectively confirmed the safety and utility of an age-adjusted cutoff value for patients 50 years or older. However, the effect of the ADJUST-PE strategy on imaging testing rates remains limited (−10.8% or −5.2% in our high-prevalence and moderate-prevalence external validation cohorts, respectively), particularly in young patients.

A further proposal, based on Bayes theorem, is to adjust the D-dimer cutoff value to the pretest probability. This principle was assessed in two recent studies, the YEARS study and PEGeD study. Both studies used 1.0 μg/mL as the D-dimer cutoff value for patients with a low CPP, and both achieved a very low overall rate of false-negative testing. Of note, the PEGeD study was the most recent study and has the lowest PE prevalence (7.4%), with 87% of patients having a low CPP. It should be used with caution in a population of patients with a higher PE prevalence. Indeed, recent external validation data of the PEGeD and YEARS strategies in cohorts of European patients suggest a higher failure rate.

Moreover, since the methods of CPP assessment are different in the PERC strategy from the other strategies aiming to reduce overtesting, it is difficult to combine them. For example, to combine the PERC and PEGeD strategies, the physician may have to first assess implicit clinical probability (gestalt), second, if low, the PERC strategy, and third, if positive, the revised Wells score. The risk of misuse in clinical practice appears to be major and may have a significant impact.

### Derivation and validation of a 4-level clinical pretest probability score for suspected pulmonary embolism to safely decrease imaging testing [^114cys15]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Despite the significant progress of the last decades, diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a clinical challenge. The standard diagnostic strategy, based on clinical probability assessment, D-dimer testing, and computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), is proven to have a very low rate of diagnostic failure. However, there has been a large increase in CTPA for suspected PE, and the exact reasons are likely multifactorial. The signs and symptoms of PE are very common and unspecific; thus, clinicians fear they might be missing a life-threatening condition and are prone to initiate a diagnostic process.

Due to the lack of specificity of D-dimer testing, a large proportion of patients have a false-positive result and require imaging to rule out PE. CTPA is readily available, fast, minimally invasive, and more sensitive than ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scans. A slight increase in PE diagnosis has been observed as a result, but with no clear benefits in terms of outcome, especially PE-related mortality. One explanation is that more CTPAs are performed, increasing the risk of false-positive results or non–clinically relevant diagnoses. Moreover, CTPA exposes patients to risks of allergies, kidney failure, and cumulative radiation-induced cancer.

Several strategies have been proposed to reduce PE overtesting and overdiagnosis. These strategies have proved satisfactory in terms of safety and efficacy, but they are based on different methods of assessing clinical pretest probability (CPP), such as the Wells or revised Geneva score.

### Ten years of imaging for pulmonary embolism: Too many scans or the tip of an iceberg [^113nthvT]. Clinical Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

To examine the number and nature of investigations performed for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) in a large teaching hospital, and the change in incidence and severity of PE over a decade, a retrospective study was conducted. All patients investigated for suspected PE using computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or lung scintigraphy during the 10 years leading up to March 2012 were identified, and their records were reviewed. In the final year, all reportedly positive CTPA cases were reviewed, and PE severity was calculated for comparison with similar historical data.

From 2002 to 2012, the total annual investigations for suspected acute PE increased by 163%, from 805 to 2121. CTPA investigations increased by 325%, from 475 to 2019. The detection of PE increased by 121%, from 193 to 426 per annum, with a stable distribution of severity scores. The positive scan rate decreased from 24% to 20%. The mean age of patients being investigated for PE increased from 56 to 63 years.

Increased detection of PE is not due to a disproportionate increase in small PEs but to increased detection of PE of all severities. This finding supports the hypothesis that PE is more common in the general population than previously appreciated, which may represent an iceberg phenomenon of previously undetected disease.

### Failure rate of the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria rule for adults 35 years or younger: Findings from the RIETE registry [^116yPVPC]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

To address the potential overuse of CTPA and the subsequent overdiagnosis of PE, particularly in younger patients, a clinical decision rule, the pulmonary embolism rule‐out criteria (PERC) rule, has been developed to help rule out PE without additional testing in patients under 50 years with a low PE pretest probability by clinical gestalt or Wells score. This approach avoids unnecessary D‐dimer testing and pulmonary imaging. Our recent study using data from the Registro Informatizado de la Enfermedad Tromboembólica (RIETE) Registry demonstrated that the PERC rule had a low missed PE rate of 0.7%.

Age is a crucial risk factor for PE, with an incidence 10 times lower in adults aged 18–35 years than in those over 65 years. Despite these differences, CTPA rates are similar between younger and older patients, resulting in a diagnostic yield 5.6 and 7.6 times lower in younger male and female patients, respectively. According to a recent study in the United States, 21% of CTPAs were performed on women under 45 years. Young women are at higher risk of overtesting due to their greater lifetime risk of radiation‐induced breast cancer, estimated at 0.4% for 20‐year‐old female patients. Given the lower PE prevalence and increased radiation risk in young patients, the PERC‐35 rule, a modification of the original PERC rule, was specifically developed for patients aged 35 years and younger. This modification of the original PERC rule substitutes fever for heart rate, as tachycardia failed to meet the thresholds required by the creators of the rule to be retained as a final PE predictor.

### Computed tomography pulmonary angiography ventilation-perfusion lung scanning for diagnosing pulmonary embolism during pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11533pir]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

- **Search strategy**:
	- For this meta-analysis, we conducted a search for all relevant full publications in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library databases. We also searched EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library databases for relevant meeting abstracts. The complete search strategy is detailed in Online Supplementary Appendix A.

- **Selection of studies**:
	- Search results were combined and duplicates were removed. Studies were screened for relevance by two independent reviewers (CT and LvdP) following a specific three-step program and applying Covidence software. Disagreements were resolved by a third investigator (FK) by majority rule. The first and second steps consisted of title and abstract screening followed by full-text screening for the remaining articles. The final selection of the studies to include in the meta-analysis was based on an assessment of relevance and study quality.

	- The assessment of relevance was based on the following criteria:
	(i) prospective patient inclusion,
	(ii) inclusion of consecutive patients,
	(iii) reported rate of non-diagnostic test results, and
	(iv) reported incidence of PE at baseline.

	- The assessment of bias was evaluated in accordance with the PRISMA criteria:
	(i) pre-specified study protocol,
	(ii) clear description of inclusion and exclusion criteria,
	(iii) inclusion of consecutive patients,
	(iv) objective diagnosis of PE,
	(v) reported losses to follow-up,
	(vi) clear distinction between pregnant and post-partum patients, and
	(vii) assessment of the primary endpoints in all patients.

### Finding an alternative diagnosis does not justify increased use of CT-pulmonary angiography [^114bykgq]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Accepted recommendations for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) continue to emphasize pre-test probability to guide the choice of testing, and the positive predictive value of CT-pulmonary angiography (CTPA) remains dependent on the pre-test probability of PE. We used documentation of pre-test probability in patients' medical records as a surrogate for assignment of pre-test probability by any means — subjective or objective. It is possible that assessment of pre-test probability was performed by physicians prior to CTPA, but not specifically recorded. However, if this were the case, such assessment of pre-test probability likely occurred in a rather small minority of patients for the following two reasons:

- **D-dimer measurement and anticoagulation**: D-dimer was only measured in 20% of all patients with a low or intermediate pre-test probability of PE. Additionally, only 1 in 5 patients in the high pre-test probability category received anticoagulation while awaiting confirmation of PE with a CTPA.

Our study was designed to investigate the rates and indications for the use of CTPA in clinical practice and therefore only includes patients undergoing CTPA. It is possible that patients presented with low risk for PE were appropriately screened and did not undergo CTPA. We believe that such a number is small, as our data reveal that younger patients with fewer risk factors for PE were undergoing CTPA.

### Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for the detection of pulmonary embolism (PE) among trauma patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115PCAQT]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is a standard imaging technique employed for the detection of pulmonary embolism (PE). This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to examine the prevalence of PE among trauma patients undergoing CTPA.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive search across PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science yielded 13 studies encompassing 5,570 individuals, conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline. Studies that used CTPA for the detection of PE among trauma patients were selected. This resulted in an evaluation of prevalence, trauma types, clinical manifestations, radiological findings, and mortality rates of PE among trauma patients undergoing CTPA.

- **Results**: The overall prevalence of PE among trauma patients undergoing CTPA was 18% (95% CI = 13–24%). After pooling the existing data, femur fractures were determined to be the most prevalent trauma type (12%). The most prevalent clinical manifestations of PE among trauma patients included shortness of breath, chest pain, and altered vital signs. Radiological findings encompassed various pulmonary abnormalities, such as opacity, ground-glass opacities, and pleural effusions. Mortality rates of PE among trauma patients ranged from 0% to 29.4% across the included studies.

- **Conclusion**: This study provides comprehensive insights into the prevalence, clinical manifestations, radiological findings, and mortality of PE among trauma patients undergoing CTPA.

### Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for the detection of pulmonary embolism (PE) among trauma patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113NLhgw]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Our systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrate CTPA's crucial significance in identifying PE in trauma patients, highlighting its high sensitivity and specificity. Despite its effectiveness, the diversity in PE frequency among trauma patients and the accompanying death rates highlight the challenges of identifying and treating PE in this group. The limits of D-dimer testing and clinical prediction guidelines in the trauma population, together with the confounding effects of trauma, demand a careful approach to diagnosing PE.

This study emphasizes the importance of CTPA in traumatic situations to improve diagnosis and treatment, weighing the advantages of early and accurate PE diagnosis against the hazards and costs of CTPA. According to our findings, a lower threshold for CTPA is recommended in patients with lower extremity or spine fractures. Future research should aim to precisely demonstrate the differences between trauma-related and other types of PE development and subsequently refine diagnostic strategies and modify guidelines specified for trauma patients.

### Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for the detection of pulmonary embolism (PE) among trauma patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113tcSXs]. Emergency Radiology (2024). High credibility.

Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has a sensitivity of 96–100% and a specificity of 89–98% in diagnosing probable pulmonary embolism (PE). CTPA offers several significant benefits contributing to its general acceptance. The main advantages of this procedure are its accessibility, minimally invasive nature, and rapid imaging time. CTPA's field of view extends beyond just the pulmonary arteries, allowing visualization of various causes of shortness of breath and chest pain, including musculoskeletal injuries, pneumonia, pericardial abnormalities, and vascular pathologies.

Moreover, if a CTPA is normal in patients with low or intermediate clinical likelihood, the diagnosis of PE can be excluded without further testing.

- **Benefits and issues**: Stepping outside of its benefits, it is important to consider that excessive testing for PE is a significant health issue, particularly at university hospitals. At one center, if the Revised Geneva Score was used, an estimated 9.84% of CTPA could have been avoided. Although improvements in procedures and techniques can optimize diagnostic accuracy while reducing radiation exposure, the primary issue associated with utilizing CT scans is the potential danger of cancer due to ionizing radiation, particularly in young female patients or patients frequently seen for recurrent chest pain. Nonetheless, Woo et al. demonstrated a notable benefit-to-risk ratio of CTPA by considering the mean lifetime attributable risk of cancer death.

Furthermore, CTPA is conducted using intravenous contrast agents, which can lead to contrast-induced nephropathy. However, this condition is much less common than previously thought, though it can rarely occur.

### Performance of 4 clinical decision rules in the diagnostic management of acute pulmonary embolism: a prospective cohort study [^116ZX9Dd]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Several clinical decision rules (CDRs) are available to exclude acute pulmonary embolism (PE), but they have not been directly compared.

- **Objective**: To directly compare the performance of 4 CDRs (Wells rule, revised Geneva score, simplified Wells rule, and simplified revised Geneva score) in combination with d-dimer testing to exclude PE.

- **Design**: Prospective cohort study.

- **Setting**: 7 hospitals in the Netherlands.

- **Patients**: 807 consecutive patients with suspected acute PE.

- **Intervention**: The clinical probability of PE was assessed by using a computer program that calculated all CDRs and indicated the next diagnostic step. Results of the CDRs and d-dimer tests guided clinical care.

- **Measurements**: Results of the CDRs were compared with the prevalence of PE identified by computed tomography or venous thromboembolism at 3-month follow-up.

- **Results**: Prevalence of PE was 23%. The proportion of patients categorized as PE-unlikely ranged from 62% (simplified Wells rule) to 72% (Wells rule). Combined with a normal d-dimer result, the CDRs excluded PE in 22% to 24% of patients. The total failure rates of the CDR and d-dimer combinations were similar (1 failure, 0.5% to 0.6% [upper-limit 95% CI, 2.9% to 3.1%]). Although 30% of patients had discordant CDR outcomes, PE was not detected in any patient with discordant CDRs and a normal d-dimer result.

- **Limitation**: Management was based on a combination of decision rules and d-dimer testing rather than only 1 CDR combined with d-dimer testing.

- **Conclusion**: All 4 CDRs show similar performance for exclusion of acute PE in combination with d-dimer testing.

### Pulmonary embolism: Care standards in 2018 [^113cidmW]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. The clinical presentation can be diverse, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion regarding the diagnosis.

Evaluation should include a detailed history of possible risk factors, a physical examination, and laboratory tests that support the diagnosis and help risk-stratify patients. Finally, a dedicated imaging study should be performed to make a definitive diagnosis. Decisions regarding short-term, immediate treatment are dictated by the PE risk category. While the treatment of low and high-risk PE is relatively straightforward, treating moderate risk PE is challenging since aggressive treatment is not devoid of potential harm.

This review focuses on the acute and chronic treatment of PE. We present risk stratification, guidance as to treatment choice, and insights into chronic treatment with available anticoagulants.

### Safety of ruling out acute pulmonary embolism by normal computed tomography pulmonary angiography in patients with an indication for computed tomography: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1156t4bK]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

Several outcome studies have ruled out acute pulmonary embolism (PE) by normal computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). We performed a meta-analysis to determine the safety of this strategy in a specific group of patients with a strict indication for CTPA, characterized by a 'likely' or 'high' clinical probability for PE, an elevated D-dimer concentration, or both.

- **Methods**: Studies that ruled out PE by normal CTPA, with or without subsequent normal bilateral compression ultrasonography (CUS), in patients with a strict indication for CTPA, were searched for in Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane dataset. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of (fatal) venous thromboembolism (VTE) in a 3-month follow-up period.

- **Results**: Three studies were identified that excluded PE by CTPA alone (2020 patients), and three studies that performed additional CUS of the legs after normal CTPA (1069 patients). The pooled incidence of VTE at 3 months was 1.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8–1.8] based on a normal CTPA result as a sole test, and 1.1% (95% CI 0.6–2.0) based on normal CTPA and negative CUS findings. This resulted in negative predictive values of 98.8% (95% CI 98.2–99.2) and 98.9% (95% CI 98.0–99.4), respectively. These values compare favorably with the VTE failure rate after normal pulmonary angiography (1.7%, 95% CI 1.0–2.7). The risk of fatal PE did not differ between the diagnostic strategies (0.6% vs. 0.5%).

- **Conclusion**: A normal CTPA result alone can safely exclude PE in all patients who require CTPA to rule out this disease.

### Pulmonary embolism during pregnancy: A 17-year single-center retrospective MDCT pulmonary angiography study [^112GDcRS]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

In many hospitals worldwide, including ours, CTPA has become the first-line modality to exclude acute PE in pregnant women, despite guidelines advocating V/Q scanning when available. V/Q scanning following a normal chest X-ray remains a valid approach but is often used as a second-line test when CTPA is inconclusive or contraindicated, such as in patients with renal impairment or intolerance to iodinated contrast agents. Only 9 (3.9%) patients in our cohort underwent V/Q scanning.

There are multiple reasons for the predominance of CTPA: the immediate and widespread availability, the fast acquisition time, the high accuracy with direct visualization of vascular emboli, and the ability to provide alternative diagnoses. This latter point is critical and well reflected in our present study cohort, where CTPA revealed alternative diagnoses four times more often than the presence of PE. In a multicenter study including 512 pregnant women who underwent CTPA, van Strijen et al. found alternative diagnoses in 25% of patients, similar to our study, consisting mostly of pneumonia. In these patients, a chest X-ray, which is usually performed before V/Q scanning, would have been abnormal, thus casting doubt on the added value of V/Q scanning. Indeed, according to the most recent European guidelines, V/Q scanning is generally not performed in such patients.

Radiation risk is a continuing concern, especially in the pregnant population, given the radiation sensitivity of both the fetus and the maternal breast. Since CTPA delivers a slightly lesser dose to the patient, its use is often preferred.

### How I diagnose acute pulmonary embolism [^117Jd6ps]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is frequently considered in patients presenting to the emergency department or when hospitalized. Since symptoms are non-specific and the consequences of anticoagulant treatment are considerable, objective tests to either establish or refute the diagnosis have become a standard of care.

Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA), which has replaced pulmonary angiography as the first-line imaging test, is associated with radiation exposure and several complications resulting from contrast dye administration, including overdiagnosis. Importantly, CTPA can be avoided in 20% to 30% of patients who present with a first or recurrent episode of clinically suspected acute PE by using a standardized algorithm. This algorithm should always include a clinical decision rule to assess the likelihood that PE is present, followed by a D-dimer blood test and/or CTPA.

The aim of this review is to provide clinicians with this practical diagnostic management approach using evidence from the literature.

### Comparison of international guideline recommendations for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^112kKbjQ]. The Lancet Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is one of the leading causes of death due to cardiovascular disease. Timely diagnosis is crucial but challenging, as the clinical presentation of pulmonary embolism is unspecific and easily mistaken for other common medical emergencies. Clinical prediction rules and D-dimer measurement allow stratification of patients into groups of expected prevalence and are key elements in the adequate selection of patients for diagnostic imaging. However, the strengths and weaknesses of the multiple proposed prediction rules, when to measure D-dimer, and which cutoff to apply might be elusive to a significant proportion of physicians.

Thirteen international guidelines authored by medical societies or expert author groups provide recommendations on facets of the diagnostic investigations in suspected pulmonary embolism, some of which are hallmarked by pronounced heterogeneity. This review summarizes key recommendations of each guideline, considers the most recent evidence on the topic, compares guideline recommendations on each facet of the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, and provides a synthesis on the most common recommendations.

### Finding an alternative diagnosis does not justify increased use of CT-pulmonary angiography [^115SDy5B]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

From the year 2000 to 2010, the total number of CTPA performed at our center increased exponentially, although the percentage of scans positive for PE declined. This increase in CTPA was not justified by finding an alternative diagnosis on CTPA that explains the patients' symptoms. Indeed, our data indicate that CTPA rarely reveals a previously unknown or new finding, especially in those with low and intermediate risk for PE. CTPA provided an alternate diagnosis, defined as one that was not previously known or evident on chest radiograph, in only 7.6% of all non-PE CTPA. Additionally, this number would drop to 3.2% had the published guidelines for the investigation of suspected PE been followed, that is, in those with low or intermediate pre-test probability and a negative D-dimer.

We also found that CTPAs were being performed in younger patients even in the absence of symptoms and identifiable PE risk factors, further negating the argument of discovering an alternative pathological diagnosis. Finally, the increase in the number of CTPA corresponds neither to the decrease in the number of V/Q scans nor to the increase in the number of ED visits or hospital admissions.

### Improving the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the emergency department [^114ZHCnB]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) in the emergency department is challenging due to the lack of clinical diagnostic criteria and imperfect investigations. The presenting symptoms are common and non-specific, varying from chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, and hemoptysis, to syncope and cardiac arrest. There is a high false positive rate with non-invasive testing, like the d-dimer test, but relatively significant potential adverse events, such as radiation and contrast-associated complications, with more invasive testing like the Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA).

Various scoring systems exist to limit unnecessary imaging for those identified as having a low pre-test probability of pulmonary embolism, without increasing the risk of missing the potentially life-threatening diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Using a combination of the Wells score and either a d-dimer (if PERC positive) or no testing (if PERC negative) can reduce the need for imaging. These scoring systems are particularly useful for junior doctors who may lack clinical experience. The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria (PERC) has been validated for use within the emergency department. Within the emergency departments where this project was undertaken, there were no specific guidelines that junior doctors were required to follow, although discussion with senior clinicians prior to requesting a d-dimer or imaging was encouraged.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines describe proposed best standards that should be met when considering the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.

### Patient-level, institutional, and temporal variations in use of imaging modalities to confirm pulmonary embolism [^115Vb2yP]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

The choice of imaging modality for diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE) can be influenced by provider, patient or hospital characteristics, or over time. However, little is known about the choice of diagnostic modalities in practice. The aim of this study was to evaluate the variations in the use of imaging modalities for patients with acute PE.

- **Methods**: Using data from Registro Informatizado Enfermedad TromboEmbolica (RIETE), a prospective international registry of patients with venous thromboembolism (March 2001-January 2019), we explored the imaging modalities used in patients with acute PE. The imaging modalities included computed tomography pulmonary angiography, ventilation/perfusion scanning, pulmonary angiography, a combination of these tests, or PE signs and symptoms plus imaging-confirmed proximal deep vein thrombosis but no chest imaging.

- **Results**: Among 38,025 patients with confirmed PE (53.1% female, age: 67.3 ± 17 years), computed tomography pulmonary angiography was the dominant modality for diagnosis in all RIETE enrollees (78.2% [99% CI, 77.6–78.7%]), including pregnant patients (58.9% [99% CI, 47.7%-69.4%]) and patients with severe renal insufficiency (62.5% [99% CI, 59.9–65.0%]). A greater proportion of patients underwent ventilation/perfusion scanning in larger hospitals compared with smaller hospitals (13.1% versus 7.3%, P < 0.001). The use of computed tomography pulmonary angiography varied between 13.3% and 98.3% across different countries, and its use increased over time (46.5% in 2002 to 91.7% in 2018, P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: This study highlights the significant variations in the use of imaging modalities to confirm pulmonary embolism across different settings and over time.

### Finding an alternative diagnosis does not justify increased use of CT-pulmonary angiography [^114e3PW6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In conclusion, our data indicate that the search for an alternate radiologic diagnosis does not justify what appears to be an indiscriminate use of CT-pulmonary angiography (CTPA). CTPA is increasingly used as the first and only diagnostic test for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), and the frequency of positive CTPAs has declined significantly over time, with younger and healthier patients being tested.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® suspected pulmonary embolism: 2022 update [^115yzD9T]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a common and important clinical condition that cannot be accurately diagnosed based on signs, symptoms, and history alone. The diagnosis of PE has been facilitated by technical advancements and multidetector CT pulmonary angiography, which is the major diagnostic modality currently used. Ventilation and perfusion scans remain largely accurate and useful in certain settings. MR angiography can be useful in some clinical scenarios, and lower-extremity ultrasound can substitute by demonstrating deep vein thrombosis; however, if negative, further studies to exclude PE are indicated.

In all cases, correlation with the clinical status, particularly with risk factors, improves not only the accuracy of diagnostic imaging but also overall utilization. Other diagnostic tests have limited roles. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel.

The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles, such as the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available.

### Could the YEARS algorithm be used to exclude pulmonary embolism during pregnancy? Data from the CT-PE-pregnancy study [^114bzM4d]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Low credibility.

The recently proposed YEARS algorithm has been shown to safely exclude pulmonary embolism (PE) and reduce the use of computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) among pregnant women with suspected PE. Our aim was to externally validate this finding.

- **Methods**: We performed a post hoc analysis of a prospective management outcome study for PE diagnosis in pregnant women. PE was diagnosed with an algorithm that combined the revised Geneva score, D-dimer testing, bilateral lower-limb compression ultrasonography, and CTPA. All women had a 3-month follow-up. All of the items necessary to use the YEARS algorithm were prospectively collected at the time of the study.

- **Results**: Of the 395 women included in the original study, 371 were available for the present analysis. The PE prevalence was 6.5%. Ninety-one women had no YEARS items, and 280 had one or more items. When the YEARS items were combined with D-dimer levels (< 1000 ng/mL in women with no items, and < 500 ng/mL in women with one or more items), 77 women (21%) met the criteria for PE exclusion and would not have undergone CTPA as per the YEARS algorithm. None of these 77 women had PE diagnosed during the initial work-up or 3-month follow-up, resulting in a failure rate of 0/77 (95% confidence interval 0.0–3.9).

- **Conclusion**: In our study, application of the YEARS algorithm would have resulted in the safe exclusion of PE in one of five pregnant women without the need for radiation exposure, further supporting the use of the algorithm in this population.

### Computed tomography pulmonary angiography as a single imaging test to rule out pulmonary embolism [^112F7Yt1]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The aim is to review the evidence on the diagnostic value of computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) as a single test to rule out acute pulmonary embolism by focusing on the most recent literature and potential alternative and additional imaging modalities or diagnostic strategies.

Clinical outcome studies have demonstrated that, using algorithms with sequential diagnostic tests, pulmonary embolism can be safely ruled out in patients with a clinical probability indicating pulmonary embolism to be unlikely and a normal D-dimer test result. This obviates the need for additional radiological imaging tests in around one-third of patients. CTPA has been shown to have a high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Several emerging tests with potential diagnostic or other advantages over CTPA need further validation before they can be implemented in routine clinical care.

CTPA is the imaging test of first choice. The presence or absence of pulmonary embolism can be determined with sufficient certainty without the need for additional imaging tests following a negative CTPA. Compression ultrasonography and ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy are reserved for patients with concomitant symptomatic deep vein thrombosis or a stringent contraindication for CTPA, respectively. Currently, magnetic resonance pulmonary angiography is not a suitable alternative for CTPA.

### External validation of the YEARS diagnostic algorithm for suspected pulmonary embolism [^112M8Ynf]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

Validated diagnostic algorithms are used to manage patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). The recently published YEARS study proposed a simplified diagnostic strategy to reduce the use of computed tomography pulmonary angiography.

- **Objectives**: To externally validate this strategy in an independent cohort.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from three previous prospective cohort studies of outpatients with suspected PE. We retrospectively applied the YEARS algorithm. The three YEARS clinical criteria are: clinical signs of deep vein thrombosis, hemoptysis, and PE as the most likely diagnosis. If zero YEARS criteria are met, a D-dimer < 1000 ng/mL will rule out PE. If ≥ 1 YEARS criteria are met, a D-dimer < 500 ng/mL will rule out PE.

- **Results**: Of the 3314 patients, 731 (22.1%) had PE. Applying the YEARS diagnostic algorithm, 1423 (42.9%) patients could have had PE ruled out without imaging. Of these patients, 17 (1.2%; 95% confidence interval 0.8–1.9) were diagnosed with PE at initial testing. All 17 had no YEARS item and a D-dimer < 1000 ng/mL. All 17 had a D-dimer level above their age-adjusted cutoff. Among the 272 patients with no YEARS criteria and a D-dimer < 1000 ng/mL but above their age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff, PE was diagnosed in 6.3% (17/272; 95% confidence interval 3.9–9.8).

- **Conclusion**: We provide external validation of the YEARS diagnostic algorithm in an independent cohort. The rule appears to safely exclude PE. However, caution is required in patients with no YEARS item and a D-dimer < 1000 ng/mL but above their age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff.

### Finding an alternative diagnosis does not justify increased use of CT-pulmonary angiography [^117XhPcx]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the preferred method to confirm or exclude a PE. However, the non-selective use of CTPA has several disadvantages. These include long-term risks of exposure to high doses of radiation and a small but definite risk of kidney injury due to intravenous contrast. Moreover, CTPA is an expensive test and often leaves behind a trail of incidental findings of indeterminate implication that further increase healthcare costs.

Even with CTPA's technological advances, easy availability, and ever shorter scan times, the assessment of clinical pre-test probability remains central to the diagnosis of PE and ideally should influence the initial choice of diagnostic testing. However, it remains unclear how frequently pre-test probability algorithms are followed in daily clinical practice. Furthermore, while the number of CTPAs has increased dramatically, the majority of CTPAs do not show the presence of PE.

The increase in the use of CTPA is often justified by the discovery of hitherto unknown pathological etiologies; however, a review of the literature indicates that this has not been rigorously examined. In this study, we examined the patterns of CTPA use over an eleven-year period at a single center and assessed whether the use of CTPA was justified in those with low or intermediate pre-test probability by the finding of an alternative diagnosis that might have explained the patient's symptoms.

### Pecss: Pulmonary embolism comprehensive screening score to safely rule out pulmonary embolism among suspected patients presenting to emergency department [^116KXK4E]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Due to the difficulties of PE diagnosis in the early clinical stage and emergency medical setting, physicians often rely on excessive CTPA use to reduce the misdiagnosis rate of PE, especially for those with pulmonary artery embolism or multiple pulmonary arteriole embolism, which could lead to poor prognosis and a high risk of death. To rule out PE among patients presenting to the emergency department, the PERC rule required eight objective criteria, including age (less than 50 years old), medical history, and several empirical indicators of clinical signs and symptoms. However, with the aging population and potential assessment bias introduced by attending physicians of various clinical experiences in PE diagnosis, the application of the PERC rule in emergency medical settings is relatively limited.

In this investigation, we developed and validated an objective and easy-to-use scoring system to safely rule out PE among patients presenting to the emergency department. The newly proposed Pulmonary Embolism Comprehensive Screening Score (PECSS) combined important clinical predictors with indicators in the Wells score and achieved excellent performances across all PE severity grades. Particularly, we found that patients with the following characteristics were at increased risk for PE:

- **Demographic and clinical features**: Older than 65 years, experiencing anhelation, experiencing less pain
- **Vital signs**: Abnormal blood pressure, critical condition upon admission
- **Laboratory indicators**:
	- **Increased levels**: Pro-BNP, CRP, UA, WBC, NEUT, MONO, ALT
	- **Decreased levels**: HGB, ALB, creatinine

Through a comprehensive grid searching algorithm, PECSS identified seven clinical predictors (anhelation and abnormal blood pressure)…

### Perform: Pulmonary embolism risk score for mortality in computed tomographic pulmonary angiography-confirmed patients [^111aH57c]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: According to the diagnosis strategy of "2019 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of acute PE developed in collaboration with the European Respiratory Society (ERS)", we retrospectively analyzed patients who were hospitalized at the Minhang Hospital, affiliated with Fudan University, from January 2010 to December 2017. We used ICD discharge diagnosis codes, including I26.0 or I26.9, to identify patients with PE. Clinical electronic medical records, laboratory findings, nursing records, and radiological reports for all patients with PE were reviewed. All patients received standardized treatment. Only patients with PE confirmed by CTPA were considered for inclusion in the study. Detailed admission data, including demographic information, past medical history, signs and symptoms, laboratory test results, and imaging reports, of each patient were collected.

- **Study design**: Using a computer-generated randomization list, the study cohorts were randomly divided into two groups (the proportion was approximately 2:1). One group was used to construct the model (training cohort, n = 339) while the other group was used to validate the model (validation cohort, n = 170). The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality. The secondary endpoints were the time to recovery in 30 days and mortality in 15 days. The time to recovery was defined by discharge from the hospital. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the Minhang Hospital.
