## Question

An cardiomyopathy cause elevated bilirubin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether cardiomyopathy can cause elevated bilirubin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology linking cardiac disease to liver dysfunction. Then, I should verify the specific mechanisms in cardiomyopathy that raise bilirubin. Next, I will review the strength of evidence and typical laboratory patterns. After that, I need to consider prognostic implications and how bilirubin fractionation helps distinguish mechanisms. Finally, I should outline practical evaluation and management steps, including when to consider advanced therapies or dual-organ strategies [^1134wYBy] [^116JaEWE].

> Let me first confirm the conceptual framework: cardiomyopathy can impair forward flow and raise right-sided filling pressures, which in turn transmits to the hepatic veins and sinusoids, producing congestive hepatopathy; in acute decompensation, hypoperfusion can cause ischemic hepatitis, both of which can elevate bilirubin, so the answer is yes, cardiomyopathy can cause hyperbilirubinemia via hemodynamic liver injury rather than primary hepatocellular disease [^1134wYBy] [^112UMUww].

> I will now examine the mechanism of congestive hepatopathy in chronic cardiomyopathy; chronically elevated central venous pressure from right heart failure leads to sinusoidal dilation, centrilobular congestion, impaired bile secretion, and cholestasis with a pattern of elevated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase, while transaminases are often normal or only mildly elevated, and over time this can progress to fibrosis and cardiac cirrhosis if congestion persists [^1134wYBy] [^112UMUww] [^1152pkqY].

> Wait, let me verify the acute mechanism; in acute decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock, low cardiac output and hepatic hypoperfusion cause ischemic hepatitis, which typically shows dramatic AST and ALT elevations with bilirubin rising later as cholestasis and synthetic dysfunction emerge, and this pattern carries high short-term mortality, underscoring bilirubin as a marker of severity rather than a primary hepatic disease [^11145Hc2] [^115sSN7i] [^115q8UTN].

> Next, I should review the evidence base; large heart failure cohorts consistently show bilirubin elevation in a substantial subset and identify bilirubin as the strongest prognostic liver test, with higher bilirubin independently predicting cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, and all-cause mortality even after adjustment for NT-proBNP and troponin, reinforcing bilirubin as a marker of right-sided congestion and low output physiology [^113Psth2] [^116E1GbF] [^114t1e2Y].

> Hold on, I should verify the laboratory pattern to avoid misclassification; in chronic cardiomyopathy with congestion, bilirubin and cholestatic enzymes predominate, whereas in acute low-output states, transaminases surge early and bilirubin rises later, so fractionating bilirubin into direct and indirect components helps distinguish predominant cholestasis from hemolysis or impaired conjugation, and an elevated direct fraction supports cardiogenic cholestasis in the right clinical context [^1134wYBy] [^113iG5vj] [^114sDDx7].

> I need to ensure I consider prognostic thresholds; in acute heart failure cohorts, even modest bilirubin elevations associate with worse short-term outcomes, and in chronic HFrEF, bilirubin in the highest tertile confers markedly higher risks of death and heart failure events, with a near-linear relationship across the spectrum, which aligns with bilirubin reflecting central venous pressures and right-sided hemodynamics [^111guy67] [^116E1GbF] [^114FMD1J].

> Let me think about how this informs management; the treatment target is to decompress the liver by optimizing cardiac function and unloading congestion with guideline-directed heart failure therapy, and in advanced cases, persistent hyperbilirubinemia may signal irreversible hepatic injury that can contraindicate isolated heart transplantation, prompting evaluation for combined heart–liver transplantation or mechanical circulatory support strategies per society guidance [^1134wYBy] [^116JaEWE] [^112FSfxH].

> But wait, what if bilirubin is unconjugated; I should double-check for hemolysis or Gilbert syndrome when the indirect fraction predominates, because while mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can be benign, in heart failure even Gilbert physiology may be accentuated by stress or fasting, and distinguishing this from congestive cholestasis avoids misattribution and guides appropriate workup and counseling [^113iG5vj] [^115fqT1w].

> In summary, I should confirm that cardiomyopathy causes elevated bilirubin via two complementary hemodynamic mechanisms: chronic passive congestion with cholestasis and acute hypoperfusion with ischemic hepatitis, both of which are well documented and carry prognostic significance; therefore, new or rising bilirubin in a patient with cardiomyopathy warrants aggressive decongestion, hemodynamic optimization, and consideration of advanced therapies if liver injury is severe or persistent [^1134wYBy] [^112UMUww] [^116E1GbF].

Cardiomyopathy can cause elevated bilirubin, most often due to **congestive hepatopathy** from right-sided heart failure or tricuspid regurgitation [^1134wYBy], which leads to hepatic congestion, impaired bile flow, and cholestasis with elevated bilirubin, ALP, and GGT [^112UMUww]. Acute decompensation can cause **ischemic hepatitis** (shock liver) with marked AST/ALT and bilirubin rises [^11145Hc2] [^115q8UTN]. Elevated bilirubin in cardiomyopathy is a marker of severity and portends worse outcomes, including higher mortality and complications [^116E1GbF] [^114t1e2Y]. Management centers on **optimizing cardiac function and relieving congestion** [^112UMUww]; persistent or severe hepatic dysfunction may require advanced therapies or combined heart–liver transplantation [^116JaEWE].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking cardiomyopathy to elevated bilirubin

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** explain how cardiomyopathy leads to elevated bilirubin:

---

### Congestive hepatopathy (cardiac hepatopathy)

- **Mechanism**: Chronic right-sided heart failure or tricuspid regurgitation elevates central venous pressure, causing passive hepatic congestion, sinusoidal dilation, and impaired bile flow (cholestasis) [^1134wYBy] [^112UMUww].

- **Laboratory pattern**: Predominantly cholestatic with elevated total bilirubin, ALP, and GGT; transaminases are often normal or mildly elevated [^1134wYBy] [^113Fviv2].

- **Histopathology**: Centrilobular congestion, sinusoidal dilation, and centrilobular fibrosis; with progression, cardiac cirrhosis may develop [^1134wYBy] [^112sjg2z].

---

### Ischemic hepatitis (shock liver)

- **Mechanism**: Acute decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock causes hepatic hypoperfusion and ischemic injury, leading to hepatocellular necrosis and impaired bilirubin processing [^11145Hc2] [^115q8UTN].

- **Laboratory pattern**: Marked AST/ALT elevations (> 10× ULN) with concurrent bilirubin rise; lactate dehydrogenase may also be elevated [^11145Hc2] [^115q8UTN].

- **Clinical course**: Rapid improvement with hemodynamic stabilization; persistent bilirubin elevation indicates ongoing congestion or synthetic dysfunction [^11145Hc2] [^114rpxGB].

---

### Drug-induced hepatotoxicity

Certain **cardiomyopathy treatments** (e.g. amiodarone, doxorubicin) can cause hepatocellular injury or cholestasis, contributing to hyperbilirubinemia [^111wokpX] [^1158a4Yc].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the association

Multiple studies and guidelines document the association between cardiomyopathy and elevated bilirubin:

- **DAPA-HF trial**: Baseline bilirubin was elevated in 14% of ambulatory HFrEF patients and independently predicted worse outcomes (CV death or HF hospitalization) even after adjustment for NT-proBNP and troponin T [^116E1GbF] [^114o4WzM].

- **CHARM program**: Elevated bilirubin was the strongest liver test predictor of adverse outcomes in chronic HF [^114t1e2Y].

- **ASCEND-HF**: Abnormal bilirubin was present in 42% of acute HF patients and independently associated with 30-day mortality or HF rehospitalization [^111guy67].

- **AHA scientific statement**: Recognizes congestive hepatopathy as a common complication of right-sided HF, with cholestatic liver tests and bilirubin elevation as key features [^1134wYBy].

---

## Prognostic significance of elevated bilirubin in cardiomyopathy

Elevated bilirubin in cardiomyopathy carries important prognostic implications:

| **Clinical context** | **Prognostic significance** |
|-|-|
| Chronic HF (HFrEF/HFpEF) | - Higher bilirubin independently predicts CV death, HF hospitalization, and all-cause mortality [^116E1GbF] [^114t1e2Y] [^115Nxnnk] |
| Acute HF (ADHF) | - Elevated bilirubin associates with increased 30-day mortality and HF rehospitalization [^111guy67] |
| Cardiogenic shock | - Hyperbilirubinemia reflects multi-organ dysfunction and higher mortality [^115sSN7i] [^114rNton] |
| Mechanical circulatory support | - Persistent bilirubin elevation predicts poor outcomes and may necessitate combined heart–liver transplantation [^115uDjGA] |

---

## Clinical management implications

Management of elevated bilirubin in cardiomyopathy centers on **optimizing cardiac function and relieving congestion**:

- **Treat heart failure**: Use guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), diuretics, and address tricuspid regurgitation when indicated [^113mqf7n].

- **Monitor liver function**: Regularly track bilirubin, ALP, GGT, AST/ALT, INR, and albumin to assess hepatic involvement and response to therapy [^112FSfxH].

- **Advanced therapies**: Persistent hepatic dysfunction despite optimal therapy may require mechanical circulatory support or combined heart–liver transplantation [^116JaEWE].

- **Avoid hepatotoxins**: Minimize or avoid drugs with hepatotoxic potential, especially in acute or chronic hepatic dysfunction [^112FSfxH].

---

## Summary of key points

- **Cardiomyopathy can cause elevated bilirubin**, primarily via congestive hepatopathy and ischemic hepatitis [^1134wYBy] [^11145Hc2].

- **Congestive hepatopathy** presents with cholestatic liver tests (bilirubin, ALP, GGT) and centrilobular congestion on histology [^1134wYBy] [^112UMUww].

- **Ischemic hepatitis** presents with marked AST/ALT and bilirubin elevations in acute decompensation [^11145Hc2] [^115q8UTN].

- **Elevated bilirubin independently predicts worse outcomes** in chronic and acute HF [^116E1GbF] [^111guy67].

- **Management focuses on optimizing cardiac function**, relieving congestion, and considering advanced therapies for persistent hepatic dysfunction [^116JaEWE] [^112UMUww].

Cardiomyopathy can cause elevated bilirubin through **congestive hepatopathy** and **ischemic hepatitis**, with bilirubin serving as a marker of disease severity and prognosis. Management centers on **optimizing cardiac function and relieving congestion**, with advanced therapies considered for persistent hepatic dysfunction [^1134wYBy] [^116E1GbF].

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Cardiomyopathy: Myocardial damage, including acute left ventricular failure can occur with doxorubicin. The risk of cardiomyopathy is proportional to the cumulative exposure with incidences from 1% to 20% for cumulative doses from 300 mg/m to 500 mg/m when doxorubicin is administered every 3 weeks. The risk of cardiomyopathy is further increased with concomitant cardiotoxic therapy. Assess LVEF before and regularly during and after treatment with doxorubicin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Secondary Malignancies: Secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) occur at a higher incidence in patients treated with anthracyclines, including doxorubicin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Severe myelosuppression resulting in serious infection, septic shock, requirement for transfusions, hospitalization, and death may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

2.1 Recommended Dose

Adjuvant Breast Cancer

The recommended dose of doxorubicin is 60 mg/m2administered as an intravenous bolus on day 1 of each 21 day treatment cycle, in combination with cyclophosphamide, for a total of four cycles [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Metastatic Disease, Leukemia, or Lymphoma

The recommended dose of doxorubicin when used as a single agent is 60 to 75 mg/m2intravenously every 21 days.
The recommended dose of doxorubicin, when administered in combination with other chemotherapy drugs, is 40 to 75 mg/m2intravenously every 21 to 28 days.
Consider use of the lower doxorubicin dose in the recommended dose range or longer intervals between cycles for heavily pretreated patients, elderly patients, or obese patients.
Cumulative doses above 550 mg/m2are associated with an increased risk of cardiomyopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

2.2 Dose Modifications

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1134wYBy]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Cardiohepatic syndrome in right heart failure — congestive hepatopathy is described as a misnomer because it generally results from combined hepatic congestion and reduced hepatic perfusion, and over time it can lead to cardiac cirrhosis; the most prominent laboratory abnormalities include markers of cholestasis (elevated bilirubin, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, and alkaline phosphatase) and altered synthetic function (prolonged prothrombin time), which are more common than elevations in transaminases; severity of tricuspid regurgitation is closely associated with liver function abnormalities, markers of cholestasis are independently associated with mortality among patients with heart failure, and hyperbilirubinemia is a risk factor for poor outcomes; in this setting, patients being considered for advanced heart failure therapies such as cardiac transplantation may require a liver biopsy to exclude cirrhosis.

Primary and secondary trial outcomes related to bilirubin level

Incidence rates for the primary and secondary outcomes of the trial were substantially higher in patients in bilirubin T3, compared to T1 (Table 2, Figure 1). The elevated risk associated with higher bilirubin persisted after comprehensive adjustment for other predictors of worse outcomes, including LVEF, NT‐proBNP and troponin T, with a fully adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) in bilirubin T3 versus T1 for the primary outcome of 1.73 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37–2.17, p < 0.001). The aHR for CV death (T3 vs. T1) was 1.52 (1.12–2.07; p = 0.01). Given more patients in the highest bilirubin tertile were male, this analysis was repeated in male patients only, with consistent results (online supplementary Table S2).

Kaplan–Meier curves for each tertile of baseline bilirubin for the primary composite endpoint (A), hospitalization or urgent visit for heart failure (B), death from cardiovascular causes (C), or death from any cause (D).

Analyses using baseline bilirubin concentration as a continuous variable showed an essentially linear relationship between event rates and bilirubin level (Figure 2). For each unit increase in log‐transformed total bilirubin, in adjusted Cox models, the aHR for the primary endpoint was 1.66 (1.39–1.98; p < 0.001); for hospitalization or urgent visit for HF 1.94 (1.56–2.40; p < 0.001); for death from CV causes 1.46 (1.16–1.85; p = 0.001); and for death from any cause 1.33 (1.07–1.64; p = 0.01) (online supplementary Table S3).

### Liver function predicts survival in patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation following cardiovascular surgery [^111LeBuN]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Generally, elevation of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin is considered as a cholestatic pattern. Cholestasis is defined as a decline of bile flow into the duodenum that may be caused by impaired secretion by hepatocytes or obstruction through intra- or extrahepatic bile ducts. Particularly, adverse effects of medications and systemic sepsis may be the underlying mechanism for elevated cholestatic parameters in the present study cohort. As preoperative bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels were in the upper normal range or only slightly elevated in the present study population, significant cholestasis is not suggested to be the sole organic correlate for poor outcome. The commonality of our study population is the severe cardiovascular disease that may itself affect liver function. The pathophysiology of cardiac hepatopathy is, on one hand, impaired arterial perfusion caused by acute heart failure and, on the other hand, passive congestion resulting from an increased central venous pressure due to elevated right ventricular pressure and right-sided heart failure. Mostly, forward and backward failure coexist and aggravate each other in patients with severe heart failure. Furthermore, hepatic derangements are not necessarily caused by primary liver disease, but may be a consequence of severe illness and may represent a surrogate marker of the generalized stress response.

In line with our results, elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin were identified to predict all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, or hospitalization for heart failure in patients with advanced heart failure. Hemodynamic alterations triggered by heart failure were found to be associated with the development of hypoxic hepatitis. Hypoxic hepatitis is a form of hepatic injury following acute arterial hypoxemia, hypoperfusion with consecutive ischemia, and passive congestion of the liver that significantly affects prognosis and the outcome of critically ill patients. It is tempting to speculate that preoperative determination of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels can detect patients with early-stage hepatocardiac disorders who have a reduced hepatic tolerance to intra- and postoperative hemodynamic changes. Our laboratory findings support this hypothesis, as alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are expected to be increased while transaminases are often normal or only slightly elevated in patients with cardiac hepatopathy as long as cardiac output is not severely compromised.

### Idarubicin hydrochloride [^1158a4Yc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiac function should be carefully monitored during treatment in order to minimize the risk of cardiac toxicity of the type described for other anthracycline compounds. The risk of such myocardial toxicity may be higher following concomitant or previous radiation to the mediastinal-pericardial area or in patients with anemia, bone marrow depression, infections, leukemic pericarditis and/or myocarditis, active or dormant cardiovascular disease, previous therapy with other anthracyclines or anthracenediones, and concomitant use of drugs with the ability to suppress cardiac contractility or cardiotoxic drugs (e.g., trastuzumab, cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel). Due to the increased risk of cardiotoxicity, avoid concomitant use of Idarubicin Hydrochloride Injection until the cardiotoxic agent has been discontinued for at least 5 half-lives, and specifically avoid Idarubicin Hydrochloride Injection for up to 7 months after stopping trastuzumab.

While there are no reliable means for predicting congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy induced by anthracyclines is usually associated with a decrease of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from pretreatment baseline values.

Since hepatic and/or renal function impairment can affect the disposition of idarubicin, liver and kidney function should be evaluated with conventional clinical laboratory tests (using serum bilirubin and serum creatinine as indicators) prior to and during treatment. In a number of Phase III clinical trials, treatment was not given if bilirubin and/or creatinine serum levels exceeded 2 mg%. However, in one Phase III trial, patients with bilirubin levels between 2.6 and 5 mg% received the anthracycline with a 50% reduction in dose. Dose reduction of idarubicin should be considered if the bilirubin and/or creatinine levels are above the normal range (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Bilirubin, platelet activation and heart disease: a missing link to cardiovascular protection in Gilbert's syndrome? [^116Kv8iX]. Atherosclerosis (2015). Low credibility.

Gilbert's syndrome (GS) is a relatively common condition, inducing a benign, non-hemolytic, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Gilbert's Syndrome is associated with mutation in the Uridine Glucuronosyl Transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) gene promoter, reducing UGT1A1 activity, which normally conjugates bilirubin allowing its elimination from the blood. Individuals with GS demonstrate mildly elevated plasma antioxidant capacity caused by elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB), reduced thiols and glutathione. Interestingly, the development of, and risk of mortality from, cardiovascular disease is remarkably reduced in GS individuals. An explanation for this protection may be explained by bilirubin's ability to inhibit multiple processes that induce platelet hyper-reactivity and thrombosis, thus far under-appreciated in the literature. Reactive oxygen species are produced continuously via metabolic processes and have the potential to oxidatively modify proteins and lipids within cell membranes, which may encourage the development of thrombosis and CVDs. Oxidative stress induced platelet hyper-reactivity significantly increases the risk of thrombosis, which can potentially lead to tissue infarction. Here, we discuss the possible mechanisms by which increased antioxidant status might influence platelet function and link this to cardiovascular protection in GS. In summary, this is the first article to discuss the possible role of bilirubin as an anti-thrombotic agent, which inhibits platelet activation and potentially, organ infarction, which could contribute to the reduced mortality rate in mildly hyperbilirbinemic individuals.

### Dual-organ transplantation: indications, evaluation, and outcomes for heart-kidney and heart-liver transplantation: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116JaEWE]. Circulation (2023). High credibility.

Evaluation of liver function in HT candidates — liver enzymes and function tests provide prognostic information but require specific caveats. Hepatic function includes hepatic protein synthesis, bilirubin disposition, and energy metabolism, and abnormalities are associated with worse prognosis in patients with HF; it is necessary to distinguish hyperbilirubinemia due to liver disease from disorders that affect bilirubin conjugation, and in FALD, albumin levels may be depressed because of protein-losing enteropathy. In both acute and chronic HF, abnormal liver-related laboratory testing is associated with a worse overall prognosis.

### The cardiohepatic axis in heart failure [^1152pkqY]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of Cardiogenic Liver Disease

RHF is prevalent in patients with end-stage cardiomyopathies and is more frequent in those with nonischemic etiology and/or pulmonary HTN. Liver dysfunction and fibrosis is common in patients with RHF and is associated with worse outcomes. As mentioned in the previous text, the presence of advanced fibrosis and/or cirrhosis can be a contraindication for single-organ heart transplant or LVAD. Thus, accurately diagnosing liver pathology is essential. Although biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis, there is a lack of standard pathologic grading criteria for CLD as compared with other primary liver diseases. Clinicians often rely on clinical factors, imaging findings, and/or biochemical markers to inform the decision for biopsy. However, there is a lack of data to guide liver evaluation in patients with HF.

Biochemical markers

Congestive hepatopathy caused by RHF often produces a cholestatic pattern of livery injury, predominantly reflected by an elevation of serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. This may also be accompanied by a mild elevation in liver enzymes, AST, and ALT. Serum concentrations of bilirubin, AST, and ALT are predictive of mortality in patients with acute and chronic HF. For other chronic liver diseases including chronic hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and MASLD, the AST to platelet ratio index and fibrosis-4 scores have been developed to predict the risk of hepatic fibrosis. These scores include several hematological and biochemical values associated with liver pathology. However, when applied to patients with RHF, there is a poor correlation between these indices and the degree of hepatic disease. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease Excluding INR (MELD-XI) score, which incorporates serum bilirubin, similarly had a weak correlation with liver pathology, r = 0.4, in patients with Fontan. Other potential surrogates of liver dysfunction and fibrosis include hepatically derived factors elevated in patients with RHF, such as bile acids, sCD163, and CXCL12. One of the challenges for the future will be to identify biomarkers that reflect chronic liver remodeling and not just acute congestion.

### Pioglitazone hydrochloride [^114PPyqY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hepatic Effects

There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating pioglitazone therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, pioglitazone should be initiated with caution.

Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of the reference range), pioglitazone treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Pioglitazone should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities.

Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury, and should not be restarted on pioglitazone. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with pioglitazone can be used with caution.

### Γ-glutamyltransferase rather than total bilirubin predicts outcome in chronic heart failure [^116T5UJK]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and total bilirubin (T-Bil) are elevated and of prognostic significance in chronic heart failure (CHF). This study sought to compare these novel cardiovascular risk markers in CHF.

Methods and Results

We evaluated 1,087 ambulatory patients from our heart failure program. Long-term follow-up was available in 1,056 patients. The combined end point was defined as death of any cause or heart transplantation. Prevalence of elevated GGT was 43% in men and 48% in women, that of T-Bil 17% and 8%, respectively. Both variables were significantly correlated with severity of heart failure. GGT and T-Bil were associated with transplant-free survival in bivariate analysis (P values < .001 and .006, respectively). However, GGT (hazard ratio [HR] 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13–1.44; P < .001), but not T-Bil, remained an independent predictor of prognosis in the multivariate model. Also, categorized GGT levels beyond the gender-specific normal ranges were predictive of the combined end point (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.23–1.95). Elevation of both GGT and T-Bil further increased the risk of reaching the end point (HR 2.57, 95% CI 1.74–3.18).

Conclusions

GGT and T-Bil are associated with disease severity in CHF. However, only GGT is independently associated with adverse outcome. Our findings further highlight the clinical importance of GGT in cardiovascular disease.

### Relation of pre-anthracycline serum bilirubin levels to left ventricular ejection fraction after chemotherapy [^112xDsrz]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Myocardial injury because of oxidative stress manifesting through reductions in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) may occur after the administration of anthracycline-based chemotherapy (A-bC). We hypothesized that bilirubin, an effective endogenous antioxidant, may attenuate the reduction in LVEF that sometimes occurs after receipt of A-bC. We identified 751 consecutively treated patients with cancer who underwent a pre-A-bC LVEF measurement, exhibited a serum total bilirubin level < 2 mg/dl, and then received a post-A-bC LVEF assessment because of symptomatology associated with heart failure. Analysis of variance, Tukey's Studentized range test, and chi-square tests were used to evaluate an association between bilirubin and LVEF changes. The LVEF decreased by 10.7 ± 13.7%, 8.9 ± 11.8%, and 7.7 ± 11.5% in group 1 (bilirubin at baseline ≤ 0.5 mg/dl), group 2 (bilirubin 0.6 to 0.8 mg/dl), and group 3 (bilirubin 0.9 to 1.9 mg/dl), respectively. More group 1 patients experienced > 15% decrease in LVEF compared with those in group 3 (p = 0.039). After adjusting for age, coronary artery disease/myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hematocrit, and the use of cardioactive medications, higher precancer treatment bilirubin levels and lesser total anthracycline doses were associated with LVEF preservation (p = 0.047 and 0.011, respectively). In patients treated with anthracyclines who subsequently develop symptoms associated with heart failure, pre-anthracycline treatment serum bilirubin levels inversely correlate with subsequent deterioration in post-cancer treatment LVEF. In conclusion, these results suggest that increased levels of circulating serum total bilirubin, an intrinsic antioxidant, may facilitate preservation of LVEF in patients receiving A-bC for cancer.

### Liver tests and outcomes in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: findings from DAPA-HF [^114o4WzM]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

A baseline measurement of bilirubin was available in 4720 patients (99.5%) and showed a right‐skewed distribution (online supplementary Figure S1); ALP was available in 4729 patients, ALT in 4714, and AST in 4681. Baseline median (IQR) values were: total bilirubin 10 (7–14) μmol/L (1 mg/dl = 17.1 μmol/L for conversion); ALP 76 (62–96) IU/L; ALT 18 (13–24) IU/L; and AST 21 (17–26) IU/L. The proportion of patients with a level above the upper limit of normal was: 661 (14.0%) for bilirubin; 471 (10.0%) for ALP; 393 (8.3%) for ALT; and 368 (7.9%) for AST. A total of 537 patients had either elevated AST or ALT or both, and in 86 patients this was accompanied by a raised bilirubin.

### Pioglitazone (Actos) [^117FFBqh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hepatic Effects

There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking ACTOS, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the ACTOS controlled clinical trial database to date [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating ACTOS therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, ACTOS should be initiated with caution.

Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of the reference range), ACTOS treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. ACTOS should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities.

Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury, and should not be restarted on ACTOS. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with ACTOS can be used with caution.

### Idarubicin hydrochloride (idamycin PFS) [^113Rs6tL]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Cardiac function should be carefully monitored during treatment in order to minimize the risk of cardiac toxicity of the type described for other anthracycline compounds. The risk of such myocardial toxicity may be higher following concomitant or previous radiation to the mediastinal-pericardial area or in patients with anemia, bone marrow depression, infections, leukemic pericarditis and/or myocarditis, active or dormant cardiovascular disease, previous therapy with other anthracyclines or anthracenediones, and concomitant use of drugs with the ability to suppress cardiac contractility or cardiotoxic drugs (e.g., trastuzumab, cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel). Due to the increased risk of cardiotoxicity, avoid concomitant use of IDAMYCIN PFS until the cardiotoxic agent has been discontinued for at least 5 half-lives, and specifically avoid IDAMYCIN PFS for up to 7 months after stopping trastuzumab.

While there are no reliable means for predicting congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy induced by anthracyclines is usually associated with a decrease of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from pretreatment baseline values.

Since hepatic and/or renal function impairment can affect the disposition of idarubicin, liver and kidney function should be evaluated with conventional clinical laboratory tests (using serum bilirubin and serum creatinine as indicators) prior to and during treatment. In a number of Phase III clinical trials, treatment was not given if bilirubin and/or creatinine serum levels exceeded 2 mg%. However, in one Phase III trial, patients with bilirubin levels between 2.6 and 5 mg% received the anthracycline with a 50% reduction in dose. Dose reduction of idarubicin should be considered if the bilirubin and/or creatinine levels are above the normal range. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .)

### Liver tests and outcomes in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: findings from DAPA-HF [^111nTybh]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Definition of elevated liver tests

The upper limits of normal were 35 IU/L for AST and ALT, 1.0 mg/dl for bilirubin, and 120 IU/L for ALP. Given the evidence that bilirubin is the most prognostically important liver test, this was the focus of our analysis of the association with subsequent clinical outcomes, as described in the statistical analysis section below.

Statistical analysis

Patients were grouped by baseline bilirubin measurement into tertiles and baseline characteristics were summarized as means (standard deviations), median (interquartile ranges [IQR]), or percentages. Logistic regression was used to explore associations with elevated bilirubin at baseline, examining candidate variables in a univariable model and those with a p ‐value < 0.2 being added into a stepwise logistic regression model.

Kaplan–Meier estimates and Cox proportional‐hazards models, stratified by diabetes status, and adjusted for treatment‐group assignment and history of HF hospitalization (except for all‐cause death) were used to examine the primary and secondary outcomes across bilirubin tertiles, with further models adjusted for known predictors of risk of HF endpoints (age, sex, race, region, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, LVEF, eGFR, NT‐proBNP [log‐transformed], NYHA class, hypertension, previous stroke, previous myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and HF aetiology). A second adjusted model included the same listed variables and the addition of high‐sensitivity troponin T (log‐transformed). A semi‐parametric proportional‐rates model was used to evaluate recurrent HF hospitalizations and CV death.

### Liver tests and outcomes in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: findings from DAPA-HF [^114FMD1J]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

The interesting question is what aspect of HF pathophysiology is measured by bilirubin? Bilirubin is associated with high central venous/right atrial pressure in patients with HF and this finding raises the possibility that bilirubin provides different information about central haemodynamics than NT‐proBNP, which may be more reflective of left‐ than right‐sided pressures. Because bilirubin is associated with high central venous/right atrial pressure, we anticipated that dapagliflozin would reduce bilirubin as SGLT2 inhibitors have a diuretic action that might alleviate hepatic congestion. However, we did not find this, possibly because the diuretic action of SGLT2 inhibitors is short‐lived and might not have led to a sustained decrease in bilirubin (there were small numbers of bilirubin measurements before 12 months after randomization, therefore early change could not be assessed). Moreover, trials examining haemodynamic measurements have reported inconsistent findings. In a recent placebo‐controlled invasive haemodynamic study, 3 months of treatment with empagliflozin did not reduce right‐sided pressures. Conversely, in a trial in patients with an implanted pulmonary artery pressure sensor, empagliflozin significantly reduced pulmonary artery end‐diastolic pressure after 1 week, with a difference of 1.7 (95% CI 0.3–3.2) mmHg, compared with placebo (p = 0.02), by 12 weeks.

### Voriconazole [^117PbsNi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hepatic Toxicity

In clinical trials, there have been uncommon cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with voriconazole (including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

A higher frequency of liver enzyme elevations was observed in the pediatric population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Hepatic function should be monitored in both adult and pediatric patients.

Measure serum transaminase levels and bilirubin at the initiation of voriconazole therapy and monitor at least weekly for the first month of treatment. Monitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly during continued use if no clinically significant changes are noted. If liver function tests become markedly elevated compared to baseline, voriconazole tablets should be discontinued unless the medical judgment of the benefit/risk of the treatment for the patient justifies continued use [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.2 Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation

Some azoles, including voriconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During clinical development and postmarketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory.

Voriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions, such as:

Congenital or acquired QT prolongation
Cardiomyopathy, in particular when heart failure is present
Sinus bradycardia
Existing symptomatic arrhythmias
Concomitant medicinal product that is known to prolong QT interval [see contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]

Rigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting and during voriconazole therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Bilirubin decreases macrophage cholesterol efflux and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 protein expression [^1145UgBW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Interestingly, patients with GS have significantly reduced incidence of ischemic heart disease 18 and significant delay in developing clinically relevant manifestations of CVD 19 compared with the general population. Furthermore, homozygous carriers of the UGT1A1*28 allele, characterized by the presence of an additional TA repeat in the TATA sequence of the UGT1A1 promoter — (TA) 7 TAA instead of (TA) 6 TAA) 8 — with mildly elevated serum UCB concentrations, also demonstrate a reduced risk of CVD. 8

Elevated serum UCB concentrations are also reported in Gunn rats. 18 Gunn rats inherit a single point mutation in the coding region of the UGT1A1 gene that truncates and inactivates UGT1A1, leading to complete absence of bilirubin glucuronidation capacity. 2, 20 UCB serum concentrations of these animals range between 50 and 200 μmol/L. 21 In line with observations in human GS, hyperbilirubinemia beneficially modulated myocardial function and aortic ejection and imparted ischemic stress resistance in Gunn rats. 22

Although a body of evidence indicates that upper normal (10–17.1 μmol/L) 3 or mildly elevated (17.1–90 μmol/L) 12 plasma bilirubin levels are associated with a reduced risk of CVD, conflicting reports show varying binomial relationships, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 with a recent report suggesting that humans with higher bilirubin levels (12–86 μmol/L) 29 have a risk similar to that of persons with the lowest bilirubin levels (< 7 μmol/L). 29 The studies show a U‐shaped relationship between circulating bilirubin concentrations and risk of ischemic heart disease, suggesting that both lower and higher concentrations of serum bilirubin are associated with an increased risk of CVD. 29, 30 Similarly, a U‐shaped association of total bilirubin levels with all‐cause mortality was also demonstrated. 31, 32 So far, the molecular determinants of this complex bioactivity pattern remain elusive; however, they are most likely explained by the inclusion of patients with underlying hepatic damage, which confounds protective associations. 32

### Liver tests and outcomes in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: findings from DAPA-HF [^117LMEuL]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

DAPA‐HF was a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial in patients with HFrEF, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily, added to standard care. Ethics Committees at each of the 410 participating institutions in 20 countries approved the protocol, all patients provided written informed consent and the study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Study patients

Men and women aged ≥ 18 years, in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II–IV, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%, and an elevated NT‐proBNP level, were eligible provided they were receiving optimal pharmacological and device therapy in the opinion of the investigator. The main exclusion criteria included type 1 diabetes mellitus, symptomatic hypotension, systolic blood pressure < 95 mmHg and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2. Patients with an AST or ALT more than three times the upper limit of normal, or total bilirubin more than two times the upper limit of normal were also excluded, as were patients judged to have a life expectancy of < 2 years due to a condition other than HF.

Measurement of liver tests

Alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, and total bilirubin were measured at enrolment and at the end‐of‐study visit. Samples were processed in a central laboratory. Our main analysis of change in liver tests used the end‐of‐study measurement, which could fall at 12, 16, 20, or 24 months. Although not required, some patients had measurements taken at other scheduled visits, at the investigator's discretion, or at unscheduled visits. In an exploratory analysis, we included the results from this unplanned sampling, allocating them to the nearest scheduled visit.

Pre‐specified trial outcomes

The primary outcome of DAPA‐HF was the composite of worsening HF (HF hospitalization or urgent visit for HF requiring intravenous therapy) or cardiovascular (CV) death, whichever occurred first. Pre‐specified secondary endpoints included HF hospitalization or CV death; and HF hospitalizations (first and recurrent) and CV deaths. The change from baseline to 8 months in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire total symptom score (KCCQ‐TSS) was an additional secondary endpoint, with the proportion having a 5‐point or more increase or decrease in their score at 8 months determined as previously described. There was also a pre‐specified secondary renal composite outcome, but this was not evaluated further in this study because of the small number of events.

### Biliary metaplasia and macrophage activation define the cellular landscape of cardiogenic liver disease [^112sjg2z]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Right heart failure (RHF) is one of the strongest predictors of hospitalizations and death amongst patients with both preserved and reduced left ventricular (LV) systolic function. Patients with RHF commonly develop hepatic congestion due prolonged transmission of elevated central venous pressures. This mechanical stress can lead to sinusoidal dilation, hepatic dysfunction, bridging fibrosis, and ultimately cirrhosis. In patients with dilated cardiomyopathies, liver fibrosis score severity correlates with all-cause mortality. Furthermore, elevated bilirubin is linked to hepatic congestion and is predictive of mortality in those who undergo left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation or heart transplantation. Despite the prognostic importance of interplay between RHF and liver disease, little is understood about the underlying pathobiology of liver disease driven by cardiac dysfunction.

The term congestive hepatopathy (CH) has been used to describe liver pathology secondary to RHF. The pathogenesis of CH is not well understood; however, inflammation is not thought to contribute. Rather, microthrombus formation, ischemia, and replacement fibrosis have been implicated. Liver biopsy is the gold standard for assessing liver pathology in heart failure patients. However, there is uncertainty regarding what noninvasive findings warrant liver biopsy. Moreover, aside from fibrosis, other pathologic features and their prognostic significance are less well understood.

The liver contains several nonparenchymal cell types that contribute to injury responses. Kupffer cells (KCs) represent the largest collection of resident macrophages in the body and contribute to tissue homeostasis and immune regulation. In the setting of injury, recruited macrophages also enter the liver where they can influence hepatic remodeling.RHF is associated with dysregulation of local and systemic inflammatory signaling in mice and humans. The impact of liver congestion on KCs and other recruited macrophages has largely been ignored. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) reside adjacent to macrophages and, in the setting of damage, are activated to become myofibroblasts, the primary collagen-producing cell in the liver. In addition to macrophages and stromal cells, cholangiocytes can also participate in liver injury responses through the release of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Cholangiocytes are epithelial cells that line the bile ducts and contribute to bile transport; however, in the setting of liver damage, expansion of bile duct-like cells can occur, a response referred to as the ductular reaction. The impact of hepatic congestion on the interplay between liver nonparenchymal cells has not been thoroughly evaluated.

In this study, we aimed to understand the key pathologic features of CH and to develop a platform to explore the mechanisms and consequences of liver dysfunction in heart failure.

### Elevated plasma bile acids coincide with cardiac stress and inflammation in young cyp2c70mice [^115MT6sN]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we demonstrate that cardiac expression of ANP, a well-established marker for heart disease, was increased and positively correlated with plasma BA levels in Cyp2c70 -deficient pups with high circulating BA levels, indicating that hypercholanemia induces stress in the heart. Analysis of the cardiac transcriptome revealed activation of inflammatory pathways and disturbed ECM homeostasis in Cyp2c70 −/− pups with high plasma BAs. Moreover, numerous cardiovascular disease-related genes strongly correlated to total BA concentrations in plasma. Finally, we found that perinatal UDCA treatment prevented hypercholanemia and the majority of the observed myocardial alterations.

In accordance with our previous reports, the 3-week-old Cyp2c70 -deficient pups used in the current study had a human-like BA composition that is devoid of MCAs, and display features of neonatal cholestasis. As such, Cyp2c70 −/− mice had increased plasma cholestasis markers, including liver transaminases, ALP, total bilirubin, and, importantly, elevated plasma BA concentrations compared to WT littermates. Furthermore, the variable plasma BA levels in Cyp2c70 −/− mice enabled us to explore concentration-dependent effects of circulating BAs. Altogether, these features make Cyp2c70 −/− mice a valuable model to study the impact of BAs on extrahepatic tissues like the heart.

### Pioglitazone and metformin [^114E3WFJ]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

5.5 Hepatic Effects

There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)].

Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride therapy.

In patients with abnormal liver tests, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be initiated with caution.

Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities.

Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury, and should not be restarted on pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride can be used with caution.

Because impaired hepatic function has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.

### Liver tests and outcomes in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: findings from DAPA-HF [^114D77py]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In a contemporary, well‐treated ambulatory cohort of patients with HFrEF, most of whom had mild symptoms, the prevalence of abnormal liver tests was low (ranging from 8% to 15% for the various liver tests measured), although patients with significant hepatic disease were not enrolled in DAPA‐HF. Bilirubin was the most frequently elevated liver test, and it remained an independent predictor of outcomes, despite adjustment for other prognostic variables, including NT‐proBNP and high‐sensitivity troponin T, a finding we believe has not been reported before. ALP was also independently predictive of outcome. The benefit of dapagliflozin was consistent across the range of bilirubin concentrations measured at baseline.

The proportion of patients in DAPA‐HF in which bilirubin was elevated (14.7%) was similar to that observed in PARADIGM‐HF (11.6%) and in the patients with reduced ejection fraction (15.8%) recruited approximately 20 years ago in CHARM when background therapy was markedly different. In all three studies, bilirubin was associated with both the composite outcome of CV death or worsening HF and all‐cause mortality in predictive models including an array of clinical and routinely measured biochemical variables. In PARADIGM‐HF, bilirubin was an independent predictor of each outcome in multivariable models including these variables and NT‐proBNP, which is the single most powerful predictor of outcomes in HFrEF (NT‐proBNP was not measured in CHARM). High‐sensitivity troponin has emerged as one of the few additional biomarkers to consistently add prognostic information when added to NT‐proBNP. In DAPA‐HF we tested whether bilirubin retained its independent predictive value even in models containing both NT‐proBNP and troponin, in addition to clinical variables. We found that bilirubin provided incremental prognostic information even when added to these other biomarkers and the fully aHR for each outcome related to bilirubin level was not attenuated to any significant extent compared to the unadjusted hazard ratio.

One limitation of our study was its cross-sectional design. Therefore, a cause-and-effect relationship could not be determined. Another limitation was the uncertainty of the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease. Ischemic heart disease was excluded on the basis only on the absence of symptoms, the lack of previous cardiovascular disease, and electrocardiogram results, indications that may not completely rule out ischemic heart disease. Additionally, the number of participants was relatively small. Further study with a large cohort is necessary for showing stronger correlation.

Cardiohepatic disorders related to HFpEF: congestive hepatopathy

Congestive hepatopathy is a clinical syndrome that refers to the manifestations of chronic, passive congestion of the liver caused by elevation of the central venous pressure in the setting of HF (HFrEF and HFpEF) or other cardiac disease (eg, tricuspid regurgitation). The incidence of congestive hepatopathy among patients with severe HF ranges from 15% to 65%. Any elevation in the pressure of the right heart typically results in an elevation of the central venous pressure and is directly transmitted to the hepatic veins through the inferior vena cava because of their close anatomical relationship. Because of the absence of valves in hepatic veins, the increased pressure in the hepatic veins leads to hepatic congestion, which is characterized mainly by centrilobular congestion and sinusoidal dilation. In acute HF, hepatic congestion is typically coupled with arterial hypoperfusion and hypoperfusion-induced hypoxia, which result in hypoxic hepatitis. Congestive hepatopathy can result in centrilobular liver cell necrosis. This necrotic damage is followed by deposition of connective tissue and fibrosis, ultimately leading to cardiac cirrhosis.

The passive backward hepatic congestion enhances hepatic lymph formation to drain the fluid that accumulates in the interstitial space. However, when the production rate of interstitial fluid exceeds the capacity of the lymphatic system, ascites develops. Furthermore, increased pressure of hepatic sinusoids disrupts the endothelial cells and the tight junctions between hepatocytes, which separate the extravascular space from the bile canaliculus. This disruption results in exposing the bile canaliculus to the sinusoidal blood and thus an increase in the level of serum bilirubin.

Congestive hepatopathy typically manifests with jaundice, ascites, edema, hepatomegaly, hepatojugular reflux, pulsatile liver (when associated with tricuspid valve regurgitation), and a cholestatic laboratory pattern (ie, increased serum γ-glutamyl-transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) with normal or mildly increased transaminases. The severity of cholestasis typically correlates with the severity of HF and implies significant prognostic values; total bilirubin is a strong predictor of adverse outcomes, such as all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and HF hospitalization.

Treatment of congestive hepatopathy focuses on decongesting the liver (using diuretic agents) and optimizing cardiac output and hemodynamic status.

Secondary acquired liver injury

Definition

Acquired liver injury without underlying liver disease represents the most common form of hepatic dysfunction in the ICU. It can occur after a hypoxic (e.g. shock), toxic (i.e. hepatotoxic drugs) or inflammatory insult (e.g. sepsis). There is no common definition for this syndrome, and its diagnosis is mainly based on the elevation of liver parameters, such as transaminases or bilirubin.

Cholestasis is characterized by altered bile excretion (i.e. extrahepatic cholestasis due to mechanical bile duct obstruction) or impaired conjugation and/or secretion (i.e. intrahepatic cholestasis owing to altered hepatocellular signaling and transport). This results in an accumulation of bile acids and conjugated bilirubin, together with increased enzymes that indicate cholestasis, such as alkaline phosphatase (AP) or γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). A consensus on how to define cholestasis in critically ill patients using these routine laboratory parameters does not exist. As defined by the SOFA score, a bilirubin threshold > 2 mg/dl is included in the guidelines of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and has been adopted by many authors. However, elevated bilirubin levels are not specific to cholestasis and might also reflect hemolysis. Lyu et al. showed that 73% of adult cardiac patients supported by veno-arterial ECMO had hyperbilirubinemia (> 3 mg/dl), which may be due to hemolysis in up to 42% of the cases. The combination of AP and GGT with or without bilirubin has been suggested to diagnose cholestasis more specifically.

Hypoxic liver injury is generally defined based on a clinical setting of circulatory, cardiac or respiratory failure, a substantial increase in transaminases, ranging from > 5 to > 20 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), and the absence of other causes of liver damage. It was first reported in 1901 as "central necrosis" and is known as "ischemic hepatitis", "shock liver" or "hypoxic hepatitis". The cause is an imbalance of oxygen supply and demand in the liver that results in cell death. More specifically, insufficient hepatic perfusion, including Budd–Chiari perfusion, hypoxemia, poor global oxygen delivery, inadequate oxygen extraction by hepatocytes or an increased metabolic demand, can cause hypoxic liver injury. Three subgroups of causes may be distinguished: respiratory failure, cardiac failure and shock/hypotension.

Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone must be considered [see Boxed Warning, and].

5.2 Hypoglycemia

Patients receiving pioglitazone in combination with insulin or other antidiabetic medications (particularly insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylureas) may be at risk for hypoglycemia. A reduction in the dose of the concomitant antidiabetic medication may be necessary to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see].

5.3 Hepatic Effects

There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date [see].

Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating pioglitazone therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, pioglitazone should be initiated with caution.

Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of the reference range), pioglitazone treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Pioglitazone should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities.

Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury, and should not be restarted on pioglitazone. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with pioglitazone can be used with caution.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113Fviv2]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is produced mainly in the liver (from the biliary epithelium) but is also found in abundance in bone and in smaller quantities in the intestines, kidneys and white blood cells. Levels are physiologically higher in childhood, associated with bone growth, and in pregnancy due to placental production. Pathologically increased levels occur mainly in bone disease (eg, metastatic bone disease and bone fractures) and cholestatic liver disease — for example, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, common bile duct obstruction, intrahepatic duct obstruction (metastases) and drug-induced cholestasis. Furthermore, hepatic congestion secondary to right-sided heart failure can also lead to cholestasis (elevated ALP levels and/or bilirubin).

When ALP is elevated in isolation, the measurement of γ-glutamyltransferase can indicate whether the ALP is of hepatic or non-hepatic origin. While there are no data on the most likely causes of an isolated raised ALP in an asymptomatic population, the the most common cause is likely to be vitamin D deficiency, or normal increase seen in childhood due to rapid growth. Other causes include Paget's disease and bony metastases. If doubt still exists, the use of electrophoresis to separate the isoenzymes of ALP can differentiate hepatic from non-hepatic causes of increased ALP.

AST and ALT are enzymes present in hepatocytes and are released into the blood stream in response to hepatocyte injury or death (hepatitis). Elevations in either of these enzymes are the the most common abnormality seen on liver blood test profiles. Both enzymes are present in many differing types of tissue, but ALT is considered more liver-specific since it is present in low concentrations in non-hepatic tissue, and non-liver related elevations are uncommon. However, AST is abundantly present in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle and so may be elevated in patients with myocardial infarction or myositis. Although ALT is considered a more specific indicator of liver disease, the concentration of AST may be a more sensitive indicator of liver injury in conditions such as alcohol-related liver disease and in some cases of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). In children, creatine kinase measurement may help to determine whether an isolated rise in ALT or AST is due to an underlying skeletal muscle disorder, such as muscular dystrophy.

### Liver function abnormalities and outcome in patients with chronic heart failure: data from the candesartan in heart failure: assessment of reduction in mortality and morbidity (CHARM) program [^114t1e2Y]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

The prevalence and importance of liver function test (LFT) abnormalities in a large contemporary cohort of heart failure patients have not been systematically evaluated.

Methods and Results

We characterized the LFTs of 2679 patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure from the Candesartan in Heart failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity program (CHARM). We used multivariable modelling to assess the relationships between baseline LFT values and long-term outcomes. Liver function test abnormalities were common in patients with chronic heart failure, ranging from alanine aminotransferase elevation in 3.1% of patients to low albumin in 18.3% of patients; total bilirubin was elevated in 13.0% of patients. In multivariable analysis, elevated total bilirubin was the strongest LFT predictor of adverse outcome for both the composite outcome of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization (HR 1.21 per 1 SD increase, P < 0.0001) and all-cause mortality (HR 1.19 per 1 SD increase, P < 0.0001). Even after adjustment for other variables, elevated total bilirubin was one of the strongest independent predictors of poor prognosis (by global chi-square).

Conclusion

Bilirubin is independently associated with morbidity and mortality. Changes in total bilirubin may offer insight into the underlying pathophysiology of chronic heart failure.

### EACTS / STS / AATS guidelines on temporary mechanical circulatory support in adult cardiac surgery [^114rpxGB]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Recovery of hepatic function on tMCS notes that hepatic injury, reflected by elevated transaminases and bilirubin, occurs in approximately 25% of patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) and in 40% of those with acute heart failure (HF); among patients not supported with tMCS, hepatic ischaemia is associated with a doubling of mortality risk, and liver function typically normalizes with adequate circulatory support. Most weaning protocols recommend waiting for normalization of liver function test (LFT) results before weaning is attempted, and persistently elevated LFT results should prompt further investigation.

### Liver tests and outcomes in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: findings from DAPA-HF [^117UFrfY]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
Association between total bilirubin as a continuous variable and the risk of the main study endpoints. Restricted cubic splines for the risk of the primary composite endpoint (A), hospitalization or urgent visit for heart failure (B), death from cardiovascular causes (C), or death from any cause (D) with the median bilirubin value (10 μmol/L) as reference.

Analysed as a continuous variable, higher levels of ALP were associated with a higher risk of the primary outcome, components of the primary outcome, death from CV cause and any cause and recurrent HF hospitalization and CV death. In the adjusted model including NT‐proBNP and high‐sensitivity troponin T, the relationship remained significant for death from any cause only. Neither AST nor ALT level was associated with the risk of any outcome in either adjusted or unadjusted models (online supplementary Table S3).

Modelling the relationship between liver tests and risk of each outcome flexibly using restricted cubic splines showed an essentially linear relationship between elevated ALP and risk of outcomes, with some plateauing at very high levels of ALP (online supplementary Figure S2). The lack of relationship between AST and ALT and any outcome was confirmed.

Allocating patients to groups defined by tertiles of bilirubin and troponin T showed a marked increase in the rate of the primary outcome when both bilirubin and troponin T were in the highest tertile (Graphical Abstract). A similar outcome was seen with tertiles of bilirubin and NT‐proBNP (Graphical Abstract).

### Infliximab-dyyb (Zymfentra) [^115KMU5K]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Hepatotoxicity

Hepatobiliary disorders, including acute liver failure, jaundice abnormal hepatic function, hepatic steatosis, hepatitis, hepatotoxicity, hyperbilirubinemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver, have been reported in postmarketing data in patients receiving infliximab products. Autoimmune hepatitis has been diagnosed in some of these cases. Severe hepatic reactions occurred between two weeks to more than one year after initiation of infliximab products administered intravenously; elevations in hepatic aminotransferase levels were not noted prior to discovery of the liver injury in many of these cases. Some of these cases were fatal or necessitated liver transplantation.

In clinical trials, three subjects treated with ZYMFENTRA had drug induced liver injury based on hepatic transaminase elevations, including one subject with accompanying bilirubin elevation [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Monitor hepatic enzymes and liver function tests every 3 to 4 months during treatment with ZYMFENTRA. Prompt investigation of the cause of liver enzyme elevation should be undertaken to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. Interrupt treatment if drug-induced liver injury is suspected, until this diagnosis is excluded. Instruct patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfuction.

5.5 Congestive Heart Failure

Cases of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) and new onset CHF, with and without identifiable precipitating factors (e.g., pre-existing cardiovascular disease), have been reported with TNF blockers, including infliximab products. Some of these patients have been under 50 years of age, and some cases had a fatal outcome. In several exploratory trials of other TNF blockers in the treatment of CHF, there were greater proportions of TNF-blocker-treated patients who had CHF exacerbations requiring hospitalization or increased mortality. ZYMFENTRA has not been studied in patients with a history of CHF. Avoid ZYMFENTRA in patients with CHF.

If a decision is made to administer ZYMFENTRA to patients with CHF, closely monitor patients during therapy for new or worsening symptoms of heart failure and discontinue ZYMFENTRA if symptoms appear.

### Relation of high serum bilirubin to short-term mortality following a myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular systolic dysfunction (from the high-risk myocardial infarction database initiative) [^113L8MEL]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Higher serum bilirubin has been associated with poorer prognosis in patients with heart failure (HF). We examined the association between serum bilirubin and clinical outcomes in patients with clinical signs of HF and/or left ventricular systolic dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction (MI). A total of 7,467 patients from the High-Risk Myocardial Infarction Database Initiative with an available baseline total bilirubin concentration were studied. The association between baseline bilirubin concentrations and the composite outcome of cardiovascular mortality (CVM), nonfatal stroke, nonfatal MI or hospitalization for HF, CVM, and all-cause mortality were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. An interaction with time was observed with associations present only in the first 90 days after randomization. The median (percentile 25–75) baseline total bilirubin concentration was 11 (8 to 14)µmol/L and was above the "normal" range (> 17.1µmol/L) in 1,053 (14.1%) patients. In multivariable analysis, with adjustment for baseline characteristics (demographic, co-morbidities, Killip score, left ventricular ejection fraction, and laboratory variables), patients with a bilirubin concentration of > 17.1µmol/L had a significantly higher risk of all the studied outcomes at 90 days (e.g. CVM: adjusted hazard ratio 1.45, 95% confidence interval 1.14 to 1.86, p = 0.003). The addition of bilirubin to a validated survival model modestly improved the risk reclassification to predict 90-day events (continuous net reclassification improvement for CVM 6.4%, 95% confidence interval 0.7% to 9.6%, p = 0.04). In patients with MI complicated with HF and/or systolic dysfunction, bilirubin concentration is an independent predictor of mortality and may improve risk stratification.

### Liver tests and outcomes in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: findings from DAPA-HF [^116RmtMU]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Liver tests are commonly abnormal in patients with severe heart failure (HF) and during acute decompensation. In both settings, abnormal liver tests are predictive of worse subsequent outcomes, including death. Abnormal liver tests are thought to reflect both increased venous pressure and reduced cardiac output.

Much less is known about the prevalence or the prognostic significance of abnormal liver tests in ambulatory patients with HF, especially in such individuals receiving contemporary treatments. In the Candesartan in Heart Failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity (CHARM) program, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was elevated in 14.0% of patients, total bilirubin in 13.0%, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in 3.1%, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in 4.1% of patients. In CHARM, bilirubin was the most powerful prognostic liver test and remained an independent predictor in a multivariable model, although that model did not include a natriuretic peptide. More recently, in the Prospective Comparison of ARNI (Angiotensin Receptor–Neprilysin Inhibitor) with ACEI (Angiotensin‐Converting Enzyme Inhibitor) to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure (PARADIGM‐HF) trial, 11.6% of patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) were found to have elevated bilirubin at baseline and bilirubin was again the most predictive liver test and remained independently so in a multivariable model including N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP). Whether bilirubin remains predictive when additional prognostic biomarkers such as high‐sensitivity troponin T are included is not known.

Recently sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been introduced as a treatment for the treatment of HFrEF. Due to their effect on proximal renal tubular reabsorption of glucose, coupled with sodium, these agents cause an initial osmotic diuresis and natriuresis which might relieve hepatic congestion and improve liver tests. It has also been suggested that SGLT2 inhibitors might reduce liver fat in patients with type 2 diabetes, a condition linked to obesity and frequently associated with non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease.

We have investigated the prevalence and predictive importance of abnormal liver tests in the Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse outcomes in Heart Failure (DAPA‐HF) trial and the effect of dapagliflozin on liver tests in this trial.

### Hepatic biomarker abnormalities in the cardiac intensive care unit: proposed criteria for cardiohepatic syndrome [^114pEvnA]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Notably, while commonly termed as such, the biomarkers we labeled as LFTs do not necessarily reflect hepatic synthetic function. Each of these biomarkers can be elevated by numerous distinct processes, in many cases involving extrahepatic organ injury or dysfunction, and none is truly specific to liver disease. Indeed, it is likely that multiple underlying disease processes could have contributed to LFT abnormalities in each patient. Additional biomarkers that are used less frequently can clarify the presence of hepatocellular injury (eg, creatine kinase or lactate dehydrogenase), cholestasis (ALK isoenzymes, gamma-glutamyl transferase or direct bilirubin), or liver synthetic failure (albumin, prothrombin time or ammonia). Because these biomarkers were obtained less frequently in our population, we could not use them in our classification, preventing us from determining the source and etiology of LFT elevations in individual patients. Where available, these additional hepatic biomarkers generally trended in the same direction as the commonly available LFTs we used for classification and were more abnormal in patients with a greater extent or severity of LFT abnormality. The most common LFT abnormality we observed was an elevated AST, which in some cases may have been elevated due to myocardial necrosis in this cohort with a high prevalence of acute myocardial infarction — without creatine kinase for comparison, it is difficult to distinguish between muscle and liver origin of AST (and to a lesser extent ALT) elevations. Notably, AST and ALT levels correlated more strongly with measures of acidosis (eg, lactate, anion gap) than troponin T levels (data not shown), suggesting that hepatocellular injury from liver hypoperfusion was an important contributor to elevated AST and ALT levels overall.

### Liver function tests in patients with acute heart failure and associated outcomes: insights from ASCEND-HF [^111guy67]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

We aimed to characterize abnormal liver function tests in patients with heart failure (HF), as they are commonly encountered yet poorly defined.

Methods and Results

We used data from ASCEND-HF (Acute Study of Clinical Effectiveness of Nesiritide in Decompensated Heart Failure) to characterize associations with baseline liver function tests (LFTs). Each LFT was analysed as both a continuous and dichotomous variable [normal vs. abnormal; bilirubin > 1.0mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 35mmol/L]. Logistic regression assessed the association of LFTs and 30-day all-cause mortality and HF rehospitalization, and Cox proportional hazards assessed the association with 180-day all-cause mortality among patients alive at a 30-day landmark. In ASCEND-HF, 4228 (59%) had complete admission LFT data. Of these, 42% had abnormal bilirubin, 22% had abnormal ALT, and 30% had abnormal AST. Patients with abnormal LFTs were younger, had lower body mass index, and lower left ventricular ejection fraction. In multivariable models, increased total bilirubin was associated with increased 30-day mortality or HF rehospitalization [hazard ratio (HR) 1.17 per 1mg/dL increase, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04, 1.32; P = 0.012], but not with an increase in 180-day mortality (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.97, 1.25; P = 0.13) per 1mg/dl increase. Compared with normal bilirubin levels, abnormal bilirubin was associated with increased 30-day mortality or HF rehospitalization (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.00, 1.54; P = 0.048) and 180-day mortality (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.08, 1.62; P = 0.007). We found no association with AST or ALT and outcomes.

Conclusion

Greater than 40% of patients hospitalized with acute HF had abnormal LFTs. After multivariable adjustment, only elevated bilirubin was independently associated with worse clinical outcomes and may represent an important prognostic variable.

### Association of plasma bilirubin with coronary heart disease and segregation of bilirubin as a major gene trait: the NHLBI family heart study [^1179qooc]. Atherosclerosis (2001). Low credibility.

Decreased serum bilirubin levels have been associated with coronary heart disease (CHD). It is believed that bilirubin acts as an antioxidant, preventing formation of oxidized LDL and subsequent atherosclerosis. Serum bilirubin also segregates as a major gene, with the rarer genotype associated with elevated bilirubin levels and occurring in about 12% of the population. Using a large population-based study of random and CHD high risk families, this analysis was designed to replicate the association of lower serum bilirubin levels with early CHD (onset by age 55 for males and 65 for females) using 328 case/control samples and the major gene segregation of bilirubin levels in 555 families. There were significant differences in plasma bilirubin levels between 188 males (12.5 micromol/l) and 140 females (9.3 micromol/l, P < 0.0001). Higher serum albumin and lower HDL-C significantly correlated with higher plasma bilirubin levels in females but not males. In sex-specific logistic regression models of early CHD (148 cases and 180 controls), lower plasma bilirubin was associated with increased prevalence of CHD in males with borderline significance (odds ratio = 0.93 for a 1 micromol/l increase in bilirubin, P = 0.056) but not in females. Bilirubin was found to segregate as a major gene using all 555 families consisting of 1292 individuals, with estimates replicating those in the previously published study. The most parsimonious model was a recessive model for high bilirubin levels that occurred in about 23% of the population. The means were separated by 1.7 standard deviations and there was a significant polygenic effect (h2 = 0.33, P = 0.0009). We conclude that decreased bilirubin is mildly related to CHD in males but not in females. Because of an inverse correlation between HDL-C and bilirubin, the protective high HDL-C levels may have counteracted the CHD risk associated with lower bilirubin levels in females. The inferred major gene for bilirubin may protect against CHD, since elevated levels, rather than lower levels, were associated with this inferred gene.

### Serum bilirubin level is associated with exercise capacity and quality of life in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113eA28p]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

However, the relationship of bilirubin and clinical outcomes should be cautiously assessed in various settings when other health statuses could confound the results. Brown et al. showed that higher bilirubin level was associated with lower risk of acute exacerbation of COPD from the secondary analyses of data in the Simvastatin for Prevention of Exacerbations in Moderate-to-Severe COPD (STATCOPE) and the Azithromycin for Prevention of Exacerbations of COPD (MACRO) studies. However, we found contradicting results, as a higher bilirubin level was associated with higher risk of exacerbation of COPD, especially in the GOLD III-IV group. This result could be cautiously explained by the relationship between bilirubin and right-heart function. Poelzl et al. showed that the median total bilirubin level increased with every New York Heart Association class. Moreover, Samsky et al. reported that several echocardiographic indices of right-heart dysfunction were related to elevated total bilirubin levels, with increased portal vein pulsatility index having the best predictive value in patients with exacerbation of chronic heart failure. Abnormal liver function test results were observed in patients with heart failure as a result of impaired perfusion or increased right-sided cardiac pressures. COPD patients with right-sided heart failure were at higher risk of severe exacerbations. Relative pulmonary artery enlargement (ratio of the main pulmonary artery diameter to the aortic diameter > 1) was a significant biomarker for predicting future exacerbation in the COPD gene study. The ratio of the main pulmonary artery diameter to the aortic diameter was positively related with right ventricular pressure, and a high ratio was a significant risk factor of COPD exacerbation in Korean COPD patients. In this study, the relationship between serum bilirubin and exacerbation was only significant in the GOLD III-IV group, which had more severe airflow limitation, but the cardiac function status in this group is not exactly known. In STATCOPE and MACRO, COPD patients with predicted FEV 1 < 80% were enrolled, and one-third were categorized into the GOLD II group. Moreover, the study duration of STATCOPE (median = 1.74 years) and MACRO (median = 0.55 years) was shorter than that of our study (mean = 5.4 years).

### Gilbert's syndrome revisited [^115fqT1w]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Gilbert's syndrome, also known as benign hyperbilirubinaemia, was described more than 100 years ago. It has usually been considered a physiological abnormality characterised by a mild elevation of the systemic level of unconjugated bilirubin, in the absence of any underlying liver or overt haemolytic disease. However, since the re-discovery of the potent antioxidant effects of bilirubin in the late 1980s, as well as multiple intracellular signalling pathways affected by bilirubin, an ever-increasing body of evidence suggests that individuals with Gilbert's syndrome may benefit from the mild hyperbilirubinaemia and are actually protected from the development of a wide variety of "diseases of civilisation" such as cardiovascular diseases, certain cancers, and autoimmune or neurodegenerative diseases. This review analyses the current state of medical knowledge given recent discoveries in this rapidly developing field, as well as their possible clinical significance, and provides a new perspective on this condition.

### Hepatic dysfunction after left ventricular mechanical assist in patients with end-stage heart failure: role of inflammatory response and hepatic microcirculation [^114wDvdQ]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background

In the condition of preexisting vital organ failure induced by heart failure, hepatic failure often progresses despite establishment of adequate hemodynamic support through a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and results in a high mortality rate. We hypothesized that inflammatory responses, including those induced by infection and their influence on organ perfusion, may contribute to the pathogenesis of this progressive hepatic failure and subsequent multiple organ failure as reported in the current investigation on multiple organ failure after major surgery or trauma.

Methods

Hepatic function and its relation to inflammatory response and hepatic microcirculation were evaluated in 16 consecutive patients who received an implantation of LVAD for end-stage cardiomyopathy, between 1992 and 2000. Patients were divided into two groups: 5 patients who died from multiple organ failure after severe hepatic failure (group 1) and 11 patients who did not develop severe hepatic failure (group 2). Serum levels of CRP, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and serum hyaluronan, a known indicator of hepatic sinusoidal function, were measured pre- and postoperatively in both groups.

Results

Serum ALT and AST levels during LVAD support were similar in the two groups. Serum total bilirubin (T-Bil), CRP, IL-6, and IL-8 levels before and during the first 20 days of LVAD support were significantly higher in group 1 than those in group 2 (p < 0.01 to 0.05). Serum hyaluronan levels in both groups were significantly correlated with T-Bil levels (r = 0.60, p < 0.05 in group 1; r = 0.68, p < 0.0001 in group 2). Histopathological examination by transvenous liver biopsy in a group 1 patient showed hepatic sinusoidal damage as well as cholestasis and fibrosis.

Conclusions

Patients with hyperbilirubinemia and inflammatory reactions before LVAD support showed increased hyperbilirubinemia and inflammatory cytokine and hyarulonan levels despite adequate hemodynamics achieved under LVAD support. These results suggest that inflammatory response contributes to subsequent aggravation of hepatic dysfunction, probably with underlying and continuing derangement in hepatic sinusoidal microcirculation even under systemic circulatory support.

### Liver tests and outcomes in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: findings from DAPA-HF [^113Psth2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Aims

Reflecting both increased venous pressure and reduced cardiac output, abnormal liver tests are common in patients with severe heart failure and are associated with adverse clinical outcomes. We aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of abnormal liver tests in ambulatory patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), explore any treatment interaction between bilirubin and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and examine change in liver tests with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment.

Methods and results

We explored these objectives in the Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse outcomes in Heart Failure (DAPA‐HF) trial, with focus on bilirubin. We calculated the incidence of cardiovascular death or worsening heart failure by bilirubin tertile. Secondary cardiovascular outcomes were examined, along with the change in liver tests at the end‐of‐study visit. Baseline bilirubin was available in 4720 patients (99.5%). Participants in the highest bilirubin tertile (T3) have more severe HFrEF (lower left ventricular ejection fraction, higher N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide [NT‐proBNP] and worse New York Heart Association class), had a greater burden of atrial fibrillation but less diabetes. Higher bilirubin (T3 vs. T1) was associated with worse outcomes even after adjustment for other predictive variables, including NT‐proBNP and troponin T (adjusted hazard ratio for the primary outcome 1.73 [95% confidence interval 1.37–2.17], p < 0.001; and 1.52 [1.12–2.07], p = 0.01 for cardiovascular death). Baseline bilirubin did not modify the benefits of dapagliflozin. During follow‐up, dapagliflozin had no effect on liver tests.

Conclusion

Bilirubin concentration was an independent predictor of worse outcomes but did not modify the benefits of dapagliflozin in HFrEF. Dapagliflozin was not associated with change in liver tests.

### Peri-operative identification and management of patients with unhealthy alcohol intake [^115ZS6av]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Thrombocytopaenia may be present secondary to bone marrow suppression, folate deficiency or hypersplenism, possibly reflecting underlying portal hypertension. Leucocytosis may also be present due to hepatitis‐related leukaemoid reaction. As discussed, severity of liver disease may be assessed by the Child‐Turcotte‐Pugh score. Key components of this are serum albumin; serum bilirubin; and prothrombin time. Additionally, elevated (conjugated) bilirubin may suggest active alcoholic steatohepatitis, even in the absence of cirrhosis.

Electrolyte disturbances, particularly hyponatraemia, are common with alcohol excess even in the absence of advanced or cirrhotic liver disease. Hypokalaemia and hypophosphataemia may cause muscle weakness, while hypomagnesaemia may worsen hypokalaemia and may cause seizures. Urea and creatinine can be elevated by pre‐renal causes of acute kidney injury more commonly seen in patients with cirrhosis, while hepatorenal syndrome only occurs in the setting of ascites or significant portal hypertension. Isolated uraemia may be due to active gastrointestinal bleeding.

Biochemical markers for alcohol‐related liver disease have been employed historically to assess liver dysfunction; however, abnormal liver enzymes are poorly predictive of underlying liver disease with only 3.9% of patients with an abnormal value in this domain shown to develop significant liver disease within 5 years of testing. Liver enzyme values should, therefore, be interpreted in the context of wider clinical findings and other test results.

Harmful alcohol intake increases the risk of cardiovascular disease ranging from hypertension and atrial arrhythmias to more serious problems such as cardiomyopathy. The incidence of stroke (haemorrhagic or ischaemic) is also increased. Diagnosis can be aided by using a 12‐lead ECG, while echocardiography can show structural damage to the heart caused by alcohol misuse such as a dilated left ventricle with decreased mass and wall thickness or systolic dysfunction. Echocardiography should be reserved for those patients with recognised criteria such as those displaying signs and symptoms of cardiac failure. In selected cases, cardiopulmonary exercise testing may be of value to identify systolic dysfunction that is masked by the hyperdynamic circulation of liver impairment.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115LFUoj]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Right-sided heart failure (RHF) serum markers — in chronic RHF (CRHF), the transaminases may be normal or minimally elevated, whereas in acute RHF (ARHF) they are commonly high. In advanced CRHF, liver synthetic function may be impaired with reduced albumin and elevated international normalized ratio. Increased bilirubin can reflect passive congestion or cholestasis or suggest fibrosis and cirrhosis, and more severe cases with venous congestion and systemic hypoperfusion can lead to renal insufficiency with elevation in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine.

### Hepatic biomarker abnormalities in the cardiac intensive care unit: proposed criteria for cardiohepatic syndrome [^115MeFDC]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Prior studies have identified associations between elevated levels of hepatocellular injury biomarkers and higher mortality in patients with acute HF, CS, and acute myocardial infarction. In 1,784 patients with STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction), Lofthus et al found AST and ALT to be independently associated with higher mortality — notably, the release of AST and, to a lesser extent, ALT from cardiac muscle can be a reflection of infarct size. In a post hoc analysis of 1,134 patients from the SURVIVE (Survival of Patients With Acute Heart Failure in Need of Intravenous Inotropic Support) trial, which included acute HF patients treated with inotropes, Nikolaou et al found abnormal ALK was associated with higher 180-day mortality and abnormal transaminases were associated with greater 31- and 180-day mortality. We observed similar trends in our data, with subgroup analysis showing a progressive increase in mortality with rising values of each LFT among patients stratified by admission diagnosis (acute coronary syndrome, HF, CS, or cardiac arrest). Although the association between hepatic biomarker derangement and mortality has become increasingly recognized over the last several decades, its ability to predict prognosis is still poorly understood. Current risk-prediction tools are limited in their use of hepatic biomarkers when predicting mortality in critically ill patients. Currently, liver function testing is already used in ICU risk-prediction tools such as the SOFA and Multi-Organ Dysfunction scores, although only TBili is used in these scores. In a prior analysis from this cohort, we demonstrated a strong association between elevated bilirubin (the liver SOFA subscore) and mortality in the minority of CICU patients with available data. Insofar as the TBili only incorporates 1 specific aspect of liver function, our data suggest the need for a multibiomarker assessment to determine the contribution of liver dysfunction to prognosis. This is supported by our findings that a greater extent of LFT abnormality was associated with worse outcomes, particularly for patients with combined hepatocellular injury and cholestasis.

### Acute liver failure guidelines [^11145Hc2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Ischemic liver injury — secondary cause of ALF: Ischemic liver injury, also called "hypoxic hepatitis" or "shock liver", results from transient or persistently decreased hepatic perfusion and may occur with congestive heart failure, sepsis, respiratory failure, injury, or major surgery, sometimes without documented hypotension. Patients with ischemia-related ALF can present with a severe hepatocellular injury pattern with marked AST elevation > 10,000 IU/L; bilirubin levels are typically normal initially, often worsening with rising INR despite improvement in transaminase levels, and patients often have rapid clinical improvement with restoration of normal hemodynamic status, with prognosis largely dictated by the underlying illness.

### Liver tests and outcomes in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: findings from DAPA-HF [^112gLHfo]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

Reflecting both increased venous pressure and reduced cardiac output, abnormal liver tests are common in patients with severe heart failure and are associated with adverse clinical outcomes. We aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of abnormal liver tests in ambulatory patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), explore any treatment interaction between bilirubin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and examine change in liver tests with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment.

Methods and Results

We explored these objectives in the Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse outcomes in Heart Failure (DAPA-HF) trial, with focus on bilirubin. We calculated the incidence of cardiovascular death or worsening heart failure by bilirubin tertile. Secondary cardiovascular outcomes were examined, along with the change in liver tests at the end-of-study visit. Baseline bilirubin was available in 4720 patients (99.5%). Participants in the highest bilirubin tertile (T3) have more severe HFrEF (lower left ventricular ejection fraction, higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP] and worse New York Heart Association class), had a greater burden of atrial fibrillation but less diabetes. Higher bilirubin (T3 vs. T1) was associated with worse outcomes even after adjustment for other predictive variables, including NT-proBNP and troponin T (adjusted hazard ratio for the primary outcome 1.73 [95% confidence interval 1.37–2.17], p < 0.001; and 1.52 [1.12–2.07], p = 0.01 for cardiovascular death). Baseline bilirubin did not modify the benefits of dapagliflozin. During follow-up, dapagliflozin had no effect on liver tests.

Conclusion

Bilirubin concentration was an independent predictor of worse outcomes but did not modify the benefits of dapagliflozin in HFrEF. Dapagliflozin was not associated with change in liver tests.

Mechanical circulatory support — Hepatic dysfunction considerations include that functional liver abnormalities are often seen with a cardiac index of < 1.5 L/min/m2, and only portal vein pulsatility index is statistically significant as a predictor of total bilirubin level. Monitoring should include liver enzymes and direct and indirect bilirubin for congestive hepatic dysfunction, optimally coordinated with monitoring of central venous pressure (CVP) (Class I, Level of evidence: C.).

### Refining liver safety risk assessment: application of mechanistic modeling and serum biomarkers to cimaglermin alfa (GGF2) clinical trials [^112aMK1g]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Cimaglermin alfa (GGF2) is a recombinant human protein growth factor in development for heart failure. Phase I trials were suspended when two cimaglermin alfa-treated subjects experienced concomitant elevations in serum aminotransferases and total bilirubin, meeting current US Food and Drug Administration criteria for a serious liver safety signal (i.e., "Hy's Law"). We assayed mechanistic biomarkers in archived clinical trial serum samples which confirmed the hepatic origin of the aminotransferase elevations in these two subjects and identified apoptosis as the major mode of hepatocyte death. Using a mathematical model of drug-induced liver injury (DILIsym) and a simulated population, we estimated that the maximum hepatocyte loss in these two subjects was < 13%, which would not result in liver dysfunction sufficient to significantly increase serum bilirubin levels. We conclude that the two subjects should not be considered Hy's Law cases and that mechanistic biomarkers and modeling can aid in refining liver safety risk assessment in clinical trials.

### Epigenetic-sensitive challenges of cardiohepatic interactions: clinical and therapeutic implications in heart failure patients [^116QpYyR]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Heart failure and liver dysfunction can coexist owing to complex cardiohepatic interactions including the development of hypoxic hepatitis and congestive hepatopathy in patients with heart failure as well as 'cirrhotic cardiomyopathy' in advanced liver disease and following liver transplantation. The involvement of liver dysfunction in patients with heart failure reflects crucial systemic hemodynamic modifications occurring during the evolution of this syndrome. The arterial hypoperfusion and downstream hypoxia can lead to hypoxic hepatitis in acute heart failure patients whereas passive congestion is correlated with congestive hepatopathy occurring in patients with chronic heart failure. Nowadays, liquid biopsy strategies measuring liver function are well established in evaluating the prognosis of patients with heart failure. Large randomized clinical trials confirmed that gamma-glutamyltransferase, bilirubin, lactate deihydrogenase, and transaminases are useful prognostic biomarkers in patients with heart failure after transplantation. Deeper knowledge about the pathogenic mechanisms underlying cardiohepatic interactions would be useful to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and treatments of these comorbid patients. Epigenetic-sensitive modifications are heritable changes to gene expression without involving DNA sequence, comprising DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNAs which seem to be relevant in the pathogenesis of heart failure and liver diseases when considered in a separate way. The goal of our review is to highlight the pertinence of detecting epigenetic modifications during the complex cardiohepatic interactions in clinical setting. Moreover, we propose a clinical research program which may be useful to identify epigenetic-sensitive biomarkers of cardiohepatic interactions and advance personalized therapy in these comorbid patients.

### Risk factors analysis of hyperbilirubinemia after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting: a retrospective observational study [^112ctTRD]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Regarding the categories of postoperative hyperbilirubinemia, most patients (71.88%) exhibited elevated direct bilirubin levels, which is consistent with previous reports. Nishi et al. reported that patients with elevated direct bilirubin levels were more likely to have higher mortality rates and worse prognostic outcomes than patients with elevated indirect bilirubin levels. This difference was also found in this study (17.39% for direct bilirubin vs. 0% for indirect bilirubin, P = 0.303), although the difference was not significant. In contrast, Mastoraki et al. reported that patients with elevated indirect bilirubin levels had worse outcomes. In the hyperbilirubinemia patients of this study, 19 patients (59.38%) had direct bilirubin/total bilirubin ratio > 50%, 10 patients (31.25%) had direct bilirubin/total bilirubin ratio between 20 and 50%, 3 patients (9.38%) had direct bilirubin/total bilirubin ratio < 20%, while 5 patients (15.63%) had elevated liver enzyme levels, demonstrated that the main cause of hyperbilirubinemia after OPCAB was intrahepatic cholestasis, followed by hepatocyte damage, and hemolysis in a few patients. Which is in agreement to the conclusion of Mastoraki et al.

Most studies were positive about the correlation between hyperbilirubinemia and postoperative complications as well as with adverse events, which embodied the importance of this study. Hyperbilirubinemia after cardiac surgery (especially after cardiopulmonary bypass) is a risk factor for postoperative respiratory, circulatory, urinary, gastrointestinal complications and associated with in-hospital mortality.

The mechanisms through which hyperbilirubinemia leads to complications and poor prognosis are complex, and have not been fully elucidated. Elevated bilirubin concentrations can trigger cell oxidative stress, induce apoptosis, and participate in a variety of pathological processes, including respiratory dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, renal tubular epithelial cell damage, neural cell differentiation and myelination inhibition. In addition, persistent hyperbilirubinemia is only a manifestation of a potential disease, such as persistent low cardiac output syndrome, rather than a direct cause of death.

### Inherited disorders of bilirubin transport and conjugation: new insights into molecular mechanisms and consequences [^1149keDS]. Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Inherited disorders of bilirubin metabolism might reduce bilirubin uptake by hepatocytes, bilirubin conjugation, or secretion of bilirubin into bile. Reductions in uptake could increase levels of unconjugated or conjugated bilirubin (Rotor syndrome). Defects in bilirubin conjugation could increase levels of unconjugated bilirubin; the effects can be benign and frequent (Gilbert syndrome) or rare but severe, increasing the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy (Crigler-Najjar syndrome). Impairment of bilirubin secretion leads to accumulation of conjugated bilirubin (Dubin-Johnson syndrome). We review the genetic causes and pathophysiology of disorders of bilirubin transport and conjugation as well as clinical and therapeutic aspects. We also discuss the possible mechanisms by which hyperbilirubinemia protects against cardiovascular disease and the metabolic syndrome and the effects of specific genetic variants on drug metabolism and cancer development.

### Changes in liver function tests, congestion, and prognosis after acute Heart Failure: the STRONG-HF trial [^112XHkuB]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute heart failure (AHF) represents a clinical syndrome that engenders a cascade of systemic effects due to impaired cardiac function and the ensuing elevated left ventricular filling pressure. Central to these systemic manifestations is the impact of right-sided congestion of visceral organs, notably affecting the liver, spleen, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract. The liver, in the setting of AHF, often exhibits deranged function as a consequence of passive congestion and hypoperfusion, which, in turn, can be detected and monitored through liver function tests (LFTs). These tests, which include markers such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin (tBil), among others, serve as indirect indicators of the hemodynamic burden on the liver as well as the AHF's severity and progression.

Cachexia and sarcopenia are systemic conditions characterized by the loss of muscle mass with or without loss of fat mass. This is a feared complication in chronic diseases such as cancer and end-stage liver disease but has also been increasingly recognized in patients with HF as it severely affects patient quality of life, functional independence, and overall prognosis. Recent observations suggest a potential link between low levels of ALT and the presence of cachexia/sarcopenia, adding a layer of complexity to their role in evaluating patients with AHF. We therefore aimed to assess the association between LFTs and the clinical presentation, including congestion status, and outcomes in patients hospitalized for AHF in the STRONG-HF (Safety, Tolerability and efficacy of Rapid Optimization, helped by NT-proBNP testinG, of Heart Failure therapies) trial. We also aimed to assess trajectories of LFTs during rapid up-titration of HF guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) as compared to usual care (UC).

### Effect of minor liver function test abnormalities and values within the normal range on survival in heart failure [^116E2jKc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Liver function test (LFT) abnormalities are often observed in patients with heart failure (HF). However, the relation of LFTs with outcomes has not been well described. Patients of the VA Palo Alto Health Care System (3 inpatient facilities and 7 community clinics) with a complete set of LFTs in the 60 days before a first HF diagnosis were included in the analysis from January 2005 to April 2013. A total of 2,096 patients met inclusion criteria. Patients were a mean of 71 ± 12 years old, 97% were men, 57% had a previous diagnosis of ischemic heart disease, and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 51 ± 12%. The median (twenty fifth and seventy fifth) values were albumin 3.6 g/dl (3.3, 3.9), alanine transaminase 21 IU/L (16, 30), aspartate transaminase 24 IU/L (20,31), AP 70 IU/L (57, 87), and total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dl (0.6, 1.0). There were 851 deaths (41%) over a mean duration of 41 ± 27 months. Mortality significantly increased with lower values of albumin and alanine transaminase and higher levels of aspartate transaminase and AP. The association with total bilirubin was not significant. In conclusion, many LFT values in the "normal" range are independently associated with decreased survival beyond traditional risk factors for mortality in HF.

### Jaundice in the intensive care unit [^1168E8GG]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia, or jaundice, is common in the ICU, with incidence up to 40% among critically ill patients. Unfortunately, it is poorly understood in the critically ill, and too often presents a diagnostic dilemma to the ICU physician. Causes of jaundice in the ICU are multiple; the etiology in any given patient, multifactorial. Acute jaundice can be a harbinger or marker of sepsis, multisystem organ failure (MSOF), or a reflection of transient hypotension (shock liver), right-sided heart failure, the metabolic breakdown of red blood cells, or pharmacologic toxicity. Acute ICU jaundice is best divided into obstructive and nonobstructive. This stratification directs subsequent management and therapeutic decisions.

### Refining liver safety risk assessment: application of mechanistic modeling and serum biomarkers to cimaglermin alfa (GGF2) clinical trials [^115LUK22]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Liver function test abnormalities in cimaglermin alfa‐treated subjects

Two phase I studies of cimaglermin alfa were conducted in patients with heart failure. In the first study, an elevation in serum aminotransferases and total and conjugated bilirubin was encountered in the 40th subject who received the highest planned dose of 1.5 mg/kg (Table 1). In the second study, the 22nd of 28 planned subjects who received the highest planned dose of 0.38 mg/kg also experienced elevations in serum aminotransferases and total and conjugated serum bilirubin (Table 2). In both cases, the biochemical abnormalities returned to near baseline within 2 weeks; long‐term follow‐up demonstrated no subsequent evidence of hepatic injury or dysfunction. However, both subjects experienced aminotransferase levels > 3× ULN and total bilirubin > 2× ULN with no other obvious cause than cimaglermin alfa, thus satisfying Hy's Law criteria, and further development of cimaglermin alfa was put on hold.

Table 1
Liver chemistries for subject meeting Hy's Law criteria in phase Ia trial

Table 2
Liver chemistries for subject meeting Hy's Law criteria in phase Ib trial

Hy's Law cases typically present as an increase in serum aminotransferases (due to hepatocyte necrosis) preceding and rising to a greater extent than elevations of total serum bilirubin (due to liver dysfunction). However, the pattern of enzyme elevations observed in the two subjects described above did not fit this profile, as total (and conjugated) bilirubin was elevated concurrently and to a similar extent as serum aminotransferases (Tables 1, 2).

### Diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction in adults with failing fontan circulation [^111GCPCH]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of the failing Fontan circulation due to diastolic dysfunction

Role of biomarkers in diagnosis failing Fontan circulation with diastolic dysfunction

Patients with chronic Fontan circulation typically exhibit mildly elevated plasma hemoglobin levels during the stable chronic phase, alongside a relatively low platelet count likely due to liver dysfunction and hypersplenism resulting from portal hypertension. Hyponatremia and hyperuricemia are also frequently observed, reflecting the overall severity of HF. Total bilirubin and γ-glutamyltransferase levels in plasma are usually elevated in proportion to liver congestion (40%-60%), whereas liver enzyme levels (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) often remain within the normal range and plasma cholesterol levels are low.

In acquired heart diseases, activation of cell signaling systems, such as activation of natriuretic peptides and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, occurs in response to ischemia or abnormal cardiac distension resulting from pressure or volume loading. Although specific activation pathways in congenital heart disease are less understood, elevated biomarkers indicate similar activation. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been extensively studied in congenital heart disease, with elevated serum levels observed in patients with poorer cardiovascular function or prognosis.

### Survival after heart transplant listing for infants on mechanical circulatory support [^116JayJE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Our findings showing a difference in outcomes between infants with cardiomyopathy and CHD are supported by previous literature, including a report by Conway et al, who examined the outcomes of 97 patients < 10 kg supported with the Berlin Heart EXCOR, and found 57% of patients were able to achieve good outcomes (weaned or transplanted), with this number decreasing to 27% in patients weighing < 5 kg. 5 When the results from this study are examined more closely, it is clear that the patients < 10 kg were not homogeneous, with 26 (26.8%) patients having a diagnosis of CHD. The authors observed that for patients with no CHD and < 10 kg, no preimplant ECMO, and a normal bilirubin, 87.5% were successfully supported to HTx. However, this rate dropped to 30.8% in those with CHD, and even further for patients with CHD on ECMO and/or who had an elevated bilirubin. These reported survival patterns remained true for those < 5 kg, with a 66.7% success rate in children without CHD, who did not require pre‐ECMO and had normal bilirubin; whereas only 1 of 12 infants with CHD < 5 kg (n = 13) survived to transplant. 5 This is similar to our results in patients < 5 kg, where most had single‐ventricle physiological features and a survival rate of 44% at 3 months after VAD implant. These results are in contrast to children < 10 kg with cardiomyopathy or myocarditis, in whom survival to HTx on VAD therapy has been reported to be as high as 91%. 11 This is consistent with our observation of excellent survival on device therapy for small patients with cardiomyopathy.

### Imatinib oral (Imkeldi) [^113B97QE]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Congestive Heart Failure and Left Ventricular Dysfunction

Congestive heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction have been reported in patients taking imatinib. Cardiac adverse reactions were more frequent in patients with advanced age or co-morbidities, including previous medical history of cardiac disease. In an international randomized Phase 3 study in 1106 patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase, severe cardiac failure and left ventricular dysfunction were observed in 0.7% of patients taking imatinib compared to 0.9% of patients taking IFN + Ara-C. In another randomized trial with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML patients in chronic phase that compared imatinib and nilotinib, cardiac failure was observed in 1.1% of patients in the imatinib arm and 2.2% of patients in the nilotinib 300 mg twice daily arm and severe (Grade 3 or 4) cardiac failure occurred in 0.7% of patients in each group. Carefully monitor patients with cardiac disease or risk factors for cardiac or history of renal failure.

Evaluate and treat any patient with signs or symptoms consistent with cardiac or renal failure.

5.4 Hepatotoxicity

Hepatotoxicity, occasionally severe, may occur with Imkeldi [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Cases of fatal liver failure and severe liver injury requiring liver transplants have been reported with both short-term and long-term use of imatinib. Monitor liver function (transaminases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase) before initiation of treatment and monthly, or as clinically indicated. Manage laboratory abnormalities with Imkeldi interruption and/or dose reduction [see Dosage and Administration (2.13)]. When imatinib is combined with chemotherapy, liver toxicity in the form of transaminase elevation and hyperbilirubinemia has been observed. Additionally, there have been reports of acute liver failure.

Monitoring of hepatic function is recommended.

### Dual-organ transplantation: indications, evaluation, and outcomes for heart-kidney and heart-liver transplantation: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115QpNMx]. Circulation (2023). High credibility.

Heart transplant candidates — liver function tests carry prognostic information relevant to outcomes. Hypoalbuminemia is associated with increased risk of worsening HF, urgent cardiac transplantation, and death. Abnormal aspartate/alanine aminotransferases (AST/ALT) are associated with congestion, elevated right-sided filling pressures, increased mortality. In multivariate analysis, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and not transaminases independently predicted HT-free survival. Total bilirubin (TB) predicts composite cardiovascular outcomes in chronic HF and predicts death or HT in a study of 1032 patients (HR, 1.28). Peak international normalized ratio (INR) > 2 is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with hypoxic hepatitis, and INR may be elevated because of anticoagulation.

### Sacubitril / valsartan on right ventricular-pulmonary artery coupling and albumin-bilirubin score in heart failure in Chinese patients with reduced ejection fraction [^112muowx]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Lastly, conventional liver function parameters serve as predictors of cardiovascular disease in patients with HFrEF. The decreased cardiac output and systemic stasis lead to hypoxic ischemia in liver cells, a condition commonly seen in patients with HF. This hepatic injury, termed cardiac hepatopathy, occurs due to liver congestion resulting from elevated right-sided filling pressures. Among patients with HFrEF enrolled in PARADIGM-HF, total bilirubin was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality or hospitalization related to cardiovascular disease. Sacubitril/valsartan improved liver function measures in comparison with enalapril. Currently, the most widely employed method for hepatic evaluation is the Child–Pugh score. However, this scoring system incorporates several subjective variables, such as the presence of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. The ALBI score is calculated by analyzing albumin and bilirubin concentrations. It is easier and more objective than the Child–Pugh score. It seems that the decrease in ALBI score can be attributed to a reduction in pulmonary venous pressure and improved LV function. These changes in cardiac geometry and reduced LA pressure subsequently lead to a decrease in PA pressure and, consequently, central venous pressure. This improvement in hemodynamics results in reduced liver portal pressure, which accounts for the observed change in ALBI score. According to our study findings, the enhancement in RA-PA coupling is not contingent upon LV remodeling. This suggests that elevated venous pressure in patients with HF is more likely to be the cause of abnormal liver function. Additionally, our research indicates that sacubitril-valsartan may not only improve right heart function but also reverse liver damage in these patients.

In our study, a novel class of drugs, sacubitril/valsartan, seems to enhance RV function. Nevertheless, these findings will require validation in more extensive cohorts with a prolonged follow-up period to establish their reliability and significance.

However, our study has some limitations, including the fact that no randomization was performed between sacubitril/valsartan and placebo. To confirm these preliminary results, a properly powered multicentric study and randomized trials will be necessary as the current the involved a relatively small cohort and had a single-center retrospective design.

### Hepatic biomarker abnormalities in the cardiac intensive care unit: proposed criteria for cardiohepatic syndrome [^114rNton]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Noncardiovascular end-organ dysfunction has been increasingly recognized as an important determinant of outcomes in critically ill patients with acute cardiac disease. Although respiratory and renal failure are more common within the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) population, those with abnormal liver biomarkers are at particularly high risk of adverse outcomes. The term "cardiohepatic syndrome" (CHS) has been used to describe the complex interplay between acute cardiovascular disease and hepatic dysfunction, most often in the context of heart failure (HF). While there are numerous serum biomarkers reflecting liver disease (commonly if imprecisely termed liver function tests [LFTs]), including hepatocellular injury (eg, aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) or cholestasis (eg, alkaline phosphatase [ALK] and total bilirubin [TBili]), prior CICU studies have focused on limited definitions of acute liver injury or dysfunction based on single biomarkers or administrative codes.

Abnormal LFTs are frequently observed in patients with acute HF secondary to impaired hepatic perfusion and systemic venous congestion, with a prevalence of 11% to 62%. Prior studies of acute and chronic HF patients have found associations between abnormal LFTs and higher mortality across the spectrum of left ventricular function, including both markers of hepatocellular injury and cholestasis. Likewise, elevated levels of hepatocellular injury biomarkers are associated with higher mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) and acute myocardial infarction. Additionally, in-hospital risk prediction tools such as the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Multi-Organ Dysfunction scores incorporate LFTs, reflecting their association with mortality in unselected critically ill patients.

These short-term outcome studies highlight the importance of abnormal LFTs for prognostication but fail to adequately describe the full spectrum of acute liver injury and dysfunction in the modern CICU population. Accordingly, we examined the associations between in-hospital and long-term outcomes with the extent and severity of admission LFT abnormalities in a large and heterogeneous CICU cohort. We hypothesized that a greater extent and severity of LFT abnormalities would be positively associated with higher in-hospital and 1-year mortality in a heterogeneous CICU population.

### Does bilirubin protect against developing diabetes mellitus? [^113u8dfM]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2016). Low credibility.

After 25 years of evaluating bilirubin as a possible protective agent in neonatal and cardiovascular disease, interest has moved on to a exploring a possible protective role in diabetes mellitus (DM). This review finds conflicting prospective data for a protective relationship though there are retrospective, case-controlled data, that can only show association, which is not causality. Only prospective studies can show causality. Also, it would appear that the underlying biochemical assumptions do not readily translate from the animal to the human setting. Given that many factors impact on circulating bilirubin levels, it is not surprising that a clear-cut answer is not available; the jury is still out. Any relationship between DM and bilirubin might relate to intermediates in bilirubin metabolism, including relationships involving the genes for the enzymes participating in those steps. Nevertheless, the pursuit of bilirubin in disease causation is opening new avenues for research and if it is established that serum bilirubin can predict risks, much will have been achieved. The answer may have to come from molecular genetic analyses.

### Decoding the liver-heart axis in cardiometabolic diseases [^113mqf7n]. Circulation Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Many individuals with CH are asymptomatic, with hepatic symptoms often overshadowed by HF. When present, symptoms include right upper quadrant discomfort from hepatomegaly, jaundice due to impaired bilirubin clearance, ascites from elevated venous pressure, nausea, vomiting, and peripheral oedema — though oedema often reflects HF more than hepatic dysfunction. Treatment focuses on optimizing cardiac function and relieving congestion. Diuretics, especially loop diuretics, are key but require careful dosing to avoid hepatorenal syndrome. Sodium restriction and fluid management support therapy, and paracentesis may be needed for refractory ascites.

Tricuspid valve disease (TVD), particularly tricuspid regurgitation (TR), can lead to liver damage even in the absence of overt HF. Severe TR can cause retrograde blood flow, leading to elevated CVP. This pressure is transmitted to the hepatic veins, resulting in hepatic congestion. Over time, this congestion can cause hepatocellular injury and fibrosis. In a retrospective study involving 435 patients with severe TR, 14.5% had documented liver disease, and elevated liver enzymes were common. In another cohort, 11% of patients with severe isolated TR exhibited liver disease, highlighting the relevance of hepatic involvement in this population. Importantly, liver stiffness assessed via transient elastography is an independent predictor of adverse outcomes in patients with TR. These findings underscore the importance of assessing liver function in patients with severe TR, even in the absence of HF, as hepatic involvement may influence management strategies and outcomes.

### Use of assist devices and ECMO to bridge pediatric patients with cardiomyopathy to transplantation [^111RkRRC]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Pulsatile ventricular assist devices (VADs) are used to bridge adults with end-stage heart disease to transplantation. A combination of external implantable pulsatile and continuous-flow external mechanical support now can be used to bridge pediatric patients with end-stage cardiomyopathy to orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT).

Methods

We reviewed consecutive pediatric patients with cardiomyopathy (n = 28) who required mechanical cardiac support from July 1995 to February 2001. All were OHT candidates with severe hemodynamic compromise despite maximal medical support. We excluded from this series patients who had undergone cardiotomy.

Results

Nineteen patients received support from external continuous-flow devices, either with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or with centrifugal VADs, and 9 patients received pulsatile support. Nineteen of 28 (68%) patients were successfully bridged to transplant (17) or weaned (2) from their devices after recovery. Of the patients successfully bridged to transplant or recovery, 89% are alive to date. Univariate analysis revealed that a lower bilirubin concentration after 2 days of support was associated with a favorable outcome (p = 0.006). As expected, the patients with pulsatile VADs had significantly higher rates of extubation and oral feeding.

Conclusion

Pulsatile and continuous-flow devices can complement each other to significantly extend the lives of a wide range of pediatric patients with severe cardiomyopathies.

### Echocardiographic correlates of abnormal liver tests in patients with exacerbation of chronic heart failure [^113attGM]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated total bilirubin (TB) and transaminases are frequently reported in patients with heart failure and are related to their worse prognosis. On the basis of hemodynamic data from previous studies, the investigators hypothesized that elevated bilirubin and transaminases are associated with different patterns of cardiac remodeling and dysfunction in patients with heart failure (i.e., elevated bilirubin with predominantly right-heart dysfunction and elevated transaminases with predominantly left-heart dysfunction). Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively echocardiographic correlates of elevated TB and transaminases on admission in patients with exacerbation of chronic heart failure.

Methods

The following echocardiographic parameters were prospectively analyzed in 150 patients (mean age, 75 years; 59% men): right ventricular end-diastolic diameter, right atrial area, tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricular systolic pressure, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, tricuspid lateral annulus systolic velocity, estimated right atrial pressure, portal vein pulsatility index (PVPI), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), left ventricular ejection fraction, and cardiac index.

Results

Elevated TB was found in 61 patients (41%) and elevated transaminases in 46 patients (31%). In univariate logistic regression analysis, right ventricular end-diastolic diameter, right atrial area, tricuspid regurgitation, estimated right atrial pressure, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, tricuspid lateral annulus systolic velocity, PVPI, left ventricular ejection fraction, and cardiac index were significant predictors of elevated TB (P < .05 for all). LVEDD indexed to body surface area, right ventricular end-diastolic diameter, and systolic blood pressure on admission were significant predictors of elevated transaminases (P < .05 for all). In a multivariate regression model, only PVPI remained a significant predictor of elevated TB and LVEDD indexed to body surface area of elevated transaminases. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of PVPI > 0.5 in the prediction of elevated TB were 81%, 87%, 82%, and 87%, respectively.

Conclusion

Several echocardiographic indices of right-heart dysfunction and low cardiac index are related to elevated TB, with an increased PVPI having the best predictive value. A weak statistically significant association was found between elevated transaminase levels and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter indexed to body surface area.

### Refining liver safety risk assessment: application of mechanistic modeling and serum biomarkers to cimaglermin alfa (GGF2) clinical trials [^1133GyXU]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

One limitation of the current study is that the percent hepatocyte loss estimated by DILIsym has not been validated experimentally. A second limitation is a lack of experimental data to assess potential impacts of cimaglermin alfa on hepatocellular ATP levels. Given the absence of such data, ATP levels were not varied in the simulations. Another limitation is that the patients included in the phase I studies received a single dose of cimaglermin alfa, while chronic therapy would be required in the target population. In addition, in the current study DILIsym was not parameterized for heart failure patients. While liver function test (LFT) abnormalities are common in heart failure patients, little is currently known about the effects of heart failure on hepatic function. 19, 20, 21 In the current study the subjects had normal baseline LFTs. Reduced baseline hepatic function may be more likely in heart failure patients with abnormal baseline LFTs. Hepatocyte loss of 13% may be more clinically meaningful in patients with impaired liver function prior to treatment with cimaglermin alfa.

In conclusion, the mechanistic biomarker data and DILIsym analyses, suggest that less than 13%, primarily apoptotic, hepatocyte loss occurred in cimaglermin alfa‐treated subjects with serum liver enzyme elevations in phase I clinical trials. This level of hepatocyte loss is not consistent with global liver dysfunction leading to the rise in serum bilirubin. It therefore seems likely that the rise in serum bilirubin observed in the two subjects was due to transient defects in bilirubin transport rather than loss of functional hepatocytes. Therefore, these two cases do not represent typical Hy's Law cases and should not be interpreted as necessarily indicating that cimaglermin alfa has a serious liver injury potential. These findings suggest that mechanistic hepatic safety biomarkers, combined with mathematical modeling, can improve the interpretation of traditional liver safety signals. To fully understand both the value and limitations of these novel approaches, broad application to clinical trials is necessary. Efforts are currently under way by several groups, including the SAFE‐T (Safer and Faster Evidence‐based Translation) consortium, the IMI (Innovative Medicines Initiative), and the DILI‐sim Initiative, to understand how mechanistic biomarkers and modeling can improve the assessment of liver injury.

### Liver tests, cardiovascular outcomes and effects of empagliflozin in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction: the EMPEROR-preserved trial [^115Nxnnk]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

The prognostic implication of elevated liver tests in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is uncertain. This analysis investigates the association of liver markers with hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) and cardiovascular death (CVD), and the treatment effect of empagliflozin across the range of liver marker levels.

Methods and Results

The double-blind, placebo-controlled EMPEROR-Preserved (EMPagliflozin outcomE tRial in Patients With chrOnic heaRt Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction) enrolled 5988 patients with HFpEF (ejection fraction > 40%). Patients in New York Heart Association class II-IV and elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10mg daily or placebo in addition to usual therapy. Patients with significant liver disease were excluded. The primary endpoint was time to first adjudicated HHF or CVD. We explored the association of liver function abnormalities with heart failure outcomes in patients on placebo, the effects of empagliflozin on liver tests and the treatment effects of empagliflozin on heart failure outcomes across categories of liver laboratory values. High alkaline phosphatase (p trend < 0.0001), low albumin (p trend < 0.0001) and high bilirubin (p = 0.02) were associated with poorer outcomes for HHF or CVD, while high aspartate aminotransferase was not, and high alanine aminotransferase was associated with better outcomes. Empagliflozin had no significant effects on liver tests compared to placebo except for albumin which was significantly increased. The treatment effect of empagliflozin on outcomes was not modified by liver tests.

Conclusion

Abnormalities of liver function tests are associated differently with heart failure outcomes. Salutary effects of empagliflozin on liver tests were not observed although albumin increased. The treatment benefits of empagliflozin were not affected by baseline values of liver parameters.

Congestive heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction have been reported in patients taking imatinib mesylate. Cardiac adverse reactions were more frequent in patients with advanced age or co-morbidities, including previous medical history of cardiac disease. In an international randomized Phase 3 study in 1,106 patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase, severe cardiac failure and left ventricular dysfunction were observed in 0.7% of patients taking imatinib mesylate compared to 0.9% of patients taking IFN + Ara-C. In another randomized trial with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML patients in chronic phase that compared imatinib mesylate and nilotinib, cardiac failure was observed in 1.1% of patients in the imatinib mesylate arm and 2.2% of patients in the nilotinib 300 mg twice daily arm and severe (Grade 3 or 4) cardiac failure occurred in 0.7% of patients in each group. Carefully monitor patients with cardiac disease or risk factors for cardiac or history of renal failure.

Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy — maternal risks, management, and postpartum follow-up indicate that maternal complications are minimal and serum aminotransferase elevations do not appear to influence maternal symptoms or fetal outcomes; although symptomatic pruritus can reduce quality of life, this typically resolves within days to weeks postpartum; management includes lifestyle measures and UDCA as first-line therapy; the main risks are to the fetus, with increased risk of preterm birth, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, neonatal respiratory depression and asphyxia, and IUFD, with proposed mechanisms including toxicity of bile acids on cardiomyocytes and vasoconstrictive effects on placental chorionic veins, reduced lung surfactant and altered macrophage activity leading to respiratory distress syndrome, and higher rates of intrauterine meconium passage due to bile acid–induced increase in fetal gut motility; follow-up of women with ICP postpartum is recommended to confirm resolution of liver test abnormalities, with further evaluation reserved for those with persistent symptoms or liver test abnormalities.

### Usefulness of the direct and / or total bilirubin to predict adverse outcomes in patients with acute decompensated heart failure [^115uGK3F]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Abnormal liver function test results are often observed in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). However, the prognostic value of bilirubin fractionation has not been elucidated. The prognostic value of direct bilirubin (DB), in comparison with total bilirubin (TB), was examined in 556 consecutive patients with ADHF. Patients with elevated DB showed mostly similar patient characteristics including signs of elevated right-sided pressure (frequent hepatomegaly, jugular venous distention, dilated inferior vena cava, and elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase) and decreased cardiac output (cold extremities, decreased pulse pressure, and lower blood pressure) and other parameters of heart failure (HF) severity (increased plasma renin activity, decreased sodium, total cholesterol, and ejection fraction) to elevated TB; however, only patients with elevated DB showed a significant difference in the frequency of HF history and alkaline phosphatase value. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with elevated DB had a significantly higher rate of the composite end point of all-cause mortality or HF readmission (p = 0.021) compared with those with normal DB, whereas patients with elevated TB did not show a statistically significant difference compared with those with normal TB (NS). A multivariate Cox hazards model showed that DB was an independent predictor of adverse events (adjusted hazard ratio 1.052, 95% confidence interval 1.001 to 1.099, p = 0.034), whereas TB was not (adjusted hazard ratio 1.017, 95% confidence interval 0.985 to 1.046, p = 0.27). Adding DB to existing prognostic variables resulted in higher C-statistics than adding TB (C-statistics: 0.670 to 0.675, 0.670 to 0.674, respectively). In conclusion, elevated DB in ADHF was an independent prognostic predictor that was superior to TB. DB may be useful for further risk stratification in ADHF.

### Changes in liver function tests, congestion, and prognosis after acute Heart Failure: the STRONG-HF trial [^111Pzxam]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Our finding suggested an inverse association between ALT and outcomes, which contrasts with some previous studies in AHF. In several observational studies, elevated liver tests at admission have tended to be associated with a higher in-hospital mortality, but these cohorts included very diverse patients with hemodynamic abnormalities, high prevalence of cardiogenic shock, and high proportion of patients treated with intravenous inotropes. Furthermore, ALT values have predominantly been considered at hospital admission and not predischarge as in STRONG-HF. Although this may explain part of the diverging results, data from the EVEREST (Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure: Outcome Study With Tolvaptan) study suggest that liver enzymes remained practically unchanged from admission for AHF to discharge. In the SURVIVE (Utility of Serelaxin in Treating Acute Heart Failure) trial, elevated admission ALT or AST (defined by an upper normal limit of 47 U/L for ALT and 37 U/L for AST) was associated with an increased risk of mortality. This study enrolled patients with severe and hemodynamically unstable AHF requiring inotropic support (27% 180-day mortality), in contrast to STRONG-HF, which enrolled patients who were stabilized and ready for discharge (7% 180-day mortality). In SURVIVE, ALT and AST were above upper normal limit in 25% for ALT and 33% for AST, while only 11% and 16% of patients exceeded these thresholds in STRONG-HF. As, LFT abnormalities may stem from different central hemodynamic abnormalities, the laboratory profiles may differ in different HF phenotypes or stages. Patients with low cardiac output are more likely to develop a rise in aminotransferases, while those with predominant congestion should present more profound abnormalities in bilirubin or gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. This may explain the differences between the biomarker profile in each of the AHF studies. This is supported by the fact that elevated ALT/AST in SURVIVE was associated with less peripheral edema and ascites, and with higher pulse, lower blood pressure, and the presence of cold extremities. Also notable is that acute myocardial infarction was the reason for ADHF in 31% of patients with elevated ALT/AST, compared to 9% in those with normal levels, most likely reflecting that a proportion of the circulating concentrations originate from myocardial injury. Of note, decreasing ALT and AST from baseline to day 5 in SURVIVE was not associated with improved survival, in fact, numerically more patients with decreasing ALT died, as compared to increasing ALT.

### Circulating markers of liver function and cardiovascular disease risk [^112GFrQG]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

Measurement of serum concentrations of various liver enzymes and other nonenzymatic proteins and metabolites of heme metabolism (eg, bilirubin) is often undertaken in clinical practice. Measurement of these liver function tests is simple, quick, and relatively inexpensive. However, interpreting the liver function test results in patients without evidence of liver disease is often challenging. Concentrations of some of liver enzymes, such as γ-glutamyltransferase or alkaline phosphatase, and concentrations of liver-derived metabolites, such as bilirubin, may be influenced by metabolic processes beyond the liver, sometimes making interpretation of the test results difficult. This scenario frequently occurs both in individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease and in patients with known cardiovascular disease, often resulting in the clinicians ignoring the test results. In this brief review, we discuss the evidence for associations between key serum liver function tests and cardiovascular disease risk and where associations are robust; we provide an interpretation for possible mechanistic links between the liver function test and cardiovascular disease.

### Case report: an imported case of severe leptospirosis with septic cardiomyopathy requiring venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in Japan [^114KCtjr]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

A 29-year-old Japanese man presenting with fever, joint pain, and diarrhea was admitted to the intensive care unit for cardiogenic and distributive shock. We suspected leptospirosis based on conjunctival hyperemia, skin rash, elevated bilirubin, and renal involvement; a travel history to Laos was also suggestive. We confirmed the diagnosis with blood and urine polymerase chain reaction and microscopic agglutination tests using paired serum samples. His hemodynamics were unstable, and his echocardiogram showed diffuse and severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction on day 2. He initially required venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO) support but responded and recovered on antimicrobial therapy. His cardiac function and hemodynamics improved on day 5. Severe leptospirosis may cause jaundice, renal failure, pulmonary hemorrhage, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and central nervous system involvement; however, few studies have reported severe cardiac manifestations. Herein, we report the first case of septic cardiomyopathy secondary to leptospirosis that was successfully managed with V-A ECMO. Leptospirosis should be included in the differential diagnosis when a patient returning from an endemic area presents with cardiogenic shock. Furthermore, intensive care management with prompt initiation of V-A ECMO should be considered to reverse septic cardiomyopathy.

### Bilirubin adsorption versus plasma exchange for hyperbilirubinemia in patients after cardiac surgery: a retrospective study [^113PMgBe]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Our findings demonstrated that postoperative hyperbilirubinemia resulted in significantly increased in-hospital mortality, as the mortality was up to 85.7%, which was much higher than the reported early mortality between 19 and 25%. Patients in our study were all critical patients with severe congestive heart disease, and most of them were NYHA class III/IV. EuroSCORE II scores showed that these patients suffered huge risks of mortality and complications. Indeed, patients in our study had almost acute liver failure with MODS, and the mortality of MODS after cardiac surgery was reported to be up to 90%. Acute liver failure combined with MODS can cause disorder of the internal environment and hemodynamic instability. In this study, most patients suffered poor clinical outcomes, especially in the usage of IABP, ECMO, CRRT, etc. Almost all the patients died of MODS.

There have been limited studies regarding the optimal techniques for bilirubin removal, and no direct comparison exists between BA and PEX in patients after cardiac surgery. Recently, Chen X and his colleagues concluded that BA treatment was an effective and safe method for treating hyperbilirubinemia in patients after cardiac surgery. Our study added evidence that BA treatment not only had a higher bilirubin removal ability but also could lower the mortality and risks of poor clinical outcomes in patients with hyperbilirubinemia after cardiac surgery. Moreover, PEX treatment requires a large amount of plasma or albumin, which could be associated with limitations regarding plasma and patients with rare blood types. BA treatment has an advantage in this aspect; it can adsorb bilirubin in a competitive binding manner compared to albumin. After the free bilirubin in plasma is adsorbed, the bilirubin bound to plasma albumin is partially dissociated and then adsorbed, and albumin and coagulation factors are protected in this way.

### Bilirubin as a prognostic marker in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^116cNPEt]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Liver dysfunction reflects the status of heart failure, with congestion and low perfusion of the liver serving as causative mechanisms. Previous studies demonstrated relationship between the results of liver function test and the prognosis in patients with heart failure. However, few studies have examined this relationship in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

Methods

The subjects were 37 patients with PAH (8 men and 29 women; 18 with idiopathic PAH and 19 with connective tissue disease-associated PAH). A blood test was performed after a 3-month period free from hospitalization and without changes in functional class, treatment, heart sounds, body weight, or heart rate.

Results

In a mean follow-up period of 635 ± 510 days, 12 patients died due to heart failure, 2 died due to pulmonary hemorrhage, and 23 patients survived. Cox proportional hazard analyses identified functional class (p < 0.001), plasma concentration of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) (p = 0.001), and hyperbilirubinemia (serum total bilirubin > 1.2 mg/dL; p < 0.001; hazard ratio = 13.31) as predictors of mortality. Patients with hyperbilirubinemia had a worse functional class (P = 0.003), a higher right atrial pressure (p < 0.001), a higher plasma concentration of BNP (p = 0.004), and a larger Doppler right ventricular index of the right ventricle (p = 0.041).

Conclusion

Elevated serum bilirubin is a risk factor for death in patients with PAH.

### Survival after heart transplant listing for infants on mechanical circulatory support [^1171eCe9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Demographics and Clinical Characteristics of All Infants

Between, 2010 and 2018, 4728 patients were listed for primary HTx in PHTS, of which the study group consisted of the 2049 patients having a weight of < 10 kg at the time of listing. Within the study group, 40.2% (n = 823) had a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy and 59.8% (n = 1226) had CHD. In terms of MCS, 269 (13.1%) (n = 110 cardiomyopathy and n = 159 CHD) required ECMO support and 308 (15%) (n = 222 cardiomyopathy and n = 86 CHD) required VAD support at or after listing. There were 1472 patients who remained and did not require MCS support during their entire time on the wait list (Figure 1).

Table 1 highlights the demographic characteristics and differences between the CHD and cardiomyopathy cohorts. Notably, the patients with CHD were younger, smaller, and less likely to be on inotropes at listing. These patients also had a tendency toward a higher listing creatinine but similar levels of total bilirubin as patients with cardiomyopathy.

### Liver tests and outcomes in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: findings from DAPA-HF [^112cKecM]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Study limitations

This was not a pre‐specified analysis. Inclusion and exclusion criteria applied may have limited the generalizability of our findings. Specifically, patients with an AST or ALT more than three times the upper limit or normal (or bilirubin greater than twice the upper limit or normal) were excluded. We did not collect data on history of liver disease or alcohol intake. Other measures reflecting hepatic function, including albumin, platelet count and international normalized ratio, were not carried out in DAPA‐HF. We did not collect information on right‐sided filling pressures or right ventricular function. Regional variation in prevalence of sub‐hepatitis may account for some of the variation in abnormal liver tests, as patients were not screened for viral hepatitis. Scheduled sampling of liver tests occurred only at baseline and the end‐of‐study visit (between 12 and 28 months after randomization). Including only end‐of‐study visits may have introduced survivor bias and our supplementary analysis, including unscheduled visits, may not be a representative sample as there was an indication for additional investigation.

### The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation / Heart Failure Society of America guideline on acute mechanical circulatory support [^115sSN7i]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Cardiogenic shock — biomarkers and organ dysfunction for diagnosis, monitoring, and prognosis are summarized: Elevated arterial lactate levels are nonspecifically indicative of tissue hypoxia and are associated with mortality in CS. A peripheral oxygen demand–delivery mismatch will result in low central venous oxygen measurements, and serial measurements of arterial lactate and mixed venous oxygen saturation levels may be helpful to temporally monitor responses to therapeutic interventions. In acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cardiac troponin is noted to be elevated and has a rise-and-fall pattern consistent with acute ischemic injury, whereas N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide was not associated with short-term mortality in multivariable analysis in CS. Acute kidney injury with a rise in serum creatinine and a potential reduction in urinary output is associated with poor outcomes, and acute ischemic or congestive liver injury with marked transaminase, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase elevations and increased prothrombin time is linked to higher risk, with these patients having a 2.5-fold higher 30-day mortality than patients without acute liver injury. A paradigm change has expanded the pathophysiology in CS to include activation of a systemic inflammatory response, and classical inflammatory markers such as neutrophils have been associated with mortality in these patients.

### Multiorgan dysfunction and its association with congestion and outcome in aortic stenosis treated with TAVI [^117XKSbE]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Prevalence of biomarker abnormalities in aortic stenosis

In heart failure forms not attributable to AS, various pathophysiological pathways have been described to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis and disease progression. Most intuitively, increasing myocyte stress has been demonstrated to be measurable by serum levels of NT-proBNP, which represents the pre-prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide and is released by the ventricular myocytes in response to volume and pressure overload. Due to its diagnostic and prognostic capabilities, measurement of NT-proBNP levels has been adopted by heart failure guidelines. In the present study, NT-proBNP was significantly elevated in the overall sample with a median level of 1,800 pg/mL, reflecting the deleterious effect of increased afterload and preload on the ventricles in AS. The heart and kidneys are functionally interconnected through various mechanisms, among which renal venous hypertension and limited organ perfusion are believed to be of particular importance in chronic cardiorenal syndrome. The adverse effects of elevated markers reflecting kidney dysfunction have been extensively described for the general heart failure population; and also in the present AS cohort, kidney dysfunction was highly prevalent and seen in half of patients. The liver is particularly vulnerable to damage in the presence of heart failure with congestive hepatopathy, cardiogenic ischemic hepatitis, malnutrition, and systemic inflammation as underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Previous heart failure studies have linked elevated bilirubin and lower cholinesterase levels to unfavorable invasive hemodynamics (elevated central venous pressure, lower cardiac output). Hypoalbuminemia is also prevalent in heart failure and mainly influenced by nutritional status and systemic inflammation, whereas elevation of transaminases (due to ischemia) is much less common. In AS patients from the current study, hyperbilirubinemia (1/10), hypoalbuminemia (15%), low cholinesterase levels (1/5), and elevation of at least one cholestasis marker (∼40%) were observed in a significant proportion of patients. Conversely, elevated transaminases were only present in ∼5%, suggesting that the cholestatic type II cardiohepatic syndrome due to chronic congestion rather than the ischemic type I is the predominant cause of liver dysfunction in AS. Inflammation is known to be important for the pathogenesis and progression of many forms of heart failure, and CRP was detected in 3 of 4 patients with congestive heart failure in a landmark study in 1956. In line with these first observations, CRP elevation was observed in more than half of AS patients in the present study, highlighting a high prevalence of low-grade inflammation in this population. Finally, anemia has been described as a common comorbidity in heart failure. Fluid overload with a hemodilution effect and impaired erythropoiesis resulting from chronic inflammation and/or iron deficiency due to anorexia/malabsorption are among the main pathophysiological causes. Anemia was present in two-thirds of patients in the present AS cohort, which is significantly higher compared to proportions reported for congestive heart failure (median 18%).

### Enalapril maleate (enalapril maleate oral solution) [^114WKb5V]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hypotension

Enalapril can cause symptomatic hypotension, sometimes complicated by oliguria, progressive azotemia, acute renal failure or death. Patients at risk of excessive hypotension include those with the following conditions or characteristics: heart failure with systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, hyponatremia, high dose diuretic therapy, renal dialysis, or severe volume and/or salt depletion of any etiology.

In these patients, enalapril should be started under very close medical supervision and such patients should be followed closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of enalapril and/or diuretic is increased.

Symptomatic hypotension is also possible in patients with severe aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Surgery/Anesthesia

In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, enalapril may block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs and is considered to be through this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion.

5.4 Hepatic Failure

Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis, and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up.

5.5 Impaired Renal Function

Monitor renal function in patients treated with enalapril. Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, post-myocardial infarction or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on enalapril. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on enalapril [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.3)].

5.6 Hyperkalemia

Serum potassium should be monitored in patients receiving enalapril. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

### Bilirubin as a prognostic marker in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^112FCP8U]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have an increased risk of mortality, and half of the patients in World Health Organization (WHO) functional class IV die within 3 years, even after treatment with epoprostenol. Right heart failure is a major cause of death in patients with PAH. The prognosis of PAH is predicted by markers of heart failure including WHO functional class, the plasma concentration of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), history of right heart failure, 6-minute-walk distance, mean blood pressure of the right atrium, and Doppler right ventricular index (Tei index of the right ventricle). Despite use of these markers, however, prediction of survival for each patient remains as a challenge in cardiology.

Liver dysfunction reflects the status of heart failure, with congestion and low perfusion of the liver serving as causative mechanisms. The prognosis of heart failure has been associated with serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase and total bilirubin, but few studies have examined data from liver function tests as potential prognostic markers for patients with PAH. Therefore, we sought to determine whether the results of liver function tests could be used to predict prognosis in such patients.

### Clinical course and predictive value of liver function tests in patients hospitalized for worsening heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: an analysis of the EVEREST trial [^114uWnS5]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) are common in ambulatory heart failure (HF). The aim of this study was to characterize abnormal LFTs during index hospitalization.

Methods and Results

A post-hoc analysis was carried out of the placebo group of the EVEREST (Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure Outcome Study with Tolvaptan) trial, which enrolled patients hospitalized for HF with an ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 40% and no history of primary significant liver disease or acute hepatic failure. LFTs (abbreviation, cut-offs for abnormal values) including serum albumin (ALB, < 3.3 g/dL), aspartate transaminase (AST, > 34 IU/L), alanine transaminase (ALT, > 34 IU/L), alkaline phosphatase (AP, > 123 IU/L),γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT, > 50 IU/L), and total bilirubin (T Bili, > 1.2 mg/dL) were measured at baseline, discharge/day 7, and post-discharge. Co-primary endpoints were all-cause mortality (ACM) and cardiovascular mortality or first HF hospitalization (CVM + HFH). Study participants had a mean age of 65.6 ± 12.0 years, were mostly male, reported high prevalences of medical co-morbidities, and were well treated with evidence-based therapies. Baseline LFT abnormalities were common (ALB 17%, AST 21%, ALT 21%, AP 23%, GGT 62%, and T Bili 26%). Abnormal T Bili was the only marker to decrease substantially from baseline (26%) to discharge/day 7 (19%). All LFTs, except AP, improved post-discharge. Lower baseline ALB and elevated T Bili were associated with higher rates of ACM, and in-hospital decreases in ALB and increases in T Bili were associated with higher rates of both ACM and CVM + HFH.

Conclusion

LFT abnormalities are common during hospitalization for HF in patients with reduced EF and were persistent at discharge. Baseline and in-hospital changes in ALB and T Bili provide additional prognostic value.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^113iG5vj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Elevation of total bilirubin level — evaluation and interpretation: Elevated serum total bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. The first step in investigating elevated bilirubin is determining conjugated (direct) vs. unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated unconjugated or indirect bilirubin is due to over-production, decreased hepatic uptake, or decreased hepatic conjugation. In Gilbert's syndrome, affecting 3–7% of the US population, total bilirubin levels almost never exceed 6 mg/dl and are usually < 3 mg/dl; fasting or significant illness can increase the unconjugated bilirubin by 2- to 3-fold and will decrease with eating or administration of phenobarbital. In hemolysis, hemolysis infrequently causes a bilirubin level > 5 mg/dl unless co-existent renal disease, liver disease, or severe acute hemolysis is present. In asymptomatic, healthy individuals with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (< 4 mg/dl), evaluation should exclude medications that cause hyperbilirubinemia, exclude evidence of hemolysis, and confirm normal serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels; if these are found, then a presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome can be made and additional evaluation is not routinely necessary.

### Special considerations in interpreting liver function tests… [^114sDDx7]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Because the secretion of conjugated bilirubin into bile is very rapid in comparison with the conjugation step, healthy persons have almost no detectable conjugated bilirubin in their blood. Liver disease mainly impairs the secretion of conjugated bilirubin into bile. As a result, conjugated bilirubin is rapidly filtered into the urine, where it can be detected by a dipstick test. The finding of bilirubin in urine is a particularly sensitive indicator of the presence of an increased serum conjugated bilirubin level. In many healthy persons, the serum unconjugated bilirubin is mildly elevated to a concentration of 2 to 3 mg per dL or slightly higher, especially after a 24-hour fast. If this is the only LFT abnormality and the conjugated bilirubin level and complete blood count are normal, the diagnosis is usually assumed to be Gilbert syndrome, and no further evaluation is required.

Gilbert syndrome was recently shown to be related to a variety of partial defects in uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyl transferase, the enzyme that conjugates bilirubin. 25 Mild hemolysis, such as that caused by hereditary spherocytosis and other disorders, can also result in elevated unconjugated bilirubin values, but hemolysis is not usually present if the hematocrit and blood smear are normal. The presence of hemolysis can be confirmed by testing other markers, such as haptoglobin, or by measuring the reticulocyte count. Severe defects in bilirubin transport and conjugation can lead to markedly elevated unconjugated bilirubin levels, which can cause serious neurologic damage in infants. However, no serious form of liver disease in adults causes elevation of unconjugated bilirubin levels in the blood without also causing elevation of conjugated bilirubin values.

When a patient has prolonged, severe biliary obstruction followed by the restoration of bile flow, the serum bilirubin level often declines rapidly for several days and then slowly returns to normal over a period of weeks. The slow phase of bilirubin clearance results from the presence of delta-bilirubin, a form of bilirubin chemically attached to serum albumin. 26 Because albumin has a half-life of three weeks, delta-bilirubin clears much more slowly than bilirubin-glucuronide. Clinical laboratories can measure delta-bilirubin concentrations, but such measurements are usually unnecessary if the physician is aware of the delta-bilirubin phenomenon.

### Serum bilirubin and risk of respiratory disease and death… [^113okhnX]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

The regression estimate for COPD in men per 0. 1-mg/dL increase in bilirubin level was a 6% decrease and for mortality in men was a 3% decrease after accounting for other health indicators. The results for COPD and mortality in women were very similar. Conclusion Among patients with normal-range bilirubin levels in primary care practices, relatively higher levels of bilirubin were associated with a lower risk of respiratory disease and all-cause mortality. Serum total bilirubin is routinely measured in the primary care setting to identify hepatobiliary and hemolytic diseases. After excluding disease, moderately increased levels generally indicate benign hereditary hyperbilirubinemia. This common condition is caused by a deficiency in the liver enzyme uridine diphosphate–glucuronosyltransferase 1, which converts insoluble bilirubin to a form suitable for renal and biliary excretion.

We therefore examined the association between serum bilirubin levels and the incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and all-cause mortality in a large population-based cohort of primary care patients from the United Kingdom. Based on our findings, bilirubin levels within the normal range appear to capture information about patients that may reflect a combination of environmental and genetically determined susceptibility to respiratory diseases. 5 The strength of the associations seemed to weaken above 1 mg/dL for all outcomes, although significantly so only for mortality, which could reflect a real dose-response relationship with only a marginal physiological benefit beyond levels typically associated with Gilbert syndrome. However, the slight increase in mortality rates for women beyond 1 mg/dL could also indicate inclusion of some hepatobiliary disease cases.

Epidemiologic analyses of bilirubin levels have reported independent inverse associations with cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mortality. 13, 14, 21 Studies of cardiovascular disease have reported risk rate ratios per 0. 1-mg/dL increase in bilirubin of
0. 84 (95% CI, 0.
73. Moderately higher levels of bilirubin within the range considered normal were associated with reduced risk of respiratory disease and all-cause mortality. Further research is needed to investigate causal associations between bilirubin levels and respiratory outcomes. A fuller understanding of these mechanisms may lead to the potential use of targeted clinical treatments that mildly suppress UGT1A1 activity and moderately increase bilirubin levels.

### Jaundice in the adult patient… [^114cDjMN]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

PREHEPATIC CAUSES Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia results from a derailment of the necessary bilirubin conjugation in the hepatocyte. This problem may occur before bilirubin has entered the hepatocyte or within the liver cell. Excessive heme metabolism, from hemolysis or reabsorption of a large hematoma, results in significant increases in bilirubin, which may overwhelm the conjugation process and lead to a state of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. 10 Hemolytic anemias usually result in mild bilirubin elevation, to about 5 mg per dL, with or without clinical jaundice. Hemolytic anemias result from abnormal red blood cell survival times. These anemias may occur because of membrane abnormalities or enzyme abnormalities. Other etiologies of hemolysis include autoimmune disorders, drugs, and defects in hemoglobin structure such as sickle cell disease and the thalassemias.
11.

1 Typically, the disease results in a mild decrease in the activity of the enzyme glucuronosyltransferase, causing an increase in the indirect fraction of serum bilirubin. Gilbert syndrome is typically an incidental finding on routine liver function tests, when the bilirubin level is slightly increased and all other liver function values are within normal limits. Jaundice and further elevation of the bilirubin level may occur during periods of stress, fasting, or illness. However, these changes are usually transient, and there is no need to pursue treatment or liver biopsy.
1. Conjugated Hyperbilirubinemia The predominant causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia are intrahepatic cholestasis and extrahepatic obstruction of the biliary tract, with the latter preventing bilirubin from moving into the intestines. Viruses, alcohol, and autoimmune disorders are the most common causes of hepatitis. Intrahepatic inflammation disrupts transport of conjugated bilirubin and causes jaundice.

A CBC is useful in detecting hemolysis, which is indicated by the presence of fractured red blood cells and increased reticulocytes on the smear. 8 The risk of fatal hemorrhage in patients undergoing percutaneous liver biopsy is 0. 4 percent if they have a malignancy and
0. 04 percent if they have nonmalignant disease. 20.
