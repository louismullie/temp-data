## Question

using sucralfate for long periods of time- adverse effects

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the adverse effects associated with using sucralfate for long periods of time. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "long-term" means in the context of sucralfate's labeled indications and clinical practice. Then, I should verify the drug's pharmacokinetics and aluminum content to anticipate systemic risks. Next, I will review the FDA-labeled adverse effects and their frequencies. After that, I need to identify serious but rare risks that emerge with prolonged therapy, especially in special populations. I will then examine drug–drug interaction issues that can complicate chronic use. Finally, I should synthesize a risk stratification and practical monitoring plan, and confirm whether any guidelines directly address long-term safety or recommend alternatives.

> Let me first confirm the time frame for "long-term". Sucralfate is indicated for short-term treatment of active duodenal ulcer, typically 4–8 weeks, with maintenance therapy at reduced dose after healing, so "long-term" here means use beyond the labeled 8-week acute course, often extending to months or longer in practice, particularly when used off-label for GERD or radiation proctitis, where evidence is limited and duration varies by indication and response [^1133NLAC] [^1114F6Sr] [^113gmVvD] [^115orkSa] [^116XVHSc] [^1135tyt8] [^111TAa6Z].

> I need to check the pharmacologic profile to anticipate risks. Sucralfate is minimally absorbed systemically and acts locally by forming an ulcer-adherent complex and adsorbing pepsin and bile salts; however, it contains aluminum, and small amounts of aluminum can be absorbed and are renally excreted, which becomes clinically relevant in chronic kidney disease where aluminum excretion is impaired [^116wtm5f] [^113jdeqJ] [^1162VYtB] [^117PmJXi].

> Next, I should review common adverse effects from trials and labeling. Constipation is the most frequent, around 2% in large tablet studies, with other gastrointestinal effects such as nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence, dry mouth, and abdominal discomfort occurring in less than 0.5%, and neurologic complaints like dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, and vertigo also uncommon. Overall, adverse effects were reported in about 4.7% of treated patients and were generally mild and rarely led to discontinuation [^114f2PrV] [^111edAxy] [^113XTMyY].

> Hold on, I should verify serious but rare adverse effects that accumulate with longer exposure. Postmarketing reports include hypersensitivity reactions ranging from urticaria and angioedema to anaphylaxis, as well as laryngeal and oropharyngeal edema and bronchospasm. Bezoar formation has been reported, particularly in patients with delayed gastric emptying or receiving enteral nutrition. And hyperglycemia has been described, especially in patients with diabetes, prompting the need to monitor glycemic control during therapy [^114f2PrV] [^111edAxy] [^113XTMyY] [^112ehVTu] [^111trmpW].

> I will now examine the most consequential long-term risk: aluminum toxicity in renal impairment. Wait, let me verify the mechanism and clinical manifestations. In chronic kidney disease or dialysis, impaired aluminum excretion can lead to accumulation with osteomalacia, aluminum bone disease, and encephalopathy; the risk is magnified when other aluminum-containing agents are coadministered, and aluminum is not efficiently removed by dialysis because it is protein-bound, so prolonged sucralfate in CKD warrants caution and monitoring for neurologic and skeletal signs of aluminum toxicity [^1162VYtB] [^117PmJXi] [^112ehVTu] [^116k2hKZ].

> Next, I should review drug–drug interactions that complicate chronic therapy. Sucralfate can bind coadministered medications in the gut and reduce their bioavailability, including fluoroquinolones, digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin, H2 blockers, and others; spacing sucralfate 2 hours before or after these agents mitigates the interaction, but adherence to this schedule becomes more challenging with long-term multidrug regimens and may undermine control of comorbidities if not managed carefully [^115BP1M2] [^114k5NYa] [^116eAnwj] [^111uiRD8].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts where long-term use is sometimes used off-label. In pregnancy, sucralfate is often favored for GERD because of minimal systemic absorption, but aluminum exposure remains a theoretical concern with chronic use. In pediatrics, safety and efficacy are not established, and the lack of long-term aluminum safety data limits routine prolonged use. In the elderly, reduced renal function increases aluminum toxicity risk, so dose caution and renal monitoring are prudent [^111nok2b] [^1131iPxv] [^1135tyt8] [^115BP1M2] [^1145LMco] [^111V5KVY] [^114eG2tw].

> But wait, what if the indication is stress ulcer prophylaxis in the ICU rather than duodenal ulcer therapy. I should double-check comparative safety signals. Network meta-analyses suggest sucralfate may be associated with less ventilator-associated pneumonia than acid-suppressive agents, yet contemporary guidelines still prioritize PPIs or H2RAs for SUP based on bleeding prevention, with sucralfate as an alternative when pneumonia risk is a particular concern; this does not directly address long-term outpatient safety but underscores that prolonged acid suppression and sucralfate have different risk profiles in critical illness [^111WUCFk] [^114oU8go].

> I need to ensure the synthesis is clinically actionable. For patients with normal renal function using sucralfate beyond 8 weeks, the main predictable issues are constipation and the logistical burden of drug–drug separation. For those with CKD or on dialysis, I should avoid sucralfate when possible or use the lowest effective dose with vigilance for aluminum toxicity and consider periodic neurologic and bone health assessment. For diabetics, I should monitor for hyperglycemia and adjust antihyperglycemics as needed. And for anyone on interacting medications, strict 2-hour spacing is essential to preserve efficacy of concomitant drugs [^1162VYtB] [^117PmJXi] [^112ehVTu] [^116k2hKZ] [^115BP1M2] [^114k5NYa].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "long-term" could be defined uniformly as more than 6 months, but I should correct that. The appropriate definition of "long-term" varies by context and the adverse effect under study. For sucralfate, beyond-label use beyond 8 weeks already constitutes prolonged exposure, and the critical long-term safety concern is aluminum accumulation in CKD, which can manifest after months of therapy depending on renal function and co-exposures, so individualized risk assessment and monitoring are warranted rather than a fixed time threshold [^115i638H] [^1162VYtB] [^117PmJXi].

> In summary, I should confirm that the principal long-term adverse effects of sucralfate are aluminum toxicity in renal impairment, rare hypersensitivity and bezoar formation, occasional hyperglycemia, and persistent constipation, with chronic use also complicating polypharmacy via binding interactions. Given the lack of robust long-term safety data and the availability of alternatives, sucralfate should generally be limited to labeled durations or carefully selected scenarios, with explicit attention to renal function, concomitant medications, and patient-specific risk factors when extended therapy is contemplated [^114f2PrV] [^111edAxy] [^113XTMyY] [^117PZFVy] [^1162VYtB] [^117PmJXi] [^116XVHSc] [^1135tyt8].

Long-term sucralfate use is generally safe due to minimal systemic absorption [^113jdeqJ], but the most significant risk is **aluminum accumulation** in patients with impaired renal function, potentially causing osteomalacia, encephalopathy, and anemia [^1162VYtB] [^116k2hKZ]. Chronic use can also cause **constipation** [^1117nDrw] and, rarely, bezoar formation, especially with delayed gastric emptying or enteral feeds [^114f2PrV] [^111trmpW]. Hypersensitivity reactions (rash, urticaria, anaphylaxis) are uncommon but possible [^114f2PrV] [^113xS32x]. Monitor renal function in prolonged therapy, avoid in severe renal impairment, and separate dosing from other drugs to limit interactions [^116k2hKZ] [^111V5KVY] [^115BP1M2].

---

## Gastrointestinal adverse effects

- **Constipation**: The most frequent complaint, occurring in approximately 2% of patients [^114f2PrV].

- **Bezoar formation**: Rare but serious; risk increases with delayed gastric emptying, dehydration, or concomitant enteral tube feedings [^114f2PrV] [^111trmpW].

- **Other gastrointestinal effects**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal discomfort, flatulence, and dry mouth are reported infrequently [^114f2PrV] [^111LcuWE].

---

## Systemic aluminum absorption and toxicity

- **Aluminum absorption**: Small amounts of aluminum are absorbed orally; urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination [^1162VYtB].

- **Renal impairment risk**: In chronic renal failure or dialysis, aluminum excretion is impaired, leading to accumulation and toxicity (aluminum osteodystrophy, osteomalacia, encephalopathy) [^1162VYtB] [^116k2hKZ].

- **Monitoring**: Renal function should be monitored during prolonged therapy, and sucralfate should be avoided or used cautiously in patients with impaired renal function [^1162VYtB] [^111V5KVY] [^116k2hKZ].

---

## Hypersensitivity reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions are rare; reported events include **rash, urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis** [^114f2PrV] [^113xS32x]. Patients with known hypersensitivity to sucralfate or its components should avoid use.

---

## Drug interactions

Sucralfate can reduce the **bioavailability** of coadministered medications — such as fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin, and others — through binding in the gastrointestinal tract [^115BP1M2] [^114k5NYa]. To minimize interactions, administer other medications at least 2 hours before or after sucralfate [^115BP1M2] [^116eAnwj].

---

## Summary of adverse effects and recommendations

| **Adverse effect** | **Frequency** | **Clinical significance** | **Recommendations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Constipation | Common (2%) | Mild to moderate | - Manage with dietary changes <br/> - Laxatives |
| Bezoar formation | Rare | Potentially serious | - Use caution in patients with delayed gastric emptying <br/> - Monitor for obstruction |
| Aluminum toxicity | Rare | Serious in renal impairment | - Monitor renal function <br/> - Avoid in severe renal impairment |
| Hypersensitivity reactions | Rare | Potentially serious | - Discontinue immediately <br/> - Provide supportive care |
| Drug interactions | Common | Variable | Separate dosing by at least 2 hours |

---

Long-term sucralfate therapy is generally well tolerated, but clinicians should remain vigilant for **aluminum toxicity in renal impairment**, constipation, bezoar formation, and drug interactions. Regular monitoring and patient counseling are essential to minimize risks.

Pneumonia

Thirty-five RCTs (5452 patients) reported on pneumonia. PPIs ranked last compared with other interventions in terms of risk of pneumonia (ESM Table 7, Fig. 3 b). Network meta-analysis results showed that PPIs and H2RAs probably increase the risk of pneumonia compared with sucralfate (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.20, 2.27; moderate quality and OR 1.30; 95% CI 1.08, 1.58; moderate quality, respectively) but not compared with placebo or no prophylaxis (OR 1.09; 95% CI 0.72, 1.66; low quality). PPIs probably increase pneumonia compared with H2RAs (OR 1.27; 95% CI 0.96, 1.68; moderate quality), and no prophylaxis (OR 1.52; 95% CI 0.95, 2.42; moderate quality). H2RAs probably have no impact on pneumonia relative to placebo (Table 1, Fig. 2 b).

Mortality

Thirty-six RCTs (5498 patients) reported on mortality. The results provide moderate-quality evidence that there is no difference between any of the management options in terms of all-cause mortality (Table 1, ESM Fig. S5). Given that all estimates were similar and approximated no effect, we did not calculate SUCRA values for the mortality outcome.

Clostridium difficile infection

Only one trial reported Clostridium difficile infection; therefore, we could not provide a network estimate for this outcome.

Radiation proctopathy — medical therapy evidence indicates rectal sucralfate suspension showed benefit in small studies, while some enemas failed; hyperbaric oxygen and antioxidant vitamins showed improvements in select reports. In one prospective case series of 14 patients, rectal sucralfate suspension relieved symptoms in 11 patients over a mean follow-up of 6 months; sucralfate enemas (2 g twice daily) were superior to combined oral sulfasalazine and steroid enemas for symptom control (94% vs 53%, P < .05) in a randomized trial of 37 patients; and in a case series of 26 patients with moderate to severe radiation proctopathy, sucralfate suspension twice daily was associated with good symptom response in 77% by 4 weeks and 92% by 16 weeks. 5-aminosalicylic acid enemas and butyric acid enemas failed to significantly improve outcomes in a prospective open-label trial and in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial in 12 patients, respectively. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial of 120 patients, hyperbaric oxygen treatment yielded an absolute risk reduction for nonhealing of 32% (number needed to treat = 3), with a Cochrane review noting significant improvement in healing (P = 0.02). An open-label pilot of 20 patients using vitamin E (400 IU 3 times daily) and vitamin C (500 IU 3 times daily) reported significant symptomatic improvement in bleeding, diarrhea, and urgency.

### Sucralfate oral (sucralfate) [^116yqzz3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Sucralfate is only minimally absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The small amounts of the sulfated disaccharide that are absorbed are excreted primarily in the urine.

Although the mechanism of sucralfate's ability to accelerate healing of duodenal ulcers remains to be fully defined, it is known that it exerts its effect through a local, rather than systemic, action. The following observations also appear pertinent:

Studies in human subjects and with animal models of ulcer disease have shown that sucralfate forms an ulcer-adherent complex with proteinaceous exudate at the ulcer site.
In vitro, a sucralfate-albumin film provides a barrier to diffusion of hydrogen ions.
In human subjects, sucralfate given in doses recommended for ulcer therapy inhibits pepsin activity in gastric juice by 32%.

In vitro, sucralfate adsorbs bile salts.

These observations suggest that sucralfate's antiulcer activity is the result of formation of an ulcer-adherent complex that covers the ulcer site and protects it against further attack by acid, pepsin, and bile salts. There are approximately 14 to 16 mEq of acid-neutralizing capacity per 1 g dose of sucralfate.

### WITHDRAWN: medical treatments in the short term management of reflux oesophagitis [^111ZNWuS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Oesophagitis arises when reflux of acid from the stomach into the oesophagus causes mucosal inflammation. It is a common problem and a systematic review on the optimum treatment would be useful.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), prokinetic therapy, sucralfate and placebo in healing oesophagitis or curing reflux symptoms or both. To compare adverse effects with the different treatments.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the National Research Register until December 2004 and reference lists of articles. We also contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials assessing the healing of oesophagitis or reflux symptoms or both. Treatment involving PPIs, H2RAs, prokinetics, sucralfate and combinations either in comparison to another treatment regimen or to placebo for 2 and 12 weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviews independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

We included 134 trials involving 35,978 oesophagitis participants. Five RCTs evaluated standard dose of PPI versus placebo in 965 participants. There was a statistically significant benefit of taking standard dose PPI therapy compared to placebo in healing of oesophagitis (RR = 0.22; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.31). Ten RCTs reported on the outcome for H2RA versus placebo evaluating 1241 participants. There was statistically significant benefit of taking H2RA compared to placebo in healing of oesophagitis (RR 0.74,95% CI = 0.66 to 0.84). Three RCTs evaluated prokinetic therapy versus placebo in 198 participants. There was no statistically significant benefit of taking prokinetic therapy compared to placebo in healing of oesophagitis (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.10). Twenty six RCTs reported the outcome for PPI versus H2RA or H2RA plus prokinetics, evaluating 4032 participants. There was statistically significant benefit of taking PPI therapy compared to H2RA or H2RA plus prokinetics in healing of oesophagitis (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.59).

Authors' Conclusions

PPI therapy is the most effective therapy in oesophagitis but H2RA therapy is also superior to placebo. There is a paucity of evidence on prokinetic therapy but no evidence that it is superior to placebo.

### Sucralfate oral suspension (sucralfate) [^116245FV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Due to limited experience in humans with overdosage of sucralfate, no specific treatment recommendations can be given. Acute oral studies in animals, however, using doses up to 12 g/kg body weight, could not find a lethal dose. Sucralfate is only minimally absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.

Risks associated with acute overdosage should, therefore, be minimal. In rare reports describing sucralfate overdose, most patients remained asymptomatic. Those few reports where adverse events were described included symptoms of dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

Chronic radiation proctitis (CRP) — sucralfate retention enemas for rectal bleeding carry a strong recommendation with low-quality evidence and demonstrate benefit across trials. "Sucralfate retention enemas are a moderately effective treatment for rectal bleeding resulting from CRP. Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C". In a randomized, double-blind trial of sucralfate enemas (2 g in 20 mL water, twice daily) plus oral sulfasalazine (1 g, 3 times daily) versus prednisone enemas (20 mg in 20 mL water, twice daily) and oral placebo in 37 symptomatic patients, there was "clinical improvement in 94% and 53% of patients". A subsequent study of 26 patients treated with a "10% sucralfate suspension… twice daily" showed "negligible or complete cessation of bleeding in 23 patients (88%) after 16 weeks" and "no recurrent bleeding in 71%… followed for a median of 45 months (range, 5–72 mo)". Two small studies (n = 9 and n = 8) using sucralfate enema "(2 g in 20–50 mL of water or saline)" demonstrated healing or alleviation "in 89% and 100% of patients". An additional regimen evaluated "a 6-week course of sucralfate paste enemas (2 g of sucralfate mixed with 4.5 mL of water, twice daily)".

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of Sucralfate Oral Suspension die not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function (see PRECAUTIONS; Special Populations: Chronic Renal Failure and Dialysis Patients). Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should

be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

SCCM/ASHP stress ulcer prophylaxis — agents: We suggest using either PPIs or H2RAs as first-line agents for stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) in critically ill adults with risk factors for clinically important stress-related upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) compared with no PPIs or H2RAs (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). Compared with H2RAs, PPIs were associated with reduced clinically important UGIB (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.34–0.83), while sucralfate was associated with less pneumonia compared with PPIs (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.3–0.79) and H2RAs (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71–0.96). The panel notes that the certainty of evidence varied (very low to high), and meta-analyses suggest reduced UGIB with PPIs compared with H2RAs but possibly increased mortality; additionally, no evidence supports the concurrent administration of sucralfate and acid suppressants for SUP.

### Reducing adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors [^116ssB1K]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors effectively treat gastroesophageal reflux disease, erosive esophagitis, duodenal ulcers, and pathologic hypersecretory conditions. Proton pump inhibitors cause few adverse effects with short-term use; however, long-term use has been scrutinized for appropriateness, drug-drug interactions, and the potential for adverse effects (e.g., hip fractures, cardiac events, iron deficiency, Clostridium difficile infection, pneumonia). Adults 65 years and older are more vulnerable to these adverse effects because of the higher prevalence of chronic diseases in this population. Proton pump inhibitors administered for stress ulcer prophylaxis should be discontinued after the patient is discharged from the intensive care unit unless other indications exist.

### Efficacy and safety of stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill patients: a network meta-analysis of randomized trials [^111WUCFk]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) is commonly prescribed in the intensive care unit. However, data from systematic reviews and conventional meta-analyses are limited by imprecision and restricted to direct comparisons. We conducted a network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to examine the safety and efficacy of drugs available for SUP in critically ill patients.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials through April 2017 for randomized controlled trials that examined the efficacy and safety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), and sucralfate for SUP in critically ill patients. No date or language restrictions were applied. Data on study characteristics, methods, outcomes, and risk of bias were abstracted by two reviewers.

Results

Of 96 potentially eligible studies, we included 57 trials enrolling 7293 patients. The results showed that PPIs are probably more effective for preventing clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding (CIB) than H2RAs [odds ratio (OR) 0.38; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.20, 0.73], sucralfate (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.13, 0.69), and placebo (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.10, 0.60) (all moderate quality evidence). There were no convincing differences among H2RA, sucralfate, and placebo. PPIs probably increase the risk of developing pneumonia compared with H2RAs (OR 1.27; 95% CI 0.96, 1.68), sucralfate (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.20, 2.27), and placebo (OR 1.52; 95% CI 0.95, 2.42) (all moderate quality). Mortality is probably similar across interventions (moderate quality). Estimates of baseline risks of bleeding varied significantly across studies, and only one study reported on Clostridium difficile infection. Definitions of pneumonia varied considerably. Most studies on sucralfate predate pneumonia prevention strategies.

Conclusions

Our results provide moderate quality evidence that PPIs are the most effective agents in preventing CIB, but they may increase the risk of pneumonia. The balance of benefits and harms leaves the routine use of SUP open to question.

### Sucralfate (Carafate) [^116eAnwj]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Drug In t e r a c t io n s

Some studies have shown that simultaneous sucralfate administration in healthy volunteers reduced the extent of absorption (bioavailability) of single doses of the following: cimetidine, digoxin, fluoroquinolone antibiotics, ketoconazole, l-thyroxine, phenytoin, quinidine, ranitidine, tetracycline, and theophylline. Subtherapeutic prothrombin times with concomitant warfarin and sucralfate therapy have been reported in spontaneous and published case reports. However, two clinical studies have demonstrated no change in either serum warfarin concentration or prothrombin time with the addition of sucralfate to chronic warfarin therapy.

The mechanism of these interactions appears to be nonsystemic in nature, presumably resulting from sucralfate binding to the concomitant agent in the gastrointestinal tract. In all case studies to date (cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, digoxin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and ranitidine), dosing the concomitant medication 2 hours before sucralfate eliminated the interaction. Because of the potential of CARAFATE to alter the absorption of some drugs, CARAFATE should be administered separately from other drugs when alterations in bioavailability are felt to be critical. In these cases, patients should be monitored appropriately.

Ca r cin o g enes i s, M u t agene s is, Im p a i r me n t of Ferti li t y

Chronic oral toxicity studies of 24 months' duration were conducted in mice and rats at doses up to 1 g/kg (12 times the human dose).

There was no evidence of drug-related tumorigenicity. A reproduction study in rats at doses up to 38 times the human dose did not reveal any indication of fertility impairment. Mutagenicity studies were not conducted.

T e r at o genic e ff e c t s

Teratogenicity studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to 50 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to sucralfate. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

N u r sing M o t he r s

It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when sucralfate is administered to a nursing woman.

### The effect of oral sucralfate on the acute proctitis associated with prostate radiotherapy: a double-blind, randomized trial [^114zA7FP]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Acute rectal complications occur in the majority of patients receiving external-beam radiotherapy for carcinoma of the prostate. Sucralfate has been proposed to reduce radiation-induced mucosal injury by forming a protective barrier on ulcer bases, binding local growth factors, and stimulating angiogenesis. However, there is conflicting clinical evidence as to whether sucralfate, taken prophylactically during radiotherapy, can ameliorate the symptoms of acute radiation proctitis.

Methods and Materials

A double-blind randomized trial was conducted at four Radiation Oncology Departments in Sydney, Australia, between February 1995 and June 1997. A total of 338 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer receiving small volume radiotherapy, of whom 335 were evaluable, were randomized to receive either 3 g of oral sucralfate suspension or placebo twice a day during radiotherapy. Patients kept a daily record of their bowel symptoms and were graded according to the RTOG/EORTC acute toxicity criteria.

Results

One hundred sixty-four patients received sucralfate and 171 received placebo. Both groups were well balanced with regard to patient, tumor, treatment factors, and baseline symptoms, except that the placebo group had a significantly more liquid baseline stool consistency score (p = 0.004). Patients kept a daily diary of symptoms during radiotherapy. After adjusting for baseline values, there was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to stool frequency (p = 0.41), consistency (p = 0.20), flatus (p = 0.25), mucus (p = 0.54), and pain (p = 0.73). However, there was more bleeding in the sucralfate group, with 64% of patients noticing rectal bleeding, compared with 47% in the placebo group (p = 0.001). There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to RTOG/EORTC acute toxicity (p = 0.88; sucralfate 13%, 44%, 43% and placebo 15%, 44%, 40% for grade 0, 1, and 2, respectively).

Conclusion

This study suggests that oral sucralfate taken prophylactically during radiotherapy does not ameliorate the symptoms of acute radiation proctitis and may increase acute bleeding. The cause of the increased bleeding in the sucralfate group is unclear. As the pathogenesis of acute and late reactions are different, late follow-up, which includes sigmoidoscopic evaluation, is currently being performed on this cohort of patients.

### Side effects of drug treatments for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease: current controversies [^112U5SDa]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The two main drugs used in the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease are proton pump inhibitors and histamine-2 receptor antagonists and both these agents have been implicated in a number of adverse effects, leading to considerable controversies related to their long-term use. This paper is aimed at a critical review of the published literature and the clinical significance of these reported side effects, most of which are associations rather than causal.

Drug Interactions

Some studies have shown that simultaneous sucralfate administration in healthy volunteers reduced the extent of absorption (bioavailability) of single doses of the following: cimetidine, digoxin, fluoroquinolone antibiotics, ketoconazole, I-thyroxine, phenytoin, quinidine, ranitidine, tetracycline, and theophylline. Subtherapeutic prothrombin times with concomitant warfarin and sucralfate therapy have been reported in spontaneous and published case reports. However, two clinical studies have demonstrated no change in either serum warfarin concentration or prothrombin time with the addition of sucralfate to chronic warfarin therapy.

The mechanism of these interactions appears to be nonsystemic in nature, presumably resulting from sucralfate binding to the concomitant agent in the gastrointestinal tract. In all cases studied to date (cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, digoxin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and ranitidine), dosing the concomitant medication 2 hours before sucralfate eliminated the interaction. Due to Sucralfate Oral Suspension's potential to alter the absorption of some drugs, Sucralfate Oral Suspension should be administered separately from other drugs when alterations in bioavailability are felt to be critical. In these cases, patients should be monitored appropriately.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Chronic oral toxicity studies of 24 months' duration were conducted in mice and rats at doses up to 1 g/kg (12 times the human dose).

There was no evidence of drug-related tumorigenicity. A reproduction study in rats at doses up to 38 times the human dose did not reveal any indication of fertility impairment. Mutagenicity studies were not conducted.

### WITHDRAWN: medical treatments for the maintenance therapy of reflux oesophagitis and endoscopic negative reflux disease [^116Yhdk7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) - reflux of stomach contents ± bile into the oesophagus causing symptoms such as heartburn and acid reflux - is a common relapsing and remitting disease which often requires long-term maintenance therapy. Patients with GORD may have oesophagitis (inflammation of the oesophagus) or a normal endoscopy (endoscopy negative reflux disease or ENRD).

Objectives

To assess the effects of continuous maintenance therapy in adults with GORD (both ENRD and healed oesophagitis).

Search Strategy

We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to 2003), EMBASE (1980 to 2003), CINAHL (1982–2003), and the National Research Register (Issue 2, 2003) and reference lists of articles. We also contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled studies comparing PPIs, H2RAs, prokinetics, sucralfate and combinations either in comparison to another treatment regimen or to placebo in adults with reflux oesophagitis and ENRD.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author extracted data from included trials and a second author carried out an unblinded check. Two authors independently assessed trial quality. Study authors were contacted for additional information.

Main Results

Maintenance of patients with healed oesophagitis: For a healing dose of PPI (generally the standard dose given by the manufacturer) versus placebo, the relative risk (RR) for oesophagitis relapse was 0.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.36); versus H2RAs the RR was 0.36 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.46) and versus maintenance PPIs the RR was 0.63 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.73). However overall adverse effects were also more common and headaches were more common when comparing healing PPIs to H2RAs. For a maintenance dose of PPI (half of the standard dose) versus placebo, the RR for oesophagitis relapse was 0.46 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.57) and versus H2RAs the RR was 0.57 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.69). Overall adverse effects were more common.H2RAs were of marginal help but beneficial for symptomatic relief. Prokinetics and sucralfate were also more effective than placebo. For ENRD patients: Limited data with one RCT showed benefit for omeprazole 10 mg once daily over placebo (RR 0.4; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.53).

Authors' Conclusions

The findings in this review support the long-term treatment of oesophagitis to prevent relapse, both endoscopically and symptomatically. Healing doses of PPIs are more effective than all other therapies, although there is an increase in overall adverse effects compared to placebo, and headache occurrence compared to H2RAs. H2RAs prevent relapse more effectively than placebo, demonstrating a role for PPI-intolerant patients. Prokinetics and sucralfate both show benefit over placebo, but the former is no longer licenced. There is only limited data for ENRD.

### Effect of histamine-2-receptor antagonists versus sucralfate on stress ulcer prophylaxis in mechanically ventilated patients: a meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials [^117PcLnM]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Subgroup analyses

Three trials that included a total of 373 patients (H 2 RA, n = 185; sucralfate, n = 188) provided data to allow us to conduct subgroup analyses based on early- or late-onset pneumonia. A total of 28 early-onset pneumonia events occurred among 185 patients (15.1%) receiving H 2 RA therapy compared with 41 events among 188 patients (21.8%) receiving sucralfate therapy, and we found no significant difference according to the incidence rates of early-onset pneumonia (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.07, P = 0.085). Only for the outcome of late-onset pneumonia did we find a significant difference suggesting higher frequencies of late-onset pneumonia with the patients receiving H 2 RA compared with those receiving sucralfate (H 2 RA: 36/185 [19.5%]; sucralfate: 10/188 [5.3%]; OR 4.36, 95% CI 2.09 to 9.09, P < 0.001). No heterogeneity was detected in those two subgroup analyses, and P values were 0.362 and 0.725, respectively.

Gastric colonization

Four studies assessing 413 participants who were randomly assigned to receive H 2 RA therapy (n = 206) or sucralfate therapy (n = 207) provided the information on gastric colonization. Pooled analysis of OR showed that there was a significant difference of gastric colonization between the two groups (OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.80 to 4.13), with heterogeneity among the trials (P of heterogeneity was less than 0.001). Sensitivity analysis indicated that the outcome was not robust until we excluded the study by Prakash and colleagues, and so the source of heterogeneity could be mainly from that trial. The heterogeneity disappeared after the removal of that study, and the remaining trails showed that there was a significant difference in gastric colonization between H 2 RA and sucralfate (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.29 to 3.19, P = 0.002, P of heterogeneity = 0.298, I² = 17.5%).

### Characterizing pharmacobezoar formation: a descriptive analysis from vigiBase [^111trmpW]. Clinical Toxicology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pharmacobezoars are concretions of drugs that can persist within the gastrointestinal tract and can lead to mechanical obstruction and pharmacological toxicity. We aimed to provide a descriptive analysis of reported cases of pharmacobezoar in VigiBase, the World Health Organization global database of adverse event reports for medicines and vaccines.

Methods

We conducted a descriptive analysis of all de-duplicated individual case safety reports related to pharmacobezoars recorded in VigiBase, from its inception in 1968 to March 2, 2025. In a subgroup analysis, we selected reports containing at least one Preferred Term related to drug overdose, misuse, or suicidal behavior to identify potential cases of acute intoxication.

Results

A total of 632 individual case safety reports related to pharmacobezoars were analyzed. These primarily involved male patients (n = 318; 50.3%), with a median age of 60.0years (IQR 43.0–71.0years). Overall, 432 reports (68.4%) described serious adverse drug reactions. The most frequently involved drugs were carbidopa/levodopa (n = 148; 23.4%), quetiapine (n = 63; 10.0%), sucralfate (n = 46; 7.3%), nifedipine (n = 41; 6.5%), and acetylsalicylic acid (n = 40; 6.3%). The subgroup analysis included 158 reports related to acute intoxications, mostly involving female patients (n = 103; 65.2%), with a median age of 43.0years (IQR 24.0–54.0years). Almost all were serious (n = 156; 98.7%), with quetiapine, venlafaxine, ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid, paracetamol, and lorazepam most frequently reported.

Discussion

The findings highlight the clinical severity and heterogeneous presentation of pharmacobezoars. Carbidopa/levodopa was frequently reported, possibly reflecting underlying conditions such as Parkinson disease with delayed gastric motility. The high prevalence of psychotropics underscores the need for targeted prevention in at-risk populations, particularly those with psychiatric comorbidities.

Conclusions

While pharmacobezoars are rare, their association with serious and potentially fatal outcomes warrants increased clinical awareness. Early recognition and appropriate management may be particularly important in cases involving high-risk drugs.

### Effect of histamine-2-receptor antagonists versus sucralfate on stress ulcer prophylaxis in mechanically ventilated patients: a meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials [^115VnfPh]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Stress-related mucosal damage might develop in the stomach and duodenum and progress to ulceration within 4 to 5 days after injury. Intensive care unit (ICU) patients are prone to develop stress-related gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Respiratory failure, hypotension, and coagulopathy are the strongest risk factors for clinically important GI bleeding, especially for those patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation, who have a 4- to 21-fold risk of stress ulceration compared with those patients without prolonged mechanical ventilation. Therefore, prophylaxis against stress ulceration traditionally has been recommended for the prevention of upper GI hemorrhage in critically ill patients. Antacids, which are the first agents employed to significantly decrease the incidence of stress ulcer, have been widely displaced by histamine-2-receptor antagonists (H 2 RA) and sucralfate because of the excessive nursing-time demand that results from frequent dosing and gastric pH testing. H 2 RA, such as ranitidine and cimetidine, blocks the secretion of gastric acid and raises the gastric pH, promoting the proliferation of bacteria - particularly, Gram-negative bacilli, tracheobronchial colonization, and nosocomial pneumonia - in the stomach. Sucralfate, which does not alter gastric pH, exerts its topical effect on ulcer disease by binding to the proteins of the ulcer site. Cook and colleagues found, in contrast, that universal prophylaxis may not be warranted as only 1 patient out of 1,000 treated would benefit from the prophylaxis. Saint and Matthay considered that stress ulceration prophylaxis never demonstrated a benefit in decreasing the incidence of mortality.

### Effect of histamine-2-receptor antagonists versus sucralfate on stress ulcer prophylaxis in mechanically ventilated patients: a meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials [^113jPUzo]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding

The events of clinically important GI bleeding were explored in three studies. The pooled analysis of the clinically important GI-bleeding rate for H 2 RA versus sucralfate showed a significant heterogeneity (P = 0.074, I² = 61.7%). On the basis of the results of the sensitivity analysis, one study was excluded. The subsequent analysis was based on two trials, and a total of 12 clinically important GI-bleeding events occurred among 667 patients (1.8%) in the H 2 RA group compared with 26 events among 673 patients (3.9%) in the sucralfate group. Nevertheless, the sample sizes were highly variable across trials, one of which contained more than nine times as many subjects as the others. Therefore, it was inappropriate to pool the data.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia

VAP data required for meta-analysis was available from eight studies. The incidence of VAP in the H 2 RA group was 243/998 (24.4%) and that of the sucralfate group was 199/1,006 (19.8%). Pooled analysis of OR showed that VAP was significantly less prominent among participants receiving sucralfate in relation to H 2 RA, and the results were robust and there was no evidence of heterogeneity (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.64, P = 0.011, P of heterogeneity = 0.236, I² = 24.2%; Figure 3).

Adverse reactions to sucralfate in clinical trials were minor and only rarely led to discontinuation of the drug. In studies involving over 2700 patients treated with sucralfate tablets, adverse effects were reported in 129 (4.7%).

Constipation was the most frequent complaint (2%). Other adverse effects reported in less than 0.5% of the patients are listed below by body system:

G a s t r oin t e s t inal: diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, gastric discomfort, indigestion, flatulence, dry mouth

De r ma t olo g i c a l: pruritus, rash

Ne r v ous S y s t em: dizziness, insomnia, sleepiness, vertigo

Ot he r: back pain, headache

P os t- ma r k e t in g: cases of hypersensitivity have been reported with the use of sucralfate tablets, including dyspnea, lip swelling, pruritus, rash, and urticaria.

Cases of anaphylactic reactions, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, edema of the mouth, Pharyngeal edema, respiratory tract edema and swelling of the face have been reported with an unknown oral formulation of sucralfate.

Bezoars have been reported in patients treated with sucralfate. The majority of patients had underlying medical conditions that may predispose to bezoar formation (such as delayed gastric emptying) or were receiving concomitant enteral tube feedings.

Inadvertent injection of insoluble sucralfate and its insoluble excipients has led to fatal complications, including pulmonary and cerebral emboli. Sucralfate is n ot intended for intravenous administration.

Mucosal protectant

Sucralfate is a mucosal protectant which adheres to the epithelial cells, creating a physical barrier against the acidic environment. When taken at 1 g thrice daily, it has been shown effective in managing GERD symptoms without adverse maternal or foetal events. As sucralfate is minimally-absorbed, it is considered safe for use in pregnancy.

Sucralfate use during lactation has not been studied, although it is likely safe due to limited maternal absorption.

PPI

In the acidic environment, PPIs irreversibly bind to the H + /K + -ATPase to prevent gastric acid production. However, PPI-induced gastric acid inhibition has a delayed onset. Many patients with GERD symptoms report dissatisfaction with PPI treatment.

Although most PPIs have been classified as category B drug in pregnancy, PPI use in pregnancy is reserved to those with GERD complications or those with symptoms not responding to other therapies. Omeprazole is classified as a category C drug, due to risk shown in animal studies.

Although there are potential adverse effects which have been associated with long-term PPI use includes kidney disease, dementia, bone fracture, myocardial infarction, infections, micronutrient deficiencies, and gastrointestinal malignancies, the strength of evidence connecting these adverse effects to PPIs is low; therefore, the connection between long-term PPI use with these possible adverse events are inconclusive. However, PPI therapy causes increased gastric pH, which may deplete the protective barrier function against ingested pathogens and increase vulnerability to enteric infections.

### Effect of histamine-2-receptor antagonists versus sucralfate on stress ulcer prophylaxis in mechanically ventilated patients: a meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials [^112X5net]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Data extraction

Two independent reviewers abstracted the data in a traditionalized format. The following information was sought from each article: first author identification, year of publication, country, study duration, sample size, duration of patient follow-up, participant characteristics (patient number and mean age), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score (range of scores was 0 to 71, with higher scores indicating a more severe illness), and intervention (drug and dose). Discrepancies in data extraction were to be resolved by consensus, referring back to the original article, and by contacting the study authors if necessary.

The primary end points of the meta-analysis were overt bleeding, clinically important GI bleeding, and VAP in the population of patients who received H 2 RA therapy in comparison with those who received sucralfate. Secondary end points were gastric colonization and ICU mortality.

In this study, overt bleeding was defined as signs of hematemesis, nasogastric aspirate containing blood or coffee-ground material, melena, or hematochezia, the last of which was a potential problem in the mechanically ventilated patients as a result of stress ulceration. Clinically important GI bleeding was defined as overt bleeding accompanied by at least one of the following: (a) a decrease in blood pressure of 20 mm Hg within 24 hours of bleeding, (b) a decrease in blood pressure of 10 mm Hg and an increase in heart rate of 20 beats per minute on orthostatic change after upper GI bleeding, or (c) a decrease in hemoglobin of 20 g/L and transfusion of 2 units of blood within 24 hours or gastric bleeding requiring surgery. We included the studies that precisely met the definition of 'ventilator-associated pneumonia' according to Cook and colleagues. The early-onset and late-onset pneumonias were diagnosed if they occurred during the first 4 days before or 4 days after the initiation of mechanical ventilation, respectively. Consequently, only patients observed for more than 4 days could be evaluated for the development of late-onset pneumonia. A patient was considered to have gastric colonization with high counts when quantitative culture of at least one specimen had more than 100 colony-forming units/mL, and ICU mortality was considered to occur as death from any cause between the date of random assignment and the end of the active study phase in the ICU.

### Does sucralfate reduce early side effects of pelvic radiation? A double-blind randomized trial [^115xXfGq]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

STUDY AND METHODS: A double-blind placebo-controlled study randomized 108 patients to investigate the effect of sucralfate on gastrointestinal side effects of pelvic radiation.

Results

Overall, pelvic radiation with the administered doses and fields and performed according to nowadays technical standards, was well tolerated. Comparison of the mean scores and the peak reactions for radiotherapy discomfort, diarrhoea and number of stools per day in the 80 evaluable patients showed no statistically significant difference between sucralfate and placebo.

Conclusion

Based on these results, the use of sucralfate can not be recommended as standard practice.

### Sucralfate therapy in NSAID bleeding gastropathy [^117WjWEy]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study was conducted to assess the efficacy of 2 g sucralfate suspension in treating gastric mucosal lesions caused by long-term treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Methods

Only patients given NSAIDs continuously for at least 2 months with positive fecal occult blood (FOB) and endoscopically confirmed mild to moderate mucosal lesions (Lanza scale, grades 2–4) were included. After 1-week run-in phase, patients were stratified into 2 groups according to gastropathy-related symptoms during the preceding 7 days (symptomatic vs. asymptomatic) and randomized to 2 g (10 mL) of sucralfate suspension or placebo twice a day over a 6-week period. NSAIDs were given according to each patient's dosage schedule and always after meals.

Results

Twenty-five patients received sucralfate and 25 received placebo. At the end of the study, 68% (17/25) of patients given sucralfate had no lesions (Lanza grade 0) on endoscopy compared with 35% (8/23) in controls (P = 0.042). The Lanza grades in patients given sucralfate were significantly improved compared with the placebo patients (P = 0.022).

Conclusions

In this target population selected according to positive FOB test and endoscopic evidence of mucosal injury, chronic administration of sucralfate significantly decreased NSAID-induced gastric erosions.

Acute RT-induced toxicity prevention

Clinical practice guidance

Dietary counselling and/or protein supplementation may reduce the risk of toxicity during pelvic radiotherapy.
Lactobacilli ± bifidobacteria containing probiotics may reduce acute RT-related diarrhoea.
A high-fibre diet may reduce the risk of toxicity during pelvic radiotherapy.

Non-pharmacological strategies to reduce GI toxicity include nutritional interventions and bowel preparation regimens. Probiotics, prebiotics and faecal microbiota transplantation have been trialled. Nutritional intervention strategies include dietary supplementation, counselling and dietary modification. Dietary modifications trialled include partial or complete replacement of normal nutritional intake with elemental (pre-hydrolysed liquid) diet, modified fat (including reduced fat intake and replacement of long-chain with medium-chain triglycerides), low lactose diets and modified fibre intake. High fibre diets may be beneficial possibly by enhancing production of anti-inflammatory short chain fatty acids. There is sound scientific rationale for many of these interventions, but there are inadequate data to say which of them make a useful difference. They are all potentially burdensome and should not be used outside the context of clinical trials.

New approaches aimed at limiting toxicity through attempting to exclude the GI tract from the radiation field (endorectal spacers, balloons, rectal emptying) have not improved GI outcomes. Synchronising bowel evacuation with treatment delivery showed that rectal gas is commonly responsible for rectal dimensional change. The aetiology of rectal gas is difficult to identify, control and eliminate. The benefit of daily enemas to control gas through the radiotherapy treatment pathway is unproven.

The introduction of daily adapted radiotherapy delivery techniques such as MR-guided radiotherapy may improve toxicity in patients, especially those prone to daily shifts in rectal positioning and dimension or with critical organs at risk abutting target volumes.multinational

Neither Cochrane review nor recentMultinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society for Oral Oncology guidelines were able to i dentify effective toxicity prevention by pharmacological agents. Pharmacological agents with potentially preventative effect for acute and late GI toxicity include aminosalicylates, corticosteroids with clodronate, superoxide dismutase, amifostine, magnesium oxide, misoprostol, octreotide, pentoxifylline, selenium, sodium butyrate, sucralfate, tocotrienols, vitamin Aand vitamin C and E. The studies are few, small and often contradictory so these agents should not be used except in clinical trials. Some agents (eg, mesalazine given during radiotherapy) may worsen symptoms. Data are now clear that glutamine supplementation does not prevent RT-induced diarrhoea.

### Pharmacological interventions for non-ulcer dyspepsia [^115qaJ86]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The commonest cause of upper gastrointestinal symptoms is non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) and yet the pathophysiology of this condition has been poorly characterised and the optimum treatment is uncertain. It is estimated that 450 million pounds is spent on dyspepsia drugs in the UK each year.

Objectives

This review aims to determine the effectiveness of six classes of drugs (antacids, histamine H2 antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, prokinetics, mucosal protecting agents and antimuscarinics) in the improvement of either the individual or global dyspepsia symptom scores and also quality of life scores patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia.

Search Strategy

Trials were located through electronic searches of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and SIGLE, using appropriate subject headings and text words, searching bibliographies of retrieved articles, and through contacts with experts in the fields of dyspepsia and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing drugs of any of the six groups with each other or with placebo for non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD).

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were collected on dyspeptic symptom scores either individual or global symptom assessments and also quality of life scores and adverse effects.

Main Results

A total of 11796 citations were obtained. 157 trials were retrieved and 98 trials fulfilled our eligibility criteria. However, subsequent data extraction was not possible in 31 trials. The final 67 trials were included in the meta-analysis. Prokinetics (14 trials with dichotomous outcomes generating 1053 patients; relative risk reduction [RRR] = 48%; 95% confidence intervals [CI] = 27% to 63%), H2RAs (11 trials generating 2,164 patients; RRR = 22%; 95% CI = 7% to 35%) and PPIs (8 trials generating 3,293 patients; RRR = 14%; 95% CI = 5% to 22%) were significantly more effective than placebo. Bismuth salts (6 trials generating 311 patients; RRR = 40%; 95% CI = -3 to 65%) were superior to placebo but this was of marginal statistical significance. Antacids (one trial generating 109 patients; RRR = -2%; 95% CI = -36% to 24%) and sucralfate (two trials generating 246 patients; RRR = 29%; 95% CI = -40% to 64%) were not statistically significantly superior to placebo. A funnel plot suggested that the prokinetic and H2RA results could be due to publication bias.

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is evidence that anti-secretory therapy may be effective in NUD. The trials evaluating prokinetic therapy are difficult to interpret as the meta-analysis result could have been due to publication bias. The effect of these drugs is likely to be small and many patients will need to take them on a long-term basis so economic analyses would be helpful and ideally the therapies assessed need to be inexpensive and well tolerated.

### Sucralfate [^116wtm5f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Sucralfate is only minimally absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The small amounts of the sulfated disaccharide that are absorbed are excreted primarily in the urine.

Although the mechanism of sucralfate's ability to accelerate healing of duodenal ulcers remains to be fully defined, it is known that it exerts its effect through a local, rather than systemic, action. The following observations also appear pertinent:

1. Studies in human subjects and with animal models of ulcer disease have shown that sucralfate forms an ulcer-adherent complex with proteinaceous exudate at the ulcer site.

2. In vitro, a sucralfate-albumin film provides a barrier to diffusion of hydrogen ions.

3. In human subjects, sucralfate given in doses recommended for ulcer therapy inhibits pepsin activity in gastric juice by 32%.

4. In vitro, sucralfate adsorbs bile salts.

These observations suggest that sucralfate's antiulcer activity is the result of formation of an ulcer-adherent complex that covers the ulcer site and protects it against further attack by acid, pepsin, and bile salts. There are approximately 14 to 16 mEq of acid-neutralizing capacity per 1 g dose of sucralfate.

### Sucralfate oral (sucralfate) [^111edAxy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse reactions to sucralfate tablets in clinical trials were minor and only rarely led to discontinuation of the drug. In studies involving over 2700 patients treated with sucralfate, adverse effects were reported in 129 (4.7%).

Constipation was the most frequent complaint (2%). Other adverse effects reported in less than 0.5% of the patients are listed below by body system:

Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, dry mouth, flatulence, gastric discomfort, indigestion, nausea, vomiting

Dermatological: pruritus, rash

Nervous System: dizziness, insomnia, sleepiness, vertigo

Other: back pain, headache

Post-marketing cases of hypersensitivity have been reported with the use of Sucralfate Oral Suspension, including anaphylactic reactions, dyspnea, lip swelling, edema of the mouth, pharyngeal edema, pruritus, rash, swelling of the face and urticaria.

Cases of bronchospasm, laryngeal edema and respiratory tract edema have been reported with an unknown oral formulation of sucralfate.

Cases of hyperglycemia have been reported with sucralfate.

Bezoars have been reported in patients treated with sucralfate. The majority of patients had underlying medical conditions that may predispose to bezoar formation (such as delayed gastric emptying) or were receiving concomitant enteral tube feedings.

### Topical sucralfate for treatment of mucocutaneous conditions: a systematic review on clinical evidences [^115wde4h]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Sucralfate is an aluminum salt of sucrose octasulfate, generally considered safe in terms of adverse effects. Systemic sucralfate is FDA-approved for the treatment of duodenal ulcers. Since 1991, topical sucralfate has been used in various mucocutaneous conditions, but it is not approved by the FDA yet. In this systematic review, the online databases were searched with appropriate keywords, and the papers were screened by the authors. After screening steps, the relevant articles were selected according to the inclusions and exclusions criteria. Finally, the full texts of 18 articles were included for final evaluations. In conclusion, topical sucralfate has some clinical benefit in several mucocutaneous conditions, including mucocutaneous inflammatory conditions (e.g., post-radiotherapy reaction, diaper dermatitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, etc.), mucocutaneous infectious disorders (e.g., peristomal wound reaction/infection); ulcers; burns, and also pain relief.

### Safety of proton pump inhibitor exposure [^116GJ4zc]. Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Proton pump (H(+)/K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase) inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used to treat patients with acid-related disorders because they are generally perceived to be safe and effective. However, as with any pharmacologic agent, they have the potential for side effects. Many studies have examined the side effects of long-term or short-term PPI exposure. We review the mechanism of action of PPIs, focusing on recently released products that might have greater risks of adverse effects than older products because of increased potency and/or duration of action. We summarize the data available on the putative adverse effects of PPI therapy and propose guidelines for clinicians who prescribe these agents to limit the potential for adverse outcomes in users of these effective therapeutic agents.

Pediatric gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) — cimetidine versus sucralfate: The study reported no significant differences in endoscopic healing between the groups treated with cimetidine versus sucralfate, and in conclusion, it is uncertain whether the use of cimetidine improves histology/macroscopy in infants and children with GERD when compared to sucralfate and it is uncertain whether the use of cimetidine leads to more side effects in infants and children with GERD when compared with sucralfate.

### When does proton pump inhibitor treatment become long term? A scoping review [^115i638H]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

If the aim is to study side effects related to long-term use, the definition of long term might need to be shorter or longer than 6 months depending on the length of exposure time needed for the side effect to occur.

In conclusion, we observed substantial variability in definitions of long-term PPI treatment. The majority of definitions did not include a rationale for the choice of definition. The variety of definitions complicates the comparison of research results and raises challenges in clinical practice, such as identifying an appropriate timeframe for discussing deprescribing. We suggest that long-term use could be defined as more than 4–8 weeks of PPI use in a clinical context depending on the indication for PPI therapy. One definition does not fit all research purposes. Thus, we suggest more than 6 months of PPI use as a possible definition for long-term use in pharmacoepidemiological studies and for studies of adverse effects the definition should be tailored the exposure time needed for the side effect in question to occur. When studying long-term use of PPIs, we suggest always giving well-argued choices of definitions.

### Pharmacological interventions for preventing upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people admitted to intensive care units: a network meta-analysis [^115DtAhH]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

This review found evidence of moderate certainty to show that a number of interventions might be effective in preventing upper GI bleeding in ICU patients compared with placebo or no prophylaxis. Also, the effect of any intervention on the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia, all-cause mortality in the ICU, all-cause mortality in the hospital, duration of the stay in the ICU, duration of intubation and serious adverse events remains unclear with no intervention seeming more effective as compared with placebo, no prophylaxis or any other intervention.

Our research emphasises that decisions in practice should be based on individual assessments of patient needs and underlying conditions. Overall, the local context and resources must be considered in selection of treatment.

Our findings are mostly based on evidence of low and very low certainty except for the primary outcomes. Given that antacids are almost no longer used in practice, only good quality research to assess the risk of nosocomial pneumonia, serious adverse events, C. difficile infections and other harms in patients receiving sucralfate, H2RAs or PPIs might be useful to ascertain the effectiveness of these interventions.

Provided H2RAs and PPIs are the drugs used most often, the effect of PPIs on any adverse event including nosocomial pneumonia and mortality should be investigated in meta-analyses that clearly take into consideration the underlying conditions of study participants and any concomitant intervention.

### Sucralfate (Carafate) [^116mfR3h]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of sucralfate PO (also known as Carafate, Carafate):
- **Aluminum toxicity**: use caution in patients with CKD receiving other products containing aluminum, such as aluminum-containing antacids, as patients with CKD or receiving dialysis have impaired excretion of absorbed aluminum and aluminum does not cross dialysis membranes.
- **Aspiration, respiratory complications**: use caution in patients with impaired swallowing, such as after recent or prolonged intubation, tracheostomy, history of aspiration, dysphagia, or other conditions altering gag and cough reflexes or diminishing oropharyngeal coordination or motility.
- **Increased blood glucose**: use caution in patients with diabetes mellitus. Consider adjusting the antidiabetic medication dose during the use of sucralfate oral suspension.
- **Recurrence of duodenal ulcer**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as a successful course of treatment with sucralfate should not be expected to alter the post-healing frequency or severity of duodenal ulceration.

Overall, sucralfate seems to be superior to placebo and as effective as H 2 RAS in relieving symptoms and repairing mucosal erosions. However, the prevention of esophagitis recurrence remains an open issue, because large clinical trials have not been and probably will never be performed because of the remarkable success of PPI therapy. This is the reason why there are no comparative studies between sucralfate and PPIs.

### Long-term effects of the iron-based phosphate binder, sucroferric oxyhydroxide, in dialysis patients [^1168Jxhp]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Extension study data demonstrate that the efficacy of sucroferric oxyhydroxide for controlling serum phosphorus concentration was robust, maintained over the long-term (1 year), and similar to that of sevelamer. The efficacy of sucroferric oxyhydroxide in the extension study was largely unaffected by geographical region, sex, age and race (data not shown).

Sucroferric oxyhydroxide was generally well tolerated over 1 year. TEAEs with sucroferric oxyhydroxide were generally more frequent during the initial Phase III study than in the extension study, indicating that those who better tolerated the drug at study start continued to do so for the remainder of the 1-year period. Hyperphosphatemia was the most common class of TEAE for both sucroferric oxyhydroxide and sevelamer, which contrasted with the first 6 months of treatment, in which GI disorders were the predominant class of TEAE. Diarrhea and discolored feces were the most frequent GI-related TEAEs with sucroferric oxyhydroxide over the first weeks of treatment, but their incidence decreased over time. Nausea, vomiting and constipation were reported more frequently with sevelamer than sucroferric oxyhydroxide in the first 6 months of treatment, but their incidence also diminished over time. Moreover, fewer patients were withdrawn due to TEAEs during the extension study in both the sucroferric oxyhydroxide and sevelamer treatment groups (8.2 and 4.9%, respectively), compared with the first 6 months of treatment (16.1 and 6.6%, respectively). This indicates that, in general, patients who tolerated the treatments in the initial study continued to tolerate them for the next 6 months during the extension study. The incidence of serious or severe TEAEs and deaths were similar in both treatment groups during the extension study and over the 1-year period overall. It should be noted that a large number (one-third) of study participants were treated with sevelamer prior to inclusion in the initial Phase III study, so could be considered preadapted to this drug.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of Sucralfate Oral Suspension did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function (see PRECAUTIONS Special Populations: Chronic Renal Failure and Dialysis Patients). Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

### Sucralfate oral suspension (sucralfate) [^115BP1M2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

Some studies have shown that simultaneous sucralfate administration in healthy volunteers reduced the extent of absorption (bioavailability) of single doses of the following: cimetidine, digoxin, fluoroquinolone, antibiotics, ketoconazole, l-thyroxine, phenytoin, quinidine, ranitidine, tetracycline, and theophylline. Subtherapeutic prothrombin times with concomitant warfarin and sucralfate therapy have been reported in spontaneous and published case reports. However, two clinical studies have demonstrated no change in either serum warfarin concentration or prothrombin time with the addition of sucralfate to chronic warfarin therapy.

The mechanism of these interactions appears to be nonsystemic in nature, presumably resulting from sucralfate binding to the concomitant agent in the gastrointestinal tract. In all cases studied to date (cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, digoxin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and ranitidine) dosing the concomitant medication 2 hours before sucralfate eliminated

the interaction. Due to Sucralfate Oral Suspension's potential to alter the absorption of some drugs, Sucralfate Oral Suspension should be administered separately from other drugs when alterations in bioavailability are felt to be critical. In these cases, patients should be monitored appropriately.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Chronic oral toxicity studies of 24 months' duration were conducted in mice and rats at doses up to 1 g/kg (12 times the human dose).

There was no evidence of drug-related tumorigenicity. A reproduction study in rats at doses up to 38 times the human dose did not reveal any indication of fertility impairment. Mutagenicity studies were not conducted.

Teratogenic effects

Teratogenicity studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to 50 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to sucralfate. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

Nursing Mothers

It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when sucralfate is administered to a nursing woman.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

OVERDOSAGE

Due to limited experience in humans with overdosage of sucralfate, no specific treatment recommendations can be given. Acute oral toxicity studies in animals, however, using doses up to 12 g/kg body weight, could not find a lethal dose. Sucralfate is only minimally absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Risks associated with acute overdosage should, therefore, be minimal. In rare reports describing sucralfate overdose, most patients remained asymptomatic. Those few reports where adverse events were described included symptoms of dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

This meta-analysis demonstrated that, compared with sucralfate for the prevention of stress ulcer in mechanically ventilated patients, H 2 RA showed no differential effectiveness in treating overt bleeding but had the disadvantages of higher gastric colonization and VAP rates. In clinical practice, the increased risks of adverse effect had to be balanced against the benefits of treatment with H 2 RA while taking into account each patient's clinical circumstances. Larger prospective RCTs and additional African and Latin American studies of H 2 RA and sucralfate are warranted among patients with mechanical ventilation in order to allow firm conclusions to be drawn about clinical benefit and risks, particularly clinically important GI bleeding.

PRECAUTIONS

The physician should read the " PRECAUTIONS " section when considering the use of this drug in pregnant or pediatric patients, or patients of childbearing potential.

Duodenal ulcer is a chronic, recurrent disease. While short-term treatment with sucralfate can result in complete healing of the ulcer, a successful course of treatment with sucralfate should not be expected to alter the post healing frequency or severity of duodenal ulceration.

Isolated reports of sucralfate tablet aspiration with accompanying respiratory complications have been received. Therefore, sucralfate tablets should be used with caution by patients who have known conditions that may impair swallowing, such as recent or prolonged intubation, tracheostomy, prior history of aspiration, dysphagia, or any other conditions that may alter gag and cough reflexes, or diminish oropharyngeal coordination or motility.

Special Populations: Chronic Renal Failure and Dialysis Patients

When sucralfate is administered orally, small amounts of aluminum are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Concomitant use of sucralfate with other products that contain aluminum, such as aluminum-containing antacids, may increase the total body burden of aluminum. Patients with normal renal function receiving the recommended doses of sucralfate and aluminum-containing products adequately excrete aluminum in the urine. Patients with chronic renal failure or those receiving dialysis have impaired excretion of absorbed aluminum. In addition, aluminum does not cross dialysis membranes because it is bound to albumin and transferrin plasma proteins. Aluminum accumulation and toxicity (aluminum osteodystrophy, osteomalacia, encephalopathy) have been described in patients with renal impairment. Sucralfate should be used with caution in patients with chronic renal failure.

### Sucralfate as an adjunct to analgesia to improve oral intake in children with infectious oral ulcers: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111JQ2Tp]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Hypothesis

We hypothesized that sucralfate along with oral analgesics (acetaminophen or ibuprofen) administered in the emergency department leads to a clinically significant improvement in oral intake in children with acute infectious oral ulcers.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of sucralfate versus placebo conducted between 2017 and 2018 in an urban pediatric emergency department. Children aged 6 months to 5 years with acute, infectious oral ulcers and poor oral intake received either acetaminophen at 15 mg/kg or ibuprofen at 10 mg/kg and were then randomized to receive sucralfate at 20 mg/kg per dose up to 1 g or a placebo solution. The primary outcome was oral fluid intake within 60 minutes of medication administration. The secondary outcomes were repeat ED visits, length of stay in ED, intravenous hydration rate, admission rate, adverse event rate, and emergency physician's determination of the adequacy of oral intake.

Results

One hundred subjects with mild dehydration (clinical dehydration score of 1) and a median age of 1.38 years were enrolled and analyzed (49 in the sucralfate group and 51 in the placebo group). Oral intake 1 hour after drug administration was similar in both the groups: the median intake in the sucralfate group was 9.7 mL/kg and 10.7 mL/kg in the placebo group (difference -1 mL/kg; 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.0 to 4.8). According to the emergency physician's report, the secondary outcomes were significant only for adequate oral intake: 71% in the sucralfate group versus 88% in the placebo group (difference -16.8%; 95% CI -32.2 to -1.4).

Conclusion

Sucralfate as an adjunct to oral analgesics was not superior to placebo in improving oral intake in children with acute oral infectious ulcers.

### Sucralfate [^111uiRD8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

Some studies have shown that simultaneous sucralfate administration in healthy volunteers reduced the extent of absorption (bioavailability) of single doses of the following: cimetidine, digoxin, fluoroquinolone antibiotics, ketoconazole, l-thyroxine, phenytoin, quinidine, ranitidine, tetracycline, and theophylline. Subtherapeutic prothrombin times with concomitant warfarin and sucralfate therapy have been reported in spontaneous and published case reports. However, two clinical studies have demonstrated no change in either serum warfarin concentration or prothrombin time with the addition of sucralfate to chronic warfarin therapy.

The mechanism of these interactions appears to be nonsystemic in nature, presumably resulting from sucralfate binding to the concomitant agent in the gastrointestinal tract. In all case studies to date (cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, digoxin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and ranitidine), dosing the concomitant medication 2 hours before sucralfate eliminated the interaction. Because of the potential of Sucralfate to alter the absorption of some drugs, Sucralfate should be administered separately from other drugs when alterations in bioavailability are felt to be critical. In these cases, patients should be monitored appropriately.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Chronic oral toxicity studies of 24 months' duration were conducted in mice and rats at doses up to 1 g/kg (12 times the human dose).

There was no evidence of drug-related tumorigenicity. A reproduction study in rats at doses up to 38 times the human dose did not reveal any indication of fertility impairment. Mutagenicity studies were not conducted.

Pregnancy

Teratogenic effects

Teratogenicity studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to 50 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to sucralfate. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

Nursing Mothers

It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when sucralfate is administered to a nursing woman.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

### Effects of daily treatment with acid suppressants for stress ulcer prophylaxis on risk of ventilator-associated events [^112nDhNP]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To estimate the effects of continuous daily treatment with different acid suppressants on the risk of ventilator-associated events in critically ill patients.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Patients

Adult critically ill patients who underwent mechanical ventilation for ≥ 3 days during an inpatient admission between January 2006 and December 2014.

Methods

We estimated the 30-day cumulative risk ratios (RRs) for ventilator-associated events comparing daily proton pump inhibitor (PPI) versus daily histamine-2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) strategies while controlling for time-fixed and time-varying confounding and accounting for competing events.

Results

Of 6,133 patients, on ventilation day 3, 58.8% received H2RAs, 26.1% received PPIs, and 4.1% received sucralfate. Patients frequently changed treatment throughout follow-up. Among 4,595 patients receiving PPIs or H2RAs on day 3, we found no differences in risk estimates for ventilator mortality and extubation alive comparing daily PPI versus daily H2RA strategies: RR, mortality, 1.03 (95% CI, 0.89–1.22); extubation alive, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.96–1.03). We found similar results after accounting for PPI dose. For possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (PVAP) and infection-related ventilator-associated complication (IVAC), point estimates were larger, but the 95% CIs crossed 1.0: RR PVAP, 1.25 (95% CI, 0.80–1.94); IVAC, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.64–1.17). The magnitude of effect estimates depended on PPI dose. The RR for PVAP, high-dose PPI versus H2RA, was 1.53 (95% CI, 0.82–2.51), and for low-dose PPI versus H2RA, the RR was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.47–1.63). For IVAC, high-dose PPI versus H2RA, the RR was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.66–1.42), and for low-dose PPI versus H2RA, the RR was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.50–1.11).

Conclusions

We estimated no effect of daily PPI versus daily H2RA on risk of mortality or extubation alive in critically ill patients. Further investigation with larger samples is warranted for PVAP and IVAC.

### Proton pump inhibitors are detrimental to overall survival of patients with glioblastoma: results from a nationwide real-world evidence database [^113NyWxU]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

In the absence of a randomized controlled trial large enough to permit subgroup analysis, we employed a logical statistical approach to address confounding variables. Significant heterogeneity exists in the presentation and treatment of GBM and we acknowledge that the median follow-up is short, but we felt the clinical impact of this finding necessitates rapid communication. In the future, we intend to incorporate other relevant features into the model such as performance status and tumor size to further understand the population most at risk from prophylactic PPI use.

These results urge caution in the use of PPIs for managing acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding and to avoid prophylactic use of PPIs. The data from this real-world study suggests alternatives to PPIs should be considered whenever possible for GBM patients, particularly among those for whom relatively favorable outcomes are anticipated. H2 blockers such as famotidine and cimetidine are reasonable alternatives and sucralfate suspension could also be useful for creating a mucosal barrier to gastric acid. Short-term use of PPI may still be essential for patients with acute GI hemorrhage, but the casual and prolonged use of PPI for prophylaxis should be balanced by the availability of alternative antacid strategies.

### Science review: the use of proton pump inhibitors for gastric acid suppression in critical illness [^117VCvxV]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Prophylaxis is routinely provided for critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) who are at high risk for stress-related mucosal damage (SRMD), an erosive process of the gastroduodenum associated with abnormally high physiological demands. Traditionally, treatment options have included sucralfate, antacids and histamine H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs). The H2RAs are currently the most widely used agents in prophylactic acid suppression; however, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have recently replaced H2RAs in the treatment of many acid-related conditions. PPIs achieve a more rapid and sustained increase in gastric pH and are not associated with the rapid tachyphylaxis seen with H2RAs. As a result, and after the introduction of intravenous formulations, PPIs are beginning to be used for the prophylaxis of SRMD in critically ill adults. The high prevalence of renal and hepatic impairment among the ICU population, as well as the need for multiple drug therapy in many patients, means that pharmacokinetic characteristics and the potential for drug interactions may be important considerations in the choice of prophylactic agent. This review seeks to present the pharmacological evidence that may inform decision-making about the prescription of drugs for prophylaxis of SRMD.

### WITHDRAWN: pharmacological interventions for non-ulcer dyspepsia [^114QiB28]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The commonest cause of upper gastrointestinal symptoms is non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) and yet the pathophysiology of this condition has been poorly characterised and the optimum treatment is uncertain. It is estimated that £450 million is spent on dyspepsia drugs in the UK each year.

Objectives

This review aims to determine the effectiveness of six classes of drugs (antacids, histamine H2 antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, prokinetics, mucosal protecting agents and antimuscarinics) in the improvement of either the individual or global dyspepsia symptom scores and also quality of life scores patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2006), EMBASE (1988 to January 2006), CINAHL (1982 to January 2006), SIGLE, and reference lists of articles. We also contacted experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies. Trials were located through electronic searches of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and SIGLE, using appropriate subject headings and text words, searching bibliographies of retrieved articles, and through contacts with experts in the fields of dyspepsia and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing drugs of any of the six groups with each other or with placebo for non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility, trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

We included 73 trials: prokinetics (19 trials with dichotomous outcomes evaluating 3178 participants; relative risk reduction (RRR) 33%; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 18% to 45%), H(2)RAs (12 trials evaluating 2,183 participants; RRR 23%; 95% CI 8% to 35%) and PPIs (10 trials evaluating 3,347 participants; RRR 13%; 95% CI 4% to 20%) were significantly more effective than placebo. Bismuth salts (six trials evaluating 311 participants; RRR 40%; 95% CI -3 to 65%) were superior to placebo but this was of marginal statistical significance. Antacids (one trial evaluating 109 participants; RRR -2%; 95% CI -36% to 24%) and sucralfate (two trials evaluating 246 participants; RRR 29%; 95% CI -40% to 64%) were not statistically significantly superior to placebo. A funnel plot suggested that the prokinetic results could be due to publication bias or other small study effects.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that anti-secretory therapy may be effective in NUD. The trials evaluating prokinetic therapy are difficult to interpret as the meta-analysis result could have been due to publication bias. The effect of these drugs is likely to be small and many patients will need to take them on a long-term basis so economic analyses would be helpful and ideally the therapies assessed need to be inexpensive and well tolerated.

### Sucralfate oral (sucralfate) [^112ehVTu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

The physician should read the "PRECAUTIONS" section when considering the use of sucralfate oral suspension in pregnant or pediatric patients, or patients of childbearing potential.

Duodenal ulcer is a chronic, recurrent disease. While short-term treatment with sucralfate can result in complete healing of the ulcer, a successful course of treatment with sucralfate should not be expected to alter the post healing frequency or severity of duodenal ulceration.

Episodes of hyperglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients. Close monitoring of glycemia in diabetic patients treated with Sucralfate Oral Suspension is recommended. Adjustment of the anti-diabetic treatment dose during the use of Sucralfate Oral Suspension might be necessary.

Special Populations

### Proton pump inhibitors for the prevention of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced ulcers and dyspepsia [^113kHgVj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most frequently prescribed medicines, commonly used to mitigate pain, inflammation, and cardiovascular prevention, among others. Chronic NSAID consumption increases the risk of acute renal failure, stroke, myocardial infarction, and gastrointestinal toxicity, ranging from mild dyspepsia to serious ulcer complications such as bleeding, obstruction, and perforation. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may exert a gastroprotective effect from NSAID gastroduodenal injury by reducing gastric acid secretion.

Objectives

To assess the effects of proton pump inhibitors on the prevention of dyspepsia and ulcers in people with chronic consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), and two trial registers up to 23 October 2023, as well as reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs comparing PPIs taken orally versus placebo, histamine 2-receptor antagonists, misoprostol, or sucralfate in adults and children with chronic consumption of NSAIDs for four weeks or longer.

Outcomes

Our outcomes were global symptoms of dyspepsia, incident ulcer, adverse events, ulcer complications, and quality of life.

Risk Of Bias

We used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool for RCTs and the tool extension for cluster-RCTs.

Synthesis Methods

We conducted meta-analyses using random-effects models to calculate risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) and 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. Due to statistical heterogeneity, we conducted meta-analyses for all but two outcomes. We summarised the certainty of evidence according to GRADE methods.

Included Studies

We included 12 studies with 8760 participants. All studies were conducted in an outpatient setting in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Central America, South America, and Australia. They were published between 1996 and 2014. All studies measured outcomes in the short term (up to 12 months).

Synthesis Of Results

PPI versus placebo PPIs may have little to no effect on global symptoms of dyspepsia assessed as a dichotomous outcome, but the evidence is very uncertain (meta-analysis was not possible due to high and unexplained statistical heterogeneity and point estimates of RR ranged from 0.36 to 1.13; 8 studies; 4944 participants; very low-certainty evidence). PPIs probably result in a slight reduction in global symptoms of dyspepsia assessed as a continuous outcome (MD -0.56, 95% CI -0.74 to -0.38; 2 studies, 1149 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). PPIs probably result in a reduction in incident ulcers compared to placebo (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.36; 11 studies, 7022 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). PPIs may have few or no adverse events, but the evidence is very uncertain (meta-analysis was not possible due to high and unexplained statistical heterogeneity and point estimates of RR ranged from 0.67 to 6.35; 12 studies, 7530 participants; very low-certainty evidence). PPIs may reduce ulcer complications compared with placebo (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.07; P = 0.30; I² = 18%; 5 studies, 4394 participants; low-certainty evidence). PPIs probably result in a slight increase in quality of life (MD 0.39, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.55; 2 studies, 1149 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). PPI versus histamine 2-receptor antagonists PPIs may increase incident ulcers (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 19.44; 1 study, 26 participants; low-certainty evidence). The included study did not report data on global symptoms of dyspepsia, adverse events, ulcer complications, or quality of life. PPI versus misoprostol PPIs may increase incident ulcers (RR 2.32, 95% CI 1.25 to 4.30; 1 study, 402 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and may have fewer adverse events (RR 0.38, 0.25 to 0.57; 1 study, 402 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. The included study did not report data on global symptoms of dyspepsia, ulcer complications, or quality of life. No studies compared PPI against sucralfate. Most included studies were at overall high risk of bias or overall some concerns of risk of bias. Imprecision in the effect estimates was also a concern.

Authors' Conclusions

Compared with placebo, PPIs may have no effect on the presence of global symptoms of dyspepsia and probably result in a slight reduction in global symptoms of dyspepsia scales. PPI probably reduces incident ulcers and may have little to no effect on adverse events. PPIs may reduce ulcer complications and probably slightly increase quality of life. Compared with histamine 2-receptor antagonists, PPIs may increase incident ulcers. The evidence for this comparison came from only one study. Compared with misoprostol, PPIs may increase incident ulcers and may reduce adverse events, but the evidence is very uncertain. The evidence for this comparison came from only one study. The certainty of the evidence for most outcomes and comparisons was low or very low, except for global symptoms of dyspepsia measured as a continuous outcome, incident ulcer, and quality of life in the comparison of PPI versus placebo. Further research is needed to assess the effect of PPIs compared to other active treatments such as sucralfate, misoprostol, or histamine 2-receptor antagonists. Well-designed and reported studies focussing on patient-important outcomes and addressing the methodological limitations found in the present included studies would be informative. These could include different baseline ulcer risks, ages, and types of NSAIDs. Long-term follow-up would be beneficial.

### Effect of histamine-2-receptor antagonists versus sucralfate on stress ulcer prophylaxis in mechanically ventilated patients: a meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials [^114zdv9i]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

All available trials were aggregated to evaluate the effect of H 2 RA and sucralfate on ICU mortality. In studies evaluating mortality, we observed similar rates of ICU mortality among patients receiving H 2 RA (204 of 1,001 [20.4%]) and those receiving sucralfate (196 of 1,014 [19.3%]), and there was no significant difference between groups (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.34). Other investigators reported that development of VAP might lead to an additional 13 days in the ICU. Although the frequencies of VAP were less prominent among participants receiving sucralfate in relation to H 2 RA, the effect of this type of pneumonia appeared to have no direct relation with mortality. More high-quality RCTs were needed to explore the associated factors of mortality in the ICUs.

To our knowledge, our study was the first attempt to summarize the available data on the comparison of H 2 RA and sucralfate effects on stress ulcer prophylaxis in mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU. There were several novel aspects in our study: early- and late-onset pneumonias were first evaluated through subgroup analysis, allowing the combination of comparable estimates. Furthermore, an advantage of our analysis was that the definitions of outcome measures were clearly defined in the present study and this resulted in precise results.

However, we do acknowledge that there are several limitations of the present study. First, the geographic regions covered in this meta-analysis include North America (the US and Canada), Europe (the Czech Republic, Switzerland, Austria, and Spain), and Asia (India). Therefore, our results have limited generalizability to other regions (for example, Africa and Latin America). Second, a small number of studies and participants in particular outcome measures were available. Although lower frequencies of clinically important GI bleeding were noted in the H 2 RA group (12/667 [1.8%]) compared with the sucralfate group (26/673 [3.9%]), the result would have been attributed to the definitive RCT published by Cook and colleagues if the data of the two trials had been synthesized, and this probably limited the detection of the effect estimate. Therefore, it was inappropriate to pool the data. Finally, differences in APACHE II score and intervention dosage might have affected the outcome of patients' response to medical management and might have produced possible clinical heterogeneity.

### Sucralfate or placebo following argon plasma coagulation for chronic radiation proctitis: a randomized double blind trial [^114D6nG7]. Colorectal Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

Chronic radiation proctitis is a long-term complication of radiation therapy for pelvic malignancy. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of two treatment regimens, sucralfate or placebo, following argon plasma coagulation (APC) for chronic haemorrhagic radiation proctitis.

Method

A single-centre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was performed on patients with haemorrhagic chronic radiation proctitis after irradiation for prostate, uterine, cervical, rectal or vaginal cancer. All patients received APC, and were then randomized to oral sucralfate (6 g twice a day) or placebo treatment for 4 weeks. APC was repeated every 8 weeks if necessary after the first session. Patients were graded clinically and endoscopically according to the Chutkan and Gilinski scales before and at 8 and 16 weeks after initial APC treatment (1.5–2 l/min, 25–40 W) and after 52 weeks (clinical only).

Results

Of 122 patients, 117 completed the entire protocol, with 57/60 in the sucralfate group and 60/62 in the placebo group. At baseline there were no significant differences between the sucralfate and placebo groups. At 1 year, a significant improvement in the clinical scale in both groups occurred compared with baseline. After 16 weeks, the median overall clinical severity scores fell from 4 to 2 points and the median bleeding score from 2 to 0 in both groups.

Conclusion

APC is safe and effective for the management of chronic radiation proctitis. Additional sucralfate treatment did not influence the clinical or endoscopic outcome.

### Gastrointestinal diseases during pregnancy: what does the gastroenterologist need to know? [^113JmXa8]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

GERD is reported by 40–85% of pregnant women, usually beginning at the end of the first trimester, and can profoundly impair the quality of life. When present, GERD persists during the entire pregnancy and usually resolves after delivery. Complications such as erosive esophagitis, bleeding or strictures are rarely described. For mild symptoms, lifestyle and dietary modifications are recommended. Conservative measures include avoiding eating late at night, elevating the head of the bed by 10–15 cm and lying on the left side. If symptoms persist, medication may be necessary. First-line treatment is based on antacids. Antacids containing calcium, and magnesium are considered safe in pregnancy. Furthermore, patients prefer to use this medication because it relieves the symptoms promptly and can be taken on demand. No teratogenic effects of these drugs have been observed in animal studies. Bicarbonate-containing agents, such as sodium bicarbonate, should be avoided as they can precipitate metabolic alkalosis and fluid overload in the mother and fetus. A further concern with aluminum antacids is the potential developmental retardation described when women take high doses of this medication. The potential fetal toxicity when using sucralfate is associated with its aluminum component. However, no maternal or fetal adverse effects have been observed, and therefore sucralfate is usually considered safe during pregnancy. Histamine type 2 antagonists are often the next-line therapy. Both cimetidine and ranitidine have been used with excellent safety profiles. Although there is a safety concern with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), in a recent meta-analysis Gill et al did not find an increased risk for major congenital malformation with PPI use during pregnancy. However, some studies in the past reported dose-related embryonic and fetal mortality in animal studies with omeprazole. Prospective data have shown the safety of this drug. Pasternak et al, in a cohort study, did not find a significant increase of major birth defects with exposure to PPIs during the first trimester of pregnancy (odds ratio [OR] 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91–1.34). In an individual analysis, there was no significant association between the use of any specific PPI and the risk of major birth defects. Altogether, PPIs are nowadays considered to be safe in pregnant women and are usually reserved for GERD complications or for women who did not respond to previous treatments. All agents that decrease gastric acidity should be used with caution, as they can lower iron absorption.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse reactions to sucralfate tablets in clinical trials were minor and only rarely led to discontinuation of the drug. In studies involving over 2,700 patients treated with sucralfate, adverse effects were reported in 129 (4.7%).

Constipation was the most frequent complaint (2%). Other adverse effects reported in less than 0.5% of the patients are listed below by body system:

Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, dry mouth, flatulence, gastric discomfort, indigestion, nausea, vomiting

Dermatological: pruritus, rash

Nervous System: dizziness, insomnia, sleepiness, vertigo

Other: back pain, headache

Post-marketing cases of hypersensitivity have been reported with the use of sucralfate oral suspension, including anaphylactic reactions, dyspnea, lip swelling, edema of the mouth, pharyngeal edema, pruritus, rash, swelling of the face and urticaria.

Cases of bronchospasm, laryngeal edema and respiratory tract edema have been reported with an unknown oral formulation of sucralfate.

Cases of hyperglycemia have been reported with sucralfate.

Bezoars have been reported in patients treated with sucralfate. The majority of patients had underlying medical conditions that may predispose to bezoar formation (such as delayed gastric emptying) or were receiving concomitant enteral tube feedings.

### Use of sucralfate in renal failure [^116k2hKZ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the potential for the development of aluminum toxicity in patients with renal insufficiency or chronic renal failure who are taking sucralfate.

Data Sources

Clinical literature accessed through MEDLINE (1966-December 1999) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-December 1999). Key search terms included sucralfate, renal failure, renal insufficiency, and end-stage renal disease.

Data Synthesis

Urinary excretion is an important route of elimination for systemically absorbed aluminum. Accumulation of aluminum in patients with impaired renal function may lead to significant toxicity. A potential source of aluminum is the antiulcer medication sucralfate. Studies and case reports evaluating the use and toxicity of sucralfate in patients with normal renal function, as well as those with renal failure or renal insufficiency, were reviewed.

Conclusions

Aluminum accumulation and toxicity have been reported with the use of sucralfate in patients with compromised renal function. The risk of toxicity most likely represents a long-term complication of sucralfate use in this patient population. Toxicity may be enhanced by concurrent use of other aluminum-containing medications, such as phosphate binders or antidiarrheal preparations. These medications, in addition to sucralfate, should be avoided if possible in patients with end-stage renal disease. Patients with renal failure or renal insufficiency who are undergoing prolonged sucralfate therapy should be monitored for potential signs of aluminum toxicity.

### Prophylaxis and treatment of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced upper gastrointestinal side-effects [^1118mKJb]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2001). Low credibility.

The use of specific agents to heal mucosal lesions or to prevent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug toxicity, has focused upon two approaches: replacement of prostaglandin deficiency and inhibition of acid secretion. Acid suppression with traditional ulcer healing doses of H2-blockers is effective in healing gastric and duodenal ulcers upon discontinuation of the offending drug. In the event the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug must be continued, the use of H2-blockers is associated with a decrease in the healing rate. In long-term prevention studies, H2-blockers significantly reduce duodenal ulcer rates, but are ineffective in reducing gastric ulceration. More potent acid inhibition with a double-dose of H2-blockers (famotidine 80 mg daily, ranitidine 600 mg daily) may reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers. Marked acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole 20–40 mg, lansoprazole 30 mg daily) also appears to be very effective in healing gastric and duodenal ulcers in patients continuing the offending drug as well. An analysis of pooled data from comparative studies on omeprazole vs ranitidine, misoprostol and sucralfate shows a therapeutic advantage in favour of the proton pump inhibitor, ranging from 10 to 40%. In long-term prevention studies, omeprazole (20 mg daily) and pantoprazole (40 mg daily) have also been shown to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-related dyspepsia. Current data from recent comparative studies of omeprazole (20 mg daily) vs ranitidine (150 mg daily) and misoprostol (200 microg daily) showed that, after 6 months' follow-up, the proton pump inhibitor was significantly superior to control drugs in reducing the risk both of gastric and duodenal ulcer. Misoprostol (at doses ranging from 400 microg to 800 microg/day) is an effective form of therapy for preventing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastroduodenal lesions. However high-dose misoprostol only, seems adequate for the prevention of ulcer complications, mainly in high-risk non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug users. Thus, available data are undoubtedly in favour of the proton pump inhibitors as well tolerated and effective drugs in the prophylaxis and treatment of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-related mucosal lesions in the gastrointestinal tract.

### Drugs for improving esophageal mucosa defense: where are we now and where are we going? [^113V6PDA]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Sucralfate

This old agent is the aluminum salt of sucrose sulfate, able to adsorb bile acids and forms stable complexes with protein molecules, which in turn are resistant to the proteolytic action of pepsin. It has a great affinity for inflamed mucosa due to its viscous adhesiveness and the formation of polyvalent bridges between the negatively charged sucralfate and the positively charged proteins present in high concentrations in mucosal lesions.

Clinical work by Orlando et al has shown that sucralfate is protective against acid injury in rabbit esophagus by enhancing mucosal defenses through binding of pepsin and bile salts, neutralization of hydrogen ions by its content of aluminum hydroxide, and reduction in the permeability of esophageal mucosa to hydrogen ions.

Several clinical studies argued for the superiority of sucralfate versus placebo in alleviating GERD symptoms. For instance, 4 randomized, placebo-controlled investigations with variable doses (1 g b.i.d. to 1 g q.i.d.) and durations of treatment (6, 8, and 12 weeks) showed that sucralfate provided some benefit over placebo in improving symptoms and healing erosive esophagitis, even though statistical significance was not achieved in two of the studies. A multicenter trial demonstrated that sucralfate was better than placebo in healing endoscopic lesions, and a recent meta-analysis also confirmed the superiority of sucralfate over placebo as maintenance therapy of GERD, but it must be emphasized that there are conflicting data regarding the prevention of relapse in erosive esophagitis.

Furthermore, sucralfate seems to be equally effective as H 2 RAs in improving reflux symptoms and in inducing mucosal healing. However, the tachyphylaxis commonly seen with H 2 RAs given for more than 2 weeks could partly explain the non-inferiority of sucralfate, because the clinical trials lasted for 4–8 weeks on average. It should be noted that there are no studies available in the medical literature comparing sucralfate with PPIs, currently the first-choice treatment of GERD.

Some good results obtained in published studies in patients with esophageal erosions might be explained by presuming that the compound could have been in contact with the esophageal mucosa for a more or less prolonged period of time. The combination of sucralfate and H 2 RAs has also been assessed in patients with reflux esophagitis in two studies; the results concerning the control of symptoms and the healing of lesions have been conflicting, even though the number of patients enrolled in the positive trial was relatively small.

### Pharmacologic treatment of GERD in adolescents: is esophageal mucosal protection an option? [^1145LMco]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Alginate-containing formulations have long been used in GERD and stood the test of time. However, advancements in the pathophysiology of reflux disease have prompted to give a new look to these "old drugs". The advent of pH-impedance technology has represented a major advance, allowing us to understand that both acidic and weakly acidic reflux are implicated in symptom generation and that only those patients in whom acid is the symptom trigger respond to acid suppression. On the contrary, alginate-containing formulations achieve symptom relief regardless of the stimulus (be it acid, pepsin, bile, or mixed). This activity is likely due to the barrier effect, which translates into a reduction of the proximal migration of the refluxed gastric contents and binding and inactivation of pepsin. Unfortunately, conversely from the well-established efficacy in adults, these formulations only slightly improve signs and symptoms of GERD in children and are not recommended by the joint North American and European clinical practice guidelines.

Recent experimental and clinical studies have unraveled that – in patients with GERD – esophageal mucosal integrity is impaired and that this feature represents a hallmark of the disease. Baseline esophageal impedance is now being used as a predictor of microscopic mucosal status in both adults, and children, allowing both diagnosis and assessment of the response to therapy. Thanks to this advancement in pathophysiology, a new therapeutic strategy has recently been undertaken, that is, esophageal mucosal protection.

One of the first mucosal protective drugs was sucralfate, which is a complex of sucrose sulfate and aluminum hydroxide, originally used in the treatment of peptic ulcer. Besides adhering to the ulcer surface, it displays also several other mechanisms of action. They include inhibition of peptic digestion, mucosal protection through mucus and bicarbonate production, and stimulation of tissue growth and repair. In the past, sucralfate has been extensively used in adults with GERD, but with advent of PPIs, it was relegated to other gastrointestinal (GI) conditions. The available data are inadequate to determine the safety or efficacy of sucralfate in the treatment of GERD in children, particularly the risk of aluminum toxicity with long-term use. As a consequence, it is not recommended by the current guidelines.

### Effect of oral sucralfate on late rectal injury associated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer: a double-blind, randomized trial [^1127icVv]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess whether oral sucralfate is effective in preventing late rectal injury in prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.

Methods and Materials

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial was conducted across four institutions in Australia. Patients receiving definitive radiotherapy for prostate cancer were randomized to receive either 3 g of oral sucralfate suspension or placebo twice daily. Data on patients' symptoms were collected for 2 years, and flexible sigmoidoscopy was scheduled at 12 months after treatment.

Results

A total of 338 patients were randomized, of whom 298 had adequate follow-up data available for an analysis of late symptoms. Of the 298 patients, 143 were randomized to receive sucralfate and 155 placebo. The cumulative incidence of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Grade 2 or worse late rectal toxicity at 2 years was 28% for placebo and 22% for the sucralfate arm (p = 0.23; 95% confidence interval for the difference -3% to 16%). Seventeen percent of patients in the sucralfate group had significant bleeding (Grade 2 or worse) compared with 23% in the placebo group (p = 0.18, 95% confidence interval -15% to 3%). No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups with respect to bowel frequency (p = 0.99), mucus discharge (p = 0.64), or fecal incontinence (p = 0.90). Sigmoidoscopy findings showed a nonstatistically significant reduction in Grade 2 or worse rectal changes from 32% with placebo to 27% in the sucralfate group (p = 0.25).

Conclusion

This trial demonstrated no statistically significant reduction in the incidence of late rectal toxicity in patients randomized to receive sucralfate. However, this result was considered inconclusive, because the trial was unable to exclude clinically important differences in the late toxicity rates.

### Effect of histamine-2-receptor antagonists versus sucralfate on stress ulcer prophylaxis in mechanically ventilated patients: a meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials [^1161kfkh]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

With respect to VAP, a recent meta-analysis suggested that sucralfate was associated with decreased incidence rates of VAP in comparison with H 2 RA, whereas another study found only a trend toward a decreased incidence of VAP when sucralfate was compared with H 2 RA, but the trend was not statistically significant. The finding of our meta-analysis indicated that incidence rates of VAP were significantly more prominent in the H 2 RA group than in the sucralfate group (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.64). Although no statistically significant difference in the incidence rates of early-onset pneumonia was found between groups, patients on H 2 RA were associated with an increased incidence of late-onset pneumonia (OR 4.36, 95% CI 2.09 to 9.09). In addition, patients receiving H 2 RA had higher magnitudes of gastric colonization than did patients receiving sucralfate (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.29 to 3.19). Importantly, in spite of evidence of heterogeneity among trials, the heterogeneity would be expected as a result of chance; this was not surprising given the certain differences in target populations and methods. We postulated that the lower incidence of late-onset pneumonia in the sucralfate group appeared to be associated mainly with the fact that sucralfate did not alter the gastric pH, for the gastric pH has been shown to greatly affect the bacterial colonization of the stomach. Thus, patients receiving this drug were able to maintain a low gastric pH and suppress bacterial growth. In that case, in early-onset pneumonia that developed during the first few days after intubation, the spectrum of bacteria (which mostly included oropharyngeal species) were probably considered to have been introduced in the trachea before or at the time of intubation.

### Interventions for treating oral mucositis for patients with cancer receiving treatment [^114xYuHy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of cancer is increasingly effective but associated with short and long-term side effects. Oral side effects, including oral mucositis (mouth ulceration), remain a major source of illness despite the use of a variety of agents to treat them.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for treating oral mucositis or its associated pain in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.

Search Strategy

Computerised searches of Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE were undertaken. Reference lists from relevant articles were searched and the authors of eligible trials were contacted to identify trials and obtain additional information. Date of the most recent searches August 2003: (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2003).

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials comparing agents prescribed to treat oral mucositis in people receiving chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Outcomes were oral mucositis, time to heal mucositis, oral pain, duration of pain control, dysphagia, systemic infection, amount of analgesia, length of hospitalisation, cost and quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted, in duplicate, by two reviewers. Authors were contacted for details of randomisation, blindness and withdrawals. Quality assessment was carried out on these three criteria. The Cochrane Oral Health Group statistical guidelines were followed and relative risk values calculated using fixed effect models.

Main Results

Twenty-five trials involving 1292 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. Three agents, each in single trials, were found to be effective for improving (allopurinol RR 3.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 10.49; immunoglobulin RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.65; human placentral extract RR 4.50, 95% CI 2.29 to 8.86) or eradicating mucositis (allopurinol RR 19.00, 95% CI 1.17 to 307.63). Two of these trials were rated as at moderate risk of bias and one as at high risk of bias. The following agents were not found to be effective: benzydamine HCl, sucralfate, tetrachlorodecaoxide, chlorhexidine and 'magic' (lidocaine solution, diphenhydramine hydrochloride and aluminum hydroxide suspension). Six trials compared the time to heal and mucositis was found to heal more quickly with two interventions: Granulocyte Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor when compared to povidone iodine, with mean difference -3.5 days (95% CI -4.1 to -2.9) and allopurinol compared to placebo, with mean difference -4.5 days (95% CI -5.8 to -3.2). Three trials compared patient controlled analgesia (PCA) to the continuous infusion method for controlling pain. There was no evidence of a difference, however, less opiate was used per hour for PCA, and the duration of pain was shorter. One trial demonstrated that pharmacokinetically based analgesia (PKPCA) reduced pain compared with PCA, however more opiate was used with PKPCA.

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is weak and unreliable evidence that allopurinol mouthwash, vitamin E, immunoglobulin or human placental extract improve or eradicate mucositis. There is no evidence that patient controlled analgesia (PCA) is better than continuous infusion method for controlling pain, however, less opiate was used per hour, and duration of pain was shorter, for PCA. Further, well designed, placebo-controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of allopurinol mouthwash, immunoglobulin, human placental extract, other interventions investigated in this review and new interventions for treating mucositis are needed.
