## Question

ramirazole dementia HELIX-x trial

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is a HELIX-x trial of ramirazole for dementia and what it entails. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "ramirazole" and "HELIX-x" appear in the provided evidence base at all. Then, I should verify if there are plausible confounders or misspellings that map to known Alzheimer's or dementia trials. Next, I will review relevant trial designs and endpoints to contextualize what a HELIX-x trial might entail if it existed. Finally, I should outline next steps and what information would allow a precise, evidence-supported answer, cross-referencing comparable programs like donanemab and lecanemab as anchors for trial design and biomarkers [^117Fygqy] [^111s68Pv].

> Let me first confirm the presence of the specific terms. I systematically checked the available references, and "ramirazole" and "HELIX-x" do not appear anywhere, which strongly suggests either a misspelling or a program not covered by these documents; by contrast, anchor trials like TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 and the Leqembi program are well represented here, providing a reliable comparator framework for Alzheimer's trial conventions [^117Fygqy] [^111s68Pv].

> Wait, let me verify potential confounders that sound similar. "Ramirazole" could be a mistaken reference to riluzole, a glutamate modulator evaluated in Alzheimer's disease, and "HELIX-x" might be misremembered from "Helix aspersa" seen in a preclinical snail-extract Alzheimer's model; these are the closest phonetic or lexical matches I can find in the corpus, but neither corresponds to a clinical "HELIX-x" dementia trial in humans, and tau mAb programs like semorinemab or tilavonemab also do not use "HELIX-x" nomenclature in their published reports [^111c1F8q] [^114FgfQB] [^115QnTeJ] [^112NZ1Y2].

> Hold on, I should not jump to conclusions; perhaps "HELIX-x" is a sponsor-internal codename or a platform construct. Let me consider whether any existing programs mirror a "HELIX-x" style design. Donanemab employed adaptive discontinuation upon amyloid clearance, which is a distinctive operational feature, but nowhere is it labeled as "HELIX-x", and the FDA labeling and pivotal JAMA report consistently use TRAILBLAZER-ALZ identifiers rather than HELIX-type branding, making a naming linkage unlikely here [^114upKDg] [^117Fygqy].

> Next, I should review core Alzheimer's trial architecture to contextualize what a hypothetical HELIX-x dementia trial would likely include. Contemporary disease-modifying trials are typically randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12–24 months in duration, powered around cognitive-functional composites such as CDR-SB and ADAS-Cog, and enriched by biomarker-confirmed amyloid positivity; this "learn-confirm" paradigm with Phase II dose-finding followed by Phase III confirmation is well described and consistent across the anchor antibody programs [^11184GXk] [^115pdoG4] [^111s68Pv] [^114upKDg].

> I need to ensure biomarker and safety expectations are explicit. Modern anti-amyloid studies require amyloid PET or CSF Aβ positivity, increasingly incorporate tau PET for staging, and mandate MRI surveillance for ARIA, with exclusion criteria for microhemorrhages and siderosis; this is seen consistently in lecanemab and donanemab, and generalized in trial design primers that emphasize biomarkers for diagnosis, target engagement, disease-modification signals, and safety [^111s68Pv] [^114upKDg] [^114GvMes].

> Let me examine small-molecule comparators in case "ramirazole" was intended to be a non-antibody agent. Riluzole has been tested at 50 mg twice daily over 6 months with FDG-PET endpoints and has a well-described safety profile including hepatotoxicity and hematologic risks, which would shape monitoring plans in any dementia trial using a glutamatergic modulator; this strengthens the suspicion that "ramirazole" could be a misnomer for riluzole rather than a distinct investigational compound [^111c1F8q] [^1117ZMyq] [^112HqFTW] [^114qpM8o].

> Hmm, wait a minute, what if the query points to a tau-directed program instead. I will now examine tau mAb data. Semorinemab and tilavonemab Phase 2 programs did not meet primary clinical endpoints across prodromal-to-mild and early AD populations, though they illustrate dosing cadence, endpoint selection, and safety surveillance norms that a hypothetical HELIX-x tau trial would likely share; nonetheless, none of these reports or labels contain a "HELIX-x" identifier [^115QnTeJ] [^112HDkwz] [^112NZ1Y2].

> I should double-check if "HELIX-x" could reflect a platform or stage-gate concept rather than a product name. Platform designs with interim biomarker stage-gates have been employed or proposed in Alzheimer's and related tauopathies, notably in contexts like DIAN-TU, suggesting that if HELIX-x were a platform, it would still be expected to show up in sponsor or registry documentation, which is not the case here [^115Z95Xp].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize a cautious conclusion. Based on the materials provided, there is no mention of "ramirazole" or a "HELIX-x" dementia trial, whereas the corpus robustly covers donanemab, lecanemab, and several tau mAbs with clear naming and trial identifiers; the most plausible explanations are a misspelling of riluzole, a very early or internal codename not captured in this literature set, or a program outside Alzheimer's that is not represented here, and definitive clarification would require a registry identifier, sponsor name, or a publication link to verify [^111s68Pv] [^114upKDg] [^115QnTeJ].

> I need to ensure you have actionable next steps. If you can share a ClinicalTrials.gov NCT number, sponsor, molecule class, or a publication/press release link, I can anchor the verification rapidly; in the meantime, if the intent was lecanemab or donanemab in early symptomatic Alzheimer's, I can provide focused efficacy, safety, and monitoring summaries keyed to CDR-SB and ARIA surveillance, or if it was riluzole or a tau-directed antibody, I can detail design, endpoints, and outcomes consistent with the studies above and align them with modern biomarker standards and regulatory expectations [^111s68Pv] [^114upKDg] [^111c1F8q] [^115QnTeJ].

I **can't find** a dementia drug named "ramirazole" or a trial called "HELIX-x" in the literature. Could you **please clarify**:

- **The exact drug name** (spelling or alternative names)?
- **The trial identifier** (e.g. NCT number) or sponsor?
- **The dementia subtype or mechanism** you're asking about?

If you meant a **tau-targeting therapy** [^1179MNTG], I can summarize evidence for semorinemab [^115QnTeJ] [^112HDkwz] and tilavonemab [^112NZ1Y2]. Alternatively, if you meant an **amyloid-directed therapy** [^115ss7Xy], I can summarize key results for donanemab [^117Fygqy] and lecanemab (LEQEMBI) [^111s68Pv].

### Donanemab in early symptomatic Alzheimer disease: The TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 randomized clinical trial [^117Fygqy]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

The TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study, conducted by John R. Sims and colleagues in 2023, was published in the journal JAMA. This study investigated Alzheimer's disease, specifically examining the effect of donanemab in patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease characterized by amyloid and tau pathology.

The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (RCT). The study population included 1,736 patients, comprised of 996 females and 740 males. The inclusion criteria required participants to have early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease with amyloid and low/medium or high tau pathology as determined by PET scans.

- **Key exclusion criteria**: Presence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities of edema/effusion, more than four cerebral microhemorrhages, more than one area of superficial siderosis, any intracerebral hemorrhage greater than 1 cm, or severe white matter disease on MRI.

- **Interventions**: Participants were divided into two groups:

	- 860 patients received donanemab through intravenous administration of 1,400 mg every four weeks for up to 72 weeks.
	- 876 patients received a matching placebo intravenously at the same frequency for up to 72 weeks.

- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant decrease in the decline of the least-squares mean integrated Alzheimer Disease Rating Scale score at week 76 (10.19 points for the donanemab group versus 13.11 points for the placebo group). The adjusted difference was -2.92 points, with a 95% confidence interval of -1.51 to -4.33.

- **Secondary outcomes**: A significant decrease was also observed in the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale score at week 76 (1.72 points for the donanemab group versus 2.42 points for the placebo group), with an adjusted difference of -0.7 points and a 95% confidence interval of -0.95 to…

### Leqembi [^111s68Pv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Leqembi treatment met the primary endpoint and reduced clinical decline on the global cognitive and functional scale, CDR-SB, compared to placebo at 18 months (-0.45 [-27%], P < 0.0001).

Statistically significant differences (P < 0.01) between treatment groups were also observed in the results for ADAS-Cog14 and ADCS MCI-ADL at 18 months, as presented in Table 8. Both ApoE ε4 carriers and ApoE ε4 noncarriers showed statistically significant treatment differences for the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints.

- **Exploratory subgroup analysis**: In an exploratory subgroup analysis of ApoE ε4 homozygotes, which represented 15% of the trial population, a treatment effect was not observed with Leqembi treatment on the primary endpoint, CDR-SB, compared to placebo, although treatment effects favoring Leqembi were observed for the secondary clinical endpoints, ADAS-Cog14 and ADCS MCI-ADL. Treatment effects on disease-relevant biomarkers (amyloid beta PET, plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, plasma p-tau 181) also favored Leqembi in the ApoE ε4 homozygous subgroup.

Starting at six months, across all time points, Leqembi treatment showed statistically significant changes in the primary and all key secondary endpoints from baseline compared to placebo; see Figure 2.

### Safety and efficacy of semorinemab in individuals with prodromal to mild Alzheimer disease: A randomized clinical trial [^115QnTeJ]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Neurofibrillary tangles composed of aggregated tau protein are one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD) and correlate with clinical disease severity. Monoclonal antibodies targeting tau may have the potential to ameliorate AD progression by slowing or stopping the spread and/or accumulation of pathological tau.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the monoclonal anti-tau antibody semorinemab in prodromal to mild AD.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial was conducted between October 18, 2017, and July 16, 2020, at 97 sites in North America, Europe, and Australia. Individuals aged 50 to 80 years (inclusive) with prodromal to mild AD, Mini-Mental State Examination scores between 20 and 30 (inclusive), and confirmed β-amyloid pathology (by positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid) were included.

- **Interventions**: During the 73-week blinded study period, participants received intravenous infusions of placebo or semorinemab (1500 mg, 4500 mg, or 8100 mg) every 2 weeks for the first 3 infusions and every 4 weeks thereafter.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcomes were change from baseline on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes score from baseline to week 73 and assessments of the safety and tolerability for semorinemab compared with placebo.

- **Results**: In the modified intent-to-treat cohort (n = 422; mean [SD] age, 69.6 [7.0] years; 235 women [55.7%]), similar increases were seen on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes.

### Tilavonemab in early Alzheimer's disease: results from a phase 2, randomized, double-blind study [^112NZ1Y2]. Brain (2023). High credibility.

Tau accumulation in patients with Alzheimer's disease tracks closely with cognitive decline and plays a role in the later stages of disease progression. This phase 2 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of tilavonemab, an anti-tau monoclonal antibody, in patients with early Alzheimer's disease. In this 96-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT02880956), patients aged 55–85 years meeting clinical criteria for early Alzheimer's disease — with a Clinical Dementia Rating-Global Score of 0.5, a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 22 to 30, a Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status-Delayed Memory Index score of ≤ 85, and a positive amyloid PET scan — were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive one of three doses of tilavonemab (300 mg, 1000 mg, or 2000 mg) or placebo via intravenous infusion every 4 weeks.

- **Primary end point**: The primary end point was the change from baseline up to Week 96 in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score.
- **Safety evaluations**: Safety evaluations included adverse event monitoring and MRI assessments.

A total of 453 patients were randomized, of whom 337 were treated with tilavonemab (300 mg, n = 108; 1000 mg, n = 116; 2000 mg, n = 113) and 116 received placebo. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were comparable across groups. The mean age was 71.3 (SD 7.0) years, 51.7% were female, and 96.5% were White. At baseline, the mean CDR-SB score was 3.0 (1.2), which worsened through Week 96 for all treatment groups. The least squares mean change from baseline at Week 96 in the CDR-SB score with tilavonemab was not significantly different.

### Randomized phase II study of the safety and efficacy of semorinemab in participants with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease: Lauriet [^112HDkwz]. Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Accumulation of tau pathology in Alzheimer disease (AD) correlates with cognitive decline. Anti-tau immunotherapies have been proposed as potential interventions in AD. While antibodies targeting N-terminal tau failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy in prodromal-to-mild AD, their utility at other disease stages has not been evaluated in prior studies. The Lauriet study is a phase 2 investigation of an anti-tau monoclonal antibody, semorinemab, in patients with mild-to-moderate AD.

- **Methods**: The phase 2 Lauriet study included a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind period during which participants with mild-to-moderate AD received 4,500 mg of IV semorinemab or placebo every 4 weeks for 48 or 60 weeks. Participants who chose to continue in the subsequent optional open-label extension received 4,500 mg of semorinemab every 4 weeks for up to 96 weeks. Coprimary efficacy endpoints were the change from baseline to week 49 or 61 on the 11-item version of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog11) and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scale. Secondary efficacy endpoints included change from baseline on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). Safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic effects were also evaluated.

- **Results**: Between December 3, 2018, and February 27, 2020, 624 individuals were screened, 272 participants were randomized, and 238 were included in the modified intent-to-treat population (received ≥ 1 dose(s) of study medication).

### Kisunla [^114upKDg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of Kisunla was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (Study 1, NCT04437511) in patients with Alzheimer's disease. These patients had a confirmed presence of amyloid pathology and mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, consistent with Stage 3 and Stage 4 Alzheimer's disease.

Participants were enrolled with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of ≥ 20 and ≤ 28 and demonstrated a progressive change in memory function for at least 6 months. Inclusion in the study was based on visual assessment of tau PET imaging with flortaucipir and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR). Patients were allowed to be on or off other approved therapies such as cholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist memantine for Alzheimer's disease. They could also opt for a long-term extension.

In Study 1, 1736 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 700 mg of Kisunla every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses, then 1400 mg every 4 weeks (N = 860), or a placebo (N = 876) for up to 72 weeks. Treatment was switched to placebo based on amyloid PET levels measured at Week 24, Week 52, and Week 76. If the amyloid plaque level was < 11 Centiloids on a single PET scan or ranged from 11 to < 25 Centiloids on two consecutive PET scans, the patient became eligible to be switched to placebo.

### Alzheimer disease therapy — moving from amyloid-β to tau [^112enUsm]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer disease (AD) have focused mainly on reducing levels of amyloid-β (Aβ) in the brain. Some compounds have achieved this goal, but none has produced clinically meaningful results. Several methodological issues relating to clinical trials of these agents might explain this failure; an additional consideration is that the amyloid cascade hypothesis — which places amyloid plaques at the heart of AD pathogenesis — does not fully integrate a large body of data relevant to the emergence of clinical AD. Importantly, amyloid deposition is not strongly correlated with cognition in multivariate analyses, unlike hyperphosphorylated tau, neurofibrillary tangles, and synaptic and neuronal loss, which are closely associated with memory deficits. Targeting tau pathology, therefore, might be more clinically effective than Aβ-directed therapies.

Furthermore, numerous immunization studies in animal models indicate that reduction of intracellular levels of tau and phosphorylated tau is possible, and is associated with improved cognitive performance. Several tau-related vaccines are in advanced preclinical stages and will soon enter clinical trials. In this article, we present a critical analysis of the failure of Aβ-directed therapies, discuss limitations of the amyloid cascade hypothesis, and suggest the potential value of tau-targeted therapy for AD.

### New treatments in Alzheimer's disease [^1125TM4M]. Journal of Neurology (2018). High credibility.

The three papers we have reviewed in this journal club represent large, well-constructed, randomized controlled trials in new and promising treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Despite all three treatments having significant pre-clinical and clinical evidence for their suitability in treating Alzheimer's disease, all three failed to reach their primary outcomes. Although disappointing for the researchers and patients with Alzheimer's disease, it is important that lessons can be learned from these "negative" results, particularly in the evolution of trial design in this discipline. It is refreshing for the methodology and evidence to be presented in high-impact journals.

There are several potential reasons for the failure of these treatments to show significant clinical effects. The most important reason may be that participants are too far into their disease course to benefit from these treatments by the time they have started the trials. This may suggest that targeting preventative treatments at a population level is a more sensible approach. However, efforts to develop a disease-modifying treatment remain a priority for healthcare providers worldwide, as effective intervention would have the potential to transform the lives of millions of people with Alzheimer's disease and their carers, who are affected by the debilitating consequences of this disease.

### Present algorithms and future treatments for Alzheimer's disease [^111rPkNV]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

An estimated 47 million people live with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other forms of dementia worldwide. Although no disease-modifying treatments are currently available for AD, earlier diagnosis and proper management of the disease could have a considerable impact on patient and caregiver quality of life and functioning. Drugs currently approved for AD treat the cognitive, behavioral, and functional symptoms of the disease and consist of three cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine.

Treatment of patients with mild to moderate AD is generally initiated with a ChEI. Patients who show progression of symptoms while on ChEI monotherapy may be switched to another ChEI and/or memantine can be added to the treatment regimen. In recent years, putative disease-modifying therapies have emerged that aim to slow the progression of AD instead of only addressing its symptoms. However, many therapies have failed in clinical trials in patients with established AD, suggesting that, once developed, disease-modifying agents may need to be deployed earlier in the course of illness. This narrative literature review discusses present treatment algorithms and potential future therapies in AD.

### Galantamine hydrobromide [^115akqe3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In each study, the primary effectiveness of galantamine was evaluated using a dual outcome assessment strategy. This was measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) and the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change that required the use of caregiver information (CIBIC-plus).

- **Cognitive performance assessment**: The ability of galantamine to improve cognitive performance was assessed with the cognitive sub-scale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog), a multi-item instrument extensively validated in longitudinal cohorts of Alzheimer's disease patients. The ADAS-cog examines selected aspects of cognitive performance, including elements of memory, orientation, attention, reasoning, language, and praxis. The ADAS-cog scoring range is from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment. Elderly normal adults may score as low as 0 or 1, but it is not unusual for non-demented adults to score slightly higher.

- **Patient scores and changes**: The patients recruited as participants in each study using the tablet formulation had mean scores on ADAS-cog of approximately 27 units, with a range from 5 to 69. Experience gained in longitudinal studies of ambulatory patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease suggests that they gain 6 to 12 units a year on the ADAS-cog. Lesser degrees of change, however, are seen in patients with very mild or very advanced disease because the ADAS-cog is not uniformly sensitive to change over the course of the disease.

The annualized rate of decline in the placebo patients participating in galantamine trials was approximately…

### A framework for translating tauopathy therapeutics: Drug discovery to clinical trials [^115Z95Xp]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). High credibility.

The phenotypic spectrum of tauopathies crosses diverse clinical features, presentations, and variable symptomatic progression rates through the disease course. This heterogeneity complicates the identification of the right participants at the most appropriate stage of the disease to evaluate novel tauopathy treatments. Through genetic testing for highly penetrant autosomal dominant MAPT mutations, it is possible to identify disease carriers in their preclinical phase. Staged development is needed to eventually design preventative clinical trials in such individuals. Initial efficacy on target PD and biological biomarkers can be followed by longer-term studies of clinical efficacy and comparisons to modeled synthetic control groups or historical comparison groups, such that trials can then be designed to test prevention/delay of disease onset in carriers in the preclinical phase.

Following the informative example of the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU), interventions can be undertaken within a platform trial design that compares multiple early interventions with a prespecified biomarker interim analysis (stage gate) to proceed to longer-term trials. The ALLFTD and GENFI studies have successfully enrolled the largest numbers of families affected by genetic forms of MAPT mutation-FTD as well as sporadic disease, and have followed them in the largest international longitudinal observational natural history studies. They have also come together in the FTD Prevention Initiative, in which they are co-operating to further research efforts.

### Pharmacological interventions for cognitive decline in people with Down syndrome [^111fEoBk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

People with Down syndrome are vulnerable to developing dementia at an earlier age than the general population. Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline in individuals with Down syndrome can place a significant burden on both the individual and their family and caregivers. Various pharmacological interventions, including donepezil, galantamine, memantine, and rivastigmine, appear to have some effect in treating cognitive decline in people without Down syndrome; however, their effectiveness for those with Down syndrome remains unclear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of anti-dementia pharmacological interventions and nutritional supplements for treating cognitive decline in people with Down syndrome.

- **Search methods**: In January 2015, we searched CENTRAL, ALOIS (the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, seven other databases, and two trials registers. Additionally, we checked the references of relevant reviews and studies and contacted study authors, other researchers, and relevant drug manufacturers to identify additional studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of anti-dementia pharmacological interventions or nutritional supplements for adults (aged 18 years and older) with Down syndrome, in which treatment was administered and compared with either placebo or no treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included trials and extracted the relevant data. Review authors also contacted study authors to obtain additional information.

### Razadyne [^114kBNJc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

In each study, the primary effectiveness of Razadyne® was evaluated using a dual outcome assessment strategy as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) and the Clinician's Interview Based Impression of Change that required the use of caregiver information (CIBIC-plus).

The ability of Razadyne® to improve cognitive performance was assessed with the cognitive sub-scale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog), a multi-item instrument that has been extensively validated in longitudinal cohorts of Alzheimer's disease patients. The ADAS-cog examines selected aspects of cognitive performance, including elements of memory, orientation, attention, reasoning, language, and praxis. The ADAS-cog scoring range is from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment. Elderly normal adults may score as low as 0 or 1, but it is not unusual for non-demented adults to score slightly higher.

The patients recruited as participants in each study using the tablet formulation had mean scores on the ADAS-cog of approximately 27 units, with a range from 5 to 69. Experience gained in longitudinal studies of ambulatory patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease suggests that they gain 6 to 12 units a year on the ADAS-cog. Lesser degrees of change, however, are seen in patients with very mild or very advanced disease because the ADAS-cog is not uniformly sensitive to change over the course of the disease. The annualized rate of decline in the placebo patients participating in Razadyne® trials was approximately 4.5 units.

### Developing effective Alzheimer's disease therapies: Clinical experience and future directions [^113FckfQ]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Tau-targeting approaches at the time of writing have been sparse. LMTM (methylene blue, tau aggregation inhibitor) was tested in a Phase III study in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD), and failed to show clinical improvement. Similarly, late-stage clinical trials aiming to treat inflammation related to AD, including a number of NSAIDs, have also had poor efficacy results.

- **Late stage clinical trials: Disease-modifying treatments targeting inflammation**:

	The ongoing trials generally target earlier stages of the disease and use, in part, available biomarkers. BI 425809, a glycine transporter inhibitor thought to modulate NMDA receptor function, is currently in a Phase II clinical trial in early AD patients. The next generation of small molecule BACE inhibitors (CNP520, Elenbecestat) is still in ongoing clinical trials in early AD patients and asymptomatic patients. Elenbecestat is being evaluated in a Phase III study in early AD patients with confirmed brain amyloid using positron emission tomography (PET) and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assessment. CNP520 is being tested in subjects who are otherwise healthy but at increased risk of developing AD based on their age, genotype, and amyloid levels.

Several passive immunotherapies advanced to Phase III and prevention trials after mixed Phase II efficacy results in mild to moderate AD. Crenezumab Phase III trials in patients with MCI or prodromal AD with PET and CSF evidence of Aβ pathology using a higher dose were terminated due to lack of efficacy. Solanezumab missed the primary endpoint in a Phase III trial.

### Combination therapy in Alzheimer's disease: Is it time [^117Hsxj8]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia globally. There is increasing evidence showing AD has no single pathogenic mechanism; thus, treatment approaches focusing only on one mechanism are unlikely to be meaningfully effective. With only one potentially disease-modifying treatment approved, targeting amyloid-β (Aβ), AD is underserved regarding effective drug treatments. Combining multiple drugs or designing treatments that target multiple pathways could be an effective therapeutic approach.

Considering the distinction between added and combination therapies, one can conclude that most trials fall under the category of added therapies. For combination therapy to have an actual impact on the course of AD, it is likely necessary to target multiple mechanisms, including but not limited to Aβ and tau pathology.

Several challenges must be addressed regarding combination therapy, including choosing the correct agents, the optimal time and stage of AD to intervene, and designing proper protocols for clinical trials. This can be achieved through cooperation between the pharmaceutical industry, academia, private research centers, philanthropic institutions, and regulatory bodies.

Based on all available information, the success of combination therapy in tackling complicated disorders such as cancer, and the blueprint already laid out for implementing combination therapy and overcoming its challenges, an argument can be made that the field must move cautiously but quickly toward designing new clinical trials to further explore the pathological mechanisms.

### Facilitating treatment initiation in early-stage Alzheimer disease [^116zxwMf]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2022). Low credibility.

Once a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is established, a wide variety of therapy options are available to treat different stages of the disease. Patients have the opportunity to delay onset of the disease or delay its progression if diagnosed early enough through new FDA-approved disease-modifying treatments. For mild to moderate stages, new symptomatic treatments can slow the progression of the disease and improve symptoms. A multi-component approach is recommended in order to tailor treatments to each patient's needs.

### Recent progress in Alzheimer's disease research, part 3: Diagnosis and treatment [^1148fMbx]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

The tau protein is a structural protein that helps stabilize the microtubules of neurons; however, hyperphosphorylation and aggregation may occur, forming filaments within neurons that condense into neurofibrillary tangles associated with neurodegeneration. Modulation of the pathological tau protein species may be a viable disease intervention. One such passive immunotherapy has been shown to reduce intracellular tau pathology, resulting in improved cognitive assessments. In two well-established transgenic mouse models of tau pathology, JNPL3 and the more aggressive P301S, peripheral injections of two different anti-tau antibodies reduced biochemical markers of tau and delayed the onset of functional decline in P301S mice.

Anti-Aβ antibodies have shown great promise in pre-clinical studies; however, their usefulness in the clinical setting has not been demonstrated despite the conducting of many clinical trials. Various polymorphisms and assemblies have been discovered, and detrimental immune responses after active immunization have been observed. To prevent overactivation of microglia and reduce dangerous immune responses, Adolfsson et al. have developed a humanized anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody that not only targets different amyloid assembly states but is built on an IgG4 backbone, which induces a lower effector response than the IgG1 antibody. This IgG4 anti-Aβ antibody, called MABT, was shown to prevent amyloid aggregation, disaggregate preformed protofibrils, and prevent Aβ cytotoxicity in neurons and mixed cortical cell cultures.

### Clinical trials for disease-modifying therapies in Alzheimer's disease: A primer, lessons learned, and a blueprint for the future [^115pdoG4]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

The development phase — and to a lesser extent the discovery phase — of drug creation is guided by a Target Product Profile (TPP). The TPP defines the desirable features of a drug and its use, including the primary indication, patient population, treatment duration, delivery mode, dosage, regimen, tolerability, risk/side effects, and differentiating features in a competitive landscape. A minimally acceptable profile and an ideal profile are identified. Failure to achieve the minimally acceptable profile may lead to discontinuation of the development program. Using the TPP, the indication and proposed package insert are constructed, and the development program is designed in reverse to ensure that all the features of the TPP are fully defined for the compound in the course of development.

Clinical trials must be reported in a specific format called the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) when they are submitted to journals. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors has subscribed to these requirements to achieve standardized reporting of clinical trials. Anticipation of the features to be reported allows the checklist to function as a useful guide to planning a clinical trial.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed a template that can be used to plan a clinical trial, including all elements necessary to meet Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and CONSORT requirements.

Cognition is mediated by integrated cerebral circuits, and the preservation of circuit integrity is a precondition for a beneficial cognitive impact of therapy. Circuit function can be assessed by fMRI or quantitative electroencephalography. Fluorodeoxyglucose PET reflects synaptic integrity and is a measure of circuit synaptic function. Neurogranin is a measure of synaptic integrity that may represent a fluid biomarker of circuit preservation. These circuit measures can assess the circuit level impact of therapy and may better predict the cognitive outcome.

Biomarkers suggesting that an agent has produced disease modification are those closely correlated with processes leading to cell death. A drug-placebo difference in these biomarkers in favor of less degeneration and more neuroprotection by the active agent indicates that the drug is a DMT.

Biomarkers currently considered as indicative of disease-modification in AD include volumetric MRI and measures of tau protein aggregation (tau PET, CSF tau), neurofilament light chain protein, and VILIP-1.

Finally, MRI is used to monitor amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) occurring as a side effect in patients treated with some anti-amyloid mAbs. Other biomarkers commonly used to monitor adverse events of medications include liver functions, hematologic measures, and electrocardiography.

At the end of Phase II, the ADME, safety, tolerability, and target engagement of the test agent should be known. Dosing should be narrowed to one or two doses before proceeding to Phase III. Understanding these aspects is crucial for the advancement of therapeutic agents to the next phase of clinical trials.

### Testing the right target and right drug at the right stage [^116GM5bt]. Science Translational Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the only leading cause of death for which no disease-modifying therapy is currently available. Recent disappointing trial results at the dementia stage of AD have raised multiple questions about our approaches to the development of disease-modifying agents. Converging evidence suggests that the pathophysiological process of AD begins many years before the onset of dementia. So why do we keep testing drugs aimed at the initial stages of the disease process in patients at the end-stage of the illness?

### Adlarity [^115JPfqV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The ability of donepezil to improve cognitive performance was assessed using the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog), a multi-item instrument extensively validated in longitudinal cohorts of Alzheimer's disease patients. The ADAS-cog examines selected aspects of cognitive performance, including elements of memory, orientation, attention, reasoning, language, and praxis. The scoring range of the ADAS-cog is from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment. Elderly normal adults may score as low as 0 or 1, though it is not unusual for non-demented adults to score slightly higher.

The patients recruited as participants in each study had mean scores on the ADAS-cog of approximately 26 points, with a range from 4 to 61. Experience based on longitudinal studies of ambulatory patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease suggests that scores on the ADAS-cog increase (worsen) by 6–12 points per year. However, smaller changes may be observed in patients with very mild or very advanced disease, as the ADAS-cog is not uniformly sensitive to change over the course of the disease. The annualized rate of decline in placebo patients participating in donepezil trials was approximately 2 to 4 points per year.

### Sample size estimation for Alzheimer's disease trials from Japanese ADNI serial magnetic resonance imaging [^116vQKqL]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Little is known about the sample sizes required for clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-modifying treatments using atrophy measures from serial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the Japanese population.

- **Objective**: The primary objective of the present study was to estimate how large a sample size would be needed for future clinical trials for AD-modifying treatments in Japan using atrophy measures of the brain as a surrogate biomarker.

- **Methods**: Sample sizes were estimated from the rates of change of the whole brain and hippocampus by the k-means normalized boundary shift integral (KN-BSI) and cognitive measures using the data of 537 Japanese Alzheimer's Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI) participants with a linear mixed-effects model. We also examined the potential use of ApoE status as a trial enrichment strategy.

- **Results**: The hippocampal atrophy rate required smaller sample sizes than cognitive measures of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Inclusion of ApoE status reduced sample sizes for AD and MCI patients in the atrophy measures.

- **Conclusion**: These results show the potential use of longitudinal hippocampal atrophy measurement using automated image analysis as a progression biomarker and ApoE status as a trial enrichment strategy in a clinical trial of AD-modifying treatment in Japanese people.

### Leqembi [^1175EVAT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

After the 79-week double-blind, placebo-controlled period of Study 1, patients could enroll in an open-label extension period for up to 260 weeks. This was initiated following a gap period (range 9 to 59 months; mean 24 months) off treatment.

- **Study 2**: In Study 2, 1795 patients were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive Leqembi 10 mg/kg or placebo once every 2 weeks. Of the total number of patients randomized, 69% were ApoE ε4 carriers and 31% were ApoE ε4 non-carriers. The overall median age of patients was 72 years, with a range of 50 to 90 years. Fifty-two percent were women, and 1381 (77%) were White, 303 (17%) were Asian, and 47 (3%) were Black.

	- **Randomization**: The randomization was stratified according to clinical subgroup (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of the disease); the presence or absence of concomitant approved therapies for Alzheimer's disease at baseline (cholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist memantine); ApoE ε4 carrier status; and geographical region.

	- **Primary efficacy outcome**: The primary efficacy outcome was change from baseline at 18 months in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline at 18 months for the following measures: amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) using centiloids, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog14), and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS MCI-ADL).

### A critique of the drug discovery and phase 3 clinical programs targeting the amyloid hypothesis for Alzheimer disease [^116WanqU]. Annals of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is responsible for approximately 70% of all dementias. Currently, a confirmed diagnosis requires the presence of plaques (deposited amyloid β [Aβ] peptide) and tangles (intracellular, aggregated, hyperphosphorylated, tau protein) found via postmortem neuropathological examination of the brain. Despite numerous abnormalities within an AD brain, neuronal death, particularly within the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and frontal cortical regions, contributes to cognitive impairment. The amount and regional distribution of plaques in AD brains do not correlate well with the extent of neuronal loss or the clinical severity of dementia.

There have been studies suggesting a better correlation with soluble Aβ in AD brain; however, deposited Aβ comprises approximately 95% of total Aβ (soluble plus deposited). The role of Aβ in AD has been long debated: does it trigger the disease process, is there some threshold amount required to sustain the disease, or does deposited Aβ drive the disease forward in a continuous fashion? The presence of tau pathology, in the form of insoluble paired helical filaments (PHFs), correlates much better both with the areas of the brain suffering from neurodegeneration and with the extent of cognitive impairment. However, the numbers of PHFs do not account for all the neuronal loss. Finally, brain volume remains the best pathological correlate of dementia in AD.

### Disease modifying trials in Alzheimer's disease: Perspectives for the future [^115yq36D]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Disease modifying trials are becoming increasingly common in the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as the search for a treatment able to slow the progression of this disease continues. In this paper, we briefly discuss the methodological considerations for disease modifying trials that were addressed during three recent international task force meetings involving specialists in the field of AD trials.

- **Study design**: Topics covered included study design, the identification of appropriate outcomes, the use of biomarkers, and the identification of suitable study populations.
- **Update on recent trials**: We also provide an update on recent disease modifying trials which have enabled us to gain experience in the use of biomarkers and have helped to define suitable outcomes.
- **Future perspectives**: Consider how these updates can help us to shape future perspectives for disease modifying trials.

### Beneficial effects of snail Helix aspersa extract in an experimental model of Alzheimer's type dementia [^114FgfQB]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease with multifactorial etiology, unsatisfactory treatment, and a necessity for broad-spectrum active substances for cure. The mucus from Helix aspersa snail is a mixture of bioactive molecules with antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic effects. So far, there are no data concerning the capacity of snail extract (SE) to affect neurodegenerative disorders.

- **Objective**: The effects of SE from Helix aspersa on learning and memory deficits in Alzheimer's type dementia (ATD) induced by scopolamine (Sco) in male Wistar rats were examined, and some mechanisms of action underlying these effects were evaluated.

- **Methods**: SE (0.5 mL/100g) was applied orally through a food tube for 16 consecutive days: 5 days before and 11 days simultaneously with Sco (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). At the end of Sco treatment, using behavioral methods, we evaluated memory performance. Additionally, in cortex and hippocampus, the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, acetylcholine and monoamines (dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin) content, levels of main oxidative stress markers, and expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) were determined.

- **Results**: We demonstrated that, according to all behavioral tests used, SE significantly improved the cognitive deficits induced by Sco. Furthermore, SE possessed AChE inhibitory activity, moderate antioxidant properties, and the ability to modulate monoamines content in two brain structures.

### Aricept ODT [^113RRmGX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The patients recruited as participants in each study had mean scores on the ADAS-cog of approximately 26 points, with a range from 4 to 61. Experience based on longitudinal studies of ambulatory patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease suggests that scores on the ADAS-cog increase (worsen) by 6–12 points per year. However, smaller changes may be seen in patients with very mild or very advanced disease since the ADAS-cog is not uniformly sensitive to change over the course of the disease. The annualized rate of decline in the placebo patients participating in Aricept trials was approximately 2 to 4 points per year.

The ability of Aricept to produce an overall clinical effect was assessed using a Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change that required the use of caregiver information, the CIBIC-plus. The CIBIC-plus is not a single instrument and is not a standardized instrument like the ADAS-cog. Clinical trials for investigational drugs have used a variety of CIBIC formats, each different in terms of depth and structure. As such, results from a CIBIC-plus reflect clinical experience from the trial or trials in which it was used and cannot be compared directly with the results of CIBIC-plus evaluations from other clinical trials.

The CIBIC-plus used in Aricept trials was a semi-structured instrument that was intended to examine four major areas of patient function: General, Cognitive, Behavioral, and Activities of Daily Living. It represents the assessment of a skilled clinician based upon his/her observations at an interview with the patient, in combination.

### Pharmacodynamic effects of semorinemab on plasma and CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology [^114vxZ3u]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, representing 60%–80% of cases. It is progressive, with no known cure, and an estimated 6.7 million people in the United States are afflicted with the disease. AD is characterized by two main pathological hallmarks: extracellular amyloid plaques composed of aggregated amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles that consist of the protein tau. The spatial temporal burden of cortical tau neurofibrillary tangles tracks more closely with neuronal loss and ante mortem cognitive measures than amyloid, suggesting, along with mechanistic data from in vitro and in vivo models, that tau is an active contributor to AD pathogenesis and a viable therapeutic target. Tau pathology spreads in a predictable sequence in AD, implying that it may be released extracellularly and propagates across interconnected brain networks in a prion-like fashion. Semorinemab, a humanized anti-tau IgG4 monoclonal antibody under development for AD, is hypothesized to target the proliferation and accumulation of tau pathology by intercepting and clearing tau from the extracellular space.

After a Phase I study (NCT02820896), two Phase II studies in different AD patient populations were conducted: Tauriel (NCT03289143), a Phase II study of semorinemab in prodromal-to-mild (P2M) AD patients, and Lauriet (NCT03828747), a Phase II study in mild-to-moderate (M2M) AD patients. In Tauriel, semorinemab failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy at doses of 1500, 4500, and 8100 mg for 73 weeks. In contrast, a 4500 mg dose of

### Aricept ODT [^115EhiVc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The study measured the effectiveness of 23 mg/day using a dual outcome assessment strategy. This approach evaluated cognitive function with an instrument tailored for more impaired patients and assessed overall function through caregiver-rated analysis.

The cognitive performance improvement afforded by 23 mg/day was assessed using the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB), a validated, multi-item tool for evaluating cognitive function in patients with moderate to severe dementia. The SIB assesses specific cognitive performance aspects such as memory, language, orientation, attention, praxis, visuospatial ability, construction, and social interaction. Scores on the SIB range from 0 to 100, with lower scores signifying greater cognitive impairment.

The overall clinical effect of 23 mg/day was evaluated via the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change, incorporating caregiver input, known as the CIBIC-plus. The CIBIC-plus in this trial was a semi-structured instrument examining four major patient function areas: general, cognitive, behavioral, and activities of daily living. It reflects a skilled clinician's assessment based on patient interviews and information provided by a caregiver familiar with the patient's behavior over the rated interval. The CIBIC-plus is scored on a seven-point categorical scale, with 1 indicating "markedly improved" and 4 indicating "no change".

### A framework for translating tauopathy therapeutics: Drug discovery to clinical trials [^113MbMGd]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Low credibility.

Tau may theoretically be a better AD therapeutic target than Aβ because, unlike the weaker relationship of brain Aβ plaque burden and cognition, the extent of insoluble tau pathology predicts both the onset of clinical symptoms of AD as well as the pattern of clinical decline. Insoluble tau deposition measured by tau PET strongly correlates with the onset of clinical symptoms in autosomal dominant AD, and temporal lobe tau PET uptake predicts the cortical spread of tau pathology, brain atrophy, and subsequent clinical decline in sporadic AD. Moreover, the severity and type of symptoms in AD closely reflect the distribution of insoluble tau in the brain, suggesting that interventions reducing tau have the potential to produce large clinical effects.

Clinical trials of early tau therapies, including biologics with first-generation N-terminal anti-tau mAbs, tilavonemab (ABBV-8E12), gosuranemab, zagotenemab, and semorinemab, have failed to demonstrate consistent clinical benefits in AD and/or other tauopathies. A trial of semorinemab in mild-to-moderate AD stands apart, having reported a ≈40% reduction in the rate of decline on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Composite co-primary endpoint, but not on other endpoints, resulting in a lack of converging evidence and questions around the potential reproducibility of the findings. By contrast, in prodromal-mild AD, semorinemab did not demonstrate clinical benefit, with modestly reduced CSF p-tau181 levels by ≈15% (mean of all doses). This effect was less than the ≈25% reductions reported for patients who responded.

### Current challenges for the successful treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease: Treating the pathologies of the disease to change its clinical course [^116RFgTm]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2008). Low credibility.

The need to develop meaningful therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease is beginning to reach the general awareness of the public. Matching this awareness is the accelerated pace of compounds entering clinical trials. In addition, the development of diagnostic tools, biomarkers, and imaging modalities of the past decade in Alzheimer's disease has improved dramatically. Unfortunately, the use of these diagnostic and scientific tools in clinical trial practice has not yet aligned or optimized. Most agents still target clinical endpoints associated with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease rather than focus on modulation of the underlying pathologies. Although there are obvious practical reasons for this, meaningful progress in other areas of medicine, such as cardiology and oncology, has generally targeted and monitored improvement or abatement of pathology as the primary endpoint as a successful disease-modifying strategy. Perhaps it is time to consider a similar approach in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

### Riluzole, a glutamate modulator, slows cerebral glucose metabolism decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease [^111c1F8q]. Brain (2021). High credibility.

Dysregulation of glutamatergic neural circuits has been implicated in a cycle of toxicity, believed to be among the neurobiological underpinnings of Alzheimer's disease. Previously, we reported preclinical evidence that the glutamate modulator riluzole, which is FDA approved for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, has potential benefits on cognition and structural and molecular markers of aging and Alzheimer's disease.

The objective of this study was to evaluate in a pilot clinical trial, using neuroimaging biomarkers, the potential efficacy and safety of riluzole in patients with Alzheimer's disease as compared to placebo. A 6-month phase 2 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted at two sites. Participants consisted of males and females aged 50 to 95 years with a clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease and a Mini-Mental State Examination score between 19 and 27.

Ninety-four participants were screened; 50 participants who met inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to receive 50 mg riluzole (n = 26) or placebo (n = 24) twice a day. Twenty-two riluzole-treated and 20 placebo participants completed the study.

- **Primary endpoints**: Baseline to 6-month changes in:
	- Cerebral glucose metabolism as measured with fluorodeoxyglucose-PET in prespecified regions of interest (hippocampus, posterior cingulate, precuneus, lateral temporal, inferior parietal, frontal).
	- Changes in posterior cingulate levels of the neuronal viability marker N-acetylaspartate as measured with in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

### A tough trek in the development of an anti-amyloid therapy for Alzheimer's disease: Do we see hope in the distance [^111gPeHk]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Low credibility.

The search for a clinically effective therapy for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been long and arduous. In some circles, the recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the human monoclonal antibody, Aducanumab, was viewed as a welcome advance. However, the administrative decision, in the face of a negative review by the members of the FDA neurology advisory board, raised many questions concerning its appropriateness. In response, the FDA has modified the conditions under which the drug should be administered.

Currently, the etiology of AD remains unknown. Thus, the application of therapies based on the still controversial amyloid hypothesis deserves critical scrutiny. While successful animal studies based on the hypothesis have stimulated many clinical trials in humans, none of these have shown statistically significant clinical benefit, raising questions regarding the intrinsic validity of the hypothesis itself. However, each successive trial has benefited from the experiences of those which preceded it.

Given these caveats, the relevance of an apparent beneficial response in a subset of Aducanumab-treated study participants must be weighed carefully. There are competing hypotheses regarding the etiology and pathophysiology responsible for the development of AD, including tau protein aggregation, acetylcholine deficiency, and neuroinflammation, among others, all of which remain controversial. Nonetheless, the newly approved agent, Aducanumab, did show some subtle benefit in some mild AD patients. Understanding the hypotheses and controversies may help better evaluate future therapeutic directions.

### Clinical trials for disease-modifying therapies in Alzheimer's disease: A primer, lessons learned, and a blueprint for the future [^111kgoez]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) has no currently approved disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), and treatments to prevent, delay the onset, or slow the progression are urgently needed. A delay of 5 years, if available by 2025, would decrease the total number of patients with AD by 50% in 2050.

To meet the definition of DMT, an agent must produce an enduring change in the course of AD; clinical trials of DMTs have the goal of demonstrating this effect. AD drug discovery entails target identification followed by high-throughput screening and lead optimization of drug-like compounds. Once an optimized agent is available and has been assessed for efficacy and toxicity in animals, it progresses through Phase I testing with healthy volunteers, Phase II learning trials to establish proof-of-mechanism and dose, and Phase III confirmatory trials to demonstrate efficacy and safety in larger populations. Phase III is followed by Food and Drug Administration review and, if appropriate, market access.

Trial populations include cognitively normal at-risk participants in prevention trials, mildly impaired participants with biomarker evidence of AD in prodromal AD trials, and subjects with cognitive and functional impairment in AD dementia trials. Biomarkers are critical in trials of DMTs, assisting in participant characterization and diagnosis, target engagement and proof-of-pharmacology, demonstration of disease-modification, and monitoring side effects.

Clinical trial designs include randomized, parallel group; delayed start; staggered withdrawal; and adaptive. Lessons learned from completed trials are essential for future research.

### Ariceptodt [^115xC6AM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The effectiveness of ARICEPT as a treatment for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease is demonstrated by the results of two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical investigations in patients with Alzheimer's disease (diagnosed by NINCDS and DSM III-R criteria, Mini-Mental State Examination ≥ 10 and ≤ 26, and Clinical Dementia Rating of 1 or 2). The mean age of patients participating in ARICEPT trials was 73 years, with a range of 50 to 94. Approximately 62% of patients were women, and 38% were men. The racial distribution was 95% white, 3% black, and 2% other races.

The higher dose of 10 mg did not provide a statistically significantly greater clinical benefit than 5 mg. There is a suggestion, however, based upon the order of group mean scores and dose trend analyses from these clinical trials, that a daily dose of 10 mg of ARICEPT might provide additional benefit for some patients. Accordingly, whether or not to employ a dose of 10 mg is a matter of prescriber and patient preference.

- **Study outcome measures**: In each study, the effectiveness of treatment with ARICEPT was evaluated using a dual outcome assessment strategy. The ability of ARICEPT to improve cognitive performance was assessed with the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog), a multi-item instrument that has been extensively validated in longitudinal cohorts of Alzheimer's disease patients. The ADAS-cog examines selected aspects of cognitive performance including elements of memory, orientation, attention, and reasoning.

### Medi1814 selectively reduces free Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid of non-clinical species and Alzheimer's disease patients [^114eB2Re]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and is characterized by cognitive deterioration and impaired activities of daily living. The predominant pathologies associated with AD in the brain are aggregates of amyloid beta (Aβ) deposited in the extracellular space, and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles of the microtubule-associated protein tau. The amyloid cascade hypothesis, supported by preclinical work on oligomers and recent clinical evaluation of plaque lowering, remains a dominant model hypothesized for the progression of AD. As a consequence, Aβ has been a primary target for therapeutic interventions, with most experimental drugs in clinical trials over the last two decades aiming to either reduce its production (with small molecule γ‐secretase and β‐site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme inhibitors) or promote its clearance (with immunotherapies).

Of the forms of Aβ targeted, Aβ 42 and Aβ 43 are highly hydrophobic and self-aggregating, whereas Aβ 40 is less so. Indeed, Aβ 40 has been postulated to have anti-amyloidogenic and neuroprotective effects in the brain, although this has not been demonstrated in clinical trials. Presenilin 1 (PSEN1, the catalytic subunit of the γ‐secretase complex) is considered to play an important role in the generation of Aβ. Most mutations do not increase total Aβ generation but instead increase the release and ratio of longer (less trimmed), amyloidogenic species of Aβ (≥ Aβ 42).

### Challenges, solutions, and recommendations for Alzheimer's disease combination therapy [^116YviHX]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2016). Low credibility.

Given the complex neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), combination therapy may be necessary for effective treatment. However, several challenges — scientific, pragmatic, regulatory, and business — need to be addressed before combination therapy for AD can become a reality. Leaders from academia and industry, along with a former member of the Food and Drug Administration and the Alzheimer's Association, have explored these challenges and propose a strategy to facilitate proof-of-concept combination therapy trials in the near future.

- **Integrated understanding**: A more integrated understanding of the complex pathophysiology and progression of AD is needed to identify the appropriate pathways and the disease stage to target.
- **Novel clinical trial designs**: Once drug candidates are identified, novel clinical trial designs and selection of appropriate outcome assessments will be needed. This will enable the definition and evaluation of the appropriate dose and dosing regimen, as well as the determination of efficacy.

Success in addressing this urgent problem will only be achieved through collaboration among multiple stakeholders.

### Alzheimer's disease beyond amyloid: Strategies for future therapeutic interventions [^11721e6c]. BMJ (2020). Low credibility.

Biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease have been clearly identified, yet the disease remains a complex and multifaceted disorder. Few would argue against the value of biomarkers for diagnosis and tracking the course of Alzheimer's disease. As our understanding of these biomarkers advances, however, the limitation of these signature proteins as targets of treatment also emerges. Several promising strategies may improve the clinical outcomes of future trials.

- **Monoclonal treatments**: The use of higher concentrations of monoclonal treatments can adjust for poor penetration of the blood-brain barrier.

- **Early identification and treatment**: Early identification and treatment of patients at high risk for Alzheimer's disease involve targeting treatment at asymptomatic patients with limited biomarker deposition.

- **Simultaneous or sequential targeting**: Simultaneous or sequential targeting of both biomarkers with monoclonal treatment may determine whether synergy is needed to achieve efficacy.

Meanwhile, we need to explore promising areas of research that target pathological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease and affect cognitive performance, such as vascular and inflammatory risk factors. Whether these cognitive benefits directly correlate with, or significantly affect, biomarker deposition requires further investigation. Cerebrovascular parameters, which may affect clinical outcomes in monoclonal trials, should be evaluated. The combination of cerebrovascular risk modification and monoclonal treatments targeting amyloid β/tau protein could have a therapeutic effect not seen in isolation.

### Risks and benefits of unapproved disease-modifying treatments for neurodegenerative disease [^111cKo8B]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

To determine whether patients randomized to unapproved, disease-modifying interventions in neurodegenerative disease trials have better outcomes than patients randomized to placebo, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed. This analysis focused on the risk and benefits experienced by patients in randomized placebo-controlled trials testing investigational treatments for Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

The researchers searched MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov for results of randomized trials testing non-Food and Drug Administration-approved, putatively disease-modifying interventions from January 2005 to May 2018. Trial characteristics were double-extracted. Coprimary endpoints included the treatment advantage over placebo on efficacy (standardized mean difference in outcomes) and safety (risk ratios of serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events), calculated with random effects meta-analyses. The study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018103798).

A total of 113 trials were included, encompassing 39,875 patients. There was no significant efficacy advantage associated with assignment to putatively disease-modifying interventions compared to placebo for Alzheimer disease (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.07 to 0.01), Parkinson disease (SMD -0.09, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.15), ALS (SMD 0.02, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.30), or Huntington disease (0.02, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.31). Patients with Alzheimer disease assigned to active treatment were at higher risk of experiencing serious adverse events compared to those assigned to placebo.

### A critique of the drug discovery and phase 3 clinical programs targeting the amyloid hypothesis for Alzheimer disease [^1122mhTo]. Annals of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

The phase 2 program studied 52 AD patients in a placebo-controlled, randomized trial. Several dosing regimens were compared over a 12-week period: 100 mg solanezumab every 4 weeks, 100 mg weekly, 400 mg every 4 weeks, and 400 mg weekly. The primary outcome measure was the safety and tolerability of multiple administrations of solanezumab, with pharmacokinetic and cognitive assessments as secondary endpoints. There was a rapid, dose-related and dose regimen–related increase in plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42. Treatment-emergent adverse events were not different between solanezumab-treated patients and placebo controls. There was no evidence of ARIA-E or ARIA-M, or of meningoencephalitis, and no treatment effects measurable by ADAS-cog.

In this study, antibody-bound and free Aβ40 and Aβ42 were assayed in CSF samples. These data showed a dose-related and dose regimen–related increase in total (bound plus unbound) Aβ40 and Aβ42 compared to baseline values. For unbound Aβ, there was no treatment effect on Aβ40, but for Aβ42, there was a dose-related and dose regimen–related increase. The increase in total Aβ40 (bound and unbound) is most likely due to capture by solanezumab entering the CNS. The increase in Aβ42 (bound and unbound), although somewhat counterintuitive, might herald some dissolution of amyloid plaques that are predominantly comprised of Aβ1–42. Thus, the mechanism of action of solanezumab was demonstrated in the phase 2 study.

### Biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease drug development [^1147yT47]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2011). Low credibility.

Developing new therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critically important to avoid the impending public health disaster imposed by this common disorder. Means must be found to prevent, delay the onset, or slow the progression of AD. These goals will be achieved by identifying disease-modifying therapies and testing them in clinical trials.

Biomarkers play an increasingly important role in AD drug development. In preclinical testing, they assist in decisions to develop an agent. Biomarkers in Phase I provide insights into toxic responses and drug metabolism; in Phase II proof-of-concept trials, they facilitate go/no-go decisions and dose finding.

- **Identifying patients and target engagement**: Biomarkers can play a role in identifying presymptomatic patients or specific patient subgroups. They can provide evidence of target engagement before clinical changes can be expected.

- **Brain imaging**: Brain imaging can serve as a primary outcome in Phase II trials and as a key secondary outcome in Phase III trials. Magnetic resonance imaging is currently best positioned for use in large multicenter clinical trials.

- **Cerebrospinal fluid measures**: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of amyloid beta protein (Aβ), tau protein, and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein are sensitive and specific to the diagnosis of AD and may serve as inclusion criteria and possibly as outcomes in clinical trials targeting relevant pathways.

Plasma measures of Aβ are of limited diagnostic value but may provide important information as a measure of treatment response. A wide variety of measures of detectable products of cellular processes are being developed as possible biomarkers accessible in research.

### Present algorithms and future treatments for Alzheimer's disease [^115MtekX]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

In recent years, drugs targeting the pathobiological processes involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have emerged. These putative disease-modifying therapies aim to slow the progression of AD instead of only addressing its symptoms. Therapies currently in phase III trials that target the amyloid cascade include agents designed to decrease amyloid-β production, such as β-secretase 1 inhibitors or γ-secretase modulators, or to increase amyloid-β clearance, like anti–amyloid-β antibodies or active immunotherapies. However, at the time of writing, all completed phase III trials that have tested these agents (e.g. bapineuzumab, solanezumab, verubecestat) have failed to meet their primary endpoints.

The failure of anti–amyloid-β drugs in AD has led to the hypothesis that such agents may need to be deployed earlier in the course of the illness, potentially even before symptoms manifest, to be effective before the brain is significantly affected. Consequently, several clinical trials in individuals "at risk" for AD or with preclinical or prodromal AD are now under way.

### Tau-targeting therapies for Alzheimer disease [^1179MNTG]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Pathologically, AD is characterized by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, with associated loss of synapses and neurons, resulting in cognitive deficits and eventually dementia. Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide and tau protein are the primary components of the plaques and tangles, respectively.

In the decades since Aβ and tau were identified, development of therapies for AD has primarily focused on Aβ, but tau has received more attention in recent years, in part because of the failure of various Aβ-targeting treatments in clinical trials. In this article, we review the status of tau-targeting therapies for AD. Initially, potential anti-tau therapies were based mainly on inhibition of kinases or tau aggregation, or on stabilization of microtubules, but most of these approaches have been discontinued because of toxicity and/or lack of efficacy.

Currently, the majority of tau-targeting therapies in clinical trials are immunotherapies, which have shown promise in numerous preclinical studies. Given that tau pathology correlates better with cognitive impairments than do Aβ lesions, targeting of tau is expected to be more effective than Aβ clearance once the clinical symptoms are evident. With future improvements in diagnostics, these two hallmarks of the disease might be targeted prophylactically.

### Clinical trials for disease-modifying therapies in Alzheimer's disease: A primer, lessons learned, and a blueprint for the future [^11184GXk]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Phase III and Phase II are often conceived as "learn" and "confirm" trials. The learnings of Phase II are tested in Phase III, and if benefits are confirmed, the agent will be submitted to the FDA for review. Phase III trials for disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are 12 to 24 months in duration and typically involve 600–1000 patients per arm of the study, with each dose and the placebo comprising one arm each.

The reasons for the failure of drugs to advance from Phase III to regulatory review include lack of efficacy (50%), unacceptable toxicity (14%), and commercial, strategic, and operational issues (31%). These figures are for all classes of agents, not limited to Alzheimer's disease-directed drugs; they emphasize the importance of accruing efficacy data in Phase II. Drugs with genetic connections to the neurobiology of the disease and biomarkers to inform drug development decisions are more likely to advance from one phase to the next than drugs that lack this information.

As noted above, biomarkers are used in Phase III to diagnose participants, support disease-modifying activity, and monitor amyloid-related imaging abnormalities in monoclonal antibody (mAb) studies.

### Exelon [^117CrDh1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

In each study, the effectiveness of Exelon was evaluated using a dual outcome assessment strategy. The ability of Exelon to improve cognitive performance was assessed with the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog), a multi-item instrument that has been extensively validated in longitudinal cohorts of Alzheimer's disease patients. The ADAS-cog examines selected aspects of cognitive performance, including elements of memory, orientation, attention, reasoning, language, and praxis. The ADAS-cog scoring range is from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment. Elderly normal adults may score as low as 0 or 1, but it is not unusual for non-demented adults to score slightly higher.

The patients recruited as participants in each study had mean scores on ADAS-cog of approximately 23 units, with a range from 1 to 61. Experience gained in longitudinal studies of ambulatory patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease suggests that they gain 6–12 units a year on the ADAS-cog. Lesser degrees of change, however, are seen in patients with very mild or very advanced disease because the ADAS-cog is not uniformly sensitive to change over the course of the disease. The annualized rate of decline in the placebo patients participating in Exelon trials was approximately 3–8 units per year.

### Pathways to personalized medicine-embracing heterogeneity for progress in clinical therapeutics research in Alzheimer's disease [^115hV6Pu]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Low credibility.

Insufficiently informative reporting of trials may be related to the constraints of regulatory approval pathways, as well as economic interests within the health care investment community driving drug development. Regulatory agencies are responsible for protecting public health by ensuring the safety and efficacy of drugs, biological products, medical devices, and so forth. This population orientation may sometimes be in tension with the individual patient orientation of health care practitioners. If a drug does not show statistical benefit in the population for which it is intended, it cannot move forward. Yet, within that population, there may be subgroups or individuals for whom the drug really worked. Responder analyses might elucidate these subgroups, but the consequence might be having to redefine the indication, setting development back to conduct more trials. This is inefficient and costly.

### Anti-amyloid antibody treatments for Alzheimer's disease [^117PvfKK]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

The research conducted on anti-amyloid antibody treatments for Alzheimer's disease offers key insights into potential therapeutic strategies. Recent studies have focused on the efficacy and safety of these treatments, highlighting the need for further investigation. These approaches aim to target and reduce amyloid plaques, which are believed to play a significant role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. However, the complexity of the disease pathophysiology means that these treatments must be carefully evaluated through rigorous clinical trials to determine their true therapeutic value.

### Stratification of patients is the way to go to develop neuroprotective/disease-modifying drugs for Alzheimer's disease [^111a6YhR]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2008). Low credibility.

The development of effective neuroprotective drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a formidable challenge because the disease is multifactorial and heterogeneous. Although AD is characterized histopathologically by the presence of numerous amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary degeneration of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain, these two hallmark lesions do not exist in any fixed proportion within the disease. Furthermore, in the brains of some normal aged individuals, there are as many amyloid-beta plaques seen as in typical cases of AD. On the other hand, extensive neurofibrillary degeneration of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau and dementia, but in the absence of amyloid-beta plaques, occur in several related neurodegenerative disorders called tauopathies.

More than one molecular mechanism has been described for the development of amyloid-beta as well as neurofibrillary degeneration of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau. Thus, AD apparently results from several different etiopathogenic mechanisms and offers numerous rational therapeutic targets. We have discovered that there are at least five different subgroups of AD, and future studies are likely to identify additional subgroups. The employment of these subgroups of AD in clinical trials can markedly increase success in developing specific and potent therapeutic drugs.

### Primary prevention trials in Alzheimer disease [^116ZboPp]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Many new treatments under development for Alzheimer disease (AD) will be disease-modifying rather than symptomatic. Clinical evaluation of these treatments will require primary and secondary prevention trials. We describe some of the methodologic challenges in designing primary prevention trials for AD and illustrate these with examples from the Alzheimer Disease Anti-Inflammatory Prevention Trial (ADAPT) and Ginkgo in Evaluation of Memory (GEM) Study.

Primary prevention trials for AD present many design challenges. In most situations, secondary prevention trials provide the most feasible first step toward primary prevention.

### Alzheimer's disease [^111r1qvj]. Lancet (2011). Low credibility.

An estimated 24 million people worldwide have dementia, the majority of whom are thought to have Alzheimer's disease. Thus, Alzheimer's disease represents a major public health concern and has been identified as a research priority. Although there are licensed treatments that can alleviate symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, there is a pressing need to improve our understanding of pathogenesis to enable the development of disease-modifying treatments.

Methods for improving diagnosis are also moving forward, but a better consensus is needed for the development of a panel of biological and neuroimaging biomarkers that support clinical diagnosis. There is now strong evidence of potential risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and cognitive decline, but further work is needed to understand these better and to establish whether interventions can substantially lower these risks. In this seminar, we provide an overview of recent evidence regarding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and discuss potential ways to reduce the risk of developing the disease.

### Insights into pathophysiology, biomarkers, and therapeutics in tauopathies: Proceedings of the Tau2024 Global Conference [^111j2cYe]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Low credibility.

- **Clinical trial design and enrollment in studies of tauopathies**: Successfully addressing tauopathies requires the capability to confirm the biological disease diagnosis, drawing lessons from anti-amyloid trials. Although specific biomarkers for primary tauopathies remain lacking, recent advances offer promise for differentiating between different tauopathies and tracking tau tangle accumulation in the brain. Notably, early-phase trials targeting tau in Alzheimer's disease have demonstrated measurable biological changes. For example, BIIB080, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting the MAPT transcript gene, has shown a dose-dependent sustained reduction in tau levels in CSF, which is associated with reduced tau burden in the brain.

Furthermore, while the dominant approach in tau-targeted therapy currently involves immunotherapy, the precise tau epitope to target remains under investigation. Recent evidence suggests the potential significance of targeting seed-competent tau. Promising interim results from tau immunotherapy (E2814) targeting two sites of the MTBR highlight the potential for second-generation anti-tau monoclonal antibodies, building on the growing understanding of tau pathophysiology.

### Phase 3 solanezumab trials: Secondary outcomes in mild Alzheimer's disease patients [^114AabX7]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2016). Low credibility.

EXPEDITION and EXPEDITION2 were identically designed placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies assessing the effects of solanezumab, an antiamyloid monoclonal antibody binding soluble amyloid-β peptide, on cognitive and functional decline over 80 weeks in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). Primary findings for both studies have been published.

- **Methods**: Secondary analyses of efficacy, biomarker, and safety endpoints in the pooled (EXPEDITION + EXPEDITION2) mild AD population were performed.

- **Results**: In the mild AD population, less cognitive and functional decline was observed with solanezumab (n = 659) versus placebo (n = 663), measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive subscale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living functional scale Instrumental ADLs. Baseline-to-endpoint changes did not differ between treatment groups for the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living functional scale, basic items of the ADCS-ADL, and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes. Plasma/cerebrospinal fluid biomarker findings indicated target engagement by solanezumab. Solanezumab demonstrated acceptable safety. Efficacy findings for the moderate AD population are also provided.

- **Discussion**: These findings describe solanezumab effects on efficacy/safety measures in a mild AD population. Another Phase 3 study, EXPEDITION3, will investigate solanezumab's effects in a mild AD population.

### Randomized phase II study of the safety and efficacy of semorinemab in participants with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease: Lauriet [^111k76Ne]. Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Accumulation of tau pathology in Alzheimer disease (AD) correlates with cognitive decline. Anti-tau immunotherapies were proposed as potential interventions in AD. While antibodies targeting N-terminal tau failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy in prodromal-to-mild AD, their utility at other disease stages was not evaluated in prior studies. Lauriet is a phase 2 study of an anti-tau monoclonal antibody, semorinemab, in patients with mild-to-moderate AD.

- **Methods**: The phase 2 Lauriet study included a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind period, during which participants with mild-to-moderate AD received 4,500 mg of IV semorinemab or placebo every 4 weeks for 48 or 60 weeks. Participants who chose to continue in the subsequent optional open-label extension received 4,500 mg of semorinemab every 4 weeks for up to 96 weeks. Coprimary efficacy endpoints were change from baseline to week 49 or 61 on the 11-item version of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog11) and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scale. Secondary efficacy endpoints included change from baseline on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). Safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic effects were also evaluated.

- **Results**: Between December 3, 2018, and February 27, 2020, 624 individuals were screened, 272 participants were randomized, and 238 were included in the modified intent-to-treat population (received ≥ 1 dose(s) of study medication).
