## Question

A 50-year-old man with a remote history of intravenous drug use and a past medical history of AIDS presents to his primary care provider with several weeks of productive cough and a mild fever. He was in his normal state of health and slowly started to develop these symptoms. He is hoping to be prescribed an antibiotic so he can get back to "normal". Family history is significant for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. He takes antiviral medication and a multivitamin daily. His heart rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 19/min, blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg, and temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F). On physical examination, he looks uncomfortable. A chest examination reveals consolidation in the right lower lung. Chest radiography confirms right lower lobe pneumonia. Of the following options, which is the most likely cause of the patient's pneumonia?
A. Aspiration pneumonia
B. Community-acquired pneumonia
C. Disseminated cutaneous infection
D. Pulmonary sequestration

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnosis is most likely for a 50-year-old man with AIDS who presents with several weeks of productive cough, mild fever, and right lower lobe consolidation on chest radiograph, and to choose among aspiration pneumonia, community-acquired pneumonia, disseminated cutaneous infection, and pulmonary sequestration. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how the clinical syndrome maps onto the differential for HIV-associated pneumonias. Then, I should verify the radiographic pattern and what it implies for likely pathogens. Next, I will compare the competing options against the evidence base for HIV-related lung infections. Finally, I will consider what additional data would confirm the diagnosis and outline immediate management implications, including when to broaden the workup for TB or PCP if the course is atypical.

> Let me first confirm the key clinical features and their implications. Several weeks of productive cough with fever and focal consolidation on exam and chest radiograph in a person with AIDS strongly suggests a bacterial community-acquired pneumonia rather than a nonproductive, interstitial process, as bacterial pneumonia in HIV typically presents with acute fevers, chills, productive sputum, and focal consolidation on exam and imaging, whereas PCP classically presents with a nonproductive cough and diffuse interstitial infiltrates rather than lobar consolidation [^111upusP] [^111HiasY] [^112PPoP9].

> Wait, let me verify the radiographic clue because I initially thought "diffuse bilateral ground-glass" might fit here, but that would be misleading in this case. Hold on, I should verify the actual description: the film shows right lower lobe consolidation, which is the hallmark of bacterial pneumonia in HIV, whereas PCP typically shows diffuse bilateral ground-glass interstitial infiltrates and often a normal lung exam early on, so the focal lobar consolidation here argues against PCP as the primary diagnosis in this presentation [^111upusP] [^111Vavif] [^112PPoP9].

> I will now examine the epidemiology and risk context to ensure pretest probabilities align. Bacterial pneumonia remains the most common HIV-associated respiratory infection in developed settings, and people with HIV have a markedly increased incidence of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia compared with those without HIV, with risk rising as CD4 counts fall; even on effective ART, the risk remains elevated, which fits this patient's AIDS status and symptom profile [^114SJdWx] [^1172wE8f] [^11522wuA].

> Let me consider aspiration pneumonia as a competitor. I need to check whether there are aspiration risk factors such as dysphagia, impaired consciousness, or recurrent events; none are described here, and the absence of recurrent pneumonias or neurologic compromise makes aspiration less likely than straightforward community-acquired bacterial pneumonia in this context, although aspiration remains a consideration if risk factors emerge or recurrences occur [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the other options. Disseminated cutaneous infection would not typically manifest with isolated lobar consolidation on chest radiograph; if there were cutaneous involvement, it would be a separate diagnostic pathway and not the most parsimonious explanation for focal lung consolidation, so this option is inconsistent with the imaging and exam findings here [^notfound]. Pulmonary sequestration is a congenital anomaly and would be an unusual, background diagnosis rather than an acute infectious presentation; it does not fit the acute febrile productive-cough syndrome described, making it the least likely choice in this scenario [^notfound].

> But wait, what if this is tuberculosis masquerading as bacterial pneumonia. I should double-check TB features: in advanced HIV, TB can present with lower-lobe infiltrates and may lack classic upper-lobe cavitation, and symptoms beyond a few weeks with systemic features should prompt TB evaluation; however, the acute productive-cough consolidation phenotype and lack of TB-specific clues here still make community-acquired bacterial pneumonia more likely initially, while maintaining a low threshold to test for TB if the course is suboptimal or risk is high [^112in7Qz] [^114GtqpE].

> Let me synthesize the most likely diagnosis. Given the clinical picture of productive cough and fever with focal right lower lobe consolidation in a patient with AIDS, the most likely diagnosis is community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, with common pathogens in this setting including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. This aligns with HIV-specific guidance describing focal consolidation as characteristic of bacterial pneumonia and with the elevated incidence of CAP in people with HIV [^111upusP] [^114SJdWx] [^1159tetS].

> I should confirm immediate management implications. Empiric antibacterial therapy should be initiated promptly for HIV-associated bacterial pneumonia, with adjustment once microbiology returns. In patients not yet on ART, initiation of ART within about two weeks of treating the infection is recommended unless contraindicated, and clinicians should monitor for clinical response within 48–72 hours and escalate evaluation if there is no improvement to consider complications, drug resistance, or alternative diagnoses such as TB or PCP [^114f5hJo] [^116Bouqy] [^1113D6DU].

> Hold on, I should verify what additional tests would strengthen confidence and exclude mimics. Sputum culture, blood cultures if febrile and systemically ill, and assessment of oxygenation are appropriate; given HIV and several weeks of symptoms, obtaining sputum for acid-fast bacilli smear and culture (or NAAT) for TB is prudent even if not strongly suspected initially, and if the patient deteriorates or the presentation is atypical, bronchoscopy with BAL can help evaluate for TB, PCP, or other opportunistic infections per HIV OI guidance [^1159tetS] [^11336azU].

> Final answer: Community-acquired pneumonia is the most likely diagnosis here, given the acute bacterial presentation with productive cough, fever, and focal right lower lobe consolidation in a patient with AIDS, consistent with HIV-associated bacterial pneumonia patterns and epidemiology [^111upusP] [^114SJdWx].

---

The most likely cause of pneumonia in this 50-year-old man with AIDS and right lower lobe consolidation is **community-acquired bacterial pneumonia** [^111upusP] (Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae) [^111upusP]. This is supported by the **acute presentation** with productive cough and fever, focal consolidation on exam and chest radiograph [^1176Aqvb], and the high incidence of bacterial pneumonia in HIV [^114SJdWx]. Pneumocystis pneumonia typically presents with diffuse interstitial infiltrates and a nonproductive cough [^112PPoP9], while tuberculosis and aspiration are less likely given the clinical and radiographic pattern [^113AHhyj].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Diagnosis** | **Clinical features** | **Radiographic findings** | **Likelihood** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae) | - Acute onset <br/> - Productive cough <br/> - Fever <br/> - Focal consolidation [^111upusP] | Unilateral focal consolidation [^111upusP] | High |
| Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) | - Subacute onset <br/> - Nonproductive cough <br/> - Dyspnea <br/> - Diffuse interstitial infiltrates [^112PPoP9] | Bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities [^112PPoP9] | Low |
| Tuberculosis (TB) | - Chronic cough <br/> - Weight loss <br/> - Night sweats <br/> - Upper lobe infiltrates [^113AHhyj] | Upper lobe infiltrates with cavitation [^113AHhyj] | Low |
| Aspiration pneumonia | - Risk factors for aspiration <br/> - Lower lobe involvement [^notfound] | Lower lobe consolidation [^notfound] | Low |

---

## Clinical reasoning

- **Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia**: The patient's acute presentation with productive cough, fever, and focal consolidation is classic for bacterial pneumonia [^111upusP], which is common in HIV and often caused by S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae [^114SJdWx] [^111HiasY].

- **Pneumocystis pneumonia**: PCP typically presents with a subacute course, nonproductive cough, and diffuse interstitial infiltrates [^112PPoP9], which do not match this patient's focal consolidation and productive cough [^114c95EY].

- **Tuberculosis**: TB usually has a more chronic course with systemic symptoms and upper lobe involvement, making it less likely here [^113AHhyj] [^113VqCq7].

- **Aspiration pneumonia**: There are no clear aspiration risk factors in the history, and aspiration is less likely than community-acquired bacterial pneumonia in this context [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely cause of pneumonia in this patient is **community-acquired bacterial pneumonia** (S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae) [^111upusP], given the acute presentation, focal consolidation, and the high incidence of bacterial pneumonia in HIV [^114SJdWx].

A 36-year-old African American man with no medical history presented with a recent history of cough and dyspnoea. Initial chest imaging revealed diffuse bilateral lung infiltrates. A subsequent HIV test resulted positive, and he was presumptively diagnosed with AIDS, later confirmed by a CD4 of 88 cells/mm 3 Empiric therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was initiated for presumed Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. The patient's clinical status deteriorated despite treatment. Further workup with chest CT, bronchoscopy and skin biopsy led to a diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma with pulmonary involvement. Highly active antiretroviral therapy therapy was initiated, along with plans to start chemotherapy. However, the patient's clinical status rapidly declined, leading to respiratory failure and eventual death. This case underlines the importance of maintaining a broad differential in immunocompromised patients presenting with respiratory symptoms.

Diagnosis of PCP in children with HIV — physiology, imaging, and diagnostic criteria: Most children with PCP have substantial hypoxia with low arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2 typically < 70 mm Hg) and an A-a gradient > 30 mmHg; CD4 percentage is often < 15% and CD4 counts are usually < 200 cells/ mm3 in children aged 6 years and older; chest radiographs most commonly reveal bilateral diffuse parenchymal infiltrates with ground-glass or reticulogranular appearance, though they can be normal or show mild infiltrates, with earliest infiltrates perihilar progressing peripherally and, rarely, lobar, cavitary, nodular, or miliary lesions, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum observed; a definitive diagnosis of PCP requires demonstration of the organism in pulmonary tissues or fluids in the presence of pneumonitis, and diagnostic procedures are the same as for adults suspected of having PCP, although some procedures may be more difficult to perform in children.

Pulmonary diseases are major causes of morbidity and death in persons with HIV infection. Millions of people with HIV/AIDS throughout the world are at risk of opportunistic pneumonias such as tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia, and Pneumocystis pneumonia. However, the availability of combination antiretroviral therapy has turned HIV into a chronic disease, and noninfectious lung diseases such as lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pulmonary arterial hypertension are also emerging as important causes of illness. Despite the importance of these diseases and the rapidly evolving understanding of their pathogenesis and epidemiology, few avenues exist for the discussion and dissemination of new clinical and basic insights. In May of 2008, the American Thoracic Society sponsored a 1-day workshop, "Emerging Issues and Current Controversies in HIV-Associated Pulmonary Diseases", which brought together basic and clinical researchers in HIV-associated pulmonary disease. A review of the literature was performed by workshop participants, and the workshop included 18 presentations on diverse topics summarized in this article.

Case presentation

A man in his early 40s presented with 5 days of worsening fever, body aches, sore throat, shortness of breath and productive cough with accompanying pleuritic pain. He was hypotensive and tachycardic. He had increased work of breathing with diminished lung sounds in the right lung field. He had leucocytosis of 13.6/mm 3 (normal range 4–11/mm 3) and neutrophil count of 12.7/mm 3, and procalcitonin was elevated to 9.46 ng/mL (normal range < 0.05 ng/mL). Chest radiograph (CXR) and CT imaging of the chest revealed a mass-like 5.2 cm cavitary lesion in right upper lobe, left lower lobe consolidation and small left pleural effusion (figure 1). SARs CoV-2 testing was negative via nasopharyngeal PCR swab, and there were no sick contacts. He had a history of well-controlled asthma on combination long-acting beta-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid, biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch for weight loss 14 years prior, and was on emtricitabine-tenofovir for pre-exposure prophylaxis.

HIV-associated cough and normal chest radiographs — clinical patterns and noninfectious mimics are described: HIV-infected patients with TB often present with cough and normal chest radiographs, and in a study of 334 consecutive HIV-infected adults with cough of ≥ 2 weeks' duration in Uganda, 54 had normal chest radiographs. The most common diagnoses were pulmonary TB in 24 patients (44%), unknown diagnosis in 19 patients (35%), pulmonary aspergillosis in three patients (6%), and pulmonary cryptococcosis in two patients (4%), and Four patients had two simultaneous respiratory infections. Patients with CD4-positive lymphocyte counts ≤ 50 cells/μL were more likely to have normal radiographs than were others with higher counts. Noninfectious disorders may also cause cough with normal radiographs, including obliterative bronchiolitis up to a year after bone marrow transplantation with cough and dyspnea and endobronchial metastasis on bronchoscopy such as Kaposi sarcoma associated with AIDS.

Making and Excluding the Diagnosis of Pneumocystis Pneumonia in AIDS

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in AIDS is often diagnosed empirically based on a subacute onset of cough; breathlessness out of proportion to abnormalities seen on chest radiographs; and subtle, bilateral changes seen on chest radiographs, in the context of a low CD4 cell count (Figure 3). Co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, Bactrim, Septrin) is the most effective agent for prevention and therapy of PCP. A low dose is effective for prophylaxis, but a 3-week course of high and potentially toxic doses is required for effective therapy. The differential diagnosis of PCP is broader in children because bacterial pneumonia is more common among them. If a precise diagnosis could be achieved in most cases of PCP, much of the inappropriate use of co-trimoxazole could be prevented.

Rates of PCP among newly hospitalized adults with advanced HIV infection are highly variable, ranging from < 1% to 60%, and rates rise as gross domestic product increases. Without the availability of adequate diagnostics, many persons will unnecessarily receive high-dose co-trimoxazole, with or without corticosteroids, for 3 weeks. If the actual number of PCP cases in patients with AIDS is 400,000, then hundreds of thousands of hospitalized HIV patients may be given co-trimoxazole unnecessarily, and toxicity rates among them could be as high as 90%. Early detection and diagnosis of PCP can help prevent unnecessary hospitalizations and reduce adverse events and healthcare costs.

### HIV… [^117HhdiJ]. Wikipedia (2001). Low credibility.

The human immunodeficiency viruses are two species of Lentivirus that infect humans. Over time, they cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, a condition in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype. When CD4^+^ T cell numbers decline below a critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections, leading to the development of AIDS. Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system, for an indeterminate amount of time. The virus can remain dormant in the human body for up to ten years after primary infection; during this period the virus does not cause symptoms.

Alternatively, the integrated viral DNA may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins, using host cell resources, that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that will begin the replication cycle anew. The majority of the glycans are therefore stalled as immature 'high-mannose' glycans not normally present on human glycoproteins that are secreted or present on a cell surface. The unusual processing and high density means that almost all broadly neutralising antibodies that have so far been identified bind to, or are adapted to cope with, these envelope glycans. Tropism The term viral tropism refers to the cell types a virus infects. HIV can infect a variety of immune cells such as CD4^+^ T cells, macrophages, and microglial cells.

HIV-1 entry to macrophages and CD4^+^ T cells is mediated through interaction of the virion envelope glycoproteins with the CD4 molecule on the target cells' membrane and also with chemokine co-receptors. This CCR5 co-receptor is used by almost all primary HIV-1 isolates regardless of viral genetic subtype. Indeed, macrophages play a key role in several critical aspects of HIV infection. They appear to be the first cells infected by HIV and perhaps the source of HIV production when CD4^+^ cells become depleted in the patient. Macrophages and microglial cells are the cells infected by HIV in the central nervous system. In the tonsils and adenoids of HIV-infected patients, macrophages fuse into multinucleated giant cells that produce huge amounts of virus.

However, the use of co-receptors alone does not explain viral tropism, as not all R5 viruses are able to use CCR5 on macrophages for a productive infection and HIV can also infect a subtype of myeloid dendritic cells, which probably constitute a reservoir that maintains infection when CD4^+^ T cell numbers have declined to extremely low levels. Some people are resistant to certain strains of HIV. For example, people with the CCR5-Δ32 mutation are resistant to infection by the R5 virus, as the mutation leaves HIV unable to bind to this co-receptor, reducing its ability to infect target cells. In patients infected with subtype B HIV-1, there is often a co-receptor switch in late-stage disease and T-tropic variants that can infect a variety of T cells through CXCR4. These variants then replicate more aggressively with heightened virulence that causes rapid T cell depletion, immune system collapse, and opportunistic infections that mark the advent of AIDS.

### Missed opportunity to diagnose HIV withpneumonia as its sequela [^113h874i]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is an opportunistic infection of the lung occurring primarily in patients with HIV infection with a CD4 cell count < 200mm 3, solid organ transplant recipients and those taking immunosuppressive therapy. The 1980s heralded the HIV pandemic, turning PCP into a major medical and public health problem worldwide. Manifestations of unusual infections such as pneumocystis and Kaposi's sarcoma, were, after all, the first signs of the emerging pandemic to be recognised and may indeed, be the presenting feature of a previously undiagnosed HIV infection. With the advent of pneumocystis chemoprophylaxis and the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy, there has been a decreased incidence in developed countries, but it remains high in developing countries. Unfortunately, late presentation of HIV remains a problem resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. The authors report the case of a new diagnosis of HIV infection in a 45-year-old woman, presenting with a dry cough, dyspnoea, unintentional weight loss and PCP. Two weeks after commencing highly active antiretroviral therapy, she was diagnosed with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Research shows that stigma and discrimination in the healthcare setting contributes to keeping individuals from accessing HIV prevention, care and treatment services and adopting key preventive behaviours. The barriers to HIV testing and stigma eradication in primary care will be explored as well as missed opportunities to diagnosis HIV in primary care in individuals presenting with signs and symptoms of immunosuppression, in this case shingles.

Acute cough algorithm — adult initial management, red flags, and follow-up: The figure applies to "patients ≥ 15 years of age with cough lasting ≤ 3 weeks" and instructs to "Always screen for the presence of red flags as a clue to a potentially life-threatening condition". Listed life-threatening causes include "Pneumonia, severe exacerbation of asthma or COPD, PE, heart failure, other serious disease". It also advises to "Always consider the presence of TB in endemic areas or high-risk populations even if chest radiographs are normal" and to "Remember to routinely assess cough severity or quality of life before and after treatment and routinely follow patients 4–6 weeks after initial visit". Red flags include "Hemoptysis", "Smoker > 45 years of age with a new cough, change in cough, or coexisting voice disturbance", "Adults aged 55–80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or who have quit within the past 15 years", "Prominent dyspnea, especially at rest or at night", "Hoarseness", "Systemic symptoms" (with "Fever", "Weight loss", "Peripheral edema with weight gain"), "Trouble swallowing when eating or drinking", "Vomiting", "Recurrent pneumonia", and "Abnormal respiratory exam and/or abnormal chest radiograph coinciding with duration of cough".

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115TSttT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — scope and population focuses on management decisions from clinical diagnosis with radiographic confirmation through completion of antimicrobial therapy and follow-up chest imaging and does not address initial clinical diagnostic criteria or prevention. The guideline centers on patients in the United States without recent foreign travel and on adults without an immunocompromising condition, including those actively receiving cancer chemotherapy, patients infected with HIV with suppressed CD4 counts, and solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipients. Although CAP may be diagnosed without a chest radiograph in ambulatory settings, the guideline emphasizes studies using radiographic criteria given the known inaccuracy of clinical signs and symptoms alone. Empiric antibiotic recommendations are based on agents effective against major treatable bacterial causes, traditionally including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella species, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) clinical manifestations in people with HIV — symptoms and objective findings: The most common manifestations are subacute onset of progressive dyspnea, fever, non-productive cough, and chest discomfort that worsens within days to weeks, and with exertion tachypnea, tachycardia, and diffuse dry (cellophane) rales may be observed. Hypoxemia ranges from mild (room air arterial oxygen partial pressure [PaO2] ≥ 70 mmHg or alveolar-arterial gradient [A-a gradient] < 35 mmHg) to moderate (A-a gradient ≥ 35 to < 45 mmHg) to severe (A-a gradient ≥ 45 mmHg). Elevation of lactate dehydrogenase levels to > 500 mg/dL is common but also nonspecific, and the chest radiograph typically demonstrates diffuse, bilateral, symmetrical "ground-glass" interstitial infiltrates emanating from the hila in a butterfly pattern.

### Fatal case of pneumonia associated with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in HIV-positive patient [^115fvkM5]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus first appeared in March 2009 in Mexico. In June 2009, a pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization. Influenza A virus (H1N1) caused a pandemic in 1918–1919; estimated deaths were ≈100 million worldwide. Symptoms of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 are similar to those of seasonal influenza (fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headache, chills, and fatigue). Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with acute febrile respiratory illness who have been in contact with persons with confirmed influenza or reside in areas where influenza has been reported.

Although most cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in the United States have been mild, 2%–5% of infected persons have required hospitalization. Immunosuppressed persons, the elderly, persons with underlying lung or cardiac disease, pregnant women, persons with diabetes, obese persons, and children < 5 years of age are at increased risk for this disease.

We report pneumonia associated with pandemic (H1N1) 2009, which resulted in respiratory and renal failure and death, in a 39-year-old HIV-positive woman. She had type 1 diabetes and a diagnosis of AIDS 7 years ago and had received highly active antiretroviral therapy. She also had an ill child at home with an influenza-like illness.

Her medical history included pleuropericardial Nocardia spp. infection, recurrent pleural effusions requiring thoracentesis, and hepatomegaly of unknown cause. Her most recent CD4 cell count was 166 cells/μL with undetectable viral load 1 month before admission. Medications prescribed included combivir, efavirenz, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole but she was noncompliant. She had received the 2008–09 seasonal influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine.

Coccidioidomycosis — clinical manifestations in HIV: Lack of suppression of HIV replication and lower CD4 cell counts are associated with the severity of the presentation of coccidioidomycosis, and four common syndromes in HIV-infected patients are focal pneumonia, diffuse pneumonia, extrathoracic involvement including meningitis, and positive coccidioidal serology tests without evidence of localized infection. Focal pneumonia is most common in patients with CD4 counts ≥ 250 cells/mm3 and can present with cough, fever, and pleuritic chest pain; coccidioidomycosis may also present with hilar or mediastinal adenopathy, upper lobe infiltrates, night sweats, and peripheral blood eosinophilia, and syndromes other than focal pneumonia usually occur in more immunosuppressed patients. Diffuse pulmonary disease may show severe hypoxemia and serological tests are frequently negative at presentation, and routine bacterial cultures from pulmonary secretions frequently reveal Coccidioides after an incubation time of less than one week. Meningitis presents with a persistent headache and progressive lethargy, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile demonstrates low glucose with elevated protein and a lymphocytic pleocytosis; immunosuppressed patients with HIV infection may also present with elevated coccidioidal serological titers without evidence of disease. In a pre–potent ART era series, 13 patients all had CD4 counts < 350 cells/mm3 and positive coccidioidal serologic tests, and Five patients subsequently developed clinical illness at a median CD4 count of 10 cells/mm3.

### What a differential a virus makes: a practical approach to thoracic imaging findings in the context of HIV infection – part 1, pulmonary findings [^114fe7Uk]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported more than one million people with HIV infection in the United States in 2006, an increase of 11% over 3 years. Worldwide, nearly 34 million people are infected with HIV. Pulmonary disease accounts for 30–40% of acute hospitalizations of HIV-infected patients, underscoring the importance of understanding the pulmonary manifestations in this population. When presented with a chest radiograph or CT image of a patient with the clinical history of HIV infection, one approach is to start by identifying and categorizing key imaging findings. In some instances, the key findings may be further subcategorized to narrow the differential diagnosis, such as distinguishing between perilymphatic distribution and the random distribution of micronodules. The differential diagnosis of these key imaging findings can also be further refined by incorporating clinical data, such as patient demographics, CD4 count, and presenting symptoms. Finally, the change of thoracic disease and clinical status in response to treatment provides important diagnostic information. The purpose of this article is to discuss pulmonary findings in patients with HIV.

Conclusion

By developing a systematic and practical approach to key pulmonary imaging findings in HIV-infected patients, radiologists can generate clinically relevant and succinct differential diagnoses and thereby improve patient care.

Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia in individuals with HIV — outcomes and predictors include that in a prospective, multicenter study independent predictors of increased mortality were CD4 count < 100 cells/mm3, radiographic progression of disease, and presence of shock; multilobar infiltrates, cavitary infiltrates, and pleural effusion on baseline imaging were independent predictors of radiographic progression; in patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with controlled HIV viremia and high CD4 counts (> 350 cells/mm3), clinical courses and outcomes of pneumonia appear to be similar to those in patients without HIV; hospitalization for pneumonia has been associated with increased mortality up to one year later, cardiovascular disease associated with CAP occurs at a similar rate in those with HIV as those without including in a retrospective cohort study of 4,384 patients, and pneumonia has been associated with impaired lung function and risk of subsequent lung cancer.

### Spectrum of imaging findings in AIDS-related diffuse large B cell lymphoma [^1152YSbi]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Imaging in HIV and lymphoma

The imaging findings of NHLs are primarily masses and lymphadenopathy. Extranodal DLBCL is common in the setting of HIV. Most HIV-positive patients have concomitant infectious disease, or are initially evaluated for presumed infectious disease. Initial imaging prior to diagnosis is guided by clinical presentation and index of clinical suspicion.

The primary imaging modality is usually contrast-enhanced CT. Besides the established imaging findings of nodal enlargement in HIV negative patients, other unusual findings are not uncommon in AIDS-related lymphoma. These include necrosis of the involved nodes, large extranodal soft tissue masses, and bone destruction secondary to lymphoma involvement. AIDS-related lymphoma also presents with multi-organ involvement and bulky disease. 18 FDG PET/CT is a useful tool in initial staging and response assessment of lymphoma in both HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. The high-grade HIV-associated DLBCLs are more likely to show avid uptake of 18 F-FDG. It is also useful in assessment of sites of FDG avid disease which may not be immediately apparent on conventional CT. PET CT is however inherently limited in tissues which show high background FDG uptake such as the brain.

Lung findings

Pulmonary involvement of diffuse large B cell lymphoma is usually a manifestation of systemic disease rather than primary pulmonary lymphoma. A few isolated case reports of primary pulmonary lymphoma in the setting of HIV have been described. Up to two-thirds of patients present with respiratory symptoms of cough and dyspnea and would therefore be evaluated for an infective process, initially with the chest radiograph and CT chest. On imaging, pulmonary lymphoma can appear as an isolated mass, multiple pulmonary nodules/masses, or diffuse consolidative opacities (Fig. 1). High-grade pulmonary lymphoma in HIV is invariably 18 FDG avid. Patients may also present with pleural effusion.

Fig. 1
Chest radiograph of a 19-year-old HIV-positive patient with low CD4 count. He presented with cough and dyspnea and was initially being evaluated for possible atypical pneumonia. The chest radiograph showed multiple focal opacities predominantly in the lower lung zones. On CT, there were lung parenchymal nodules/masses of variable sizes which were also intensely FDG avid on PET CT. There was extensive lymphoma involvement elsewhere including in the liver, spleen (splenic activity higher than liver background), and multiple nodal sites above and below the diaphragm. Biopsy of the liver lesion was consistent with DLBCL

Pathogen-focused considerations in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) note that the increased incidence of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus (including community-acquired MRSA) as causes of CAP are exceptions for which empiric antibiotic coverage may be warranted, and diagnostic tests (sputum Gram stain and culture) are likely to be of high yield for these pathogens, allowing early discontinuation of empiric treatment if results are negative.

Case Presentation

A 37-year-old man attended a medical clinic at the confluence of the Appalachian and the St. Lawrence Valley after 2 weeks of coughing greenish sputum and progressive dyspnea on exertion. In addition, he reported fatigue, fevers, and chills. He had quit smoking a year earlier and was not a drug user. He recently had spent most of his free time outdoors, mountain biking, but had not travelled outside of Canada. Medical history was unremarkable. He did not take any medication. Upper airway samples taken for SARS-CoV-2 proved negative; he was prescribed cefprozil and doxycycline for presumed community-acquired pneumonia. He returned to the emergency room 1 week later with mild hypoxemia, persisting fever, and a chest radiography consistent with lobar pneumonia. The patient was admitted to his local community hospital, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were added to the regimen. Unfortunately, his condition deteriorated over the following week, and he experienced hypoxic respiratory failure for which he required mechanical ventilation before his transfer to our medical center.

### Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in adults [^113XFjRg]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Pneumocystis pneumonia:

- Definition: PCP is a severe opportunistic fungal infection caused by P. jirovecii, primarily affecting immunocompromised individuals.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of PCP involves airborne transmission of the fungus, which then invades lung tissue and adheres to type 1 epithelial cells. The attachment of Pneumocystis to the alveolar epithelium promotes the transition of the organism from the trophic to the cyst form, leading to the production of inflammatory mediators, lung injury, and impaired gas exchange.
- Epidemiology: The incidence of PCP is estimated at 2.2–4.5 per 100,000, with more than 80% occurring in patients without HIV. In the US, approximately 10,500 hospitalizations and 400 deaths are reported annually due to PCP.
- Risk factors: Risk factors for PCP include HIV infection with a low CD4+ T-cell count, malignancies, solid organ transplantation, hematologic stem cell transplantation, prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents, such as chemotherapy (especially purine analogs), T-cell-depleting agents, TNF-α inhibitors, anti-interleukin 6, anti-CD26, and calcineurin inhibitors.
- Disease course: Clinically, PCP often presents with a progressive nonproductive cough, exertional dyspnea, chest pain, and fever. Patients with HIV may have an indolent course, while patients without HIV usually present with rapidly progressive onset.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The mortality rate of PCP in patients with and without HIV is estimated at 25% and 33–69%, respectively.

Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) evaluation in adults — five clinical scenarios are outlined with specific recommended evaluations as follows: For any patient with a cough of > 2–3 wk duration with at least one additional symptom (fever, night sweats, weight loss, or hemoptysis), the recommended evaluation is chest radiograph; if suggestive of TB (or if patient has HIV infection), collect three sputum specimens for AFB smear microscopy and culture. For any patient at high risk for TB with an unexplained illness, including respiratory symptoms, of > 2–3 wk duration, the recommended evaluation is chest radiograph; if suggestive of TB, collect three sputum specimens for AFB smear microscopy and culture. For any patient with HIV infection and with cough and fever, the recommended evaluation is chest radiograph, then sputum specimens for AFB smear microscopy and culture. For any patient at high risk for TB with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia who has not improved after 7 d of treatment, the recommended evaluation is chest radiograph, then sputum specimens for AFB smear microscopy and culture. For any patient at high risk for TB with an abnormal chest radiograph suggestive of TB even if symptoms are minimal or absent, the recommended evaluation is review of previous chest radiographs if available, three sputum specimens for AFB smear microscopy and culture.

### Lung infections in the HIV-infected adult [^113X48kD]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review describes current epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of adult HIV-related lung infections using evidence published within the past 2 years.

Recent Findings

Recent evidence has helped better determine the importance of early initiation of antiretroviral therapy in co-infected individuals with advanced immune suppression. Although this has led to a greatly reduced incidence of opportunistic infections in people with HIV, Pneumocystis pneumonia remains common. Pneumonia due to bacterial pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, also causes considerable disease burden, but emerging evidence of the clinical efficacy of pneumococcal vaccination, especially conjugated vaccines, offers considerable promise. As HIV-infected populations become older, more emphasis should be given to the potential benefit of influenza prevention, particularly with vaccination, and encouraging smoking cessation. Co-infection with tuberculosis is still a huge problem worldwide, but the recent development and use of simple clinical algorithms based on symptoms and point-of-care testing for recognizing active disease offers great potential.

Summary

The lung remains an important site of disease in HIV-infected individuals. Increasing emphasis should be placed upon prevention of infection and modification of risk factors.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112in7Qz]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV-related tuberculosis — radiographic patterns and immunodeficiency effects include atypical chest findings when CD4 counts are low, with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3 associated with infiltrates showing no upper-lobe predilection and uncommon cavitation; normal chest radiographs can occur despite respiratory symptoms and positive sputum cultures, and thoracic CT scans may show mild reticulonodular infiltrates despite a normal chest radiograph. With increasing immunodeficiency, extrapulmonary or disseminated TB are more common, and in markedly immune-suppressed people TB can be a severe systemic disease with high fevers, rapid progression, and features of sepsis; TB must be considered at any site, especially with central nervous system disease when early TB treatment is essential to improve outcomes. After initiation of ART, immune reconstitution can unmask subclinical TB disease, resulting in pronounced inflammatory reactions at sites of infection.

### HIV / AIDS… [^116U4DqY]. Wikipedia (2001). Low credibility.

The human immunodeficiency virus is a retrovirus that attacks the immune system. Without treatment, it can lead to a spectrum of conditions including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is a preventable disease. It can be managed with treatment and become a manageable chronic health condition. While there is no cure or vaccine for HIV, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease, and if used before significant disease progression, can extend the life expectancy of someone living with HIV to a nearly standard level. An HIV-positive person on treatment can expect to live a normal life, and die with the virus, not of it. Effective treatment for HIV-positive people involves a life-long regimen of medicine to suppress the virus, making the viral load undetectable. Without treatment the infection can interfere with the immune system, and eventually progress to AIDS, sometimes taking many years.

Following initial infection an individual may not notice any symptoms, or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness. During this period the person may not know that they are HIV-positive, yet they will be able to pass on the virus. Typically, this period is followed by a prolonged incubation period with no symptoms. Eventually the HIV infection increases the risk of developing other infections such as tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors which are rare in people who have normal immune function. The late stage is often also associated with unintended weight loss. Without treatment a person living with HIV can expect to live for 11 years. Early testing can show if treatment is needed to stop this progression and to prevent infecting others. Signs and symptoms There are three main stages of HIV infection: acute infection, clinical latency, and AIDS.

First main stage: acute infection The initial period following infection with HIV is called acute HIV, primary HIV or acute retroviral syndrome. Many individuals develop an influenza-like illness, mononucleosis or glandular fever 2–4 weeks after exposure while others have no significant symptoms. Symptoms occur in 40–90% of cases and most commonly include fever, large tender lymph nodes, throat inflammation, a rash, headache, tiredness, and/or sores of the mouth and genitals. The rash, which occurs in 20–50% of cases, presents itself on the trunk and is maculopapular, classically. Some people also develop opportunistic infections at this stage. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting or diarrhea may occur. Neurological symptoms of peripheral neuropathy or Guillain–Barré syndrome also occur. The duration of the symptoms varies, but is usually one or two weeks. These symptoms are not often recognized as signs of HIV infection.

Family doctors or hospitals can misdiagnose cases as one of the many common infectious diseases with similar symptoms. Someone with an unexplained fever who may have been recently exposed to HIV should consider testing to find out if they have been infected. Second main stage: clinical latency The initial symptoms are followed by a stage called clinical latency, asymptomatic HIV, or chronic HIV. Without treatment, this second stage of the natural history of HIV infection can last from about three years to over 20 years. While typically there are few or no symptoms at first, near the end of this stage many people experience fever, weight loss, gastrointestinal problems and muscle pains.

Classic example of this combined pattern as the predominant pattern is Pneumocystis pneumonia, which is characterised by the presence of patchy or diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities with thick or thin-walled, irregular, septated cysts in the upper lobes. A significant key from the clinical history is the history of immunosuppression or more specifically the history of AIDS (Fig. 39).

### Respiratory infection in the AIDS and immunocompromised patient [^117TADBT]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Immunocompromised patients are susceptible to infections by a wide range of organisms. In the past several decades, AIDS epidemic, advances in the treatment of cancer, organ transplantation, and immunosuppressive therapy have resulted in large numbers of patients who develop abnormalities in their immune system. Moreover, mildly impaired host immunity as it occurs in chronic debilitating illness, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, alcoholism, advanced age, prolonged corticosteroid administration, and chronic obstructive lung disease have also been regarded as predisposing factors of pulmonary infections. Imaging plays a crucial role in the detection and management of patients with pulmonary infectious diseases. When pulmonary infection is suspected, knowledge of the varied radiographic manifestations will narrow the differential diagnosis, helping to direct additional diagnostic measures, and serving as an ideal tool for follow-up examinations. Combination of pattern recognition with knowledge of the clinical setting is the best approach to pulmonary infection occurring in the immunocompromised patients.

### Changing global epidemiology of pulmonary manifestations of HIV / AIDS [^1167xGVf]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

Tremendous advances have occurred in the care of patients with HIV/AIDS resulting from the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). This has led to differences in the presentations of HIV-related pulmonary disease. Infections such as bacterial pneumonias, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae, remain commonplace, while opportunistic agents such as Pneumocystis jirovecii remain a concern in patients without adequate access to optimal medical care. The tuberculosis epidemic, once thought to be slowing, has been re-energized by the spread of HIV, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Unusual inflammatory responses due to a phenomenon of immune reconstitution, are now recognized as a consequence of HAART, with a reported incidence of IRIS in this setting ranges from 7 to 45% in retrospective reviews. Noninfectious pulmonary conditions such as chronic obstructive lung disease and pulmonary malignancies are gaining prominence as patients are accessing antiretroviral care and enjoying significantly extended survival.

### Significance of abnormal chest radiograph findings in patients with HIV-1 infection without respiratory symptoms [^114azMcu]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

Patients with HIV-1 infection or AIDS may present with abnormal chest radiograph (CXR) findings in the absence of symptoms specific to the lung. The objective was to determine the spectrum of disease and the diagnostic modalities employed in these patients.

Methods

From 1996 to 1998, we identified patients with HIV-1 infection presenting to the Bellevue Hospital Chest Service with abnormal CXR findings, and absence of specific pulmonary symptoms. Charts were reviewed for presence of constitutional symptoms, CD4 lymphocyte count, use of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis, eventual diagnosis, and all diagnostic modalities employed. CXR findings were classified according to their predominant abnormalities: nodules, infiltrates, cavity, mass, adenopathy, or effusion.

Results

Forty-four patients were eligible for inclusion. Eight-six percent of patients had a CD4 lymphocyte count < 200 cells/microL, and 57% were receiving PCP prophylaxis. Nodular disease was the most common radiographic abnormality (57%), followed by adenopathy (17%). A definitive diagnosis was obtained in 86% of the patients. The most common diagnosis was tuberculosis (26%), followed by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM; 23%) and Kaposi sarcoma (12%). No patients had PCP or bacterial pneumonia. Sixty-two percent of patients required an invasive modality to establish a diagnosis. Only 18% of patients with tuberculosis (2 of 11 patients) received diagnoses by sputum analysis.

Conclusions

Patients with HIV-1 infection, abnormal CXR findings, and lack of pulmonary symptoms have a high incidence of infectious disorders, especially pulmonary tuberculosis and infection due to NTM. The high prevalence of treatable and potentially communicable disorders warrants an aggressive diagnostic approach in these patients.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia in adults and adolescents with HIV — epidemiology indicates bacterial pneumonia is a common cause of HIV-associated morbidity and, despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), remains more common in individuals with HIV than in those without HIV. Recurrent pneumonia, considered two or more episodes within a 1-year period, is an AIDS-defining condition. Incidence has declined with ART, with one study reporting a decline from 22.7 episodes per 100 person-years before ART to 9.1 episodes per 100 person-years by 1997 after ART was introduced; in the Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment (START) study the incidence rate of serious bacterial infections was 0.87 per 100 person-years, with approximately 40% due to bacterial pneumonia. Risk factors include a CD4 count decrease, especially when below 100 cells/mm3, lack of or intermittent ART, tobacco, alcohol, and/or injection drug use, chronic viral hepatitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy, renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure particularly in the population of older adults with HIV, and obesity.

### Never too early for the opportunists! [^116asDop]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Primary HIV infection can occur in 40–90% of individuals recently infected with HIV. Variable symptoms usually suggestive of a flu-like illness as well as high-level HIV viraemia and steep decline in CD4 cell count are often noted. We report a case of a previously healthy homosexual man who presented with symptoms suspicious of primary HIV infection as well as non-productive cough associated with chest CT finding of diffuse ground glass appearance in lungs. Recent HIV seroconversion was confirmed. Diagnosis of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia was made on transbronchial lung biopsy. The symptoms improved rapidly after initiation of treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. It is important to recognise that although Pneumocystis pneumonia is generally seen in the setting of AIDS, it can occasionally also occur during primary HIV infection.

### Radiologic approach to the diagnosis of infectious pulmonary diseases in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus [^117XTwJb]. European Journal of Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Nearly all patients infected with HIV experience respiratory infection at some point in the course of their illness. The spectrum of infections is varied and in order to generate a useful differential diagnosis based on imaging findings it is imperative for the radiologist to be aware of changing trends in disease prevalence and epidemiology, and the possible pathology related to new therapies. The characterization of the radiographic pattern in correlation with clinical findings and laboratory values (in particular the degree of immunosuppression as reflected in the CD4 level) would be helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis of infectious pulmonary disease in HIV-positive patients. The most common radiologic patterns considered include areas of ground-glass, consolidation, nodules, and lymphadenopathy. We also include airways diseases and cavitary/cystic lesions because their prevalence has increased over recent years, and we also mention the significance of a normal chest radiograph in the suspicion of a lung infection. In most cases, the clinical and radiographic findings are sufficient for confident diagnosis. The radiologic diagnosis of thoracic infections in patients with AIDS has improved with the use of CT. The greatest value of CT is in excluding lung disease when the radiographic findings are equivocal and in confirming the presence of clinically suspected disease when the radiograph is normal.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Bacterial pneumonia in HIV — risk factors, severity assessment, and outcomes are outlined as follows: Risk factors associated with bacteremia include lack of ART, low CD4 count (particularly < 100 cells/mm3), alcohol use, current smoking, and comorbidities. Disease severity and arterial oxygenation should be assessed in all patients with pneumonia, and noninvasive measurement of arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry is an appropriate screening test; arterial blood gas analysis is indicated for patients with evidence of hypoxemia suggested by noninvasive assessment and for patients who have tachypnea and/or respiratory distress. In a prospective study of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia in individuals with HIV, independent predictors of increased mortality were CD4 count < 100 cells/mm3, radiographic progression of disease, and presence of shock, and multilobar or cavitary infiltrates and pleural effusion at baseline independently predicted radiographic progression. In patients on ART with controlled HIV viremia and high CD4 counts (> 350 cells/mm3), the clinical courses and outcomes of pneumonia appear to be similar to those in patients without HIV. Longer term impacts include increased mortality after hospitalization for pneumonia up to one year later, along with associations with impaired lung function and risk of subsequent lung cancer in individuals with HIV.

Clinical manifestations of tuberculosis (TB) disease in people with HIV are characterized as follows: people with HIV and TB disease may be asymptomatic but have positive sputum cultures with or without abnormal chest radiograph findings (subclinical TB). In ambulatory people with HIV, the presence of any one of cough, fever, night sweats, or weight loss has high sensitivity but low specificity for diagnosing TB in resource-limited settings, and compared to treatment-naive patients with HIV, the sensitivity of classic TB symptoms is lower in people with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART). In people with HIV and CD4 counts > 200 cells/mm3, HIV-related TB generally resembles TB among people without HIV. Most people with or without HIV have disease limited to the lungs, with common chest radiographic manifestations of upper lobe infiltrates with or without cavitation.

Case Presentation

A previously healthy 37-year-old man initially presented to a hospital near his home with persistent cough after failing outpatient azithromycin for empiric treatment of pneumonia. He was newly employed as a bulldozer operator burying trash in a landfill in Virginia, which he continued throughout his illness. He owned two healthy dogs, had never traveled outside the state, and denied a history of cigarette smoking, alcohol, and substance use. His WBC count was 13.4 × 10 9 /L (11% eosinophils). CT scan of the chest showed ground glass opacities. Subsequent bronchoscopy with BAL of the right middle lobe showed eosinophilic predominance (46%); transbronchial biopsy of right lower lobe was performed. Infectious and autoimmune work up that was negative included blood, urine, and BAL cultures, BAL Pneumocystis pneumonia direct immunofluorescence assay, urine legionella antigen, serum HIV antibody, antinuclear antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and angiotensin converting enzyme. After improvement in hypoxia with inpatient corticosteroid therapy, he was discharged home with a two week course of prednisone for a presumptive diagnosis of acute eosinophilic pneumonia. He subsequently experienced worsening fever and difficulty breathing; six weeks after his symptoms began, he was admitted to our hospital.

### Report of the NIH panel to define principles of therapy of HIV infection… [^1122CApy]. CDC (1998). Low credibility.

The use of ART, in conjunction with the prevention of specific HIV- related opportunistic infections, has been associated with dramatic decreases in the incidence of OIs, hospitalizations, and deaths among HIV- infected persons. Advances in this field have been so rapid, however, that keeping up with them has posed a formidable challenge to health- care providers and to patients, as well as to institutions charged with the responsibility of paying for these therapies. INTRODUCTION The past 2 years have brought major advances in both basic and clinical research on acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The availability of more numerous and more potent drugs to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus replication has made it possible to design therapeutic strategies involving combinations of antiretroviral drugs that accomplish prolonged and near complete suppression of detectable HIV replication in many HIV-infected persons.

Kaiser Family Foundation sponsored the Panel on Clinical Practices for the Treatment of HIV Infection. The HHS Panel was charged with developing recommendations, based on the scientific principles, for the clinical use of antiretroviral drugs and laboratory monitoring methods in the treatment of HIV-infected persons. Both documents — the Report of the NIH Panel To Define Principles of Therapy for HIV Infection, developed by the NIH Panel, and the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents, developed by the HHS Panel — are provided in this report. After carefully evaluating data from these studies, the Panel concluded that the results of several important contemporary studies have been consistent in their validation of recent models of HIV pathogenesis. The Panel believes that new antiretroviral drugs and treatment strategies, if used correctly, can substantially benefit HIV-infected persons.

However, as the understanding of HIV disease has improved and the number of available beneficial therapies has increased, clinical care of HIV-infected patients has become much more complex. Therapeutic success increasingly depends on a thorough understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV disease and on familiarity with when and how to use the more numerous and more effective drugs available to treat HIV infection. The Panel is concerned that even these new potent antiretroviral therapies will be of little clinical utility for treated patients unless they are used correctly and that, used incorrectly, they may even compromise the potential to obtain long-term benefit from other antiretroviral therapies in the future. Thus, the Panel expects that these principles will require modification and elaboration as new information is acquired. SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES Principle 1. Ongoing HIV replication leads to immune system damage and progression to AIDS.

HIV infection is always harmful, and true long-term survival free of clinically significant immune dysfunction is unusual. Active replication of HIV is the cause of progressive immune system damage in infected persons. In the absence of effective inhibition of HIV replication by antiretroviral therapy, nearly all infected persons will suffer progressive deterioration of immune function resulting in their susceptibility to opportunistic infections, malignancies, neurologic diseases, and wasting, ultimately leading to death. For adults who live in developed countries, the average time of progression to AIDS after initial infection is approximately 10–11 years in the absence of antiretroviral therapy or with older regimens of nucleoside analog monotherapy.

HIV in the era of antiretroviral therapy (ART) — CD4 metrics and residual risks define pulmonary infection susceptibility. The CD4 cell count is the most readily quantifiable immune defect in people with HIV (PWH), with the risk for many opportunistic infections increasing sharply once the CD4 cell count drops below 200 cells/microliter, and the risk for bacterial pneumonia also increases with a decreasing CD4 cell count. However, even patients on ART with well-controlled HIV disease and a normal CD4 count have significant impairments to the immune system and an increased risk of nonopportunistic bacterial pneumonia by organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Moreover, PWH with CD4 counts above 500 cells/microliter have a fivefold increased risk of S. pneumoniae pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease compared with the general population, and they remain at high risk for tuberculosis even with appropriate ART and preserved CD4 cell counts.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in HIV — clinical manifestations and diagnostic findings commonly include "subacute onset of progressive dyspnea, fever, non-productive cough, and chest discomfort that worsens within days to weeks", with normal resting pulmonary exam in mild cases and exertional "tachypnea, tachycardia, and diffuse dry (cellophane) rales". "Oral thrush is a common co infection" and "Fever is apparent in most cases". Hypoxemia severity is defined by arterial oxygen and A–a gradient thresholds: mild "room air arterial oxygen [PO2] ≥ 70 mm Hg or alveolar-arterial PO2 gradient [A-a] DO2 < 35 mm Hg", moderate "[A-a] DO2 ≥ 35 to < 45 mm Hg", and severe "[A-a] DO2 ≥ 45 mm Hg". Exercise desaturation is "often abnormal but is non-specific", and "Elevation of lactate dehydrogenase levels to > 500 mg/dL is common but also non-specific". Chest radiographs typically show "diffuse, bilateral, symmetrical 'ground-glass' interstitial infiltrates emanating from the hila in a butterfly pattern", though early disease may have a normal film; atypical patterns "such as nodules, blebs and cysts, asymmetric disease, upper lobe localization, intrathoracic adenopathy, and pneumothorax, also occur", while "Cavitation and pleural effusion are uncommon" and suggest alternate pathology. Concurrent conditions are frequent, as "approximately 13% to 18% of patients with documented PCP have another concurrent cause of pulmonary dysfunction", and "Thin-section computed tomography (CT) is a useful adjunctive study".

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111upusP]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Bacterial pneumonia in individuals with HIV — clinical and radiographic presentation is similar to that in individuals without HIV, with patients caused by bacteria such as S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus characteristically having acute onset (3 to 5 days) of fevers, chills, rigors, chest pain or pleurisy, cough productive of purulent sputum, and dyspnea; tachypnea and decreased arterial oxygen saturation indicate moderate-to-severe pneumonia, and in such cases, clinicians should strongly consider hospitalizing the patient. Patients with bacterial pneumonia typically have signs of focal consolidation, such as egophony, and/or pleural effusion on examination, whereas in Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) lung examination often is normal and, if abnormal, reveals inspiratory crackles. In bacterial pneumonia the white blood cell (WBC) count usually is elevated, the elevation may be relative to baseline in those with advanced HIV, and neutrophilia or a left shift may be present. Chest radiographs characteristically show unilateral, focal, segmental, or lobar consolidation; those with S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus typically present with consolidation, whereas cavitation may be more suggestive of P. aeruginosa or S. aureus.

### Pneumonia associated with HIV infection [^115r5h59]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pneumonia occurs commonly in HIV-infected patients and this review highlights some of the recent findings in the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, treatment and prevention of this condition.

Recent Findings

Pneumonia remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients. A number of factors have been identified that increase the risk of pneumonia. Cigarette smoking increases the risk of lung colonization, as well acute pneumonia due to Pneumocystis jiroveci, and has been documented to produce significant depression of the phagocytic function of alveolar macrophages in HIV-infected patients, which may underlie this risk. Legionella pneumophila infections appear to be uncommon in HIV-infected patients, while pneumonia with Streptococcus pneumoniae continues to occur with regularity, including infections with antibiotic-resistant isolates. Pneumocystis pneumonia occurs with a low incidence in patients receiving HAART, once the CD4 count increases to over 200 microl. Studies of invasive pneumococcal infections (predominantly pneumonia) indicate that in critically ill cases, including HIV-seropositive patients, combination antibiotic therapy is associated with a lower mortality than monotherapy. The 23-polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of pneumococcal infection in HIV-infected adults receiving HAART, and a 9-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine has been shown to reduce the incidence of radiologically confirmed pneumonia in HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative children.

Summary

Pneumonia remains an important condition in HIV-infected patients, but recent studies demonstrate that antibiotic prophylaxis, the introduction of HAART, recognition of specific risk factors, new antibiotic treatment strategies and effective vaccines should serve to decrease its impact.

### HIV-associated Pneumocystis pneumonia [^116JsVH3]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Low credibility.

During the past 30 years, major advances have been made in our understanding of HIV/AIDS and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), but significant gaps remain. Pneumocystis is classified as a fungus and is host-species specific, but an understanding of its reservoir, mode of transmission, and pathogenesis is incomplete. PCP remains a frequent AIDS-defining diagnosis and is a frequent opportunistic pneumonia in the United States and in Europe, but comparable epidemiologic data from other areas of the world that are burdened with HIV/AIDS are limited. Pneumocystis cannot be cultured, and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage is the gold standard procedure to diagnose PCP, but noninvasive diagnostic tests and biomarkers show promise that must be validated. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the recommended first-line treatment and prophylaxis regimen, but putative trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole drug resistance is an emerging concern. The International HIV-associated Opportunistic Pneumonias (IHOP) study was established to address these knowledge gaps. This review describes recent advances in the pathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of HIV-associated PCP and ongoing areas of clinical and translational research that are part of the IHOP study and the Longitudinal Studies of HIV-associated Lung Infections and Complications (Lung HIV).

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

HIV-associated community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) — diagnosis and evaluation emphasize imaging plus microbiology: Patients with clinical symptoms and signs suggestive of CAP should have posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs; evidence of pneumonia can also be found on chest computed tomography (CT) scan, but routine use of chest CT scan for this purpose is not recommended. Lung ultrasound can also be used to aid in the diagnosis of pneumonia, and prior radiographs should be reviewed to assess for new findings. The clinical diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia requires a demonstrable infiltrate by chest radiograph or other imaging technique in conjunction with compatible clinical symptoms and signs. Because the differential is broad, a confirmed microbiologic diagnosis should be pursued; microbial identification can allow clinicians to target the specific pathogen(s) and discontinue broad spectrum antibiotic therapy and/or empiric therapy that targets non-bacterial pathogens. Given the increased incidence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in individuals with HIV, a tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis should always be considered in patients with HIV who have pneumonia; those with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of TB should be managed as potentially having TB (i.e., respiratory isolation for hospitalized patients), and two to three sputum specimens should be obtained for acid fast bacilli evaluation (including TB PCR). Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage should be considered, especially if the differential diagnosis includes opportunistic pathogens such as Pneumocystis jirovecii.

### Pulmonary infiltrates in the non-HIV-infected immunocompromised patient: etiologies, diagnostic strategies, and outcomes [^1159JQG8]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Pulmonary complications remain a major cause of both morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. When such individuals present with radiographic infiltrates, the clinician faces a diagnostic challenge. The differential diagnosis in this setting is broad and includes both infectious and noninfectious processes. Rarely are the radiographic findings classic for one disease, and most potential etiologies have overlapping clinical and radiographic appearances. In recent years, several themes have emerged in the literature on this topic. First, an aggressive approach to identifying a specific etiology is necessary; as a corollary, diagnostic delay increases the risk for mortality. Second, the evaluation of these infiltrates nearly always entails bronchoscopy. Bronchoscopy allows identification of some etiologies with certainty, and often allows for the exclusion of infectious agents even if the procedure is otherwise unrevealing. Third, early use of CT scanning regularly demonstrates lesions missed by plain radiography. Despite these advances, initial therapeutic interventions include the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and other anti-infectives in order to ensure that the patients is receiving appropriate therapy. With the results of invasive testing, these treatments are then narrowed. Frustratingly, outcomes for immunocompromised patients with infiltrates remain poor.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for Pneumocystis pneumonia, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, ECIL 2016 guidelines recommend to use composite criteria to assess the need for diagnostic bronchoscopy and empiric treatment for PCP, as single clinical diagnostic criteria are insufficient to prove the diagnosis:

- patient at risk

- clinical signs and symptoms, such as dyspnea and/or cough, fever, hypoxemia, chest pain

- imaging findings compatible with PCP, preferably chest CT

- with or without unexplained serum LDH elevation.

### The sensitivity and specificity of chest CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19 [^115qb6b4]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Appearance of the disease on the chest CT

The SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the family of Coronaviridae and causes systemic and/or respiratory tract infections, rarely acute respiratory distress syndrome, or multi-organ failure. Its cellular entry is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor which is expressed partly on the alveolar cells of the lung epithelium.

The CT manifestation of this viral pneumonia is non-specific but it has characteristic features based on which experienced radiologists can diagnose the disease. Findings are similar to other viral pneumonias but the localization of the signs is rather typical (see Fig. 1). The most frequent and earliest pattern is ground-glass opacity (GGO) that at first may be unifocal, but usually multifocal, bilateral, and peripheral distribution with a posterior predominance especially in inferior lobes. In the area of GGO, common findings are the widening of vessels and traction bronchiectasis.

### Respiratory infection complicating HIV infection [^114CWYsm]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Respiratory infections remain a major cause of morbidity among HIV-infected persons. Thus, knowledge of recent advances regarding HIV-associated opportunistic pneumonias is crucial for optimal care of HIV-infected persons.

Recent Findings

Bacterial pneumonia is the most common HIV-associated opportunistic pneumonia in the USA and its incidence remains appreciable. Worldwide, tuberculosis dominates the clinical picture. The absence of rapid, affordable diagnostics for active and latent tuberculosis remains a major obstacle that must be overcome if the global epidemic is to be slowed. The specter of extensively drug resistant tuberculosis and its overlap with HIV infection highlight the importance of rapid diagnostics and the need for accessible drug susceptibility testing. Pneumocystis (carinii) jirovecii pneumonia appears to be a more common pneumonia among HIV-infected persons residing in developing countries than was previously appreciated. Similar to tuberculosis, the absence of available diagnostics in developing areas is a major obstacle to clinical care and epidemiologic studies. The critical care of HIV-infected persons is challenging.

Summary

Although tremendous advances have been made in our understanding of the management, treatment, and prevention of HIV and its associated respiratory infections, significant gaps remain. Thus, continued epidemiologic, clinical, and bench research is needed.

### Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma masquerading as pneumonia [^111ai1uf]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) is a relatively rare adenocarcinoma that typically arises in the lung periphery and grows along alveolar walls, without destroying the lung parenchyma. It is often multicentric and may arise from a previously stable scar. Because the parenchyma is preserved and because BAC may arise simultaneously in multiple lobes, the chest radiograph and symptoms (cough, chest pain, and sputum production) may be indistinguishable from pneumonia or other noninfectious inflammatory processes (eg, hypersensitivity pneumonitis or bronchiolitis obliterans). The clinician should suspect BAC if what otherwise appears to be pneumonia lacks fever or leukocytosis or does not respond to antibiotics. BAC accounts for 2.6–4.3% of all lung cancers. On a radiograph, BAC often appears as a solitary nodule, but may also appear as a patchy, lobar or multilobar infiltrates, often with air bronchograms indistinguishable from pneumonia. Positron-emission tomography does not help distinguish BAC from pneumonia. Among BAC patients, 62% present without symptoms and with only an abnormal radiograph, whereas 38% present with symptoms of cough, chest pain, and sputum production. Bronchoscopy is usually normal. Preoperative diagnosis with transbronchial biopsy, bronchoscopic cytology examination, or expectorated sputum cytology is more common with the diffuse or multicentric forms. Cure depends on complete resection. A trial of antibiotics and reassessment of clinical findings is a reasonable approach, but biopsy or cytology is the only means of ruling in malignancy and ruling out other etiologies, so biopsy should always be considered when a presumed pneumonia does not respond to antibiotics. I saw a 61-year-old man whose initial diagnosis was pneumonia. He took a 10-day course of oral azithromycin, but his symptoms and chest radiograph were unchanged. A tomogram showed interstitial prominence and peripheral air-space disease in the right upper and lower lobes. Transbronchial biopsy of the right upper lobe showed Clara cells, with substantial atypia and various nuclear-cytoplasmic ratios. The underlying pulmonary architecture was preserved and no invasive component was seen. The diagnosis was changed to nonmucinous BAC. Pneumonectomy was successful and he was cancer-free for about 10 months, after which the cancer returned and from which he eventually died.

Coccidioidomycosis — clinical manifestations in people with HIV include four syndromes: focal pneumonia; diffuse pneumonia; extrathoracic involvement, including meningitis and osteoarticular infection; and positive coccidioidal serology tests without evidence of localized infection, and lack of viral suppression with CD4 count < 250 cells/mm3 is associated with increased severity. Focal pneumonia is most common when CD4 counts ≥ 250 cells/mm3 and can be difficult to distinguish from bacterial or viral community-acquired pneumonia, presenting with cough, fever, and pleuritic chest pain, while hilar or mediastinal adenopathy, upper lobe infiltrates, nodules, peripheral blood eosinophilia, or rash may point towards coccidioidomycosis, particularly with residence, prior residence, or travel to a known endemic area. Diffuse pneumonia and extrathoracic disease usually occur in more apparently immunocompromised patients; diffuse pulmonary disease presents with fever and dyspnea with a diffuse reticulonodular pattern on chest imaging and may be difficult to distinguish clinically from Pneumocystis pneumonia, and hypoxemia may be severe with serological tests possibly negative early. In meningitis, the cerebrospinal fluid profile demonstrates low glucose levels, elevated protein levels, and a lymphocytic pleocytosis, and eosinophils may also be present on cerebrospinal fluid analysis.

Unusual Infections in Two of Our Recent Patients from 2013 to 2019 (see Table 1)

One of our patients (Patient 14), a 19-year-old male at the time, presented in July 2017 with cough and left pleuritic chest pain for 2 weeks, without fevers. He had been evaluated for transplant and deemed not a candidate because of lack of donors and previous organ damage (kidney and heart). He missed 2 weeks of IFN-γ and voriconazole prophylaxis due to insurance issues. He was initially treated with levofloxacin for 2 weeks with mild symptomatic improvement. Chest CT scan was most significant for a large wedge-shaped consolidative opacity with surrounding ground glass attenuation and air bronchograms in the posterior left lower lobe. He underwent a lung biopsy via Interventional Radiology, the fungal culture of which grew a mold that was identified as a basidiomycete/phellinus species, a rare cause of lung and other infections in patients with CGD. He was initially treated with IV ambisome followed by oral posaconazole. However, after about 2 months of oral posaconazole in the setting of therapeutic posaconazole levels, his cough returned and his chest CT scan progressed. In consultation with the NIH, he was referred for a lung wedge resection for debulking of infection that he tolerated well. He received a year of intravenous ambisome and remains well on oral posaconazole with therapeutic levels. He was not a candidate for transplantation due to the lack of a suitable match and pre-existing organ damage.

A second patient (Patient 21) was referred to us after presenting at 4 months of age at another institution with pneumocystis pneumonia. He was diagnosed following a bronchoalveolar lavage during a hospitalization for a right middle lobe pneumonia that did not respond to clindamycin and cefdinir. He had a negative evaluation for other immunodeficiencies, including HIV. He was treated with IV trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole followed by oral treatment and then prophylactic doses of the same.

Objective

The purpose of this essay is to review the spectrum of high-resolution CT findings of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in immunocompromised patients with and without HIV infection.

Conclusion

Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia is a common opportunistic infection affecting immunosuppressed patients. High-resolution CT may be indicated for evaluation of immunosuppressed patients with suspected pneumonia and normal chest radiographic findings. The most common high-resolution CT finding of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia is diffuse ground-glass opacity. Consolidation, nodules, cysts, and spontaneous pneumothorax also can develop.

### HIV-1 and bacterial pneumonia in the era of antiretroviral therapy [^113yuoCQ]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia affects approximately 4 million people in the United States, with 40,000 deaths per year. The incidence is increased about 35-fold in HIV-infected individuals, and this rate has decreased since the antiretroviral era has begun. Bacterial pneumonia has decreased from 5 to 20 cases per 100 person-years to less than 1 to 5 cases per 100 person-years in the era of antiretroviral therapy. HIV-1 infection impairs the function of neutrophils in the lung and infects CD4⁺ cells and alveolar macrophages. Opportunistic infections dramatically increase local HIV replication in the lung cells, especially alveolar macrophages and CD4⁺ cells. This enhanced replication increases viral mutations and provides opportunities for viral escape from latent reservoirs. Mortality is increased with more comorbidities in this highly susceptible population. Immunization with vaccines is recommended, especially pneumococcal vaccines, although the vaccine itself may stimulate viral replication. Recent studies show that the lower respiratory tract is a microbial reservoir in HIV-infected individuals rather than being a sterile environment, as originally thought. This may provide new opportunities for preventing opportunistic infections in HIV-infected subjects. Bacterial pneumonia presents an ongoing challenge in these high-risk individuals, particularly in studying the functions of the innate and acquired immune response.

### Adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111ZUJ8V]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Outpatient adults with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia — C-reactive protein (CRP): For outpatient adults with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia, we suggest measuring C-reactive protein (CRP) because the addition of CRP to features such as fever (38°C or greater), pleural pain, dyspnea and tachypnea, and signs on physical examination of the chest (tachypnea and new and localizing chest examination signs) strengthens both the diagnosis and exclusion of pneumonia (Grade 2C). The quality of evidence is low but a CRP > 30 mg/L in addition to suggestive symptoms and signs increases the likelihood that the cough may be related to having pneumonia; acute cough (ie, < 3 weeks in duration) is less likely to be caused by a pneumonia when the CRP < 10 mg/L or between 10–50 mg/L in the absence of dyspnea and daily fever.

Discussion, Part I: probability in medicine

Reasoning under uncertainty

They say that Understanding ought to work by the rules of right reason. These rules are, or ought to be, contained in Logic; but the actual science of logic is conversant at present only with things either certain, impossible, or entirely doubtful, none of which (fortunately) we have to reason on. Therefore the true logic for this world is the calculus of Probabilities, which takes account of the magnitude of the probability which is, or ought to be, in a reasonable man's mind. - James Clerk Maxwell

The inadequacy of deductive logic

Since Aristotle the mainstream Western view has been that rationality means reasoning according to the rules of deductive logic. The basic building block of deductive logic is the syllogism, for example:

Or, similarly:

These logical forms play a role in straightforward medical diagnostic scenarios like the following:

- 75 year old man with fever, productive cough, chest x-ray showing consolidation of the right upper lobe, sputum culture positive for gram positive cocci in clusters.

Diagnosis: Pneumonia.

- 50 year old previously healthy man with sudden onset painful arthritis of the MTP joint of his right great toe, arthrocentesis positive for needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals.

Diagnosis: Gout.

The reasoning required to make these diagnoses is essentially syllogistic, that is a matter of checking that the definitions of the disorders are satisfied, then drawing the inevitable conclusion.

### 'Non-resolving' pneumonia [^116NetGC]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 47-year-old man presented with symptoms of fever and productive cough secondary to a left upper lobe pneumonia. He had received more than three courses of antibiotics over a 2-year period. Review of serial radiographic exams including chest x-ray and CT scans revealed consolidation of the left upper lobe. Lack of response to antibiotics prompted invasive testing with bronchoscopy which revealed a growth in the left main bronchus. Histopathology revealed squamous cell carcinoma.

### Pneumonia presenting as a large pulmonary mass in a patient with AIDS [^115oUphH]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia typically presents with diffuse bilateral infiltrates or ground-glass opacities. However, the radiographic pattern may be atypical. We report a case of a woman in her 40s who presented with multiple pulmonary masses and prolonged symptoms of non-productive cough, generalised weakness and fatigue. Serial chest CT performed prior to her presentation showed a large right lower lobe lung mass with multiple additional bilateral pulmonary nodules. Her workup revealed a new diagnosis of AIDS. Pathology of several CT-guided needle biopsies was consistent with Pneumocystis which was confirmed by microbial DNA sequencing. No additional pathogens were identified. Her clinical symptoms and radiographs improved significantly with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and treatment of her HIV infection. Clinicians should evaluate for underlying immunodeficiency and seek infectious disease and pulmonary consultation early for consideration of alternative diagnoses when patients present with cough, dyspnoea and atypical chest radiographs, and initial pathological examination is unrevealing.

### Infectious lung complications in patients with HIV / AIDS [^115mfvT2]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this article is to review recent observations in the area of infectious lung complications in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Since the immunodeficiency was first characterized, it has been associated with enhanced susceptibility to opportunistic infection, and life-threatening infections of the lung in particular. In the past few years there have been a large number of reports documenting the changes to this disease profile in the age of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Furthermore, there have been considerable advances in our understanding of the immunology and vaccinology of many of the pathogens implicated in pulmonary infections in this context, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pneumocystis pneumonia.

Recent Findings

In considering the time-course and spectrum of HIV-associated respiratory infections, the field must now be divided into studies undertaken in parts of the world where HAART is accessible and those where it is not. Despite the enormous impact of HAART, it has brought with it a new set of concerns, including the effects of immune restoration disease (IRD), and the complex interplay between HAART and tuberculosis therapy.

Summary

The overriding conclusion from recent experience is that HAART, in those parts of the world where it is readily available, has changed the clinical picture of infections associated with HIV, and needs to be available to patients across the developing world as well. Furthermore there have been important developments in vaccination programs against pathogens involved in HIV-associated pneumonia.

### Pneumocystis pneumonia causing cavitating lung nodules in an immunocompetent individual [^112V7HYu]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is a potential life-threatening pulmonary infection which commonly manifests in immunosuppressed patients especially with HIV, with underlying malignancies, severe malnutrition as well as those on immunosuppressive treatments. There have been case reports of symptomatic PCP in individuals with a normally functioning immune system with typical clinical features and radiologic findings of bilateral and diffuse interstitial opacities. However, PCP in immunocompetent individuals presenting with lung nodules had been rarely reported. We report a 53-year-old immunocompetent gentleman who presented with subacute cough, progressive shortness of breath and radiographic findings of multiple lung nodules with central cavitation. The diagnosis of PCP was made by detection of PCP DNA PCR in bronchoalveolar lavage sample following fibreoptic bronchoscopy. This case also highlights the atypical radiographic findings of multiple cavitating lung nodules as a presentation of PCP in an immunocompetent patient.

### Respiratory emergencies in HIV-infected persons [^115hVZfi]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Respiratory complaints are a common reason for patients with HIV infection to present to an emergency department (ED). "HIV and shortness of breath" is one of the most frequent chief complaints on ED triage sheets, and the differential diagnosis is broad. Pulmonary etiologies include infectious and noninfectious causes that are related and unrelated to underlying HIV infection and range from the minor to the life threatening. This article focuses on respiratory emergencies among HIV-infected patients and discusses their typical presentation and diagnostic evaluation as well as therapeutic interventions that should be initiated in an ED.

HIV community-acquired pneumonia — risk factors — bacterial pneumonia remains more common in people with HIV than in those who do not have HIV, may be the first manifestation of underlying HIV infection, and can occur at any stage of HIV disease and at any CD4 count; a CD4 count decrease, especially when below 100 cells/mm3, is a major risk factor alongside immune defects affecting B cells, neutrophils, and alveolar macrophages; lack of ART or intermittent use of ART increases the risk for pneumonia, and additional risk factors include chronic viral hepatitis, tobacco, alcohol, injection drug use and prescribed opioid.

HIV community-acquired pneumonia — epidemiology and scope — bacterial pneumonia is a common HIV-associated morbidity, and recurrent pneumonia defined as two or more episodes within a 1-year period is an AIDS-defining condition; with combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), incidence declined from 22.7 episodes per 100 person-years before ART to 9.1 episodes per 100 person-years by 1997 after ART introduction, and in the Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment (START) study serious bacterial infections occurred at 0.87 per 100 person-years with approximately 40% due to bacterial pneumonia; this chapter focuses on bacterial community-acquired pneumonia and does not consider hospital acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^1112GDfv]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Immunocompromised host pneumonia (ICHP) — diagnostic criteria and imaging: Clinical signs and symptoms such as fever, cough, sputum production, and hypoxemia should prompt evaluation with chest imaging, but these signs are not always present in immunocompromised hosts. Radiographic abnormalities are required for a diagnosis of infectious pneumonia, and given multiple nonpulmonary causes in this population, findings consistent with an infection on imaging must be present for ICHP diagnosis. In immunocompromised hosts, lung infiltrates may not be evident by chest X-ray and may require a computed tomography scan for detection, and noninfectious pulmonary conditions must be distinguished from infection; immunocompromised hosts may have concurrent infectious and noninfectious etiologies of lung infiltrates.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in HIV — treatment response and predictors: A clinical response typically is observed within 48 to 72 hours after initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Advanced HIV infection and CD4 count < 100 cells/mm3 were predictors for longer time to clinical stability (i.e., > 7 days). The presence of bacteremia is a significant factor that impacts outcomes, and radiographic improvement usually lags behind clinical improvement.

Infection of the lungs and airways by viral, bacterial, fungal and protozoal agents, often producing atypical radiographic features, is common in children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Conventional chest radiography and chest CT remain the most useful imaging modalities for evaluation of the immunocompromised patient presenting with a suspected pulmonary infection. In this review the radiological features of acute lung infections in this population are discussed.

Adult pulmonary tuberculosis — clinical suspicion triggers and imaging specificity: Typical features include "prolonged cough with production of sputum that might be bloody, fever, night sweats, and weight loss", and classical chest radiograph findings in immunocompetent patients are "upper lobe infiltrates frequently with evidence of contraction or fibrosis and cavitation", but "these features are not specific for TB, and for every person in whom pulmonary TB is diagnosed, an estimated 10 to 100 persons are suspected on the basis of clinical criteria and must be evaluated". The page further states that "TB should be suspected in any patient who has persistent cough for more than 2 to 3 weeks", and notes that among persons with advanced HIV infection and pulmonary TB, the chest radiograph "might have lower-lobe and lobar infiltrates, hilar adenopathy, or interstitial infiltrates".

### Imaging features of bacterial respiratory infections in AIDS [^111Vavif]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although an emphasis has historically been placed on nonbacterial, opportunistic respiratory infections in HIV-infected individuals, it is increasingly important for clinicians to be familiar with the spectrum of bacterial respiratory infections that may occur in this population.

Recent Findings

Bacterial pneumonia and acute bronchitis are currently the most common causes of respiratory disease in HIV-infected individuals in developed countries. Moreover, these infections are frequently the first clinical manifestation of HIV infection. Among patients with sustained CD4 cell count > 200 cells/microL, the discontinuation of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis is not associated with an increased risk of bacterial pneumonia. The most common radiographic pattern of bacterial pneumonia is focal consolidation, which typically presents in either a segmental or lobar distribution. In cases in which the chest radiograph is inconclusive, high-resolution chest CT has a very high accuracy for detecting pyogenic small airways disease and for distinguishing between P. carinii pneumonia and other lung infections including bacterial infection.

Summary

Knowledge of the characteristic imaging and clinical features of bacterial respiratory infections can enhance their timely diagnosis and treatment.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Clinical manifestations of bacterial CAP in HIV — presentation, examination, and hospitalization threshold — are generally similar to those in individuals without HIV, with acute symptom onset over 3–5 days typical for S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus infections. Indicators of sepsis include fever, tachycardia, and/or hypotension, and tachypnea with decreased arterial oxygen saturation indicates moderate-to-severe pneumonia for which clinicians should strongly consider hospitalizing the patient. Bacterial pneumonia commonly shows focal consolidation signs on exam, whereas Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) often has a normal lung exam or inspiratory crackles if abnormal; white blood cell count is usually elevated (often relative to baseline in advanced HIV) with possible neutrophilia or left shift. On chest radiograph, bacterial pneumonia characteristically produces unilateral, focal, segmental, or lobar consolidation; consolidation is typical with S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus, whereas cavitation may suggest P. aeruginosa or S. aureus.

### Adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116hhrwJ]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Summary of recommendations — C-reactive protein (CRP) testing for suspected pneumonia in outpatient adults with acute cough: For outpatient adults with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia, we suggest measuring C-reactive protein (CRP) because the addition of CRP to features such as fever (38°C or greater), pleural pain, dyspnea and tachypnea, and signs on physical examination of the chest (tachypnea and new and localizing chest examination signs) strengthens both the diagnosis and exclusion of pneumonia (Grade 2C). Remarks specify that a CRP > 30 mg/L increases the likelihood that the cough may be related to having pneumonia, and that acute cough (ie, < 3 weeks in duration) is less likely to be caused by a pneumonia when the CRP < 10 mg/L or between 10–50 mg/L in the absence of dyspnea and daily fever.
