## Question

In blood venous gas

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when and how venous blood gas (VBG) can be used as a substitute for arterial blood gas (ABG) in clinical practice, including what parameters are reliable, what thresholds apply, and when ABG is still required. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts where VBG is commonly considered. Then, I should verify which VBG parameters correlate with ABG and which do not. Next, I will examine disease-specific evidence for COPD, DKA, trauma, and critical illness. After that, I should review guideline positions and practical thresholds for ruling in or out hypercarbia. Finally, I will consider special populations, pre-analytical pitfalls, and synthesize a practical decision framework with caveats and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts where VBG is most often used as an ABG surrogate: acute respiratory failure and hypercarbia screening, COPD exacerbations, diabetic ketoacidosis, trauma and shock, and general ICU or ED acid–base assessment, with emerging interest in mathematically arterialized venous methods to reduce ABG frequency [^4dd21b77] [^0c6078db] [^8f5f23c3] [^2bbf4d79] [^8e28874b].

> I need to check which VBG parameters are clinically reliable versus those that are not. Venous pH shows strong correlation and close agreement with arterial pH, typically within about ± 0.03–0.05 units, making venous pH a valid substitute for arterial pH in many settings [^e0313155] [^ed099a4c]. Venous bicarbonate and base excess also track closely with arterial values and can be used for metabolic acid–base assessment, whereas venous PCO2 is consistently higher than arterial by roughly 4–6 mmHg with wide limits of agreement, so it cannot be interchanged outright but can be used as a screening tool with adjustment or thresholds [^e0313155] [^5a757d8c]. Venous PO2 and oxygen saturation are not reliable surrogates for arterial oxygenation and should not be used to assess hypoxemia or to titrate oxygen therapy [^23cd6a53] [^27eca973].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about PCO2 interchangeability. I should double-check the magnitude and variability of the venous–arterial PCO2 gap. Multiple studies show a mean venous PCO2 about 4–6 mmHg higher than arterial, with 95% limits of agreement spanning roughly ± 15–20 mmHg, which is clinically too wide for direct substitution; however, a venous PCO2 below about 45 mmHg reliably excludes clinically significant hypercarbia, and values above about 50–55 mmHg are highly specific for arterial hypercarbia, enabling a rule-out/rule-in strategy rather than direct interchange [^5a757d8c] [^27eca973] [^4dd21b77].

> Next, I should review COPD exacerbations specifically. Prospective cohort data demonstrate that venous pH and bicarbonate agree closely with arterial values, and using a venous pH threshold around 7.35 can safely reduce ABGs by about two-thirds while catching acidosis; pulse oximetry complements VBG for oxygenation, though oximetry is less reliable at low saturations, prompting ABG when SpO2 is below about 80–85% or when NIV is being considered [^0c6078db] [^3832f856] [^a847f43c]. Let me verify the practical cut points: a venous pH less than 7.35 should trigger ABG to confirm acidosis and guide ventilatory support, whereas a venous pH 7.35 or higher with adequate SpO2 makes ABG less urgent in stable patients [^0c6078db] [^3832f856].

> I will now examine diabetic ketoacidosis. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of venous–arterial pH difference. Studies in DKA show a mean pH difference of about 0.03 units, with excellent correlation, supporting the use of venous pH to assess metabolic acidosis; however, if there is concern for mixed acid–base disorders, respiratory depression, or hypoxemia, ABG remains indicated to clarify the respiratory component and oxygenation needs [^8f5f23c3].

> For trauma and shock, I should confirm agreement for base deficit and lactate. Observational data show venous base deficit and lactate agree closely with arterial values, and venous sampling can substitute for arterial in many trauma contexts; however, in severe shock or when precise ventilatory assessment is needed, ABG may still be required, and clinicians should integrate the clinical picture rather than rely on VBG alone [^2bbf4d79] [^22080e9c].

> In critical illness and ICU settings, I need to ensure I distinguish central from peripheral VBG. Central venous blood gases show better correlation with ABG than peripheral VBG, particularly for PCO2, and agreement improves in mechanically ventilated patients with adequate ScvO2; nonetheless, even central VBG PCO2 has clinically important limits of agreement, so ABG remains the reference when fine titration of ventilation or precise oxygenation is needed [^37b41437] [^acddb4f1] [^e0313155]. But wait, what if we use mathematically arterialized venous methods? Emerging evidence suggests v-TAC can closely approximate ABG pH and PCO2 and may track ventilatory changes better than raw VBG, though it assumes normal perfusion and aerobic metabolism and is less reliable for high PO2 ranges [^8e28874b] [^71d469b3] [^4c49de3d].

> I should confirm guideline positions to avoid overgeneralization. AARC advises that venous PCO2 and pH are not substitutes for arterial in general, but acknowledges that in select conditions such as COPD exacerbations, DKA, and some ICU contexts, adjusted central VBG or validated venous approaches may suffice for acid–base and ventilation screening; AAFP emphasizes using pH and PCO2 to determine the primary acid–base process, implicitly allowing venous pH when the process is metabolic [^23cd6a53] [^ee2bf749] [^abc8e566]. GOLD notes that venous pH and bicarbonate are accurate compared with arterial, but PCO2 differs and may require ABG confirmation when NIV is planned or when oxygenation is unstable [^a847f43c].

> Let me consider special populations and pre-analytical pitfalls. In neonates and pediatrics, capillary blood gases can substitute for ABG for pH and PCO2 when properly collected and arterialized, but not for oxygenation; in lower-risk BRUE infants, routine VBG/ABG is not recommended because it rarely changes management and may yield false positives [^2593703d] [^58a596c3]. I should double-check sample handling: underfilled heparin tubes can artifactually raise pH and lower ionized calcium, and delays in analysis can distort results, so tubes should be filled adequately and analyzed promptly, ideally within 10–15 minutes [^ca972cce] [^08018013].

> Next, I should review a practical decision framework and verify the thresholds. For suspected hypercarbic respiratory failure, start with VBG; if venous PCO2 is less than about 45 mmHg, hypercarbia is effectively excluded and ABG can be avoided; if venous PCO2 is greater than about 50–55 mmHg, the probability of arterial hypercarbia is high and ABG should be obtained to quantify and guide therapy; if venous PCO2 is 45–50 mmHg, obtain ABG based on clinical risk and pretest probability [^27eca973] [^4dd21b77] [^6c0e7795]. For acid–base assessment, venous pH is generally sufficient unless mixed disorders or respiratory components are unclear; for oxygenation, never rely on venous PO2 or saturation, and use pulse oximetry with awareness of its limitations, escalating to ABG when SpO2 is low, unreliable, or when NIV/high-flow oxygen is initiated [^23cd6a53] [^a847f43c].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: venous pH and bicarbonate are reliable substitutes for arterial in many stable patients, venous PCO2 is not interchangeable but can be used to screen for hypercarbia with validated thresholds, and venous oxygenation parameters should not be used to assess hypoxemia; ABG remains indicated for unstable patients, when precise ventilatory control is needed, for mixed acid–base disorders, or when oxygenation must be accurately determined, with emerging mathematically arterialized venous methods offering a promising, context-dependent alternative to reduce ABG burden [^e0313155] [^4dd21b77] [^8e28874b].

Venous blood gas (VBG) is a **less invasive alternative** to arterial blood gas (ABG) for assessing acid–base status and ventilation, but it **cannot reliably assess oxygenation** [^23cd6a53]. Venous pH and bicarbonate correlate closely with arterial values (mean pH difference ~0.03–0.05), making VBG useful for metabolic acidosis and hypercarbia screening [^e0313155] [^5a757d8c]. Venous PCO2 is ~5–8 mmHg higher than arterial, so a venous PCO2 < 45 mmHg **rules out hypercarbia**, while values > 50 mmHg suggest arterial hypercarbia and warrant ABG confirmation [^27eca973] [^6c0e7795]. VBG is not reliable for oxygenation; venous PO2/SO2 do not reflect arterial oxygenation, so ABG is needed when accurate oxygen assessment is required [^23cd6a53] [^27eca973]. VBG is preferred in COPD, DKA, and trauma when oxygenation is stable, and is less painful and safer than ABG [^0c6078db] [^8f5f23c3] [^2bbf4d79] [^ace74692].

---

## Clinical utility of venous blood gas

VBG is **most useful for assessing acid–base status and ventilation**, with limited utility for oxygenation [^23cd6a53].

---

### Acid-base assessment

Venous pH correlates closely with arterial pH (mean difference ~0.03–0.05), allowing reliable assessment of metabolic acidosis and compensation [^e0313155] [^ed099a4c]. Venous bicarbonate and base excess also align with arterial values, supporting metabolic acid–base interpretation [^4213596d] [^5f525ca9].

---

### Ventilatory assessment

Venous PCO2 is ~5–8 mmHg higher than arterial, but a venous PCO2 < 45 mmHg **reliably excludes hypercarbia**, while values > 50 mmHg suggest arterial hypercarbia and warrant ABG confirmation [^27eca973] [^6c0e7795]. VBG is useful for screening and trending ventilation, especially in COPD and DKA [^0c6078db] [^8f5f23c3].

---

### Oxygenation assessment

Venous PO2 and SO2 **do not reflect arterial oxygenation**; VBG should not be used to assess hypoxemia or guide oxygen therapy [^23cd6a53] [^27eca973]. ABG remains the gold standard for oxygenation assessment [^01d6f35a].

---

## Clinical scenarios where VBG is appropriate

VBG is **appropriate when oxygenation is stable** or adequately assessed noninvasively:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Vbg utility** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| COPD exacerbation | High utility for pH, bicarbonate, and PCO2 screening | Reserve ABG for severe acidosis, NIV initiation, or SpO2 < 80% [^0c6078db] [^a847f43c] |
| Diabetic ketoacidosis | High utility for pH and bicarbonate | ABG if mixed acid–base disorder or respiratory compromise suspected [^8f5f23c3] |
| Trauma | Useful for base deficit and lactate | ABG if severe shock or respiratory failure [^2bbf4d79] |
| General ED patients | Useful for acid–base and ventilation screening | ABG if hypoxemia or complex acid–base disorder suspected [^5f525ca9] |

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Oxygenation**: Venous PO2/SO2 are unreliable for arterial oxygenation; use ABG when accurate oxygen assessment is needed [^23cd6a53] [^27eca973].
- **Circulatory failure**: Arterial–venous differences widen in shock; interpret VBG cautiously and prefer ABG in severe hemodynamic instability [^e0313155] [^58e6d408].
- **Pre-analytical errors**: Proper sampling, handling, and timely analysis are critical to avoid errors [^9d5aec74] [^b0dc79c4].

---

## Practical approach to VBG interpretation

- **pH**: Interpret venous pH as clinically equivalent to arterial pH for acid–base assessment [^e0313155] [^ed099a4c].
- **PCO2**: Use venous PCO2 to screen for hypercarbia; < 45 mmHg excludes hypercarbia, > 50 mmHg suggests hypercarbia and warrants ABG [^27eca973] [^6c0e7795].
- **Bicarbonate/base excess**: Use venous values for metabolic acid–base interpretation [^4213596d] [^5f525ca9].
- **PO2/SO2**: Do not rely on venous oxygenation; use ABG or pulse oximetry for oxygenation assessment [^23cd6a53] [^27eca973].

---

## Emerging technologies

Mathematical arterialization (v-TAC) can estimate arterial pH and PCO2 from VBG plus SpO2, showing close agreement with ABG in some settings, but **requires validation** and is not yet universally adopted [^8e28874b] [^71d469b3].

---

Venous blood gas is a **practical, less invasive alternative** to ABG for acid–base and ventilatory assessment, but it **cannot replace ABG** when accurate oxygenation or precise ventilatory control is required. Use VBG when oxygenation is stable or noninvasively monitored, and escalate to ABG when results are discordant or clinical risk is high.

### Comparing central venous blood gas to arterial blood gas and determining its utility in critically ill patients: narrative review [^e0313155]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis is used in critical care units to determine the degree of oxygenation, adequacy of ventilation, and the presence and severity of acid-base disturbances in the body. However, arterial puncture may result in complications, and the difficulty in acquiring arterial blood may delay care. Central venous blood gas (VBG) is a potentially more accessible alternative to ABG sampling. Current evidence suggests that pH and Pco2 obtained via peripheral VBG correlate well with ABG measurement. Nevertheless, the value of using central VBG to guide clinical decisions or as a surrogate for ABG is unclear. The purpose of this review is to explore the relationship between ABGs and central VBGs in critically ill patients. We performed a MEDLINE search using the following search terms: venous blood gas, arterial blood gas, and central venous blood gas. We excluded studies that did not involve human subjects, and only pH and Pco2 values were reviewed and examined from the studies included. All cited references from included studies were also reviewed to identify relevant literature. We identified 7 studies that met our criteria. In studies of hemodynamically stable patients, the mean difference between arterial and central venous pH and Pco2 was 0.03 units and 4–6.5 mm Hg, respectively. However, in patients with circulatory failure, the difference between central venous and arterial pH/Pco2 was 4-fold greater. We concluded that central VBG parameters of pH and Pco2 are potentially good surrogates for determining arterial pH and Pco2 in a stable patient without severe acid-base disturbances. Furthermore, central VBG can be used as a useful screening tool for arterial hypercapnia. In addition, we derived an adjustment formula for ABG conversion from central VBG: (1) arterial pH = venous pH + 0.05 units and (2) arterial Pco2 = venous Pco2 - 5 mm Hg.

### How reliable are electrolyte and metabolite results measured by a blood gas analyzer in the ED? [^035fdaed]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Blood gas analysis is a frequently ordered test in emergency departments for many indications. It is a rapid technique that can analyze electrolyte and metabolites in addition to pH and blood gases. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of electrolyte and metabolite results measured by blood gas and core laboratory analyzers.

Methods

This was a prospective, single-center observational study conducted in a tertiary care center's emergency department. All adult patients requiring arterial/venous blood gas analysis and core laboratory tests together for any purpose were consecutively included in the study between April 2014 and July 2015. Patients younger than 16 years, having any intravenous infusion or blood transfusion prior to sampling, or who were pregnant were excluded.

Results

A total of 1094 patients' (male = 547, female = 547) paired blood samples were analyzed. The mean age was 58.10 ± 21.35 years, and there was no difference between arterial and venous sampling groups by age, pH, or sex (P = 0.93, .56, and .41, respectively). Correlation coefficients for hemoglobin, hematocrit, glucose, potassium, sodium, and chloride levels measured by blood gas analyzer and core laboratory analyzers were 0.922, 0.896, 0.964, 0.823, 0.854, and 0.791, respectively.

Conclusion

Blood gas analysis results were strongly correlated for hemoglobin, hematocrit, glucose, potassium, and sodium levels but were only moderately correlated for chloride levels. These parameters as measured by a blood gas analyzer seem reliable in critical decision making but must be validated by core laboratory results.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: blood gas analysis and hemoximetry: 2013 [^3d726d02]. Respiratory Care (2013). Medium credibility.

Blood gas analysis (BGA) description and variables — analysis of arterial and mixed venous blood provides information concerning oxygenation, ventilatory, and acid-base status, whereas samples from capillary, peripheral venous, umbilical venous sources and pH from other body fluids may provide limited information. The variables most generally measured are the P co2, P o2, and pH, and additional clinically useful variables include the concentration of total hemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin saturation, saturations of the dyshemoglobins (carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin), and calculated or derived values such as plasma bicarbonate and base excess/deficit. While some evidence suggests venous and arterial pH, P co2, and HCO3 may be clinically comparable in certain settings, venous blood gas (VBG) obtained from a central line should be considered a surrogate for arterial blood gas (ABG) only in very specific clinical circumstances. Central venous oxygen saturation and mixed venous oxygen saturation can reflect the relationship between oxygen delivery and consumption, and venous oximetry monitoring may reduce the morbidity and mortality of patients undergoing major surgery or patients with septic shock as it allows implementation of early goal-directed therapies.

### Can VBG analysis replace ABG analysis in emergency care? [^5f525ca9]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Blood gas analysis is an integral part of the assessment of emergency department (ED) patients with acute respiratory or metabolic disease. Traditionally ABG analyses have been used, but increasingly, emergency clinicians are using venous blood gas (VBG) analyses. This has been challenged, especially by respiratory physicians, as being too inaccurate. This clinical review, using case examples, summarises the evidence supporting use of VBG to guide management decisions. Arteriovenous agreement for pH is such that values are clinically interchangeable and agreement for bicarbonate is also close. Agreement for pCO2 is poor with 95% limits of agreement of the order of 20mmHg (2.67kPa); however, there is solid evidence that a venous pCO2 ≤ 45mmHg (6kPa) reliably excludes clinically significant hypercarbia. Evidence regarding arteriovenous agreement for base excess is unclear. Given knowledge of the performance characteristics of VBG analyses, integration of the clinical findings with VBG results is often sufficient to safely guide treatment decision making.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: blood gas analysis and hemoximetry: 2013 [^66e3b131]. Respiratory Care (2013). Low credibility.

We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library database for articles published between January 1990 and December 2012. The update of this clinical practice guideline is based on 237 clinical trials, 54 reviews, and 23 meta-analyses on blood gas analysis (BGA) and hemoximetry. The following recommendations are made following the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation scoring system. BGA and hemoximetry are recommended for evaluating a patient's ventilatory, acid-base, and/or oxygenation status. BGA and hemoximetry are suggested for evaluating a patient's response to therapeutic interventions. BGA and hemoximetry are recommended for monitoring severity and progression of documented cardiopulmonary disease processes. Hemoximetry is recommended to determine the impact of dyshemoglobins on oxygenation. Capillary BGA is not recommended to determine oxygenation status. Central venous BGA and hemoximetry are suggested to determine oxygen consumption in the setting of early goal-directed therapies. For the assessment of oxygenation, a peripheral venous PO₂ is not recommended as a substitute for an arterial blood measurement (PaO₂). It is not recommended to use venous PCO₂ and pH as a substitute for arterial blood measurement of PaCO₂ and pH. It is suggested that hemoximetry is used in the detection and evaluation of shunts during diagnostic cardiac catheterization.

### Comparison of pH and PCObetween arterial blood gas and venous blood gas in critically ill patients [^619f1962]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The reliability of peripheral venous blood sampling as a substitute for arterial blood sampling in determining the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2) in critically ill patients remains controversial. We aimed to determine the utility of venous blood in a medical intensive care unit population.

Methods

Seventy-six critically ill patients requiring arterial blood sampling as part of their standard clinical management were prospectively enrolled in this study. A venous blood sample was drawn from the same upper extremity within 5 min of the arterial blood sampling. Venous pH, pCO 2, and pO 2 were measured in venous samples and compared with those in their arterial counterparts.

Results

The venous pCO 2 was, on average, higher by 5.8 mmHg (standard deviation = 4.6 mmHg) than the arterial pCO 2 with Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement of -9.2, 9.2 mmHg.

Conclusions

Obtaining venous blood from an intact upper extremity in critically ill individuals can provide a reliable estimate of arterial pCO 2 and eliminate the need for invasive arterial blood sampling.

### Venous blood gases in the assessment of respiratory failure in patients undergoing sleep studies: a randomized study [^27eca973]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Venous blood gases (VBGs) are not consistently considered suitable surrogates for arterial blood gases (ABGs) in assessing acute respiratory failure due to variable measurement error. The physiological stability of patients with chronic ventilatory failure may lead to improved agreement in this setting.

Methods

Adults requiring ABGs for sleep or ventilation titration studies had VBGs drawn before or after each ABG, in a randomized order. Veno-arterial correlation and agreement were examined for carbon dioxide tension (PCO 2), pH, oxygen tension (PO 2), and oxygen saturation (SO 2).

Results

We analyzed 115 VBG-ABG pairs from 61 patients. Arterial and venous measures were correlated (P < .05) for PCO 2 (r = .84) and pH (r = .72), but not for PO 2 or SO 2. Adjusted mean veno-arterial differences (95% limits of agreement) were +5.0mmHg (-4.4 to +14.4) for PCO 2; -0.02 (-0.09 to +0.04) for pH; -34.3mmHg (-78.5 to +10.0) for PO 2; and -23.9% (-61.3 to +13.5) for SO 2. VBGs obtained from the dorsal hand demonstrated a lower mean PCO 2 veno-arterial difference (P < .01). A venous PCO 2 threshold of ≥ 45.8mmHg was > 95% sensitive for arterial hypercapnia, so measurements below this can exclude the diagnosis without an ABG. A venous PCO 2 threshold of ≥ 53.7mmHg was > 95% specific for arterial hypercapnia, so such readings can be assumed diagnostic. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 indicated high discriminatory capacity.

Conclusions

A venous PCO 2 < 45.8mmHg or ≥ 53.7mmHg would exclude or diagnose hypercapnia, respectively, in patients referred for sleep studies, but VBGs are poor surrogates for ABGs where precision is important.

### Agreement between central venous and arterial blood gas measurements in the intensive care unit [^4213596d]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Venous blood gas (VBG) analysis is a safer procedure than arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis and may be an alternative for determining acid-base status. The objective of this study was to examine the agreement between ABG and central VBG samples for all commonly used parameters in a medical intensive care unit (ICU) population.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We performed a single-center, prospective trial to assess the agreement between arterial and central VBG measurements in a medical ICU. Adult patients who were admitted to the ICU and required both a central venous line and an arterial line were enrolled. When an ABG was performed, a central venous sample was obtained to examine the agreement among the pH, Pco(2), and bicarbonate. Data comparing central and peripheral VBG values were also obtained.

Results

The mean arterial minus venous difference for pH, Pco(2), and bicarbonate was 0.027, -3.8, and -0.80, respectively. Bland-Altman plots for agreement of pH, Pco(2), and bicarbonate showed 95% limits of agreement of -0.028 to 0.081, -12.3 to 4.8, and -4.0 to 2.4, respectively. Regression equations were derived to predict arterial values from venous values as follows: Arterial pH = −0.307 + 1.05 × venous pH, arterial PCO₂ = 0.805 + 0.936 × venous PCO₂, and arterial bicarbonate = 0.513 + 0.945 × venous bicarbonate. The mean central minus peripheral differences for pH, Pco(2), and bicarbonate were not clinically important.

Conclusions

Peripheral or central venous pH, Pco(2), and bicarbonate can replace their arterial equivalents in many clinical contexts encountered in the ICU.

Shock is defined as global tissue hypoxia secondary to an imbalance between systemic oxygen delivery and oxygen demand. Venous oxygen saturations represent this relationship between oxygen delivery and oxygen demand and can therefore be used as an additional parameter to detect an impaired cardiorespiratory reserve. Before appropriate use of venous oxygen saturations, however, one should be aware of the physiology. Although venous oxygen saturation has been the subject of research for many years, increasing interest arose especially in the past decade for its use as a therapeutic goal in critically ill patients and during the perioperative period. Also, there has been debate on differences between mixed and central venous oxygen saturation and their interchangeability. Both mixed and central venous oxygen saturation are clinically useful but both variables should be used with insightful knowledge and caution. In general, low values warn the clinician about cardiocirculatory or metabolic impairment and should urge further diagnostics and appropriate action, whereas normal or high values do not rule out persistent tissue hypoxia. The use of venous oxygen saturations seems especially useful in the early phase of disease or injury. Whether venous oxygen saturations should be measured continuously remains unclear. Especially, continuous measurement of central venous oxygen saturation as part of the treatment protocol has been shown a valuable strategy in the emergency department and in cardiac surgery. In clinical practice, venous oxygen saturations should always be used in combination with vital signs and other relevant endpoints.

### Reducing pain by using venous blood gas instead of arterial blood gas (VEINART): a multicentre randomised controlled trial [^ace74692]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Venous sampling for blood gas analysis has been suggested as an alternative to arterial sampling in order to reduce pain. The main objective was to compare pain induced by venous and arterial sampling and to assess whether the type of sampling would affect clinical management or not.

Methods

We performed an open-label randomised multicentre prospective study in four French EDs during a 4-week period. Non-hypoxaemic adults, whose medical management required blood gas analysis, were randomly allocated using a computer-generated randomisation list stratified by centres with an allocation ratio of 1:1 using random blocks to one of the two arms: venous or arterial sampling. The primary outcome was the maximal pain during sampling, using the visual analogue scale. Secondary outcomes pertained to ease of sampling as rated by the nurse drawing the blood, and physician satisfaction regarding usefulness of biochemical data.

Results

113 patients were included: 55 in the arterial and 58 in the venous sampling group. The mean maximal pain was 40.5mm ± 24.9 mmand 22.6mm ± 20.2 mm in the arterial group and the venous group, respectively, accounting for a mean difference of 17.9mm (95%CI 9.6 to 26.3) (p < 0.0001). Ease of blood sampling was greater in the venous group as compared with the arterial group (p = 0.02). The usefulness of the results, evaluated by the prescriber, did not significantly differ (p = 0.25).

Conclusions

Venous blood gas is less painful for patients than ABG in non-hypoxaemic patients. Venous blood gas should replace ABG in this setting.

### Can venous cord gas values predict fetal acidemia? [^0dffa6fc]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Umbilical cord arterial blood gas values are used to diagnose fetal acidemia; however, arterial cord blood specimens are frequently not available.

Objective

We sought to assess whether umbilical cord venous blood gas values can be used to reliably predict fetal acidemia.

Study Design

This is an observational study of women with a singleton gestation at a single tertiary care hospital who delivered from September 2010 through August 2015 and had both umbilical cord arterial and venous blood gas samples measured. Fetal acidemia was defined in 2 ways: (1) umbilical cord arterial pH < 7.0, and (2) umbilical cord arterial base deficit ≥ 12 mEq/L. Receiver operating characteristic curves for fetal acidemia were generated using umbilical cord venous blood gas values and the areas under the curve were calculated. Umbilical cord venous blood gas cutoffs associated with < 1%, < 5%, < 10%, and < 50% probability of acidemia were calculated.

Results

Of the 36,325 women who met inclusion criteria, 563 (1.5%) had an umbilical cord arterial pH < 7.0 and 1535 (4.2%) had an umbilical cord arterial base deficit ≥ 12 mEq/L. Umbilical cord venous pH was highly predictive of umbilical cord arterial pH < 7.0 (area under the curve, 0.955; 95% confidence interval, 0.946–0.965). Similarly, umbilical cord venous base deficit was highly predictive of umbilical cord arterial base deficit ≥ 12 mEq/L (area under the curve, 0.967; 95% confidence interval, 0.963–0.971). While the combination of venous pH and base deficit was statistically significantly more predictive of umbilical cord arterial pH < 7.0 (area under the curve, 0.961; 95% confidence interval, 0.952–0.969; P < .001), this difference has negligible clinical meaning. Similarly, the combination of venous pH and base deficit (area under the curve, 0.967; 95% confidence interval, 0.962–0.971) was no more predictive than venous base deficit alone in the prediction of umbilical cord arterial base deficit ≥ 12 mEq (P = 0.622). The likelihood of an arterial cord venous pH < 7.0 was < 1%, < 5%, < 10%, and < 50% with cord venous pH of 7.22, 7.16, 7.14, and 7.07, respectively. The likelihood of an arterial cord base deficit ≥ 12 mEq/L was < 1%, < 5%, < 10%, and < 50% with cord venous base deficit of 7.0, 8.5, 9.2, and 11.3, respectively.

Conclusion

Umbilical cord venous pH and base deficit are each highly predictive of fetal acidemia, and can be used to evaluate the likelihood of fetal acidemia in the absence of umbilical cord arterial blood gas values.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: blood gas analysis and hemoximetry: 2013 [^58e6d408]. Respiratory Care (2013). Medium credibility.

Venous blood gas (VBG) versus arterial blood gas (ABG) — interchangeability and clinical use are restricted: VBG values should be interpreted as interchangeable with ABG only in very specific clinical conditions. Central venous oxygen saturation may not reliably predict (overestimate) mixed venous oxygen saturation in patients with severe sepsis in early goal-directed therapies. Available evidence suggests that there is good agreement for pH and HCO3 values between arterial and VBG results obtained from a peripheral vein in patients with COPD, but not for P_aO2, or P_CO2, and VBG pH and P_CO2 levels have relatively good correlation with ABG values, but cannot be substituted for ABG in exacerbation of COPD or in the setting of acute trauma. While a VBG may be used instead of ABG to determine pH, PCO2, and HCO3 in some diseases, such as respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal sepsis, renal failure, pneumonia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and status epilepticus, it should not be used as a substitute in other diseases such as neonatal seizure, shock, congestive heart failure, and congenital heart diseases. The presence of a high central venous-arterial PCO2 difference helps identify inadequacy of circulatory response as the one present in severe hemorrhagic shock, poor cardiac output, during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and after cardiopulmonary bypass.

### Using venous blood gas analysis in the assessment of COPD exacerbations: a prospective cohort study [^0c6078db]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Identifying acute hypercapnic respiratory failure is crucial in the initial management of acute exacerbations of COPD. Guidelines recommend obtaining arterial blood samples but these are more difficult to obtain than venous. We assessed whether blood gas values derived from venous blood could replace arterial at initial assessment.

Methods

Patients requiring hospital treatment for an exacerbation of COPD had paired arterial and venous samples taken. Bland–Altman analyses were performed to assess agreement between arterial and venous pH, CO 2 and. The relationship between SpO 2 and SaO 2 was assessed. The number of attempts and pain scores for each sample were measured.

Results

234 patients were studied. There was good agreement between arterial and venous measures of pH and(mean difference 0.03 and −0.04, limits of agreement −0.05 to 0.11 and −2.90 to 2.82, respectively), and between SaO 2 and SpO 2 (in patients with an SpO 2 of > 80%). Arterial sampling required more attempts and was more painful than venous (mean pain score 4 (IQR 2–5) and 1 (IQR 0–2), respectively, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Arterial sampling is more difficult and more painful than venous sampling. There is good agreement between pH andvalues derived from venous and arterial blood, and between pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas oxygen saturations. These agreements could allow the initial assessment of COPD exacerbations to be based on venous blood gas analysis and pulse oximetry, simplifying the care pathway and improving the patient experience.

### Agreement between an arterial blood gas analyser and a venous blood analyser in the measurement of potassium in patients in cardiac arrest [^4d9db46e]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Rapid measurement of potassium is crucial in the resuscitation of patients in cardiac arrest. This is often done on an arterial blood gas sample taken during resuscitation and analysed in an emergency department based blood gas analyser. No-one has assessed how accurate or reliable this is when compared with the traditional method of sending a venous sample to the laboratory for standard analysis. This study looked at the agreement between potassium measurements in arterial blood gas samples and venous blood samples in patients in cardiac arrest.

Method

Arterial and venous blood samples were taken at the same time and analysed in the usual way from 50 patients in cardiac arrest. It was found that the mean difference between each pair of arterial and venous potassium measurements was low at 0.106 mmol/l. However, the standard deviation of these differences and subsequently the 95% limits of agreement were wide (-1.182 mmol/l to 1.394 mmol/l)-that is, 95% of differences will lie between these limits. It is felt that these limits are too wide for safe use in clinical practice.

Conclusion

Based on these results, it is advised that arterial blood gas analysers should be used with caution to measure potassium in patients in cardiac arrest.

### Using venous blood gas analysis in the assessment of COPD exacerbations: a prospective cohort study [^bf69d08d]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Arterial sampling was more painful than venous and required more attempts. While the pain of arterial sampling can be reduced by using local anaesthetic, it is not widely used. Although capillary sampling is used in speciality wards, widespread adoption is difficult because of the extra training, resources and time needed. As patients with exacerbations of COPD almost always have venipuncture to obtain samples for full blood count and blood chemistry analysis, VBG analysis can be performed on the same sample.

Our results suggest that the close relationship between venous and arterial acid base parameters, and between oxygen saturations obtained from pulse oximetry and arterial blood, could allow the initial assessment of acute COPD exacerbations to be based on a combined measurement of a VBG pH and SpO 2. This would mean a change in practice as the current oxygen guidelines published by the British Thoracic Societystate that any patient requiring supplemental oxygen to achieve a target SpO 2 of 92%–94% should have an arterial blood or arteriolised capillary blood gas performed.

We suggest that arterial sampling is reserved for patients with a venous pH of < 7.35. The approach of using venous blood first has obvious benefits. Only one blood draw would be required resulting in less pain and a lower risk of bruising and associated side effects. Less training would be required to initially assess acid/base status, and fewer attempts to draw blood would be needed, needing less equipment and simplifying the care pathway for COPD exacerbations. We conservatively estimate that > 66% of ABG attempts would be avoided and replaced by VBG sampling.

If one is interested in acid-base balance, a simultaneous measurement of hemoglobin, pH, and carbon dioxide tension will define the base excess of the blood, which is a measure of the nonrespiratory or metabolic component of acid-base balance, and by definition the value should be identical in venous or arterial blood.

Carbon dioxide content, pH, and hemoglobin concentrations could also be used to determine base excess, but among all of these factors the base excess is the only accurate measure of the degree of metabolic acidosis or alkalosis.

### Venous and arterial base deficits: do these agree in occult shock and in the elderly? A bland-altman analysis [^22080e9c]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Trauma centers are increasingly advocating the replacement of arterial blood gas measurements with venous blood gas measurements for simplification of base deficit (BD) determination. These values have never been demonstrated to agree in important trauma populations, such as for patients in occult shock (OS) or the elderly. The goal of this study was to investigate the level of agreement between venous and arterial BDs from blood gases in critically ill or injured patients, specifically in OS and the elderly.

Methods

This is a retrospective, consecutive, cohort study using matched pairs of venous and arterial blood gases from patients admitted to the Trauma and Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit in a Level I trauma center in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Agreement between near simultaneous arterial and venous BD was calculated using the Bland-Altman method. McNemar's test was used for differences in BDs in the presence or absence of OS and in elderly patients.

Results

BDs for 466 arterial and venous samples from 72 patients were compared pairwise. There was no significant difference between samples (p = 0.88). Ninety-eight percent of samples were within 3.0 mmol/L of each other. No significant differences were detected between venous and arterial BD in the presence of OS or in the elderly (p = 0.72 and p = 0.25, respectively).

Conclusion

Arterial and venous BDs agree, including in the presence of OS and in the elderly. Consideration may be given to venous sampling both in the intensive care unit or in other areas of care, such as the trauma bay.

### Trending peripheral venous PCOin patients with respiratory failure using mathematically arterialised venous blood gas samples [^7411e3d7]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Key messages

Does mathematically arterialised venous carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO 2) trend pCO 2 differently to venous pCO 2 alone, and if so, which follows arterial pCO 2 more accurately?
Limits of agreement for change in pCO 2 between venous samples and arterial samples/mathematically arterialised venous blood were wide. The change in pCO 2 with mathematical arterialisation more closely followed arterial blood than venous sampling.
Previous work has established that mathematical arterialisation of venous blood improves correlation with arterial blood. This is the first work to examine whether this improvement translates into improved ability to trend pCO 2.

### Multiple blood gas variables predict AKI survival in an independent manner [^e452cc7f]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

At this point, it briefly needs to be reiterated why the study aimed to evaluate the value of blood gas analysis emergin or newly established AKI. Predicting relevant clinical outcomes (such as the need for dialysis or death) in AKI remains challenging. Blood gas tests are cost-effective and widely available. The inclusion of both venous and arterial analyses in the current pilot study was based on the limited existing data on this topic.

We identified three independent predictors of in-hospital survival in subjects with AKI: admission arterial pH, arterial pH at AKI onset, and arterial pCO2 at AKI onset. Additionally, venous pCO2 at AKI onset was found to be predictive of the need for KRT. These findings are particularly intriguing considering that blood gas analysis data was not available for all subjects, suggesting the potential role of these variables as prognostic biomarkers for emerging AKI, even before clinical diagnosis.

In the absence of an indwelling arterial catheter, capillary blood gas sampling may be used to evaluate the acid/base and ventilation status of neonatal and pediatric patients with cardiorespiratory conditions. These guidelines were developed from a comprehensive review of the literature to provide guidance for the collection, handling, and interpretation of blood obtained from an arterialized capillary sample. Capillary and venous blood gas measurements are a useful alternative to arterial blood gas measurements for neonatal and pediatric patients who do not require close monitoring of [Formula: see text] In the presence of alterations in body temperature, blood pressure, or peripheral perfusion, agreement between a capillary blood gas with an arterial sample is recommended to determine whether changes in these physiologic conditions reduce reliability. Perfusion to the sample site should be assessed and preference given to blood sampling from a well perfused site, and blood should be analyzed within 15 min of sampling to minimize the propensity for pre-analytical errors. Clinicians should consider re-collecting a blood sample, obtained from an artery, vein, or capillary, when the blood gas or analyte result interpretation does not align with the patient's clinical presentation. A pneumatic tube system can be reliably used to transport blood gas samples collected in a syringe and capillary tube to a clinical laboratory for analysis. To reduce the cumulative pain effect and risk of complications, the capillary puncture procedure should be minimized when possible. Non-pharmacologic interventions should be used to reduce pain associated with capillary blood gas sampling. Automatic lancets are preferred to puncture the skin for capillary blood gas collection.

### Trending peripheral venous PCOin patients with respiratory failure using mathematically arterialised venous blood gas samples [^0cc3074b]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Background

Blood gas analysis with measurement of carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO 2) is essential in the assessment of a critically ill patient with respiratory failure. Arterial blood gases (ABGs) are the accepted reference technique for the assessment of pCO 2; however, they are painful, technically challenging and require expertise to obtain. Venous blood gases (VBGs) are often obtained with any initial venous punctureand in our experience are often used alone in the initial assessment of ventilatory status.

There is agreement in the literature for the use of VBG instead of ABG for the assessment of pH, lactate, and bicarbonate for both centraland peripheral VBGs.

VBGs are a useful screening tool for respiratory function with pCO 2 > 45 mm Hg being 100% sensitive for detecting the presence of hypercarbiaand a pCO 2 < 30 mm Hg being 100% predictive to rule out the presence of hypercarbia. However, venous (pCO 2 v) and arterial pCO 2 (pCO 2 a) are not interchangeable for further assessment as the limits of agreement (LOAs) are unacceptably wide ranging from −17.4 to +26 mm Hg(although some authors suggest closer agreement). In addition, pCO 2 v and pCO 2 a do not have a consistent relationship to permit a simple conversion factor.

Several authors have suggested that pHor pCO 2 may be useful for trending change in respiratory status, although reliance on pCO 2 v instead of ABG is likely to lead to unnecessary ventilator adjustment in intubated patients. One study looking at trending suggested that the agreement for absolute change was reasonable for venous pH, but not for pCO 2 v due to the wide LOAs.

Recently, a method has been developed that allows the estimation of ABG values from venous samples based on mathematical modelling of oxygen utilisation and thus carbon dioxide production in the tissues based on haemoglobin, peripheral oxygen saturations and venous oxygen saturations. Using an estimate of the respiratory quotient and oxygen extraction, the pCO 2 a is then estimated from the pCO 2 v. Mathematically arterialised or calculated VBG can be calculated to within clinically acceptable criteria of the arterial blood gas values for pH and pCO 2. The remaining variability is similar to that seen within serial arterial blood sampling and within laboratory acceptable performance criteria. Calculated arterial values from peripheral venous blood have been found to be more accurate than those taken from central venous bloodand caution is recommended when transforming central venous blood samples.

Venous blood cut points for managing acute exacerbations of COPD

Given the relationships observed, we calculated the sensitivity and specificity of a VBG pH andto correctly identify an arterial pH of ≥ 7.35, and an arterialof ≥ 21, as well as an SpO 2 to identify an SaO 2 of ≥ 92% (table 4). A venous pH of 7.34, a venousof 21.45 and an SpO 2 of 91.5 would have correctly classified 87% (95% CI 82% to 91%), 97% (95% CI 93% to 98%) and 71% (95% CI 65% to 77%) of patients, respectively. In terms of specificity, 96% of patients with an ABG pH of ≥ 7.35 also had a VBG pH of ≥ 7.35 (tables 5 and 6).

Table 4

We used current oxygen guidelinesto calculate how many ABG samples may have been avoided if the venous cut points were used instead. Of our 234 patients, 72 (31%) had a venous pH < 7.35. Of the 162 with a venous pH ≥ 7.35, only two had an arterial pH of < 7.35.

Consequently, we estimate approximately two-thirds of ABGs can safely be avoided in the initial assessment of COPD exacerbations. This figure does not factor in the repeat attempts needed to obtain arterial blood. Using these data, we suggest a new algorithm for the management of COPD exacerbations based on the current guidelines (figure 5).

Timing of samples

We assessed the mean difference in time between the paired arterial and venous samples to see if a delay between samples had an effect on the relationship between ABG and VBG parameters. The mean time difference was −4.18 min, SD 16.92, range −58.98 to 78.64 min (arterial–venous). Given the range, we repeated our analysis using the 168 paired samples that were performed within 15 min of each other. This did not affect the relationships (see online supplementary table).

### Prospective correlation of arterial vs venous blood gas measurements in trauma patients [^a59abae8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study is to assess if venous blood gas (VBG) results (pH and base excess [BE]) are numerically similar to arterial blood gas (ABG) in acutely ill trauma patients.

Methods

We prospectively correlated paired ABG and VBG results (pH and BE) in adult trauma patients when ABG was clinically indicated. A priori consensus threshold of clinical equivalence was set at ± less than 0.05 pH units and ± less than 2 BE units. We hypothesized that ABG results could be predicted by VBG results using a regression equation, derived from 173 patients, and validated on 173 separate patients.

Results

We analyzed 346 patients and found mean arterial pH of 7.39 and mean venous pH of 7.35 in the derivation set. Seventy-two percent of the paired sample pH values fell within the predefined consensus equivalence threshold of ± less than 0.05 pH units, whereas the 95% limits of agreement (LOAs) were twice as wide, at -0.10 to 0.11 pH units. Mean arterial BE was -2.2 and venous BE was -1.9. Eighty percent of the paired BE values fell within the predefined ± less than 2 BE units, whereas the 95% LOA were again more than twice as wide, at -4.4 to 3.9 BE units. Correlations between ABG and VBG were strong, at r² = 0.70 for pH and 0.75 for BE.

Conclusion

Although VBG results do correlate well with ABG results, only 72% to 80% of paired samples are clinically equivalent, and the 95% LOAs are unacceptably wide. Therefore, ABG samples should be obtained in acutely ill trauma patients if accurate acid-base status is required.

### Changes in central venous to arterial carbon dioxide gap (PCOgap) in response to acute changes in ventilation [^b2b80dad]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

For patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), measurements of blood gases are used for the assessment of acid–base and oxygenation status. Many of these patients suffer from sepsis, estimated to affect over 30 million people each year and contributing significantly to the number of hospital deaths. One of the main factors predetermining the prognosis of a patient with sepsis is the presence of septic shock. In the last decade, much research in this area has been focused on the early detection of shock. An elevated CO 2 gap, measured by the difference in central venous ('cv') and arterial ('a') PCO 2 (∆PCO 2) has been used as an early indicator of shock. Furthermore, the ratio of ∆PCO 2 to the arterial-venous difference in oxygen content ΔPCO₂(cv−a)/ΔtO₂(a−cv) has been used to guide and assess the response of fluid resuscitation strategies.

Previous studies have illustrated that significant changes in ∆PCO 2 can be due to circulatory effects, focussing on how venous blood could be modified due to, for example, reduced tissue perfusion and the CO 2 stagnation phenomenon. However, there are other situations that could alter the blood gas parameters in an ICU setting, including spontaneous breathing and/or adjustment of ventilator settings. Disturbances around the time of blood sampling could result in inaccurate calculations of ∆PCO 2 and other related parameters. The isolated effects of a disturbance in ventilation on the CO 2 gap have however, not been investigated.

In this study, we hypothesise that acute changes in ventilation affects arterial blood faster than central venous blood and that this may result in clinically significant changes in the ∆PCO 2. The aim of this study was, therefore, to determine and quantify the influences of acute changes in ventilation on the ∆PCO 2, concluding on the clinical significance of these changes when interpreting values of ∆PCO 2.

### Peripheral venous blood gas analysis for the diagnosis of respiratory failure, hypercarbia and metabolic disturbance in adults [^4dd21b77]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) is the reference standard for the diagnosis of respiratory failure (RF) and metabolic disturbance (MD), but peripheral venous blood gas analysis (PVBGA) is increasingly being used for the estimation of carbon dioxide, pH, and other variables in the context of acutely unwell adults presenting to hospitals and emergency departments.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review is to evaluate the performance of PVBGA by comparing it with the reference standard ABGA, which is assumed to be error-free for the diagnosis of (1) respiratory failure, (2) hypercarbia, and (3) metabolic disturbance (the three target conditions) in adults. The secondary objective is to evaluate the performance of the index test to diagnose nine specific subtypes of respiratory failure and metabolic disturbance. The definitions for these additional conditions are determined by changes to one or more of the following: pH (acidity), pO 2 (partial pressure of oxygen), pCO 2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide), HCO 3 (bicarbonate), as stated in the Methods section of this review (target conditions). We aimed to explore the following covariates: participant demographics (e.g. age, weight, and sex); participant comorbidities (e.g. chronic lung disease, chest wall deformity, and central nervous system disorder such as spinal cord injury); and the indication for blood gas sampling (e.g. shortness of breath, critical illness, resuscitation, trauma, or whilst under general anaesthesia).

Search Methods

On 10 July 2024, we searched the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and LILACS. We also manually searched 19 respiratory and critical care journals, and we searched ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We considered consecutive series studies and case-control studies that directly compared the index test PVBGA to the reference standard ABGA for adults over the age of 16 years. The included studies contained data for any one of the target conditions of respiratory failure and metabolic disturbance, as determined by individual changes to pO 2 (partial pressure of oxygen), pCO 2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide), pH (acidity), and HCO 3 (bicarbonate) concentration. Studies that only provided mean values for summed data were ineligible for inclusion. However, we invited authors of such studies to provide individual patient data for inclusion in this systematic review. There are nine studies awaiting classification.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently evaluated the quality of the relevant studies and extracted data from them. We conducted a quality assessment using the QUADAS-2 tool. Our statistical analysis used 2 x 2 tables for the positive and negative results of each test. We estimated a bivariate meta-analysis of sensitivity and specificity.

Main Results

We included six studies (919 participants) in our quantitative analysis. All studies were at high risk of bias due to one or more of the following factors: patient selection, since it was unclear if consecutive patients were included or where they were located; index test, with poor reporting of cut-offs; flow and timing domain because the fraction of inspired oxygen was frequently not stated and any difference between the collection of the VBGA and the ABGA could introduce bias. Respiratory failure For the diagnosis of respiratory failure of any type, when using PVBGA, the estimated summary sensitivity (Sn) was 97.6% (95% credible interval (CI) 94.1 to 99.4) and the estimated summary specificity (Sp) was 36.9% (95% CI 17.1 to 60.1) (6 studies, 805 participants of whom 291 (36%) were diagnosed with respiratory failure by ABGA; sensitivity: low-certainty evidence; specificity: very low certainty evidence). Isolated hypercarbia For the diagnosis of isolated hypercarbia (regardless of oxygen level), when using PVBGA, the estimated summary Sn was 97.1% (95% CI 93.3 to 99.2); the estimated summary Sp value was 53.9% (95% CI 39.8 to 66.7) (6 studies with 805 participants, 269 (33%) with ABGA confirmation; low-certainty evidence). Other findings Results for metabolic disturbance and our secondary target conditions are presented in the full review.

Authors' Conclusions

Very limited data suggest PVBGA performs poorly as a diagnostic test for respiratory failure compared to the reference standard of ABGA. The index test PVBGA was highly sensitive for the diagnosis of respiratory failure and isolated hypercarbia, but its specificity was poor for these two primary target conditions. The high sensitivity means PVBGA may have a useful role as a "rule out test" for respiratory failure and isolated hypercarbia; however, the high false-positive rates make the clinical interpretation of a positive test difficult. Moreover, we are uncertain regarding these estimates because we have only low to very low certainty about the evidence. Further studies that use (ABGA) established thresholds for the diagnosis of each target condition are needed.

### Use of central venous oxygen saturation to guide therapy [^6f75573f]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The use of pulmonary artery catheters has diminished, so that other technologies are emerging. Central venous oxygen saturation measurement (ScvO₂) as a surrogate for mixed venous oxygen saturation measurement (SvO₂) is simple and clinically accessible. To maximize the clinical utility of ScvO₂ (or SvO₂) measurement, it is useful to review what the measurement means in a physiologic context, how the measurement is made, important limitations, and how this measurement may be helpful in common clinical scenarios. Compared with cardiac output measurement, SvO₂ is more directly related to tissue oxygenation. Furthermore, when tissue oxygenation is a clinical concern, SvO₂ is less prone to error compared with cardiac output, where small measurement errors may lead to larger errors in interpreting adequacy of oxygen delivery. ScvO₂ should be measured from the tip of a central venous catheter placed close to, or within, the right atrium to reduce measurement error. Correct clinical interpretation of SvO₂, or its properly measured ScvO₂ surrogate, can be used to (1) estimate cardiac output using the Fick equation, (2) better understand whether a patient's oxygen delivery is adequate to meet their oxygen demands, (3) help guide clinical practice, particularly when resuscitating patients using validated early goal directed therapy treatment protocols, (4) understand and treat arterial hypoxemia, and (5) rapidly estimate shunt fraction (venous admixture).

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^3f774ff4]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) — lower-risk infants, blood gas testing: Clinicians Should Not Obtain Measurement of Venous or Arterial Blood Gases in Infants Presenting With a Lower-Risk BRUE (Grade B, Moderate Recommendation). Benefits are to reduce costs, unnecessary testing, pain, risk of thrombosis, and caregiver/infant anxiety, while risks include avoiding consequences of false-positive results and that testing may miss rare instances of hypercapnia and acid-base imbalances; the benefit-harm assessment states that the benefits of reducing unnecessary testing and false-positive results, as well as alleviating caregiver and infant anxiety, outweigh the rare missed diagnostic opportunity for hypercapnia and acid-base imbalances.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis and venous blood gas values… [^8f5f23c3]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis consists of elevated blood glucose, measurable ketone bodies and metabolic acidosis. Arterial blood gas determination is considered essential in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected diabetic ketoacidosis. Arterial blood sampling is painful, may be technically difficult and must be done in addition to venous sampling when testing for electrolytes and other values. The general correlation between arterial and venous pH measurements is well established, although this correlation has not been studied in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis. Brandenburg and Dire prospectively studied the relationship between arterial and venous blood gas values in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected diabetic ketoacidosis. Thirty-eight patients with 44 episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis who presented to an emergency department with blood glucose levels greater than 250 mg per dL, urine dipstick results positive for ketones and clinical suspicion of diabetic ketoacidosis were included in the study. Arterial and venous samples were obtained as temporally close to each other as possible for blood gas analysis. The mean difference between arterial and venous pH values was 0.
03. Arterial and venous pH results, arterial and venous bicarbonate measurements and arterial bicarbonate and serum carbon dioxide results were also closely correlated. The authors conclude that the peripheral venous pH measurement is a valid and reliable substitute for arterial pH in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis. A potential disadvantage of using venous determinations to determine the presence of diabetic ketoacidosis is that it may be more difficult to detect when mixed acid-base disturbances are present, since venous blood values may not reflect hypoxia in patients with respiratory depression.

In patients with suspected mixed acid–base disorders or evidence of respiratory depression or hypoxemia on pulse oximetry, arterial blood gas analysis remains an appropriate means of testing for diabetic ketoacidosis. To ensure that venous sampling does not underestimate the degree of acidosis, a larger patient sample would be needed to examine more patients with severe acidosis. In addition, a study of final patient outcomes is necessary to determine whether the use of venous rather than arterial gas values affects outcome.

### Predicting arterial blood gas and lactate from central venous blood analysis in critically ill patients: a multicentre, prospective, diagnostic accuracy study [^c8ec3b13]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The estimation of arterial blood gas and lactate from central venous blood analysis and pulse oximetry [Formula: see text] readings has not yet been extensively validated.

Methods

In this multicentre, prospective study performed in 590 patients with acute circulatory failure, we measured blood gases and lactate in simultaneous central venous and arterial blood samples at 6 h intervals during the first 24 h after insertion of central venous and arterial catheters. The study population was randomly divided in a 2:1 ratio into model derivation and validation sets. We derived predictive models of arterial pH, carbon dioxide partial pressure, oxygen saturation, and lactate, using clinical characteristics, [Formula: see text], and central venous blood gas values as predictors, and then tested their performance in the validation set.

Results

In the validation set, the agreement intervals between predicted and actual values were -0.078/+0.084 units for arterial pH, -1.32/+1.36 kPa for arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure, -5.15/+4.47% for arterial oxygen saturation, and -1.07/+1.05 mmol litre(-1) for arterial lactate (i.e. around two times our predefined clinically tolerable intervals for all variables). This led to ∼5% (or less) of extreme-to-extreme misclassifications, thus giving our predictive models only marginal agreement. Thresholds of predicted variables (as determined from the derivation set) showed high predictive values (consistently > 94%), to exclude abnormal arterial values in the validation set.

Conclusions

Using clinical characteristics, [Formula: see text], and central venous blood analysis, we predicted arterial blood gas and lactate values with marginal accuracy in patients with circulatory failure. Further studies are required to establish whether the developed models can be used with acceptable safety.

### Trending peripheral venous PCOin patients with respiratory failure using mathematically arterialised venous blood gas samples [^717f0455]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

This work along with current evidence suggests that the change in pCO 2 ca is a more accurate marker of the trend in pCO 2 a than venous pH or pCO 2 v. It is of interest that analysis incorporating the peripheral pCO 2 v may potentially be a more accurate representation of the patient's 'true' physiology than arterial samples in the setting of acute change in ventilation. Transient changes in ventilation as might occur with sampling anxiety-related hyperventilation appear to be reflected within seconds in pCO 2 a, while this effect is mitigated in venous blood. As a method where this mitigating effect is maintained and which also corrects for variability in tissue oxygen metabolism, pCO 2 ca via vTAC holds theoretical advantages.

There are limitations to this study. The two groups analysed were different, data set 1 appearing to have more acute and severe respiratory failure with higher baseline pCO 2 and lower pH. This may reflect the different time of sampling with samples in data set 1 being taken in the emergency department and intensive care unit versus patients established in the ward in data set 2. Without arterial samples, the LOA for ΔpCO 2 from data set 1 can only demonstrate that in this population pCO 2 ca and pCO 2 v gas tracked CO 2 differently. Data set 2, with concurrent VBG and ABG samples, allowed direct comparison of all three values - arterial, venous and calculated. The narrower LOAs between ΔpCO 2 ca and ΔpCO 2 a suggest that ΔpCO 2 ca tracks change in pCO 2 a better than ΔpCO 2 v in this population. Correlation of ΔpCO 2 for VBG/ABG and vTAC (calculated arterial) values in the most acute phase of respiratory failure represents an opportunity for future research. Of note, other studies of critically ill patients with wide ranges of diagnoses admitted to intensive care, pulmonary medicine or emergency departments retain small LOAs < 5 mm Hg when comparing single timepoint pCO 2 ca with pCO 2 a.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: blood gas analysis and hemoximetry: 2013 [^b0dc79c4]. Respiratory Care (2013). Medium credibility.

AARC clinical practice guideline — blood gas analysis analytical and post-analytical procedures state that testing is carried out according to an established proven protocol, conforming to manufacturer recommendations and that the following aspects of analysis should be monitored and corrective action taken as indicated: detection of presence of air bubbles or clots in specimen; assurance that an uninterrupted (ie, continuous) sample is drawn (or injected) into the analyzer and that all electrodes are covered by the sample; assurance that 8-hour quality control and calibration procedures have been completed and that instrumentation is functioning properly prior to patient sample analysis; and assurance that the specimen was properly labeled, stored, and analyzed within an acceptable period of time. The post-testing phase notes that the results should validate or contradict the patient's clinical condition, that documentation of results should be available for at least 2 years, and that reference intervals and critical values must be determined for each analyte prior to sample analysis, with transferred intervals that should be validated.

### Venous pH can safely replace arterial pH in the initial evaluation of patients in the emergency department [^ed099a4c]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aims to determine the extent of correlation of arterial and venous pH with a view to identifying whether venous samples can be used as an alternative to arterial values in the clinical management of selected patients in the emergency department.

Methods

This prospective study of patients who were deemed by their treating doctor to require an arterial blood gas analysis to determine their ventilatory or acid-base status, compared pH on an arterial and a venous sample taken as close to simultaneously as possible. Data were analysed using Pearson correlation and bias (Bland-Altman) methods.

Results

Two hundred and forty six patients were entered into the study; 196 with acute respiratory disease and 50 with suspected metabolic derangement. The values of pH on arterial and venous samples were highly correlated (r = 0.92) with an average difference between the samples of -0.4 units. There was also a high level of agreement between the methods with the 95% limits of agreement being -0.11 to +0.04 units.

Conclusion

Venous pH estimation shows a high degree of correlation and agreement with the arterial value, with acceptably narrow 95% limits of agreement. Venous pH estimation is an acceptable substitute for arterial measurement and may reduce risks of complications both for patients and health care workers.

### Comparison of mathematically arterialised venous blood gas sampling with arterial, capillary, and venous sampling in adult patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure: a single-centre longitudinal cohort study [^8e28874b]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Accurate arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis is essential in the management of hypercapnic respiratory failure, but sampling is painful, depending on operator expertise. Patients often require multiple samples over time to assess therapy response. Use of local anaesthetic is rare in UK ward-based practice despite longstanding recommendations for its use in national guidance. This recommendation was reinforced in the British Thoracic Society's 2017 guideline for oxygen use in adults in healthcare and emergency settings, which recommended (grade A) use of 'local anaesthesia for all ABG specimens except in emergencies'.

Arterialised capillary blood gas (CBG) samples present an alternative to this accepted standard, though their reliability and accuracy are uncertain. Venous blood gas (VBG) pH sampling can screen acutely unwell patients, but has less precision for PCO 2. VBG testing does not replace subsequent ABG sampling if treatment with acute non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is considered.

A newer venous to arterial conversion method (v-TAC, Roche) is available for clinical use. It calculates arterial acid–base status from VBG measurements combined with blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2) from standard pulse oximetry using mathematical models of acid–base chemistry. Peripheral venous blood is mathematically transported back through the tissues adding oxygen and removing carbon dioxide in a fixed ratio until oxygen levels match measurements taken from the pulse oximeter. A mathematical model of acid–base is applied to perform this calculation, which accounts for the oxygen dissociation curve, calibrating this to the venous blood, and for the Bohr-Haldane effects in the blood. The model calculates 'arterialised' values of pH, PCO 2, PO 2 and SO 2 assuming a respiratory quotient of 0.82, and adding oxygen and removing carbon dioxide until the calculated SO 2 is equivalent to measured SpO 2. The method essentially aims to compensate for the effects of aerobic metabolism. It is important to note that v-TAC calculations of arterial PO 2 are inaccurate when the plateau of the oxygen dissociation curve is reached, typically when SpO 2 is greater than 97%.

### Comparison of mathematically arterialised venous blood gas sampling with arterial, capillary, and venous sampling in adult patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure: a single-centre longitudinal cohort study [^71d469b3]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

For a cohort of patients treated with NIV for hypercapnic respiratory failure, a method of mathematical arterialisation of a venous sample (v-TAC) was interchangeable with arterial sampling for PCO 2 and pH assessment. The v-TAC method was less painful than ABG and had a higher likelihood of sampling success. The use of capillary or venous blood gas testing was found to be inaccurate and is not recommended as surrogates for ABG measurement. Our data also suggest that up to 15% of ABG sample results may be affected by a transient change in breathing pattern, reinforcing the use of local anaesthesia if intermittent ABG sampling is undertaken. Further studies under more controlled conditions are needed to explore the true variability of arterial results. The v-TAC method offers significant promise within acute clinical pathways for respiratory patients where its implementation could simplify the patient pathway and improve the recognition and monitoring of respiratory failure.

Blood gas analysis (BGA) — limitations/validation notes that erroneous results can arise from sample clotting due to improper anticoagulation or improper mixing; sample contamination by air, improper anticoagulant and/or improper anticoagulant concentration, saline or other fluids from an indwelling catheter, or inadvertent sampling of venous blood if attempting to obtain an ABG; deterioration or distortion due to delay in sample analysis, inappropriate collection and handling, or incomplete clearance of analyzer calibration gases and previous waste or flushing solution(s); the presence of hyperlipidemia, methylene blue, and/or hydroxocobalamin, which causes problems with analyzer membranes and may affect CO-oximetry; inappropriate sample size for the anticoagulant or analyzer requirements, and attempts should be made to keep sample sizes as small as is technically feasible, to limit blood loss, particularly in neonates; the presence of dyshemoglobins, where calculated values may be in error and may overestimate oxyhemoglobin saturation in the presence of carboxyhemoglobin or methemoglobin and with changes in diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) concentration; the presence of excess fetal hemoglobin, which leads to underestimation of calculated blood gas oxygen saturation values; inappropriate sample site, since arterialized capillary and central venous samples may be adequate to assess pH and PCO2 in hemodynamically stable patients but may underestimate patient oxygenation; and temperature-related errors, for which the laboratory must have a defined procedure for temperature correction and, if temperature-adjusted results are reported, the report should be clearly labeled as such and the measured results at 37°C must also be reported.

### ARTP statement on pulmonary function testing 2020 [^01d6f35a]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Measurement of arterial blood gases

National and international guidelines recommend accurate and reliable measurement of arterial blood gases (ABGs) that must comply with specific criteria for the prescription of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT). The 'gold standard' technique for blood gas analysis is arterial blood obtained via an indwelling arterial catheter (most often sited at the radial artery in adults) or by arterial puncture.

By nature of the complexity and invasiveness of arterial catheterisation, this method is usually reserved for the intensive care setting where patients may require frequent blood gas testing. Technical and safety considerations determine that for most patients who require blood gas analysis, placement of an arterial catheter is either not justified or only for a limited period (such as serial measurements during cardiopulmonary exercise testing).

Arterial blood is most often sampled by arterial puncture using a needle and syringe. Although traditionally performed by medical staff, arterial sampling is now often practised by senior healthcare scientists who have met the acceptable competency standards required by local policy. Importantly periodic re-evaluation relative to common precautions, correct syringe preparation, site determination, puncture technique, sample aspiration, storage and disposal of blood specimens, as well as postpuncture care should be performed.

### Central venous oxygenation: when physiology explains apparent discrepancies [^021c9838]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

A recent review of the literature concluded that 'central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO 2) is a very important measurement, which can be easily taken in a critical care environment by both medical and nursing staff. It provides an understanding of the patient's oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption and cardiac output. It has a key role within early goal-directed therapy and has been shown to decrease mortality when taken and analyzed appropriately'. Indeed, ScvO₂ > 70% or mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO₂) > 65% is recommended for both septic and non-septic patients.

There is no debate that a major task of experts is to determine clear and simple rules for the early treatment of life-threatening disorders. As a consequence of the worldwide promotion of these recommendations, however, there is a risk of reducing intensive care to these simple protocols. The objective of this review is to highlight the basic physiological and pathological features as well as the metrological issues that provide clear evidence that, in reality, and for each specific patient, SvO 2 and ScvO 2 are complex dynamic variables that may not always provide an appropriate cutoff for all clinical settings. This may explain that targeting unique S(c)vO 2 thresholds may balance positive and negative effects and may produce hazardous results in large studies.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: arterial blood gas testing to screen for hypercarbic respiratory failure [^6c0e7795]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Venous blood gases (VBGs) are safe and effective at screening for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Multiple studies have validated that a VBG with a PvCO 2 less than 45 reliably rules out hypercarbia. The use of VBGs for the initial screening of hypercarbia when hypercarbic respiratory failure is suspected can reduce the overall use of arterial blood gases which are more painful and take more time and expertise to perform.

WHY YOU MIGHT THINK AN ABG IS THE BEST TEST TO ORDER

Many physicians learn about blood gas testing during their preclinical years. Lecture material and test questions refer to ABG analysis as a crucial step in determining the primary acid base disturbance and assessing for appropriate compensation. For instance, "First Aid for the USMLE Step 1" makes no mention of VBGs.

ABG analysis, the gold standard for measurement of acid–base, oxygenation and ventilation status, provides the PCO 2 of arterial blood, which is proportional to CO 2 production and inversely proportional to alveolar ventilation.PCO 2 measurement is often useful to hospitalists assessing a patient's respiratory status or response to a metabolic process.

While VBGs can obtain all the values of an ABG, hospitalists cannot interchange them. A review of 13 studies comparing ABG and VBG values for 2009 patients found a weighted mean difference in pH of −0.033 for a VBG compared to an ABG. The study found a 95% limits of agreement (LOA) of approximately ± 0.1, suggesting good agreement between ABG and VBG. Therefore, adding 0.033 to a VBG pH can estimate an ABG pH. On the other hand, VBGs do not accurately predict PCO 2 as well as ABGs. In the same review, 8 studies assessing 965 patients found a weighted mean difference of 6.2 mmHg (a PvCO 2 typically reports approximately 6.2 mmHg higher than a PaCO 2), but the 95% LOA vary widely, falling between −17.4 to 23.9 mmHg. Even though these two values correlate well, hospitalists cannot uniformly convert the partial pressure of venous CO 2 (PvCO 2) to a PaCO 2.

### Point-of-care bedside gas analyzer: limited use of venous pCO ₂ in emergency patients [^d1fb369c]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Because arterial punctures are more painful, venous blood gas analysis has been proposed as an alternative.

Objectives

To determine if venous pCO(2) can replace arterial pCO(2) in emergency patients using a bedside blood gas analyzer.

Methods

This is a cross-sectional study. We recruited patients who were deemed by the attending Emergency Physicians to require arterial blood gas analysis to determine their ventilation or acid-base status. A venous and an arterial blood gas sample were drawn from the patient, temporally as close to each other as possible. Both samples were then analyzed using the same bedside blood gas analyzer immediately after collection.

Results

There were 122 paired samples obtained. The strength of the association between arterial and venous pCO(2) is r = 0.838 (p = 0.001). The Bland-Altman bias plot methods for agreement show a mean difference of 3.3 mm Hg with two standard deviation limits of agreement being -17.4 to 23.9; 93.4% of the pCO(2) values fell within two standard deviation limits. Venous pCO(2) below 30 mm Hg had a 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] 90.5–100) sensitivity and 100% (95% CI 80.7–100) Negative predictive value to rule out hypercarbia, defined as arterial pCO(2) > 45 mm Hg.

Conclusions

There is significant variability in the arteriovenous difference of pCO(2) readings, hence, arterial punctures are still needed to specifically determine the arterial pCO(2).

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO INSTEAD

When a patient has suspected hypercarbic RF, hospitalists should obtain a VBG due to the ease, safety, and relative comfort of an VBG as compared to an ABG. Depending on the clinical case and pre‐test probability, hospitalists may proceed with treatment directed towards hypercarbic RF or obtain an ABG to confirm and quantify the hypercarbia. Hospitalists can rule out hypercarbic respiratory failure by finding a normal venous pH and PCO 2.

### Improving the validity of peripheral venous blood gas analysis as an estimate of arterial blood gas by correcting the venous values with SvO ₂ [^751e8034]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Peripheral venous blood gas (pVBG) analysis in replacement of arterial blood gas (ABG) is limited by the unpredictable differences between arterial and venous values, especially for PCO2 and pH (ΔPCO2 and ΔpH).

Objectives

We hypothesized that, using the theoretical relationship linking SvO2 and blood flow, we could diminish the effect of local circulatory conditions on ΔPCO2 and ΔpH and thereby increase pVBG validity.

Methods

This was a prospective cross-sectional study performed in emergency patients requiring a blood gas analysis in which ABG and pVBG were performed simultaneously. The data of 50 randomly selected patients (model group) were used for developing two equations to correct PvCO2 and pHv according to the peripheral SvO2 (SpvO2) level. The formulas derived were PvCO₂cor = PvCO₂ − 0.30 × (75 − SpvO₂), and pHvcor = pHv + 0.001 × (75 − SpvO₂). The validity of the corrected values was then tested on the remaining population (validation group).

Results

There were 281 patients included in the study, mainly for dyspnea. ΔPCO2 and ΔpH were strongly correlated with SpvO2 (r(2) = 0.62 and r(2) = 0.53, respectively, p < 0.001). Using the data of the model group, we developed equations that we applied on the validation group. We found that the corrected values were more valid than the raw values for detecting a PaCO2 > 45 mm Hg (AUC ROC = 0.96 ± 0.01 vs. 0.89 ± 0.02, p < 0.001), a PaCO2 < 35 mm Hg (AUC = 0.95 ± 0.02 vs. 0.84 ± 0.03, p < 0.001), a pHa < 7.35 (AUC = 0.97 ± 0.01 vs. 0.95 ± 0.02, p < 0.05), or a pHa > 7.45 (AUC = 0.91 ± 0.02 vs. 0.81 ± 0.04, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

The variability of ΔPCO2 and ΔpH is significantly lowered when the venous values are corrected according to the SpvO2 value, and pVBG is therefore more accurate and valid for detecting an arterial abnormality.

### Central venous oxygenation: when physiology explains apparent discrepancies [^6942ebd4]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The fundamental equilibrium

The sine qua non condition for adequate energy supply is that the circulatory system transports to each cell enough oxygen (O 2), nutrients, and chemicals to ensure their aerobic respiration. 'Adequate' means that, at any time, the difference (gap) between the expected metabolic needs minus the real O 2 consumption (VO 2) must not exceed energy storage. This basic equilibrium can be conveniently formulated as:

For any cell, tissue, and organ, VO 2 is the difference between arterial and venous O 2 flows. For the whole body, if we ignore the O 2 dissolved in the plasma water, which represents only a few percent of the total O 2 blood content, if we consider that arterial and venous blood flows are represented by the cardiac output (CO), and if we assume that arterial and venous blood flow have a similar hemoglobin concentration (Hb), then we can write:where VO₂ is in ml/minute.m², CO is in L/minute.m², Hb is in g/L, and arterial oxygen hemoglobin saturation (SaO₂) and SvO₂ are the ratios of arterial and venous oxygenated Hb over the total Hb per blood unit and, therefore, dimensionless percentages. The constant 1.34 is the carrying capacity of the oxygenated Hb in milliliters of O₂ per gram. This equation can be reformulated as a function of each variable, but its reformulation as a function of SvO 2 is one of the most popular because SvO 2 measurements are precise, accurate, time responsive and quite easy to monitor. Figure 1 shows that the relationships between SvO 2 and its components are not equivalent and not necessarily linear. As a consequence, a large change in one variable may be compensated by a small change in another - for example, small changes in low CO that are compensated for by large changes in SvO 2 and large changes in high CO that are compensated for by small changes in SvO 2:

### Agreement between mathematically arterialised venous versus arterial blood gas values in patients undergoing non-invasive ventilation: a cohort study [^c60d8ff9]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Blood gas analysis is important for assessment of ventilatory function. Traditionally, arterial analysis has been used. A method for mathematically arterialising venous blood gas values has been developed. Our aim was to validate this method in patients undergoing non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in an emergency department (ED).

Materials and Methods

This post hoc substudy of a prospective cohort study included adult patients undergoing NIV for acute respiratory compromise. When arterial blood gas analysis was required for clinical purposes, a venous sample was also drawn. Mathematically arterialised values were calculated independent of arterial values. Primary outcome of interest was agreement between mathematically arterialised venous and arterial values for pH and pCO2. Bland-Altman agreement plot analysis was used.

Results

Eighty sample-pairs (58 patients) were studied. Mean difference for arterial pH (actual-calculated) was 0.01pH units (95% limits of agreement: -0.04, 0.06). Mean difference for pCO2 (actual-calculated) was -0.06kPa (95% limits of agreement: -1.34, 1.22).

Conclusions

For patients undergoing NIV in an ED, agreement between mathematically arterialised venous values and arterial values was close for pH but only moderate for pCO2. Depending on clinician tolerance for agreement, this method may be a clinically useful alternative to arterial blood gas analysis in the ED.

Blood gas analysis — actions when contamination is suspected are as follows: if questionable results are obtained and are consistent with specimen contamination, the labeling of the blood sample container should be rechecked for the patient's full name, medical record number, or date of birth (patient identifier), date and time of acquisition, and measured FᵢO₂ (for supplemental oxygen flow); the residual specimen should be reanalyzed (preferably on a separate analyzer), assuming sufficient sample remains; an additional sample should be obtained if the discrepancy cannot be resolved; and results of analysis of discarded samples should be logged with reason for discarding.

### Comparison of mathematically arterialised venous blood gas sampling with arterial, capillary, and venous sampling in adult patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure: a single-centre longitudinal cohort study [^a012bd07]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Participants

From January 2019 to October 2020, we screened patients aged 18+ years who were admitted on an inpatient basis for home NIV assessment and due to undergo ABG sampling as part of their routine care. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) inability to provide informed consent, (2) clinical necessity to perform blood gas sampling prior to allowing sufficient time for informed consent and (3) inability to obtain reliable SpO 2 readings.

All measurements were undertaken during a single admission episode. Recruited patients underwent near simultaneous ABG, CBG and VBG sampling at day 0, and up to two further occasions (day 1 NIV and discharge) if NIV was indicated. Pulse oximetry was recorded at the exact point of sampling.

Participant experience of each type of blood sampling method was recorded using a standard visual/analogue pain score (scale 0–10).

Patient and public involvement

We did not include formal patient and public involvement in study design.

### Mixed venous blood gas sampling is not influenced by the speed of withdrawal in cardiac surgery patients [^875a846b]. Intensive Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether mixed venous blood gas sampling obtained by pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is influenced by the speed of withdrawal.

Design

Prospective, observational study.

Setting

Surgical intensive care unit at a university hospital.

Subjects

Twenty-five patients in the early postoperative period of cardiac surgery.

Measurements and Main Results

After verification of the adequate position of the PAC, measurements of mixed venous blood gas oxygen saturation, oxygen partial pressure (PO(2)), carbon dioxide partial pressure (PCO(2)), pH and bicarbonates were obtained at two different rates of withdrawal. A slow sampling was taken at a mean speed of 3 ml/min and a fast sampling at 18 ml/min for each patient. The mean difference in venous oxygen saturation between slow and fast samplings was -0.18 ± 1.3%, venous PO(2): -0.2 ± 1.3 mmHg, venous PCO(2): 0.1 ± 0.9 mmHg, venous pH: 0 ± 0.03, venous bicarbonates: 0.03 ± 0.5 mmol/l.

Conclusion

Using the Bland & Altman method, we showed a satisfactory agreement between slow and fast mixed venous blood gas sampling techniques when measuring PO(2), oxygen saturation, PCO(2), pH and bicarbonates though a PAC.

### Using venous blood gas analysis in the assessment of COPD exacerbations: a prospective cohort study [^e7b49e3d]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Exacerbations of COPD are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and our local figures reflect this. In 2010, there were 1343 admissions into Nottingham University Hospitals Trust. The management of COPD exacerbations depends upon quickly identifying acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. In this study, we set out to establish if ABG analysis obtained for the initial assessment of COPD exacerbations could be replaced by VBG analysis and pulse oximetry when assessing for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure.

We examined the agreement between ABG and VBG parameters and between ABG and pulse oximetry measurements of oxygen saturation in COPD exacerbations and found acceptable agreement for pH, and for SaO 2 at an SpO 2 > 80%. We found that 96% of patients with an ABG pH of < 7.35 also had a VBG pH of < 7.35 and that only two patients were misclassified as having a normal venous pH but a low arterial pH.

A meta-analysis of five studies examining the utility of peripheral VBG analyses in exacerbations of COPD in the emergency department found that there was agreement between arterial and venous pH and. The weighted average difference for pCO 2 was 0.79 kPa (n = 440), whereas those for pH andwere 0.028 and 1.34 mmol (n = 239), respectively. The relatively weaker relationship seen between SpO 2 and SaO 2 at lower levels is unsurprising as commercial pulse oximeters are more accurate at higher oxygen saturations and significantly less accurate below 80%. The proposed algorithm reflects this; any patient with an SpO 2 of < 80% needs an immediate ABG.

Our study has limitations. There was a small time gap between sample acquisition and processing, although results did not change significantly when this was factored in. We also had a pragmatic approach to sample collection which depended upon our junior doctors and specialist nurses; consequently, it was difficult to fully exclude mixed arterial/venous stabs which may explain why the sensitivities and specificities to predict an arterial pH of < 7.35 were not 100%. We stress in our algorithm that if there is a risk or actual clinical deterioration an arterial analysis should be performed.

### Comparison of mathematically arterialised venous blood gas sampling with arterial, capillary, and venous sampling in adult patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure: a single-centre longitudinal cohort study [^4c49de3d]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

It is important to acknowledge several limitations. First, the v-TAC calculation is based on a compensation for normal aerobic metabolism. The method assumes peripheral venous sampling is taken from a limb with a clearly recognisable pulse and a normal capillary response. It would not be suitable in clinical scenarios characterised by additional anaerobic metabolism at the tissue site. In the setting of haemodynamic instability or sepsis, for example, then arterial sampling is preferred. We also emphasise here that calculation of higher values of PO 2 via v-TAC is not as robust as for pH and PCO 2. For other patient cohorts, where O 2 evaluation is critical, then an arterial sample remains most appropriate.

Second, the single-centre nature of our study limits its generalisability. There are a growing number of single-centre studies that show successful application of the v-TAC method. These have served to establish the safety and reliability of the method and to refine the patient groups most likely to benefit. Ultimately, it could replace most, but not all, arterial samples for some patient groups. This would be quite a significant change in the patient pathway given that arterial sampling is the current gold standard. We believe that the available data support the introduction of v-TAC-directed pathways into clinical care, though would recommend that implementation should be assessed via service evaluation or further study.

One of the issues of comparing against a gold standard is in assuring the gold standard itself. Arterial sampling is subjected to known errors, and it would not be sensible to compare against a non-physiological sample. We considered significant venous admixture and sedimentation to be the two main preanalytical errors that might affect an ABG result. We used conservative criteria to exclude clear examples of preanalytical error, without excluding those with more equivocal changes. Using our criteria, we excluded 8/133 (6%) of presumed arterial samples on the grounds of venous contamination.

There is also inherent variability of sampling even when the sample is clearly arterial. As a pragmatic study, we accepted that patients were unlikely to be physiologically stable from a respiratory perspective at the time of sampling. We did not tend to use local anaesthesia for ABG sampling and recognise this as a weakness against national standardsthough not in comparison to usual practice in the UK. Transient hyperventilation or breath-holding around the time of blood sampling is commonand may affect ABG results; our post hoc analysis suggests that this may have been the case for up to 15% of ABG samples obtained.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^a847f43c]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Respiratory support — oxygen therapy during COPD exacerbations: Supplemental oxygen should be titrated to improve hypoxemia with a target saturation of 88–92%, and once oxygen is started, blood gases should be checked frequently, or as clinically indicated, to ensure satisfactory oxygenation without carbon dioxide retention and/or worsening acidosis. Pulse oximetry is not as accurate as arterial blood gas and may overestimate blood oxygen content among individuals with darker skin tones. Venous blood gas to assess bicarbonate levels and pH is accurate when compared with arterial blood gas assessment, but additional data are needed because most patients included had a pH > 7.30 on presentation and PCO2 levels were dissimilar when measured by venous compared to arterial samples. Venturi masks offer more accurate and controlled delivery of oxygen than nasal prongs.

### Changes in central venous to arterial carbon dioxide gap (PCOgap) in response to acute changes in ventilation [^1288bfac]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

The insertion of a central venous and arterial catheter is common practice for patient management in the intensive care setting, be it for monitoring, fluid and drug administration or blood sampling. Circulatory status of the patient can be assessed by calculation of various parameters using central venous and arterial blood gases, commonly ∆PCO 2. However, especially on assisted ventilation, acute changes in respiratory frequency and/or tidal volume can influence blood acid–base parameters. Previous studies have assessed the effects of circulatory changes on ∆PCO 2. This study is the first to assess the isolated effects of changes in ventilation on ∆PCO 2. The study has demonstrated that ∆PCO 2 responds rapidly to acute changes in ventilation, with these changes due to the influences of ventilation on arterial blood, which are observed without delay, in comparison to central venous blood.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: blood gas analysis and hemoximetry: 2013 [^7dde04b3]. Respiratory Care (2013). Medium credibility.

AARC clinical practice guideline — documentation and interpretation for blood gas analysis and hemoximetry specifies that the mode of ventilation, oxygen concentration, oxygen delivery device, and results of the pretest assessment should be documented and placed in the patient's medical record. The report of test results should contain a statement by the licensed medical professional performing the test regarding test quality, including patient understanding of directions and effort expended, and, if appropriate, which recommendations were not met. Test results should be interpreted by a physician or qualified medical professional, and there must be evidence of active review of quality control, proficiency testing, and physician alert or critical values commensurate with the number of tests performed. Blood gas pH analysis and hemoximetry are beneficial only if pre-analytical error has not occurred.

### Assessment of haemoglobin measurement by several methods-blood gas analyser, capillary and venous HemoCue, non-invasive spectrophotometry and laboratory assay-in term and preterm infants [^f87af168]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

A laboratory haematology analyser is the gold standard for measuring haemoglobin concentration but has disadvantages, especially in neonates. This study compared alternative blood-sparing and non-invasive methods of haemoglobin concentration measurement with the gold standard. Haemoglobin concentrations were measured using a laboratory haematology analyser (reference method), blood gas analyser, HemoCue ® using venous and capillary blood samples and a newly developed non-invasive sensor for neonates < 3 kg. A total of 63 measurements were performed. Body weight (2190 (1820–2520 [967–4450]) g) and haemoglobin concentration (12.3 (10.6–15.2 [8.2–20.5]) g.dl -1) varied widely. Bias/limits of agreement between the alternative methods and reference method were -0.1/-1.2 to 1.0 g.dl -1 (blood gas analyser), -0.4/-1.8 to 1.1 g.dl -1 (HemoCue, venous blood), 0.7/-1.9 to 3.2 g.dl -1 (HemoCue, capillary blood) and -1.2/-4.3 to 2 g.dl -1 (non-invasive haemoglobin measurement). Perfusion index, body weight and fetal haemoglobin concentration did not affect the accuracy of the alternative measurement methods, and these were successfully applied in term and preterm infants. However, the accuracies of non-invasive haemoglobin measurement and HemoCue of capillary blood especially lacked sufficient agreement with that of the reference method to recommend these methods for clinical decision making.

### Venous samples are a less-painful starting point for the… [^7fd9b136]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Question In patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is a venous blood sample as useful as an arterial sample. Bottom Line There is very good agreement between arterial and venous measurements of pH and bicarbonate, and fairly good agreement at higher levels between arterial and peripheral measures of oxygen saturation. These authors suggest an algorithm for patients with acute exacerbation of COPD that includes an arterial blood gas analysis only if the patient's initial pulse oximetry is less than 80% or if the venous pH is less than 7. 35, which would obviate the need for two-thirds of arterial blood gasses. A more conservative approach would also include an arterial blood gas analysis for patients with oxygen saturation between 80% and 84%, where there was also some misclassification. Synopsis Arterial blood draws are painful.

These British researchers asked, sensibly, whether we could get the same information from a venous blood sample. Specifically, can it identify patients with hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis who are at risk of respiratory failure and worse outcomes. This study included 234 patients hospitalized for an acute exacerbation of COPD. Patients had arterial and venous samples drawn, and the pain of each procedure was measured using a 10-point visual analog scale. The authors then evaluated the agreement between arterial and venous samples for pH, bicarbonate, and CO. 2, and between arterial oxygen saturation and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry. Overall, agreement was very good between arterial and venous measures of pH and bicarbonate. The venous CO.

Overall, the venous pH was 90% sensitive and 96% specific compared with arterial pH, correctly classifying 87% of patients. The median pain score was significantly higher for arterial samples, and arterial samples were more likely to require a second stick.

### Effects of time delay and body temperature on measurements of central venous oxygen saturation, venous-arterial blood carbon dioxide partial pressures difference, venous-arterial blood carbon dioxide partial pressures difference / arterial-venous oxygen difference ratio and lactate [^54626c0f]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO 2), venous-arterial blood carbon dioxide partial pressures difference (Pv-aCO 2), venous-arterial blood carbon dioxide partial pressures difference/arterial-venous oxygen difference ratio (Pv-aCO 2 /Ca-vO 2) and lactate are important parameters employed during shock resuscitation. We designed this study to confirm the effects of time delay and body temperature on measurements of these four parameters.

Methods

Arterial and central venous blood samples were simultaneously drawn by plastic syringes via indwelling intra-arterial and central venous catheters from critically ill patients. Blood gas analyses were performed on both samples and repeated after 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min. Patients were divided into a control group and a high temperature group according to whether the body temperature was greater than 38 °C.

Results

A total of 30 critically ill patients were enrolled. There was a trend of increasing values for ScvO 2, Pv-aCO 2, Pv-aCO 2 /Ca-vO 2 and lactate over time (P < 0.001). The ScvO 2 differences were all lower in high temperature group after 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min when compared to the corresponding differences in the control group (P < 0.05). The differences in lactate values were slightly higher in the high temperature group, relative to the control group after 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Measurements of ScvO 2, Pv-aCO 2, lactate and Pv-aCO 2 /Ca-vO 2 were affected by time delay or body temperature. We recommend that arterial and central venous blood gas samples be analyzed quickly within 10 min, especially for patients with body temperature < 38 °C.

### Trending peripheral venous PCOin patients with respiratory failure using mathematically arterialised venous blood gas samples [^614c1a55]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Background

Trending venous blood gases (VBGs) has been suggested as an alternative to arterial blood gases (ABGs) in patients with respiratory failure, but there are limits to its utility. The aim of this study was to compare the trending of venous carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO 2) (pCO 2 v) with mathematically arterialised pCO 2 (pCO 2 ca) and to further evaluate whether pCO 2 ca follows change in arterial pCO 2 (pCO 2 a) more accurately.

Methods

We analysed two data sets. The first was a retrospective study of patients with respiratory failure admitted to the intensive care unit. Venous samples were mathematically arterialised using the vTAC method. The change in pCO 2 between two consecutive samples (ΔpCO 2) for pCO 2 v was compared with the change in calculated pCO 2 ca values. In the second data set taken from previously published work, we analysed 82 trend points (difference between consecutive samples) for change in pCO 2. There were pCO 2 v, pCO 2 a and pCO 2 ca values for each trend point. The primary outcome measures were the 95% limits of agreement (LOAs) between different sampling methods for ΔpCO 2.

Results

In the first data set, 46 patients had 203 VBG results giving 157 trend points for ΔpCO 2 analysis. The 95% LOAs for ΔpCO 2 ca and ΔpCO 2 v were −9.28 to 11.12 mm Hg.

In the second data set, 95% LOAs for ΔpCO 2 were −9.46 to 9.48 mm Hg for ΔpCO 2 a and ΔpCO 2 v, −8.94 to 8.58 mm Hg for ΔpCO 2 ca and ΔpCO 2 v, and −4.54 to 4.91 mm Hg for ΔpCO 2 a and ΔpCO 2 ca.

Conclusion

This study suggests that trending pCO 2 v is not an accurate way to trend pCO 2 a in patients with respiratory failure. ΔpCO 2 ca via vTAC trended differently to ΔpCO 2 v. Our data suggest pCO 2 ca more accurately trends pCO 2 a.

Conclusions

Measurements of ScvO 2, Pv-aCO 2, lactate and Pv-aCO 2 /Ca-vO 2 were affected by time delay or body temperature. We recommend that arterial and central venous blood gas samples be analyzed quickly within 10min, especially for patients with body temperature < 38°C.

### Relationship between central and peripheral venous oxygen saturation and lactate levels: a prospective study [^1b0c8c7d]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Optimization of tissue oxygen delivery to meet consumption demands is important in the resuscitation of critically ill patients. Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) and lactate levels are often used to guide resuscitation; however, invasive monitoring is required for the former. Clinicians searching for less invasive alternatives may consider using peripheral venous oxygen saturation (SpvO2) and lactate levels as a substitute.

Objectives

To determine the relationship between SpvO2 and ScvO2 and peripheral and central lactate levels.

Methods

All patients with a central venous catheter in an academic emergency department and intensive care unit were eligible for the study. Blood was obtained simultaneously from a central and peripheral vein and measured for oxygen saturation and lactate levels. Results were analyzed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), Bland-Altman plots, and receiver operating characteristic curves.

Results

Seventy-nine paired blood samples were analyzed. SpvO2 and ScvO2 have moderate agreement: ICC = 0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35–0.67). A Bland-Altman plot revealed substantial bias (-4.47; limits of agreement -38.6, 29.6). SpvO2 ≥ 85% was 90% specific for ScvO2 ≥ 70%, and SpvO2 of ≤ 55% had a 94% sensitivity for ScvO2 < 70%. Central and peripheral venous lactate levels showed almost perfect agreement: ICC = 0.92 (95% CI 0.87–0.95), bias of 0.46 (limits of agreement -1.78–2.70).

Conclusion

SpvO2 and ScvO2 have moderate agreement. There was excellent agreement between peripheral and central lactate levels, making them interchangeable. The clinical implications of these substitutions in real-time patient management require further study.

### Appropriate timing of blood sampling for blood gas analysis in the ventilated rabbit [^9d37836c]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Arterial and venous blood gas analyses (BGAs) are essential to evaluate devices that measure biological oxygenation. The appropriate timing of blood sampling for BGA after respiratory rate (RR) change in animal experiments has not been reported. This study investigated the appropriate timing of blood sampling for BGA in ventilated rabbits and whether venous samples are an alternative to arterial samples.

Materials and Methods

Under general anesthesia, 14 rabbits (body weight, 3.02 ± 0.09 kg) were ventilated and their RR was changed (40/min, 30/min, and 20/min). Blood was sampled through cervical arterial and venous catheters. Experiment 1: in seven rabbits, arterial BGA was measured at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min after the RR change. Experiment 2: in seven different rabbits, simultaneous arterial and venous BGA were measured at 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min after the RR change.

Results

Oxygen partial pressure (PO 2) and saturation (SO 2) of the arterial blood stabilized 0.5 min after the RR changed. In venous BGA, no index stabilized during observation. The arterial and venous values of the carbon dioxide partial pressure (PCO 2) and pH had significant correlations (arterial PCO 2 = 0.9316 × venous PCO 2–4.4425 [r = 0.9178]; arterial pH = 1.0835 × venous pH-0.5795 [r = 0.9453]).

Conclusions

In ventilated rabbits, arterial PO 2 and SO 2 stabilized in 0.5 min. No venous value stabilized after the RR change. Only the PCO 2 and pH of venous samples may be an alternative to arterial samples under the defined formula.

### Comparison of mathematically arterialised venous blood gas sampling with arterial, capillary, and venous sampling in adult patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure: a single-centre longitudinal cohort study [^c457ea7e]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Prior studies confirm that v-TAC shows close agreement with ABG for pH and PCO 2 at all ranges, though its clinical application is not established. The v-TAC method also shows close agreement with ABG for PO 2 up to 10 kPa, though not for higher oxygen levels. This is because of the nature of the oxygen dissociation curve. The commercial version of the software, therefore, reports PO 2 up to 10 kPa. The primary aim of our study was to compare ABG sampling against VBG, v-TAC and CBG sampling in the longitudinal assessment of inpatients with suspected hypercapnic respiratory failure and considered for treatment with NIV.

While ABG sampling is the recognised gold standard, our study data also provided a means to explore this further as a secondary aim. There is emerging evidence that intermittent ABG sampling can lack precision due to transient changes in the breathing pattern of the patient. A recent study of invasively ventilated adult subjects showed that arterial blood pH and CO 2 values change rapidly in response to a transient increase (+100%) or decrease (−60%) in ventilation, whereas peripheral venous samples change little in the first 60 s. It is well recognised that the anticipatory fear of pain just before an ABG can cause hyperventilation or breath-holding. Data are lacking on the prevalence or impact. It was postulated recently that the v-TAC conversion from venous blood could mitigate the acute changes in the arterial baseline induced by a transient change in breathing pattern. We, therefore, conducted a post hoc analysis of our data set to consider the potential effect of transient changes in breathing pattern.

### Trending peripheral venous PCOin patients with respiratory failure using mathematically arterialised venous blood gas samples [^2ecdfb32]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Peripheral saturations obtained were as close to the time of documented sampling as possible. Given the first set of data is retrospective, it is possible the actual saturation at the time of sampling may be different to that recorded. Previous assessments of an adequately 'well perfused limb' for the measurement of peripheral saturations for the purpose of calculating arterialised values from venous samples required a clearly recognisable pulse and a normal capillary response. We cannot confirm this retrospectively, but few patients had any concern for shock described in their clinical notes. Another study of pCO 2 ca using routinely available blood samples found results in line with experimentally controlled conditions, despite no attempt to ensure reasonable peripheral perfusion beyond routine clinical practice.

We did not correct for the use of multiple data points from individual patients but do not believe there was any difference in the within and between patient variance that altered the LOA. Data using the first observation from each patient only had essentially identical SDs to those used for the presented LOA, and there was no significant within/between groups difference in variance on one-way analysis of variance. A non-parametric presentation of results is also included in table 1.

Central venous saturations were unlikely to have featured significantly in this patient population. Delay in time from VBG sampling to blood gas analysis may well have occurred, but up to 15 min delay has shown no significant change in calculated values. While bubbles in VBG sampling tubes can affect values, there is no reason to believe our sample does not represent everyday clinical practice.

### Utility of venous blood gases for the assessment of traumatic shock: a prospective observational study [^2bbf4d79]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

ABG samples are often obtained in trauma patients to assess shock severity. Venous blood gas (VBG) sampling, which is less invasive, has been widely used to assess other forms of shock. The study aim was to determine the agreement between VBG and ABG measurements in trauma.

Methods

Patients were enrolled at an Australian trauma centre between October 2016 and October 2018. Bland-Altman limits of agreement (LOA) between paired blood gas samples taken < 30min apart were used to quantify the extent of agreement. The impact of using only VBG measurements was considered using an a priori plan. Cases where venous sampling failed to detect 'concerning levels' were flagged using evidence-based cut-offs: pH ≤ 7.2, base deficit (BD) ≤ -6, bicarbonate < 21and lactate ≥ 4. Case summaries of these patients were assessed by independent trauma clinicians as to whether an ABG would change expected management.

Results

During the study period 176 major trauma patients had valid paired blood gas samples available for analysis. The median time difference between paired measurements was 11min (IQR 6–17). There was a predominance of men (81.8%) and blunt trauma (92.0%). Median Injury Severity Score was 13 (range 1–75) and inpatient mortality was 6.3%. Mean difference (ABG-VBG) and LOA between paired arterial and venous measurements were 0.036 (LOA -0.048 to 0.120) for pH, -1.27mmol/L (LOA -4.35 to 1.81) for BD, -0.64mmol/L (LOA -1.86 to 0.57) for lactate and -1.97mmol/L (LOA -5.49 to 1.55) for bicarbonate. Independent assessment of the VBG 'false negative' cases (n = 20) suggested an ABG would change circulatory management in two cases.

Conclusions

In trauma patients VBG and ABG parameters displayed suboptimal agreement. However, in cases flagged as VBG 'false negative' independent review indicated that the availability of an ABG was unlikely to change management.

### Comparison of mathematically arterialised venous blood gas sampling with arterial, capillary, and venous sampling in adult patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure: a single-centre longitudinal cohort study [^cb8f0f7a]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

ABG sampling is a common test for patients admitted to hospital with acute respiratory problems. National audits, however, have repeatedly shown important deficiencies in care associated with delayed or missed blood gas sampling. A National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death study showed that there was a delay in starting NIV for 27% of patients assessed. Failure to recognise respiratory failure due to a lack of blood gas testing was the most common reason for treatment delay.

In this study, patients with known or suspected hypercapnic respiratory failure underwent serial blood gas monitoring during treatment with NIV. We assessed v-TAC, a novel method of mathematically arterialised venous blood gas sampling, against arterial, capillary and venous blood gas sampling. We found that the v-TAC method showed close agreement with arterial PaCO 2 and pH results, the key physiological variables used to guide treatment with NIV. In addition, the v-TAC method showed good agreement with arterial for PO 2 values up to 10 kPa. In contrast, average bias in PCO 2 was −0.75 kPa for capillary sampling (reading lower than arterial) and +1 kPa for VBG sampling (reading higher than arterial). CIs were wider for CBG and VBG compared with v-TAC, further reducing their reliability as surrogates for arterial sampling.

An important aspect of this study was to follow patients longitudinally after starting treatment with NIV. While guidelines recommend repeated ABG sampling to assess NIV response, CBG or VBG is often used in clinical practice because of their greater convenience. We found that v-TAC tracked well with ABG sampling, whereas VBG and CBG sampling did not, introducing a bias and wider variation compared with ABG. CBG measurements functioned worst of all, with only 61% of samples matching the same categorical change in ABG in response to NIV.

We also found that arterial sampling was the most painful with its median score (4) reaching the moderate pain category. If considered alongside the relatively low first-time success rate (67%), this reinforces guideline recommendations to use local anaesthesia. Capillary sampling, while not painful in comparison, showed lower sampling overall success rates.

### Correlation of central venous and arterial blood gas measurements in mechanically ventilated trauma patients… [^acddb4f1]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Correlation between central venous and arterial blood gas values for PCO2, pH, and base excess. Middle diagonal line represents the "best fit" linear regression line with 95% confidence interval lines on both sides. Linear regression equation is shown in the top left corner. Bland-Altman bias plots of central venous and arterial blood gas values for PCO2, pH, and base excess. Solid horizontal line indicates mean difference; shaded area, 95% limits of agreement; and diagonal line, regression line. All 3 plots demonstrate that the difference tended to decrease as the average values increased. Previous studies have examined the relationship between arterial, venous, and capillary blood gas samples. 2, 4–8 Even though arterial, venous, and capillary blood gas PCO2 values correlate statistically, the venous values are generally 6 mm Hg greater than the arterial values.

4, 8 This difference may be clinically significant and alter the management of a patient's ventilator settings. Because of this, the arterial PCO2 value is currently the gold standard for managing a patient's ventilation settings and requires that an ABG sample be drawn. 2, 4, 5. The 95% LOAs between central venous and arterial PCO2 were −2. 2 to
10. 9 mm Hg. Consequently, if a central venous PCO2 value were to be obtained, there would be a 95% chance that the arterial value would be between 2. 2 mm Hg higher and
10. 9 mm Hg lower than the measured central venous value. Nonetheless, in general, one can be 95% confident that the arterial value will not be more than 0. 03 lower than the central venous value, which would allow patients with a significant acidosis to be reliably identified. Before the development of modern blood gas analyzers, the venous PCO2 was calculated by using the measured venous pH and total CO2 content and the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Using this method, Brooks and Wynn5 discovered that "arterialized" venous values for PCO2 and pH were not significantly different from arterial values.

### Reliability of central venous blood gas values compared with arterial blood gas values in critically ill patients [^37b41437]. Respiratory Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Central venous blood gas (cVBG) values are correlated with arterial blood gas (ABG) values. However, the substitution of cVBG values for ABG values in critically ill patients remains uninvestigated. Thus, we investigated the reliability between cVBG and ABG values and sought to define the conditions that could improve the reliability of cVBG values as a substitute.

Methods

We conducted a prospective comparison of 292 sets of cVBG values and ABG values from 82 subjects admitted to the medical ICU between October 2017-July 2018. Paired cVBG and ABG samples were collected daily during the first 5 d of ICU treatment and on days 8, 15, 22, and 29. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman limits of agreement (LOA) were obtained.

Results

The ICC between ABG and cVBG was 0.626 for pH, 0.696 for P CO2, 0.869 for bicarbonate, 0.866 for base excess, and 0.989 for lactic acid. Bland-Altman plots showed clinically unacceptable LOA between all parameters. Subgroup analysis indicated a significant increase in the ICCs of P CO2 in samples with mechanical ventilation (0.0574–0.735, P = 0.02) and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO 2) ≥ 70% (0.611–0.763, P = 0.008). After adjustment, the 95% LOA between ABG and cVBG was -0.06 to 0.07 for pH and -7.09 to 7.05 for P CO2 in mechanically ventilated subjects with ScvO 2 ≥ 70%.

Conclusions

ABG and cVBG values showed clinically acceptable agreements and improved reliability in mechanically ventilated subjects with ScvO 2 ≥ 70%. cVBG analysis may be a substitute for ABG analysis in mechanically ventilated patients once tissue perfusion is restored.

### 40th international symposium on intensive care&emergency medicine 2020-part 2: e-ISICEM 2020 15–18 September 2020 [^77f5bef2]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Results:

The number of currently included ICU patients (nine) does not meet a sufficient sample size for statistics. However, preliminary results tend towards the results of the normal values; Except lactate, all normal values remain stable throughout a two-hour test period without any differences compared to controls (un-paired Mann-Whitney U-test; all p > 0.05). Apart from pO2, there are minor clinically irrelevant effects of cooling (paired Mann-Whitney U-test, n = 70; all p < 0.001). In the case of lactate, cooling delays an otherwise instantly increase for one hour and also slows down the progression (paired Mann-Whitney U-test; p < 0.001).

Conclusions:

Preliminary results of stored abnormal venous blood gas values reflect the trends of normal values. Except for lactate, normal venous blood gas values remain stable throughout two hours.

### The role of pre-hospital blood gas analysis in trauma resuscitation [^d7047b2d]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

There are numerous studies with different focuses on pre-hospital blood gas analysis in patients undergoing out of hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation or during emergency transport. In addition, there are several studies about predictive value of lactate, pH and BE in severely injured trauma patients, but the measurements are all made after admission to a hospital. In an Austrian prospective study about small-volume resuscitation, repeated measurements of venous blood electrolytes, haemoglobin and white cell count were performed, but arterial blood-gas values were not measured. This study attempts to obtain more information about pre-hospital arterial blood-gas analysis and shock resuscitation of severely injured trauma patients.

Blood lactate levels have been shown to correlate with injury severity as well as the overall prognosis of the severely injured patient. Kaplan et al. were able to show among 282 patients with a major vascular injury, that initial emergency department acid-base variables (pH, base deficit, lactate, anion gap, apparent strong ion difference and strong ion gap) were able to discriminate survivors from non-survivors. Sindert et al. published recently a large study with 489 trauma patients, where they were testing the diagnostic utility of Base Deficit (BD) measurements at triage and four hours later, in distinguishing minor from major injury. They wanted to test, if infusion of chloride-rich solution, such as normal saline (NS), confuses the results. Even infusion of more than 2000 mL of normal saline didn't confound the prognostic value of BD.

### Central venous pressure: a useful but not so simple measurement [^0cbfb3d2]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the clinical use of central venous pressure measurements.

Data Sources

The Medline database, biographies of selected articles, and the author's personal database.

Data Synthesis

Four basic principles must be considered. Pressure measurements with fluid-filled systems are made relative to an arbitrary reference point. The pressure that is important for preload of the heart is the transmural pressure, whereas the pressure relative to atmosphere still affects other vascular beds outside the thorax. The central venous pressure is dependent upon the interaction of cardiac function and return function. There is a plateau to the cardiac function curve, and once it is reached, further volume loading will not increase cardiac output.

Conclusions

If careful attention is paid to proper measurement techniques, central venous pressure can be very useful clinically. However, the physiologic or pathophysiological significance of the central venous pressure should be considered only with a corresponding measurement of cardiac output or at least a surrogate measure of cardiac output.

### Evaluation of a method for converting venous values of acid-base and oxygenation status to arterial values [^12f0eed3]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

This paper evaluates a method in which arterial values of pH, carbon dioxide tension (Pco(2)) and oxygen tension (Po(2)) calculated from venous values and pulse oximetry are compared with simultaneously measured arterial values.

Methods

103 adult patients from three departments (pulmonary medicine, thoracic intensive care and multidisciplinary intensive care) were studied. The patients belonged to three groups: (1) 31 haemodynamically stable patients with a diagnosis of chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD); (2) 49 haemodynamically stable patients without COLD; and (3) 23 haemodynamically unstable patients without COLD. Arterial and venous (peripheral and, where possible, central and mixed) blood samples were taken simultaneously and anaerobically. Peripheral arterial oxygen saturation was measured with a pulse oximeter. The principle of the method is to simulate the transport of venous blood back through the tissues using the respiratory quotient (adding oxygen and removing carbon dioxide) until simulated arterial oxygenation matches that measured by pulse oximetry.

Results

Calculated values of arterial pH and Pco(2) had very small bias and standard deviations regardless of the venous sampling site. In all cases these errors were within those considered acceptable for the performance of laboratory equipment, and well within the limits of error acceptable in clinical practice. In addition, the standard deviation (SD) of calculated values of pH and Pco(2) was similar to the variability between consecutive arterial samples. For peripheral oxygen saturation values ≤ 96%, the method can calculate Po(2) with an SD of 0.93, which may be useful in clinical practice. Calculations made from peripheral venous blood were significantly more accurate than those from central venous blood.

Conclusion

Arterial pH and Pco(2) can be calculated precisely from peripheral venous blood in a broad patient population. The method has potential for use as a screening tool in emergency medical departments and in medical and surgical wards to assess a patient's acid-base and oxygenation status prior to sampling arterial blood or to help in the decision to refer the patient to the ICU. In departments where arterial blood gas values are used to monitor patients (eg, pulmonary medicine), the method might reduce the number of arterial samples taken by replacing them with peripheral venous blood samples, thus reducing the need for painful arterial punctures.

### Comparison of mathematically arterialised venous blood gas sampling with arterial, capillary, and venous sampling in adult patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure: a single-centre longitudinal cohort study [^ce19f8f3]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Figure 3
Arterial PCO 2 changes due to NIV compared with the changes seen for VBG (column A), v-TAC (column B), and CBG (column C). Categorical agreement (for example, a reduction in PCO 2 in both comparators) was 86% for VBG, 91% for v-TAC, and 61% for CBG. R² values were highest for v-TAC (0.61). CBG, capillary blood gas; VBG, venous blood gas; v-TAC, venous to arterial conversion.

We then considered the potential impact of unstable ventilation around the time of ABG sampling. We defined relative hyperventilation and hypoventilation as follows:

Hyperventilation: pHa-pHv ≥ 0.09 and PCO2a-PCO2v ≤ −1.5 kPa.

Hypoventilation: pHa-pHv ≤ −0.01 and PCO2a – PCO2v ≥ 0.1 kPa.

Using these criteria, we found evidence of hyperventilation for 8/119 paired samples, and hypoventilation for 10/119 paired samples (ie, total affected = 18/119 (15%) samples).

### Heparin concentration in evacuated tubes and its effect on pH, ionized calcium, lactate, and potassium in venous blood gas analysis [^ca972cce]. Laboratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Arterial blood specimens collected in evacuated tubes are unacceptable for blood gas analysis. However, evacuated tubes are routinely used for venous blood-gas analysis. The impact of the blood to heparin ratio on venous blood in evacuated tubes is unclear. Venous blood was drawn into lithium and sodium heparin evacuated tubes that were 1/3 full, ½ full, 2/3 full, and fully filled. Specimens were analyzed for pH, ionized calcium (iCa), lactate, and potassium on a blood-gas analyzer. The results for specimens filled only 1/3 full for lithium and sodium heparin tubes revealed a significant increase in pH and a significant decrease in the iCa. Underfilling the lithium and sodium heparin evacuated tubes did not significantly impact the lactate or potassium results. Venous whole-blood specimens should be filled to at least 2/3 full for accurate pH and iCa results.

### Extracorporeal gas exchange: when to start and how to end? [^067601fa]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

The second feature is the amount of blood flow and gas flow used to ventilate the artificial lung: to oxygenate venous blood entering the membrane lung, the gas flow required equals the oxygen sufficient to fully saturate the hemoglobin passing through the artificial lung. As an example, if 1 l of venous blood with10 g/dL of hemoglobin and saturation 70% enters the membrane lung every minute, a transfer of 42 mL of 100% oxygen per minute from the gas compartment of the membrane lung would be sufficient to fully saturate the blood leaving the membrane lung. Therefore, being the possibility to "charge" oxygen limited by the hemoglobin concentration and its saturation in the venous blood, the oxygen transfer to the membrane lung is primarily function of the extracorporeal blood flow. In the previous example, 4 l of extracorporeal blood flow, in the absence of re-circulation, would provide fully saturated blood with a gas flow into the membrane lung of only 168 ml/min. All the gas is absorbed, and no gas leaves the membrane lung

### Comparison of mathematically arterialised venous blood gas sampling with arterial, capillary, and venous sampling in adult patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure: a single-centre longitudinal cohort study [^26e17be2]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Background

Accurate arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis is essential in the management of patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure, but repeated sampling requires technical expertise and is painful. Missed sampling is common and has a negative impact on patient care. A newer venous to arterial conversion method (v-TAC, Roche) uses mathematical models of acid-base chemistry, a venous blood gas sample and peripheral blood oxygen saturation to calculate arterial acid-base status. It has the potential to replace routine ABG sampling for selected patient cohorts. The aim of this study was to compare v-TAC with ABG, capillary and venous sampling in a patient cohort referred to start non-invasive ventilation (NIV).

Methods

Recruited patients underwent near simultaneous ABG, capillary blood gas (CBG) and venous blood gas (VBG) sampling at day 0, and up to two further occasions (day 1 NIV and discharge). The primary outcome was the reliability of v-TAC sampling compared with ABG, via Bland-Altman analysis, to identify respiratory failure (via PaCO 2) and to detect changes in PaCO 2 in response to NIV. Secondary outcomes included agreements with pH, sampling success rates and pain.

Results

The agreement between ABG and v-TAC/venous PaCO 2 was assessed for 119 matched sampling episodes and 105 between ABG and CBG. Close agreement was shown for v-TAC (mean difference (SD) 0.01 (0.5) kPa), but not for CBG (-0.75 (0.69) kPa) or VBG (+1.00 (0.90) kPa). Longitudinal data for 32 patients started on NIV showed the closest agreement for ABG and v-TAC (R² = 0.61). v-TAC sampling had the highest first-time success rate (88%) and was less painful than arterial (p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

Mathematical arterialisation of venous samples was easier to obtain and less painful than ABG sampling. Results showed close agreement for PaCO2 and pH and tracked well longitudinally such that the v-TAC method could replace routine ABG testing to recognise and monitor patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure.
