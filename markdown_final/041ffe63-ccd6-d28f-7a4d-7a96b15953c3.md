## Question

Treatment for otitis external in 17 yo old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment for acute otitis externa in a 17-year-old. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should assess pain and plan analgesia. Next, I will evaluate modifying factors like tympanic membrane status, diabetes, and immunocompromise. After that, I will select topical therapy and address delivery issues such as edema or debris. I should also decide when, if ever, to add systemic antibiotics. Finally, I will set expectations for follow-up, prevention, and what to do if there is no improvement within 48–72 hours [^8bc30361].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to conclusions, because diffuse AOE must be distinguished from focal furunculosis, otomycosis, contact dermatitis, herpes zoster oticus, and referred otalgia; the classic finding is tenderness with tragal or pinna movement and diffuse canal edema/erythema, and I should verify that the tympanic membrane is intact or nonintact before choosing drops, as this will change management [^955a20fb] [^e4e06b8f] [^59d21c16].

> I need to check pain severity next, since pain is the dominant symptom and warrants proactive analgesia; NSAIDs are reasonable first-line for mild to moderate pain, with acetaminophen as an alternative, and I should escalate to a short opioid-acetaminophen combination if pain is severe, while avoiding topical anesthetics if the tympanic membrane status is uncertain because of safety concerns and lack of FDA approval for middle ear exposure [^2212c3ca] [^3e4f098c].

> Hold on, I should verify modifying factors before prescribing anything topical; if the tympanic membrane is perforated or a tympanostomy tube is present, I must choose a non-ototoxic quinolone drop and avoid alcohol or low-pH preparations, whereas if the membrane is intact, a broader range of topical agents is acceptable; I also need to screen for diabetes, immunocompromise, prior head/neck radiotherapy, and inability to deliver topical therapy, because these factors can push me toward systemic therapy or altered delivery strategies [^e999f581] [^7cd32554] [^4f84b429] [^8bde4d29].

> Next, I should review first-line therapy; for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE, topical therapy is the initial treatment of choice and systemic antibiotics should not be prescribed upfront, as they do not improve outcomes and increase adverse effects; I can select among quinolone drops, aminoglycoside-containing combinations, polymyxin B combinations, or acetic acid, and there is no consistent superiority among classes, so I should tailor to cost, adherence, tympanic membrane status, and patient preference [^bb9cfda4] [^d5cf12a6] [^61f1f904] [^45aa076f].

> Wait, let me verify the role of topical corticosteroids; adding a steroid to a topical antibiotic can hasten pain relief and reduce inflammation, and a recent RCT suggested faster otalgia resolution with ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone versus monotherapy, though superiority on the primary endpoint was not demonstrated; practically, I favor a quinolone–steroid combination when pain and edema are prominent and the tympanic membrane is intact, and I will avoid steroid-only drops given limited evidence [^020ef296] [^8c7c6078] [^2086b726].

> I will now examine delivery optimization; if the canal is edematous or filled with debris, drops may not penetrate, so I should perform aural toilet and consider placing an ear wick to maintain medication contact, instructing the patient on proper administration technique and keeping the ear dry; I should double-check that the wick is not removed prematurely and that drops are continued for at least 7 days, extending to 14 days if symptoms persist, with reassessment if there is no improvement by 48–72 hours [^d96cfe34] [^cb2a1fc8] [^a8f07851] [^82ed433d].

> But wait, what if there is extension beyond the canal or the patient has diabetes or is immunocompromised; in those scenarios, I should add systemic therapy active against Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus aureus, typically a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin, while continuing topical therapy and arranging close follow-up; I need to ensure I do not substitute systemic therapy for topical therapy when the disease is uncomplicated and localized [^d5cf12a6] [^8bde4d29].

> I should confirm follow-up expectations; most patients improve within 48–72 hours of appropriate topical therapy, so if there is no improvement by then, I need to reassess the diagnosis, adherence, and delivery, consider culture if atypical or refractory, and evaluate for alternative pathology such as fungal infection, contact dermatitis, or malignant otitis externa; if symptoms persist beyond 2 weeks, I should treat this as treatment failure and pivot to alternative management [^8bc30361] [^7013c02a] [^ea24514f].

> Let me consider prevention and patient education; I need to advise keeping the ear dry for 7–10 days, using a coated cotton ball for showers, avoiding canal instrumentation, and considering prophylactic acetic acid drops after swimming once the acute episode resolves; I should also counsel on recognizing recurrence and when to seek care promptly to avoid chronicity [^c7241823] [^87acaa1b].

> Putting this together for a typical 17-year-old with diffuse, uncomplicated AOE and an intact tympanic membrane, I would prescribe a topical quinolone–steroid combination such as ciprofloxacin 0.3% with fluocinolone 0.025% twice daily for 7 days, provide NSAIDs for pain, ensure the canal is patent or place a wick if edema is marked, and arrange follow-up in 48–72 hours if not improving; I would avoid oral antibiotics unless there is extension beyond the canal or modifying host factors, and I would switch to a non-ototoxic quinolone if a perforation or tube is discovered [^020ef296] [^d5cf12a6] [^d96cfe34] [^e999f581].

---

For a 17-year-old with acute otitis externa, **topical therapy is first-line** [^bb9cfda4] (quinolone or aminoglycoside ± steroid) for 7–10 days [^27e2548e], with **analgesia as needed** [^2212c3ca]. Use **non-ototoxic drops** if the tympanic membrane is perforated or a tube is present [^7cd32554] [^e999f581]. Avoid routine oral antibiotics unless there is extension beyond the canal or the patient is immunocompromised [^d5cf12a6] [^637a520e]. If the canal is edematous, place a wick and perform aural toilet to ensure drop delivery [^d96cfe34] [^cb2a1fc8]. Reassess at 48–72 hours if no improvement [^8bc30361] [^7013c02a].

---

## Clinical assessment and diagnosis

- **History**: Recent swimming, trauma, hearing aid use, or skin conditions; assess pain severity and systemic symptoms [^59d21c16].

- **Examination**: Otoscopy reveals erythema, edema, and debris; tragal tenderness supports AOE [^bb15ddd3].

- **Differentiation**: Exclude otitis media, furunculosis, herpes zoster oticus, and contact dermatitis [^955a20fb].

---

## First-line treatment: topical therapy

Topical therapy is **first-line** because it achieves high local concentrations with minimal systemic absorption [^45aa076f].

| **Topical agent** | **Examples** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|
| Quinolone antibiotics | - Ciprofloxacin 0.3% <br/> - Ofloxacin 0.3% | - Non-ototoxic <br/> - Safe with perforated TM <br/> - Effective against Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus [^e999f581] [^fcc711ce] |
| Aminoglycoside combinations | - Neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone | - Effective but ototoxic; avoid if TM perforated [^e999f581] |
| Acetic acid 2% | - Acetic acid 2% | - Effective for mild cases; less effective if treatment extends beyond 1 week [^2086b726] |

---

Duration is **7–10 days** [^27e2548e]; extend to 14 days if symptoms persist [^82ed433d].

---

## Adjunctive measures

- **Analgesia**: NSAIDs or acetaminophen; opioids for severe pain [^3e4f098c].

- **Aural toilet**: Remove debris to improve penetration [^d96cfe34].

- **Wick placement**: Use if edema obstructs the canal; keeps the canal open and delivers medication [^cb2a1fc8].

- **Water precautions**: Keep the ear dry during treatment [^c7241823].

---

## Indications for systemic antibiotics

Systemic antibiotics are **not first-line** unless:

- **Extension**: Cellulitis beyond the canal or systemic symptoms [^d5cf12a6].

- **Host factors**: Diabetes, immunocompromise, or inability to deliver topical therapy [^8bde4d29].

- **Failure**: No improvement after 48–72 hours of appropriate topical therapy [^8bc30361].

If needed, use an oral agent active against Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin [^8bde4d29].

---

## Special considerations

In cases of a **perforated tympanic membrane** or tympanostomy tube, use non-ototoxic quinolone drops and avoid aminoglycosides or alcohol-containing preparations [^7cd32554] [^e999f581]. For **chronic or recurrent cases**, evaluate for underlying dermatologic conditions, allergies, or anatomical abnormalities and consider ENT referral [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Reassess at **48–72 hours** if there is no improvement to confirm the diagnosis, assess adherence, and exclude other causes [^8bc30361] [^7013c02a]. Most patients improve within 48–72 hours, with complete resolution in 7–10 days [^82ed433d].

---

## Patient education and prevention

Prevention focuses on **keeping the ear dry**, avoiding trauma, and using acetic acid drops after swimming [^87acaa1b]. Educate on proper drop administration and adherence to the full course [^a8f07851] [^b337486a].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Topical therapy**: First-line for 7–10 days [^bb9cfda4] [^27e2548e].

- **Analgesia**: Use NSAIDs or acetaminophen; opioids for severe pain [^3e4f098c].

- **Aural toilet and wick**: Use if edema obstructs the canal [^d96cfe34] [^cb2a1fc8].

- **Systemic antibiotics**: Only if extension, host factors, or failure of topical therapy [^d5cf12a6] [^637a520e].

- **Follow-up**: Reassess at 48–72 hours if no improvement [^8bc30361] [^7013c02a].

---

Topical therapy with analgesia and canal care is the **cornerstone of care** for a 17-year-old with AOE; reserve systemic antibiotics for specific indications and reassess promptly if there is no improvement.

Objective

This clinical practice guideline is an update and replacement for an earlier guideline published in 2006 by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. This update provides evidence-based recommendations to manage acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as diffuse inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The variations in management of AOE and the importance of accurate diagnosis suggest a need for updating the clinical practice guideline. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is clinical resolution of AOE.

Purpose

The primary purpose of the original guideline was to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials for AOE and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is needed because of new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group. The target patient is aged 2 years or older with diffuse AOE. Differential diagnosis will be discussed, but recommendations for management will be limited to diffuse AOE, which is almost exclusively a bacterial infection. This guideline is intended for primary care and specialist clinicians, including otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, pediatricians, family physicians, emergency physicians, internists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. This guideline is applicable in any setting in which patients with diffuse AOE would be identified, monitored, or managed.

Action Statements

The development group made strong recommendations that (1) clinicians should assess patients with AOE for pain and recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain and (2) clinicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The development group made recommendations that (1) clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal; (2) clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); (3) clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; (4) clinicians should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed; (5) clinicians should prescribe a non-ototoxic preparation when the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube; and (6) clinicians should reassess the patient who fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) outcome assessment — STATEMENT 8: The clinician should reassess the patient who fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. Recommendation based on observational studies and a preponderance of benefit over harm. Action statement profile notes Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, Level of confidence in evidence: Medium, Policy level: Recommendation, Exceptions: None, and Intentional vagueness: Time frame of 48 to 72 hours is specified since there are no data to substantiate a more precise estimate of time to improvement. Appropriate treatment of uncomplicated AOE should be followed by symptom improvement within 48 to 72 hours, although symptom resolution may take up to 2 weeks in some cases; patient-reported ear pain generally decreases after 1 day of treatment and most pain resolves within 4 to 7 days; a Cochrane review recommended follow-up in 2 weeks if any symptoms persist, while diary data showed most patients show rapid improvement within 72 hours even if complete resolution may take a week or more.

### Otitis externa [^7f85b974]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Otitis externa is thought to affect 10% of people at some stage, and can present in acute, chronic, or necrotising forms. Otitis externa may be associated with eczema of the ear canal, and is more common in swimmers, in humid environments, in people with narrow ear canals, in hearing-aid users, and after mechanical trauma.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of empirical treatments for otitis externa? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review).

Results

Nine studies were included. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: oral antibiotics, specialist aural toilet, topical acetic acid, topical aluminium acetate, topical antibacterials, topical antifungals, topical corticosteroids, and combinations of these agents.

Introduction

Otitis externa is thought to affect 10% of people at some stage, and can present in acute, chronic, or necrotising forms. Otitis externa may be associated with eczema of the ear canal, and is more common in swimmers, humid environments, people with absence of ear wax or with narrow ear canals, hearing-aid users, and after mechanical trauma.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of empirical and prophylactic treatments for otitis externa? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found nine systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: oral antibiotics, specialist aural toilet, topical acetic acid drops or spray, topical aluminium acetate drops, topical antibacterials, topical antifungals, topical anti-infective agents, topical corticosteroids, and water exclusion.

### Otitis externa: a practical guide to treatment and prevention [^87acaa1b]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Otitis externa is most commonly caused by infection (usually bacterial, although occasionally fungal), but it may also be associated with a variety of noninfectious systemic or local dermatologic processes. The most characteristic symptom is discomfort that is limited to the external auditory canal, while the most characteristic signs are erythema and swelling of the canal with variable discharge. Excessive moisture and trauma, both of which impair the canal's natural defenses, are the two most common precipitants of otitis externa, and avoidance of these precipitants is the cornerstone of prevention. Thorough cleansing of the canal is essential for diagnosis and treatment, but flushing should be avoided. Acidification with a topical solution of 2 percent acetic acid combined with hydrocortisone for inflammation is effective treatment in most cases and, when used after exposure to moisture, is an excellent prophylactic. Other prophylactic measures such as drying the ears with a hair dryer and avoiding manipulation of the external auditory canal may help prevent recurrence.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^8bde4d29]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — initial management and therapy selection begins with patients age 2 y or older with diffuse AOE, for whom clinicians prescribe analgesics based on pain severity. If there is extension outside the ear canal or host factors requiring systemic therapy, prescribe systemic antimicrobial active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, with or without topical therapy, plus other management based on underlying condition; factors requiring systemic therapy include diabetes, immune deficiency, or inability to effectively deliver topical therapy despite aural toilet. If no such extension or factors, assess for a perforated tympanic membrane (known or suspected) or tympanostomy tube; if present, prescribe topical therapy with a non-ototoxic preparation, and if absent, prescribe topical therapy based on benefits, cost, compliance, preference. If the ear canal is obstructed, perform aural toilet to remove obstructing debris and place a wick if edema prevents drug delivery; if not obstructed, educate the patient or caregiver on how to administer topical drops.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^82ed433d]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — patient information for topical therapy states that eardrops alone are the most effective treatment, while antibiotics taken by mouth "should be used only when infection spreads beyond the ear canal, eardrops cannot get into the ear, or the immune system is weak"; all approved eardrops are "highly effective, with no consistent advantage" for a specific drug. Most patients "feel better within 48 to 72 hours and have minimal or no symptoms by 7 days", and drops "should be used for at least 7 days" with continuation "for a maximum of 7 additional days" if symptoms persist. "Pain‑relieving (anesthetic) eardrops are not recommended", and keeping the ear dry is important; a "cotton ball coated with petroleum jelly" may be used before showering. Eardrops are generally safe, but tasting the drops suggests a perforation and patients should inform a doctor, and they should also call a doctor if the drops become painful or unexpected symptoms develop.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^3141b1be]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to manage diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as generalized inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The primary purpose is to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief.

Study Design

In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) selected a development group representing the fields of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, family medicine, infectious disease, internal medicine, emergency medicine, and medical informatics. The guideline was created with the use of an explicit, a priori, evidence-based protocol.

Results

The group made a strong recommendation that management of AOE should include an assessment of pain, and the clinician should recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The group made recommendations that clinicians should: 1) distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the ear canal; 2) assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); and 3) use topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; systemic antimicrobial therapy should not be used unless there is extension outside of the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The group made additional recommendations that: 4) the choice of topical antimicrobial therapy of diffuse AOE should be based on efficacy, low incidence of adverse events, likelihood of adherence to therapy, and cost; 5) clinicians should inform patients how to administer topical drops, and when the ear canal is obstructed, delivery of topical preparations should be enhanced by aural toilet, placing a wick, or both; 6) when the patient has a tympanostomy tube or known perforation of the tympanic membrane, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation; and 7) if the patient fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. And finally, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed.

Conclusion

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating patients with AOE. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to the diagnosis and management of this problem.

Significance

This is the first, explicit, evidence-based clinical practice guideline on acute otitis externa, and the first clinical practice guideline produced independently by the AAO-HNSF.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — follow-up and treatment failure notes that follow-up is warranted if symptoms fail to resolve completely by 2 weeks after initiation of therapy. Initial treatment failure of diffuse AOE may be caused by an obstructed ear canal, poor adherence to therapy, misdiagnosis, microbiologic factors, host factors, or contact sensitivity to eardrops. If topical antimicrobial therapy was prescribed, the clinician should reassess the patency of the ear canal to ensure that edema or debris are not impeding drug delivery. Any obstruction should be addressed with aural toilet, wick placement, or both, or if the obstruction cannot be relieved, systemic therapy is begun with an oral antibiotic that covers P aeruginosa and S aureus.

### Necrotizing otitis externa: a systematic review [^fdf7b3d4]. Otology & Neurotology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To carry out a systematic review of scientific evidence available about necrotizing otitis externa, emphasizing epidemiologic data, diagnosis criteria, treatment protocols, follow-up criteria, prognosis factors, and chronologic evolution.

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for publications in English and French languages, between 1968 and October 1, 2011.

Study Selection

We included publications of all types including at least 6 cases. We excluded publications focused on cranial base osteomyelitis not originating from the external ear and publications limited to a specific population.

Data Extraction

We assessed publication quality according to international guidelines.

Data Synthesis

For each publication, data were entered in a spreadsheet software for analysis. We excluded individual data already published in other studies or reviews.

Conclusion

Our review revealed the absence of strong scientific evidence regarding diagnosis criteria, treatment protocols and follow-up criteria. This implies the use of highly empirical indexes of suspicion in clinical practice. Our review confirmed the existence of a typical but not exclusive population at risk (aged, male, and diabetic patient) and also revealed major issues: lack of primary prevention in population at risk, delays before referral and management, bacteriologic issues caused by antibiotic misuse (agent identification problems, rise of resistant strains), persistence of recurrent cases. A better diffusion of medical information should help improve the management of this severe disease.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^020ef296]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution seems to be efficacious and safe in treating acute otitis externa (AOE) compared with ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, or fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution alone.

Objective

To evaluate the superiority of ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution compared with ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, or fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution alone in treating AOE.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A phase 3 randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial was conducted between August 1, 2017, and September 14, 2018, at 36 centers in the US. The study population comprised 493 patients aged 6 months or older with AOE of less than 21 days' duration with otorrhea, moderate or severe otalgia, and edema, as well as a Brighton grading of II or III (tympanic membrane obscure but without systemic illness). Statistical analysis was performed from November 14, 2018, to February 14, 2019.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned to receive ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone, ciprofloxacin, or fluocinolone twice daily for 7 days and were evaluated on day 1 (visit 1; baseline), days 3 to 4 (visit 2; conducted via telephone), days 8 to 10 (visit 3; end of treatment), and days 15 to 17 (visit 4; test of cure).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was therapeutic cure (clinical and microbiological) at the end of the treatment period. The principal secondary end point was the time to end of ear pain. Efficacy analyses were conducted in the microbiological intent-to-treat population, clinical intent-to-treat population, and microbiological intent-to-treat population with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.

Results

A total of 493 patients (254 female patients [51.5%]; mean [SD] age, 38.2 [23.1] years) were randomized (197 to receive ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone, 196 to receive ciprofloxacin, and 100 to receive fluocinolone). Therapeutic cure in the modified intent-to-treat population with ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone (63 of 103 [61.2%]) was statistically comparable to that of ciprofloxacin (49 of 91 [53.8%]; difference in response rate, 7.3%; 95% CI, -6.6% to 21.2%; P = 0.30) and fluocinolone (20 of 45 [44.4%]; difference in response rate, 16.7%; 95% CI, -0.6% to 34.0%; P = 0.06) at visit 3 and significantly superior to ciprofloxacin at visit 4 (90 of 103 [87.4%] vs 69 of 91 [75.8%]; difference in response rate, 11.6%; 95% CI, 0.7%-22.4%; P = 0.04). A statistically faster resolution of otalgia was achieved among patients treated with ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone (median, 5.0 days [range, 4.2–6.3 days]) vs ciprofloxacin (median, 5.9 days [range, 4.3–7.3 days]; 95% CI, 4.3–7.3 days; P = 0.002) or fluocinolone (median, 7.7 days [range, 6.7–9.0 days]; 95% CI, 6.7–9.0 days; P < .001). Ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone demonstrated statistical superiority in sustained microbiological response vs ciprofloxacin (94 of 103 [91.3%] vs 74 of 91 [81.3%]; difference in response rate, 9.9%; 95% CI, 0.3%-19.6%; P = 0.04) and fluocinolone (34 of 45 [75.6%]; difference in response rate, 15.7%; 95% CI, 2.0%-29.4%; P = 0.01) and in the microbiological outcome vs fluocinolone by visit 3 (99 of 103 [96.1%] vs 37 of 45 [82.2%]; difference in response rate, 13.9%; 95% CI, 2.1%-25.7%; P = 0.01) and ciprofloxacin by visit 4 (97 of 103 [94.2%] vs 77 of 91 [84.6%]; difference in response rate, 9.6%; 95% CI, 0.9%-18.2%; P = 0.02). Fifteen adverse events related to study medications were registered, all of which were mild or moderate.

Conclusions and Relevance

Ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution was efficacious and safe in treating AOE but did not demonstrate superiority vs ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, or fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solutions alone in the main study end point of therapeutic cure.

### Acute otitis externa: an update [^bb15ddd3]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute otitis externa is a common condition involving inflammation of the ear canal. The acute form is caused primarily by bacterial infection, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus the most common pathogens. Acute otitis externa presents with the rapid onset of ear canal inflammation, resulting in otalgia, itching, canal edema, canal erythema, and otorrhea, and often occurs following swimming or minor trauma from inappropriate cleaning. Tenderness with movement of the tragus or pinna is a classic finding. Topical antimicrobials or antibiotics such as acetic acid, aminoglycosides, polymyxin B, and quinolones are the treatment of choice in uncomplicated cases. These agents come in preparations with or without topical corticosteroids; the addition of corticosteroids may help resolve symptoms more quickly. However, there is no good evidence that any one antimicrobial or antibiotic preparation is clinically superior to another. The choice of treatment is based on a number of factors, including tympanic membrane status, adverse effect profiles, adherence issues, and cost. Neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone preparations are a reasonable first-line therapy when the tympanic membrane is intact. Oral antibiotics are reserved for cases in which the infection has spread beyond the ear canal or in patients at risk of a rapidly progressing infection. Chronic otitis externa is often caused by allergies or underlying inflammatory dermatologic conditions, and is treated by addressing the underlying causes.

### Acute otitis externa: rapid evidence review [^59d21c16]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute otitis externa:

- **Definition**: Acute otitis externa is defined as an infection of the cutis and subcutis of the external auditory canal, possibly involving the tympanic membrane and pinna as well.
- **Pathophysiology**: More than 90% of acute otitis externa cases are caused by bacteria, most commonly P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Polymicrobial infection is common. Fungi are a rare cause of acute otitis externa.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of acute otitis externa in the US is estimated at 810 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: The characteristic symptom of acute otitis externa is severe pain, which is typically worsened by pressure on the tragus or tension on the pinna. Other symptoms include otorrhea, itch, erythema, and swelling of the ear canal, potentially leading to conductive hearing loss. Inadequately treated acute otitis externa may lead to chronic otitis externa.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Early diagnosis and rapid initiation of a 4- to 6-week course of antibiotics help lower the morbidity and mortality, but recurrence is common.

### Acute otitis externa: rapid evidence review [^27e2548e]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition that affects the external ear canal. It is usually of rapid onset and is generally caused by bacterial infection. The primary bacterial infections are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Acute otitis externa presents with pain (otalgia), redness, and swelling of the canal. It is more common in children and young adults. Tenderness on movement of the pinna or tragus is the classic finding. Analgesics and topical antibiotics are the mainstays of therapy. Topical medications include acetic acid 2%, aminoglycosides, polymyxin B, and quinolones with and without corticosteroids. There is no evidence that any one preparation is clinically superior to another, and the choice of treatment is based on factors such as cost, whether the tympanic membrane is intact, and patient adherence. Oral antibiotics are indicated only if evidence of cellulitis occurs outside of the ear canal or if associated conditions such as immunocompromise, diabetes mellitus, or conditions that would not allow for the use of topical treatment are found. Duration of topical treatment is usually seven to 10 days. Keys to prevention include avoiding injury to the ear canal and keeping it free of water.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^3e4f098c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — analgesic options, routes, and cautions: Mild to moderate pain usually responds to acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs given alone or in fixed combination with an opioid (eg, oxycodone or hydrocodone; ibuprofen with oxycodone), and orally administered analgesics are the preferred route of administration whenever possible, although parenteral analgesia may be necessary rarely. Administering a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug during the acute phase of diffuse AOE significantly reduces pain compared with placebo. Acute analgesia and, occasionally, procedure-related sedation, may be required to accomplish adequate aural toilet in patients with extreme inflammation and tenderness of the canal, while nonpharmacologic therapies such as heat or cold, relaxation, and distraction are of unproven value. Benzocaine otic solution, with or without antipyrine, is available for topical anesthesia but is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for safety, effectiveness, or quality; topical anesthetic drops should not be used if a tympanostomy tube is present or if there is uncertainty regarding the integrity of the tympanic membrane, because these drops are not approved for use in the middle ear. If a topical anesthetic drop is prescribed for temporary pain relief, the patient should be reexamined within 48 to 72 hours to ensure appropriate response; symptoms of uncomplicated AOE should improve within 48 to 72 hours of initiating appropriate topical therapy. Adding a topical steroid to topical antimicrobial drops has been shown to hasten pain relief in some randomized trials, but other studies have shown no significant benefit. Use of a faces, Oucher, or visual analog scale may help determine the level of pain, particularly for children and non–English-speaking patients.

Many of the oral antibiotics selected are inactive against P aeruginosa and S aureus, and treatment with penicillins, macrolides, or cephalosporins increases disease persistence (rate ratios 1.56 to 1.91) and treatment with cephalosporins also increases recurrence (rate ratio 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.58). Orally administered antibiotics have systemic adverse effects that include rashes, vomiting, diarrhea, allergic reactions, altered nasopharyngeal flora, and development of bacterial resistance.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) with suspected or confirmed tympanic membrane perforation — topical agent selection and ototoxicity cautions are specified as follows: If the tympanic membrane is known or suspected to be nonintact, topical drops that contain alcohol, have a low pH (most acidifying/antiseptic agents), or both should be avoided because of pain and potential ototoxicity, and substances with ototoxic potential (eg, aminoglycosides, alcohol) should not be used when the tympanic membrane is perforated and the middle ear space is open, because the risk of ototoxic injury outweighs the benefits compared with non-ototoxic antimicrobials with equal efficacy; the only topical antimicrobials approved by the FDA (December 2005) for middle ear use are quinolone drops; warnings for neomycin-containing products note that neomycin can induce permanent sensorineural hearing loss, therapy should be limited to 10 consecutive days, and CORTISPORIN Otic Suspension should not be used in any patient with a perforated tympanic membrane; identification of persistent patency is aided by the facts that children with tubes inserted more than 1 year ago should also have the tympanic membrane carefully assessed, since in some cases the tube may remain functional for 3 years or longer, and individuals who taste substances placed into their ear or who can expel air out of their ear canal by pinched nose blowing can be assumed to have a perforation.

Acute otitis externa — patient counseling on water exposure and canal manipulation — advises that clinicians should advise patients with AOE to resist manipulating the ear and discuss water restrictions; inserting earplugs or cotton (with petroleum jelly) prior to showering or swimming can reduce moisture, and the external auditory canal can be dried after swimming or bathing with a hair dryer on the lowest heat setting. Patients with AOE should preferably abstain from water sports for 7 to 10 days during treatment; competitive swimmers sometimes return to competition after 2 to 3 days after completing treatment or, if using well-fitting earplugs, after pain resolution; patients with hearing aids or ear phones should limit insertion until pain and discharge (if present) have subsided.

### Interventions for acute otitis externa [^2086b726]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition of the ear canal, with or without infection. Symptoms include ear discomfort, itchiness, discharge and impaired hearing. It is also known as 'swimmer's ear' and can usually be treated successfully with a course of ear drops.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for acute otitis externa.

Search Strategy

Our search for published and unpublished trials included the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources. The date of the most recent search was 6 January 2009.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating ear cleaning, topical medication or systemic therapy in the treatment of acute otitis externa were eligible. We excluded complicated acute otitis externa; otitis externa secondary to otitis media or chronic suppurative otitis media; chronic otitis externa; fungal otitis externa (otomycosis); eczematous otitis externa; viral otitis externa and furunculosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors assessed eligibility and quality.

Main Results

Nineteen randomised controlled trials with a total of 3382 participants were included. Three meta-analyses were possible. The overall quality of studies was low. Topical antimicrobials containing steroids were significantly more effective than placebo drops: OR 11 (95% CI 2.00 to 60.57; one trial). In general, no clinically meaningful differences were noted in clinical cure rates between the various topical interventions reviewed. One notable exception involved a trial of high quality which showed that acetic acid was significantly less effective when compared with antibiotic/steroid drops in terms of cure rate at two and three weeks (OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.62) and OR 0.25 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.58) respectively). One trial of low quality comparing quinolone with non-quinolone antibiotics did not find any difference in clinical cure rate. No trials evaluated the effectiveness of ear cleaning. Only two trials evaluated steroid-only drops. One trial of low quality suggested no significant difference between steroid and antibiotic/steroid but did not report the magnitude or precision of the result. Another trial of moderate quality comparing an oral antihistamine with topical steroid against topical steroid alone found that cure rates in both groups were high and comparable (100% (15/15) and 94% (14/15) respectively at three weeks).

Authors' Conclusions

There is a paucity of high quality trials evaluating interventions for acute otitis externa. The results of this systematic review are largely based on odds ratios calculated from single trials, most of which have very broad 95% confidence intervals because of small to modest sample sizes. The findings may not be wholly generalisable to primary care for a variety of reasons; only two of the 19 trials included in the review were conducted in a primary care population setting, and in 11 of the 19 trials ear cleaning formed part of the treatment (an intervention unlikely to be available in primary care). Despite these reservations, some meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the evidence available:Topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated acute otitis externa. In most cases the choice of topical intervention does not appear to influence the therapeutic outcome significantly. Any observed differences in efficacy were usually minor and not consistently present at each follow-up visit. Acetic acid was effective and comparable to antibiotic/steroid at week 1. However, when treatment needed to be extended beyond this point it was less effective. In addition, patient symptoms lasted two days longer in the acetic acid group compared to antibiotic/steroid. The evidence for steroid-only drops is very limited and as yet not robust enough to allow us to reach a conclusion or provide recommendations. Further investigation is needed. Given that most topical treatments are equally effective, it would appear that in most cases the preferred choice of topical treatment may be determined by other factors, such as risk of ototoxicity, risk of contact sensitivity, risk of developing resistance, availability, cost and dosing schedule. Factors such as speed of healing and pain relief are yet to be determined for many topical treatments and may also influence this decision. Patients prescribed antibiotic/steroid drops can expect their symptoms to last for approximately six days after treatment has begun. Although patients are usually treated with topical medication for seven to 10 days it is apparent that this will undertreat some patients and overtreat others. It may be more useful when prescribing ear drops to instruct patients to use them for at least a week. If they have symptoms beyond the first week they should continue the drops until their symptoms resolve (and possibly for a few days after), for a maximum of a further seven days. Patients with persisting symptoms beyond two weeks should be considered treatment failures and alternative management initiated.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^0ec47820]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Health care burden — incidence and prevalence of otitis media with effusion (OME) are substantial: Approximately 2.2 million new U.S. cases occur annually, with 50% to 90% of children affected by 5 years of age. The point prevalence is 7% to 13%, with a 1-year period prevalence of 15% to 30%. Young children experience about 4 episodes of new-onset OME annually with a mean duration of 17 days per episode. Longitudinal weekly otoscopy shows that 25% of observed days in children 0 to 9 years of age have otitis media (OME and acute otitis media), with 13% to 21% bilateral involvement.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^2962611a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Table 7 — physical examination in the tinnitus patient outlines examination targets and related actions. Rarely, tinnitus can be heard by the clinician as well as the patient, and objective tinnitus may be caused by identifiable disease, such as vascular abnormalities and myoclonus. Cardiovascular disease and vascular lesions may cause tinnitus, and cardiovascular disease can have morbidities more substantial than tinnitus and requires appropriate evaluation and treatment. Tinnitus patients should undergo neurologic assessment, and any focal neurologic deficits will dictate additional evaluation and treatment with referral to appropriate specialists and workup that may include imaging of the central nervous system. Otorrhea indicates possible middle ear infection or otitis externa, and treatment of otitis media/externa may improve tinnitus as well as associated hearing difficulties. Simple external or middle ear problems such as cerumen impaction or otitis media can be detected by otoscopy, and uncommon middle ear disorders (eg, cholesteatoma, glomus tumors) can be identified, prompting appropriate referral and imaging when indicated. A head and neck mass associated with ipsilateral tinnitus requires prompt investigation, with referral to appropriate specialists and imaging when indicated.

### Diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^6eddd9b3]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

This evidence-based clinical practice guideline provides recommendations to primary care clinicians for the management of children from 2 months through 12 years of age with uncomplicated acute otitis media (AOM). The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians convened a committee composed of primary care physicians and experts in the fields of otolaryngology, epidemiology, and infectious disease. The subcommittee partnered with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center to develop a comprehensive review of the evidence-based literature related to AOM. The resulting evidence report and other sources of data were used to formulate the practice guideline recommendations. The focus of this practice guideline is the appropriate diagnosis and initial treatment of a child presenting with AOM. The guideline provides a specific definition of AOM. It addresses pain management, initial observation versus antibacterial treatment, appropriate choices of antibacterials, and preventive measures. Decisions were made based on a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations, as well as expert consensus when definitive data were not available. The practice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review before formal approval by the partnering organizations. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the management of children with AOM. Rather, it is intended to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for clinical decision-making. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children with this condition. These recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to the management of this problem.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^61f1f904]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — evidence synthesis for topical therapy: The purpose of this statement is to emphasize the importance of topical therapy, without systemic antibiotics, for initial management of uncomplicated AOE, and most topical preparations provide antimicrobial activity through (1) an antibiotic, which may be an aminoglycoside, polymyxin B, a quinolone, or a combination of these agents; (2) a steroid, such as hydrocortisone or dexamethasone; or (3) a low-pH antiseptic. Randomized trials used in the 3 AOE meta-analyses are summarized in Table 7, with 31 listed trials, of which 3 were included in all of the meta-analyses, 14 in 2, and 5 in only 1, and multiple analyses report no meaningful differences in clinical outcomes by class or combination, including that Rosenfeld and colleagues found no significant differences for antiseptic versus antimicrobial, quinolone antibiotic versus nonquinolone antibiotic(s), or steroid-antimicrobial versus antimicrobial alone.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^3f3c4303]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) research priorities emphasize determining if water precautions are necessary or beneficial during active treatment and when to discontinue them, improving recognition of treatment failure versus topical sensitivity, and conducting high-quality randomized trials comparing clinical efficacy with explicit double-blind protocols and assessing systemic antimicrobial therapy versus topical therapy. Trials are also prioritized to report early clinical outcomes (eg, after 2–4 days of therapy) and compare time to symptom resolution alongside categorical responses, and to compare "home therapies" (vinegar, alcohol) versus antimicrobials with attention to the role for patient preferences. Further needs include defining indications for aural toilet and wick placement, determining the independent efficacy of aural toilet, comparing wick versus no wick and suction or active debridement versus dry mopping, and defining best methods to teach clinicians to safely and effectively perform aural toilet and wick insertion. Additional priorities are to determine optimal assessment of tympanic membrane integrity in AOE (including the utility of tympanometry), develop medicated wicks that gradually release drug into the ear canal, and continue monitoring bacteriology and antibiotic resistance patterns in AOE.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^8c7c6078]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, superior to ciprofloxacin or fluocinolone acetonide alone in treating acute otitis externa?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial including 493 patients, ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone was not superior to either agent alone for the primary outcome of therapeutic cure. A faster resolution of otalgia, superiority in sustained microbiological response, and superiority in the microbiological outcome were noted with ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone compared with fluocinolone or ciprofloxacin alone.

Meaning

Ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone otic solution did not show statistical superiority compared with ciprofloxacin or fluocinolone alone for the primary end point, although the combination showed statistical superiority in many secondary efficacy end points and a good safety profile.

### Efficacy of ofloxacin and other otic preparations for otitis externa [^fcc711ce]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Ofloxacin otic is as effective in curing otitis externa in children (< 12 years of age) as is the preparation combining polymyxin/neomycin plus hydrocortisone and as ciprofloxacin otic. Furthermore ofloxacin otic, as it requires less frequent dosing, is likely to encourage greater patient adherence and consequently to achieve a better cure rate than both of these treatment options. Because a number of cases of otitis externa are complicated by an undiagnosed tympanic membrane perforation, the lack of ototoxicity associated with ofloxacin otic makes it a particularly safe option for use in these patients.

### Improving patient care pathways in otitis externa [^af9eeb0f]. Family Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Referrals for otitis externa (OE) have dramatically increased but the reasons for this remain unclear. We aim to characterize management of patients both pre- and post-referral to identify areas of improvement at the primary-secondary care interface.

Methods

Questionnaire study from consultant-led research clinic specifically set up to prospectively analyse OE referrals at a tertiary referral centre for Otolaryngology.

Results

Sixty-two patients were included; 63% female, median age 57 years. One was excluded (clinically not OE). Most patients had multiple primary care visits before referral (average 4 GP; 2 practice nurse). Sixty per cent had received oral antibiotics (16% multiple classes). Eighteen per cent had never had ear drops. Thirty-nine per cent were not advised to keep ears dry. Twenty-one per cent had dermatitis; 13% contact allergy, 30% systemic allergy, 5% diabetes. Less than 10% had narrow canals. Thirty-six per cent had active discharge but < 7% needed a wick. Approximately 75% appear suitable for community aural care clinics.

Conclusions

OE occurs most commonly in female patients, often with associated risk factors. Patients often consult primary care several times prior to referral. Lifestyle advice and ototopical drops are frequently overlooked; instead, often inappropriately treated with oral antibiotics. Most ears were anatomically normal, and community aural care clinics may have a role in more timely and accessible treatment.

### Malignant otitis externa: a novel stratification protocol for predicting treatment outcomes [^6cb02648]. Otology & Neurotology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

1) Stratify malignant otitis externa into severe and nonsevere disease categories. 2) Predict treatment courses and outcomes based on this stratification.

Setting

Tertiary center.

Patients

Retrospective review 2004 to 2014; 28 patients. Inclusion criteria are a diagnosis by senior authors, radiographic evidence of disease, admission for intravenous antibiotics/debridement, minimum 1 year of follow-up.

Interventions

Severe group stratification if two or more of the following: cranial nerve VII palsy, fungal positive culture, relapse, surgery performed, major radiographic findings. All other patients stratified to nonsevere group.

Main Outcome Measures

Cure, alive/refractory disease, death by disease, death by other cause. Secondary measures are antibiotic duration and number of disease-related admissions.

Results

Forty-three percent (12 of 28) and 57% (16 of 28) of patients stratified into the severe and nonsevere groups. The severe group had significantly more adverse disease-specific outcomes than the nonsevere group (7 of 12 versus 0 of 16; p = 0.002). Disease-specific mortality was 42% and 0% in the severe and nonsevere groups, respectively. The severe group had longer antibiotic courses (12.8 versus 6.9 wk; p = 0.01) and more disease-related admissions/relapses (1.6 versus 1, p < 0.001). Only four of 12 severe group patients achieved cure. All but two nonsevere patients achieved cure, with those two dying of other causes.

Conclusion

A subgroup of malignant otitis externa may exist that is not as susceptible to parenteral antibiotics and local debridement. A combination of clinical and radiographic findings may be useful for stratifying patients into severe/nonsevere categories. Patients with severe disease may be more likely to die of their disease and have worse treatment courses such that additional surgical intervention may be indicated.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^dd7863e9]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) initial management — Table 4 lists age-, severity-, otorrhea-, and laterality-based options: for "6 mo to 2 y", otorrhea with AOM, unilateral or bilateral AOM with severe symptoms, and bilateral AOM without otorrhea are "Antibiotic therapy", whereas unilateral AOM without otorrhea allows "Antibiotic therapy or additional observation"; for " ≥ 2 y", otorrhea with AOM and unilateral or bilateral AOM with severe symptoms are "Antibiotic therapy", while bilateral AOM without otorrhea and unilateral AOM without otorrhea allow "Antibiotic therapy or additional observation". These recommendations "apply only to children with well-documented AOM with high certainty of diagnosis", define severe features including "persistent otalgia more than 48 h" and "temperature ≥ 39°C (102.2°F) in the past 48 h", and emphasize shared decision-making with a safety net: "If observation is offered, a mechanism must be in place to ensure follow-up and begin antibiotics if the child worsens or fails to improve within 48 to 72 h of AOM onset".

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^3c25d4f5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2004 guideline codeveloped by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians, provides evidence-based recommendations to manage otitis media with effusion (OME), defined as the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection. Changes from the prior guideline include consumer advocates added to the update group, evidence from 4 new clinical practice guidelines, 20 new systematic reviews, and 49 randomized control trials, enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of OME.

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing OME and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy, identify children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from OME, and educate clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most OME and the clinical benefits for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). Additional goals relate to OME surveillance, hearing and language evaluation, and management of OME detected by newborn screening. The target patient for the guideline is a child aged 2 months through 12 years with OME, with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage children with OME, and it applies to any setting in which OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline, however, does not apply to patients < 2 months or > 12 years old.

Action Statements

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing OME in a child; (2) should perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess for OME in a child with otalgia, hearing loss, or both; (3) should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy; (4) should manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown); (5) should recommend against using intranasal or systemic steroids for treating OME; (6) should recommend against using systemic antibiotics for treating OME; and (7) should recommend against using antihistamines, decongestants, or both for treating OME. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should document in the medical record counseling of parents of infants with OME who fail a newborn screening regarding the importance of follow-up to ensure that hearing is normal when OME resolves and to exclude an underlying sensorineural hearing loss; (2) should determine if a child with OME is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from middle ear effusion because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (3) should evaluate at-risk children for OME at the time of diagnosis of an at-risk condition and at 12 to 18 months of age (if diagnosed as being at risk prior to this time); (4) should not routinely screen children for OME who are not at risk and do not have symptoms that may be attributable to OME, such as hearing difficulties, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, or ear discomfort; (5) should educate children with OME and their families regarding the natural history of OME, need for follow-up, and the possible sequelae; (6) should obtain an age-appropriate hearing test if OME persists for 3 months or longer OR for OME of any duration in an at-risk child; (7) should counsel families of children with bilateral OME and documented hearing loss about the potential impact on speech and language development; (8) should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected; (9) should recommend tympanostomy tubes when surgery is performed for OME in a child < 4 years old; adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); (10) should recommend tympanostomy tubes, adenoidectomy, or both when surgery is performed for OME in a child ≥ 4 years old; and (11) should document resolution of OME, improved hearing, or improved quality of life when managing a child with OME.

Type of antibiotic prescribed for ear symptoms and conditions

Otitis externa is treated in just over 30% of cases with a macrolide or broad-spectrum antibiotic, regardless of whether there is an uncertain or no indication for an antibiotic. For patients with otitis externa for whom an antibiotic was uncertain and who did receive an antibiotic, this antibiotic was a first-, second-, or third-choice antibiotic in fewer than half of the cases. Acute otitis media was treated with macrolides or broad-spectrum antibiotics in fewer than 10% of the cases. When an antibiotic was prescribed for patients with acute otitis media with an uncertain or certain indication for an antibiotic, prescribers chose a first-, second-, or third-choice antibiotic in over 90% of the cases (Fig. 2, Supplementary Appendix 4).

If pain is present, the clinician should recommend treatment to reduce pain" with "Evidence Quality: Grade B, Rec. Strength: Strong Recommendation". Pain is the major symptom of AOM. Antibiotic therapy "does not provide symptomatic relief in the first 24 hours and even after 3 to 7 days, there may be persistent pain, fever, or both in 30% of children younger than 2 years", whereas "analgesics do relieve pain associated with AOM within 24 hours and should be used whether antibiotic therapy is or is not prescribed; they should be continued as long as needed". The management of pain "should be addressed regardless of the use of antibiotics", and "Treating pain is essential whether or not antibiotics are prescribed". Choice of analgesic is intentionally unspecified, and clinicians should select therapy on "the basis of a consideration of benefits and risks" and "incorporate parent/caregiver and patient preference". Topical analgesics are excluded "in the presence of a perforated TM".

### Initial impact of the acute otitis externa clinical practice guideline on clinical care [^478a1e3f]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives. Determine the influence of the acute otitis externa clinical practice guideline on clinical care. Study Design. Cross-sectional study with historical controls. Setting. Outpatient departments in the United States. Methods. Cases of acute otitis externa occurring in 2004–2005 (before guideline publication) and 2007–2008 (after guideline publication) were extracted from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Care Survey. Prescribing rates for ototopical medications, analgesic recommendations, and oral antibiotics were determined and compared before and after guideline publication and relative to guideline recommendations. Results. An estimated 5.50 (standard error of the estimated mean, 0.38) million visits (mean age, 27.7 [1.7] years; 49.8% male) with a primary and singular coded diagnosis of acute otitis externa were studied (2.64 [0.26] million visits for 2004–2005 and 2.86 [0.28] million visits for 2007–2008). Prescribing rates for ototopical preparations were 67.2% (5.3%) and 67.6% (5.0%) before and after guideline publication, respectively (P = 0.955). Recommendation rates for analgesics were 14.2% (3.3%) and 20.6% (3.9%), respectively (P = 0.248). Prescription rates for oral antibiotics were 21.7% (4.8%) and 30.5% (3.6%), before and after, respectively (P = 0.166). Conclusion. Clinician behavior in the medical treatment of acute otitis externa has not significantly changed after guideline publication, despite clear, evidence-based guideline recommendations. These data have important implications for performance measures based on the guideline. Further efforts toward guideline dissemination are likely needed.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^45aa076f]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — efficacy of topical therapy and lack of added benefit from systemic antibiotics: Three randomized trials have compared topical antimicrobial versus placebo for treating diffuse AOE, and a meta-analysis of the 2 trials with similar methodology yields a combined absolute rate difference (RD) of 0.46 based on 89 patients (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28 to 0.63), suggesting that only 2 patients need to be treated (NNT) with topical antimicrobials to achieve 1 additional cure; bacteriologic efficacy (RD = 0.61) was higher than clinical efficacy. A Cochrane review affirms that "Topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated AOE", and randomized trials show no significant difference in cure rates when adding an oral antibiotic to topical therapy at 2 to 4 days (RD = −0.01; 95% CI, −0.21 to 0.18) or at 5 to 6 days (RD = 0.08; 95% CI, −0.15 to 0.30), with another trial showing no differences in pain duration or bacteriologic efficacy between topical ciprofloxacin/hydrocortisone (Cipro HC) and combination therapy with oral amoxicillin and topical neomycin/polymyxin b/hydrocortisone. An advantage of topical therapy is the very high concentration of antimicrobial that can be delivered to infected tissue, often 100 to 1000 times higher than can be achieved with systemic.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^7f5ce719]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute otitis media, more specifically with respect to systemic antibiotics, regimens, AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend to administer an antibiotic with additional β-lactamase coverage in patients meeting any of the following criteria:

- receipt of amoxicillin in the last 30 days

- presence of concurrent purulent conjunctivitis

- history of recurrent AOM unresponsive to amoxicillin.

Regarding specific circumstances for invasive aspergillosis, more specifically with respect to patients with Aspergillus ear infections, IDSA 2016 guidelines recommend to perform mechanical cleansing of the external auditory canal and administer topical antifungals or boric acid in patients with noninvasive Aspergillus otitis externa (otomycosis).

### Benign necrotizing otitis externa [^3d63c795]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Benign necrotizing otitis externa (BNOE) is a rare condition of the external acoustic meatus characterized by ulceration of the floor of the deep meatus overlying an area of bony necrosis. Recognition of this condition as different from malignant necrotizing otitis externa (MNOE) and carcinoma of the external ear is important because its treatment is very different. The best choice of treatment for BNOE is not clear because both long-term medical therapy and surgery have been advocated as first-line treatments. We describe a case involving a 50-year-old man and present what we believe to be the first published photographs of the surgical management of BNOE.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^51652fc0]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) duration of therapy by age and severity: The optimal duration is uncertain, but for children younger than 2 years and children with severe symptoms, a standard 10-day course is recommended. A 7-day course appears equally effective in children 2 to 5 years of age with mild or moderate AOM, and for children 6 years and older with mild to moderate symptoms, a 5- to 7-day course is adequate treatment.

### Efficacy of ofloxacin otic solution once daily for 7 days in the treatment of otitis externa: a multicenter, open-label, phase III trial [^0045658b]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis externa (OE) is an infection of the external auditory canal that is typically treated with topically applied broad-spectrum antibiotics. Twice-daily topical treatment with ofloxacin otic 0.3% solution for 10 days has been reported to be as effective and well tolerated as the standard of care, neomycin sulfate/polymyxin B sulfate/hydrocortisone solution administered 4 times daily for 10 days.

Objective

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety profile of 7 days of a once-daily regimen of ofloxacin otic 0.3% solution in the treatment of OE.

Methods

This multicenter, open-label, Phase III study was conducted from June 12, 2002, to October 14, 2002. Eligible patients were aged ≥ 6 months and had OE of < 2 weeks' duration with moderate to severe edema and tenderness involving 1 or both ears and sufficient exudate for microbiologic culture. Ofloxacin otic solution was instilled once daily for 7 days (5 drops for children aged 6 months to < 13 years, 10 drops for adolescents/adults aged ≥ 13 years). Assessments were conducted at the end-of-treatment visit and 7 to 10 days later (the test-of-cure visit). Medication was supplied free of charge to study participants who incurred no costs for physician visits.

Results

Of 489 patients enrolled at 58 sites in 3 countries, 439 were clinically evaluable (173 children, 266 adolescents/adults; 52% males, 48% females; 47% Hispanic, 45% white; 5% black, and 3% other). The cure rate among clinically evaluable patients was 91% (95% of children, 88% of adolescents/adults); 68% of patients were cured within 7 days. Forty-three potentially pathogenic strains were isolated from 253 microbiologically evaluable patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from 158 (62%) microbiologically evaluable patients and Staphylococcus aureus from 32 (13%). Eradication rates were 96% overall. No serious adverse events were observed. Minor adverse events were experienced by 15 (3%) of 489 patients included in the safety population. The most common adverse events were pruritus (5 patients), increased earache (4 patients), and application-site reactions (3 patients). Overall mean (SD) adherence to therapy was 98% (11.9).

Conclusions

Ofloxacin otic 0.3% solution administered once daily for 7 days was well tolerated and effective in achieving clinical and microbiologic cure of OE. The compliance rates in this study suggests that this regimen may be better accepted by patients than longer, more repetitive regimens.
