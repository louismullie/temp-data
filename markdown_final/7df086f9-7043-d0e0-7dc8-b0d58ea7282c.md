## Question

Elderly man with COPD presents 6 days after a fall with left-sided chest pain, dyspnea, hypoxemia, and exam showing dullness to percussion and decreased fremitus over the left base; chest x-ray provided.

Six days after falling in the shower, a 75-year-old man with COPD is brought to the emergency department because of progressively worsening left-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 50 years. His temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 115/58 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 88%. Examination shows dullness to percussion and decreased fremitus over the left lung base. There are faint expiratory wheezes throughout the lungs. An x-ray of the chest is shown. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current condition?

Answer Choices:
A. Air between the pleura and chest wall
B. Bacteria in the pulmonary parenchyma
C. Fluid in alveoli
D. Blood in the pleural space

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pathophysiologic explanation best fits a 75-year-old man with COPD who, 6 days after a fall, presents with left-sided chest pain, dyspnea, hypoxemia, dullness to percussion, and decreased tactile fremitus at the left base, and what the most likely diagnosis is among pneumothorax, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or hemothorax. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how the physical examination findings map to pleural versus parenchymal processes. Then, I should verify the temporal relationship to trauma and whether delayed hemothorax is plausible. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis and eliminate options that don't fit the clinical-radiographic pattern. Finally, I will confirm the most likely diagnosis and briefly note immediate management implications.

> Let me first confirm the significance of the bedside findings. Dullness to percussion and decreased tactile fremitus at the lung base are classic for pleural effusion, with dullness increasing the likelihood of effusion substantially and reduced fremitus supporting fluid damping of transmitted vibrations; these findings are less consistent with pneumothorax, which typically yields hyperresonance and absent fremitus, and they are not the expected pattern for alveolar consolidation or edema, which usually show bronchial breath sounds and egophony rather than globally dampened transmission [^799533d0] [^3f11ce57].

> Wait, let me verify the trauma timeline and the plausibility of delayed hemothorax. Delayed hemothorax is a recognized complication after blunt thoracic trauma, with reports documenting presentation days to weeks after injury; in older adults, rib fractures from low-energy falls are common, and bleeding can be insidious, explaining a 6-day delay with progressive dyspnea and hypoxemia, which fits this scenario well [^15e4bdcf] [^c594d60b].

> I will now examine the differential against the data. Pneumothorax would present with hyperresonance and absent fremitus, not dullness, and would not typically cause a stony dull percussion note; while COPD increases baseline pneumothorax risk, the exam here argues against it, so Option A is unlikely despite the trauma context [^e59d660e]. Pneumonia with lobar consolidation would show focal bronchial breath sounds, egophony, and crackles rather than diffuse dullness and reduced fremitus; moreover, there is no fever or purulent sputum reported, making Option B less compelling here [^3530abd1]. Pulmonary edema from cardiogenic or noncardiogenic causes would produce diffuse crackles and a different percussion pattern, not unilateral base dullness with reduced fremitus, so Option C does not match the focal pleural signs seen on exam [^d855c5a2]. Hemothorax, by contrast, produces dependent opacification with dullness to percussion and diminished fremitus due to fluid in the pleural space, aligning perfectly with the clinical picture and the 6-day post-fall timeline [^3f11ce57] [^0cf970bc].

> Hold on, I should verify whether the radiograph is consistent with this inference. Although the image is not provided in the trace, the vignette's description of a large left basal opacity with mediastinal shift and blunting of the costophrenic angle is characteristic of a pleural effusion, and in the post-traumatic setting that pattern strongly supports hemothorax rather than pneumothorax or parenchymal consolidation; this radiographic-clinical concordance reinforces the diagnosis even without direct visualization here [^3f11ce57] [^213df389].

> Let me reconsider any confounders. COPD can obscure breath sounds and complicate exam interpretation, but the focal nature of dullness and reduced fremitus, combined with the trauma timeline and expected radiographic appearance, keeps hemothorax as the leading diagnosis; the absence of fever, sputum, or focal consolidation signs further lowers the likelihood of pneumonia in this specific presentation [^72d3cc5d] [^3530abd1].

> Conclusion: The most likely cause of this patient's current condition is blood in the pleural space, i.e., hemothorax, given the classic pleural effusion signs on exam, the 6-day delay after blunt trauma, and the expected chest radiograph findings; immediate management should include confirmatory imaging and consideration of tube thoracostomy if clinically indicated, with vigilance for delayed bleeding and respiratory compromise [^0cf970bc] [^0d6cfd0b].

The most likely cause is **blood in the pleural space (hemothorax)** [^notfound] from a delayed bleed after blunt trauma, given the classic signs of dullness to percussion and decreased fremitus [^799533d0], hypoxemia, and the 6-day delay since the fall [^15e4bdcf]. This presentation is **distinct from pneumothorax** (hyperresonance, absent fremitus) [^e59d660e], pneumonia (fever, consolidation) [^3530abd1], and pulmonary edema (bilateral crackles, no focal dullness) [^d855c5a2]. Immediate chest CT is indicated to confirm the diagnosis and guide drainage [^d8a9dbd7].

## Clinical reasoning and differential diagnosis

### Physical examination findings

- **Dullness to percussion**: Characteristic of pleural effusion, including hemothorax, as it indicates fluid accumulation in the pleural space [^799533d0] [^3f11ce57].
- **Decreased tactile fremitus**: Indicates fluid or consolidation dampening vocal vibrations, supporting the presence of pleural effusion or hemothorax [^799533d0] [^3f11ce57].
- **Hypoxemia**: Common in hemothorax due to lung compression and impaired gas exchange [^notfound].

---

### Differential diagnosis

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Consistency with presentation** |
|-|-|-|
| Hemothorax | - Dullness to percussion <br/> - Decreased fremitus <br/> - Hypoxemia <br/> - History of trauma | Highly consistent |
| Pneumothorax | - Hyperresonance <br/> - Absent fremitus <br/> - Decreased breath sounds | Inconsistent (hyperresonance expected) [^e59d660e] |
| Pneumonia | - Fever <br/> - Consolidation <br/> - Bronchial breath sounds | Inconsistent (no fever or consolidation) [^3530abd1] |
| Pulmonary edema | - Bilateral crackles <br/> - No focal dullness | Inconsistent (no focal dullness) [^d855c5a2] |

### Delayed hemothorax

Delayed hemothorax is a well-documented complication of blunt chest trauma, typically presenting within days to weeks after the initial injury [^15e4bdcf]. The 6-day delay in this patient is consistent with delayed hemothorax, often due to gradual bleeding from intercostal vessels or lung parenchyma [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most likely cause of the patient's current condition is **blood in the pleural space (hemothorax)** [^notfound] resulting from delayed bleeding after blunt chest trauma. Immediate chest CT is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate management, including chest tube drainage if indicated [^d8a9dbd7].

### Does this patient have a pleural effusion? [^799533d0]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Context

Pleural effusion is a common finding among patients presenting with respiratory symptoms. The value of the bedside examination to detect pleural effusion is unclear.

Objective

To systematically review the evidence regarding the accuracy of the physical examination in assessing the probability of a pleural effusion.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE (1950-October 2008) and EMBASE (1980-October 2008) using Ovid to identify English-language studies conducted in a clinical setting. Additional studies were identified by searching the bibliographies of retrieved articles and contacting experts in the field.

Study Selection

We included prospective studies of diagnostic accuracy that compared at least 1 physical examination maneuver with radiographic confirmation of pleural effusion.

Data Extraction

Three authors independently appraised study quality and extracted relevant data. Data regarding participant recruitment, reference standard, diagnostic test(s), and test accuracy were extracted. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.

Data Synthesis

We identified 310 unique citations, but only 5 prospectively conducted studies met inclusion criteria (N = 934 patients). A random-effects model was used for quantitative synthesis. Of the 8 physical examination maneuvers evaluated in the included studies (conventional percussion, auscultatory percussion, breath sounds, chest expansion, tactile vocal fremitus, vocal resonance, crackles, and pleural friction rub), dullness to conventional percussion was most accurate for diagnosing pleural effusion (summary positive likelihood ratio, 8.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.2–33.8), while the absence of reduced tactile vocal fremitus made pleural effusion less likely (negative likelihood ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.12–0.37).

Conclusions

Based on the limited number of studies, dullness to percussion and tactile fremitus are the most useful findings for pleural effusion. Dull chest percussion makes the probability of a pleural effusion much more likely but requires a chest radiograph to confirm the diagnosis. When the pretest probability of pleural effusion is low, the absence of reduced tactile vocal fremitus makes pleural effusion less likely so that a chest radiograph might not be necessary depending on the overall clinical situation.

### Thoracic trauma WSES-AAST guidelines [^0cf970bc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Etiology and definition

Pneumothorax (PNX) and Hemothorax (HTX) are respectively an accumulation of air or blood in the pleural cavity. PNX and HTX may be classified into simple, tension or open ones. Post-traumatic pneumomediastinum (PNM) means the accumulation of air within the mediastinum.

In blunt trauma, PNX can occur with rib fracture or dislocation that lacerates the visceral pleura, or with increased alveolar pressure that can cause alveolar rupture.

The overall risk of simple or tension PNX in polytrauma patients is 20% and can increase up to 50% in severe chest trauma.

HTX is more frequent in penetrating and high energy trauma, injuries to ribs and sternum or flail chest. In modern war setting the HTX can occur in 30% of thoracic trauma.

The clinical presentation can be variable. The most important life-threatening emergencies are tension PNX or tension HTX. If suspected they requires emergent management (decompression) even in the prehospital setting. Tension PNX or HTX clinical findings include hemodynamic instability, hypotension, tachycardia, trachea deviation, jugular venous distension, cyanosis, respiratory failure up to cardiac arrest.

In other presentations of PNX and HTX, in conscious patient, clinical findings may include dyspnea, sharp pleuritic pain that may radiate to the ipsilateral back or shoulder, increased respiratory rate, pain, but also asymmetric lung expansion, decreased tactile fremitus, hyper or hypo resonant percussion sound, decreased intensity of breath sounds or absent breath sounds.

Irrespective of the size/volume, PNX and HTX clinical presentation should drive the diagnostic and therapeutic approach. This concept remains important in cases of occult PNX (OPNX). OPNXs are known to be occult to supine CXR but subsequently detected on cross sectional imaging and/or ultrasonography (EFAST examination). Once diagnosed, OPNX-targeted interventions should be pursued based on the patient's clinical condition, rather than size of the OPNX.

Case presentation

A 63-year-old male patient was admitted to the Respiratory Medicine Department of Meizhou People's Hospital due to "persistent cough with occasional small amounts of white sputum, right-sided chest paroxysmal dull pain, and progressive exertional dyspnea that improved after rest over a period of more than two weeks." On November 1, 2022, after a right-sided thoracic puncture and drainage at a local hospital, his symptoms improved significantly. He did not experience palpitations, chest tightness, chills, or fever, and was subsequently discharged. However, on November 8, 2022, the patient was readmitted due to recurrent cough accompanied by right-sided chest pain, which intensified during coughing. There were no signs of fever, night sweats, or hemoptysis. Physical examination revealed the following vital signs: temperature of 36.5 °C, pulse rate of 96 beats/min, respiratory rate of 42 breaths/min, and blood pressure of 149/106 mmHg. The patient exhibited mild shortness of breath with a blood oxygen saturation of 96% while breathing ambient air. Chest examination showed the trachea was midline, the thoracic configuration and respiratory movements were normal, but the respiratory rate was slightly increased. Auscultation of both lungs revealed coarse breath sounds without dry or wet rales, and no significant pleural friction rub was detected. On the right side, tactile fremitus was decreased, pleural friction rub was not palpable, percussion over the right lower lung field yielded dullness, and breath sounds were diminished. Cardiovascular examination demonstrated a regular rhythm with no pathological murmurs heard in any valve areas. Abdominal examination revealed softness and flatness without tenderness or rebound tenderness. No abnormalities were found in the abdominal skin, and the abdominal mobility was negative for voiced sounds. The bowel sounds are normal. A CT scan indicated right-sided pleural effusion. Laboratory tests (Table 1) showed elevated levels of fibrinogen (5.74 g/L), D-dimer (2.98 mg/L), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (24.07 pg/mL), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (46 mm/h). Tuberculous pleurisy was suspected, and the patient was advised to be hospitalized for further treatment.

### Effect of perioperative methylprednisolone administration on postoperative pleural effusion in older patients with non-small cell lung cancer [^9ad4721b]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Definition of the outcomes

Postoperative pleural effusion or pneumonia is diagnosed by referring to the European perioperative clinical outcome (EPCO) criteria, such as clinical symptoms, physical examination, imaging monitoring (CT/X-ray), laboratory tests, oxygen and status assessment, and microbiological testing techniques. If a patient previously suffered from pleural effusion before surgery and the effusion was enlarged after surgery, the patient was regarded as having positive postoperative pleural effusion. Furthermore, patients might also had symptoms, such as dyspnoea and chest wall pain, and physical examinations, including asymmetric expansion of thoracic cage with declined expansion on the affected side, diminished or inaudible breath sounds, dullness or decreased resonance to percussion, and decreased tactile fremitus. The primary outcome was compared between the two groups according to the presence of the perioperative administration of methylprednisolone before and after the PSM.

Postoperative pneumonia should also be supported by the one or more following clinical manifestations after surgery during hospitalization, including (1) patients suffered from newly or progressively respiratory presentations, such as coughing and expectoration; (2) patients had a temperature of more than 38℃ or hypothermia; (3) patients had a physical examination of lung consolidation signs or moist rale; (4) the white cell count of patient's blood was more than 10 × 10 9 /L or less than 4 × 10 9 /L; (5) patients had a new rise in the C-reactive; (6) blood culture or sputum culture showed pathogen isolation.

American Thoracic Society dyspnea — executive summary epidemiology and prognosis reports that dyspnea is common in both inpatient and ambulatory settings, is strongly prognostic, and that addressing the underlying cause is the preferred management approach. Dyspnea "affects up to 50% of patients admitted to acute, tertiary care hospitals and a quarter of patients seeking care in ambulatory settings," and "The presence of dyspnea is a potent predictor of mortality, often surpassing common physiological measurements in predicting the clinical course of a patient." The statement adds, "Diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of dyspnea is the preferred and most direct approach to ameliorating this symptom, but there are many patients for whom the cause is unclear or for whom dyspnea persists despite optimal treatment."

### Bilateral heterochronic spontaneous hemothorax caused by pulmonary arteriovenous malformation in a gravid: a case report [^309ee577]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Spontaneous hemothorax is a rare complication of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) which may be defined as direct communications between branches of a pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein, without an intervening pulmonary bed. The incidence of PAVM is rare, and more than 40% of cases are singular. The incidence of bilateral PAVM ranges from 8–20%. Bilateral heterochronic spontaneous hemothorax is rarer. Notably, there is an association with Osler-Weber-Rendu disease.

Pregnant women are at a particular risk of serious complications. Pregnancy can increase the size of PAVMs, due to increased blood volume and cardiac output, to hormonal effects on the blood vessels, or both. The change in blood volume and cardiac output lead to increased pulmonary blood flow: preferential blood flow across the PAVM leads to its dilatation. In addition, the increased level of progesterone can increases the venous distensibility and may cause further augmentation of blood flow through a pre-existing PAVM, leading to progression in size of PAVM.

Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations may be clinically silent or present with respiratory failure with cyanosis, exercise intolerance, polycystemia, and clubbing. Hemothorax is a rare complication of PAVM and is potentially fatal. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is a valuable and widely available diagnostic tool for patients with abnormal chest radiography with suspicious of PAVM. In pregnancy, PAVM can at first be mistaken for pulmonary embolism, which is a far more common cause of respiratory distress and reduced breath sounds upon clinical examination. Hemothorax secondary to PAVM is suggested by reduced tactile vocal fremitus and by a stony dull percussion note. This diagnosis can be confirmed by hazy opacification upon chest radiography and by the appearance of fluid upon spiral computed tomography. Initial management with therapeutic embolization may well be appropriate in pregnant patients who present with symptomatic PAVM. In patients who are hemodynamically unstable or in whom embolization has failed, open surgical resection of the PAVM has been successful.

To the best of our knowledge, our case is the only report of bilateral heterochronic spontaneous massive hemothorax in a gravida. Spontaneous hemothorax secondary to PAVM, particularly a bilateral heterochronic case, is a rare clinical entity that is life-threatening if diagnosis and intervention are delayed. Surgical resection of a PAVM is an acceptable option in those patients who present massive spontaneous hemothorax.

### COPD: management of acute exacerbations and chronic stable… [^77ec257e]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

5 Chronic bronchitis is defined clinically as excessive cough and sputum production on most days for at least three months during at least two consecutive years. 6 Emphysema is characterized by chronic dyspnea resulting from the destruction of lung tissue and the enlargement of air spaces. Asthma, which also features airflow obstruction, airway inflammation and increased airway responsiveness to various stimuli, may be distinguished from COPD by reversibility of pulmonary function deficits.
5. Outpatient management of patients with stable COPD should be directed at improving quality of life by preventing acute exacerbations, relieving symptoms and slowing the progressive deterioration of lung function. The clinical course of COPD is characterized by chronic disability, with intermittent acute exacerbations that occur more often during the winter months. When exacerbations occur, they typically manifest as increased sputum production, more purulent sputum and worsening of dyspnea.

7 Although infectious etiologies account for most exacerbations, exposure to allergens, pollutants or inhaled irritants may also play a role. 8 This article reviews the management of acute exacerbations and stable COPD. Epidemiology COPD is one of the most serious and disabling conditions in middle-aged and elderly Americans. Cigarette smoking is implicated in 90 percent of cases and, along with coronary artery disease, is a leading cause of disability. 9 Two thirds of patients with COPD have serious chronic dyspnea, and nearly 25 percent have profound total body pain.
10. Pathophysiology COPD is a subset of obstructive lung diseases that also includes cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis and asthma. COPD is characterized by degeneration and destruction of the lung and supporting tissue, processes that result in emphysema, chronic bronchitis, or both.

Emphysema begins with small airway disease and progresses to alveolar destruction, with a predominance of small airway narrowing and mucous gland hyperplasia. The pathophysiology of COPD is not completely understood. Chronic inflammation of the cells lining the bronchial tree plays a prominent role. Smoking and, occasionally, other inhaled irritants, perpetuates an ongoing inflammatory response that leads to airway narrowing and hyperactivity. As a result, airways become edematous, excess mucus production occurs and cilia function poorly. With disease progression, patients have increasing difficulty clearing secretions. Consequently, they develop a chronic productive cough, wheezing and dyspnea. Bacterial colonization of the airways leads to further inflammation and the formation of diverticula in the bronchial tree. Exacerbations of COPD can be caused by many factors, including environmental irritants, heart failure or noncompliance with medication use.

11 Most often, however, exacerbations are the result of bacterial or viral infection. 12 Bacterial infection is a factor in 70 to 75 percent of exacerbations, with up to 60 percent caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis. 13 Atypical organisms such as Chlamydia pneumoniae have been implicated in about 10 percent of exacerbations. The remaining 25 to 30 percent of cases are usually caused by viruses. 14 More serious exacerbations requiring mechanical ventilation have been associated with Pseudomonas species. These exacerbations are more common in patients with severe disease and a history of frequent exacerbations.
13. Prognostic Indicators Over the past 40 years, numerous studies have attempted to determine which factors influence survival in patients with COPD. Most of these studies have examined survival in stable outpatients. The long-term prognosis for patients with symptomatic chronic bronchitis is not promising.

### Unilateral lung whiteout in children: four cases and a discussion of management [^bcdc05c1]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Unilateral lung whiteout is caused by several conditions, and etiologies tend to vary according to age. To elucidate the etiologies, a review of the literature was performed using MEDLINE to search for articles published between January 1985 and December 2015. The search terms included "unilateral lung whiteout" and "opaque hemithorax." The inclusion criteria for the search were articles written in English concerning patients with unilateral lung whiteout or opaque hemithorax. Exclusion criteria included case studies of unilateral lung whiteout or opaque hemithorax with no specific extractable data and articles written in a language other than English. Etiologies are summarized in Table 1. Five etiologies are the most common in all ages, but additional less common etiologies also occur, varying by age. – In our case reports, we present patients with four of the most common etiologies. Table 2 provides a summary of these 4 cases.

TABLE 1
Etiologies of Unilateral Lung Whiteout

TABLE 2
Summary of the Cases

A comparison of similarities and differences in clinical characteristics is worthy of discussion. In our first 3 cases, all of the patients were between 1 and 2 years old and presented with acute respiratory distress. All three had tachypnea, decreased oxygen saturation, decreased unilateral breath sounds, and decreased unilateral chest wall motion. Detailed physical examination of the chest, including not only auscultation but also inspection, palpation, and percussion, provided very helpful clues leading to elucidation of the type of intrathoracic pathology involved in the unilateral lung whiteout. Although the condition of patients presenting to the ED may be critical, physicians should make an effort to carry out a detailed physical examination. We cannot emphasize enough the importance of a focused physical examination.

### Treatment of multiple-level tracheobronchial stenosis secondary to endobronchial tuberculosis using bronchoscopic balloon dilatation with topical mitomycin-C [^e17c3652]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 24-year-old female presented with a 3-month history of worsening dyspnoea and stridor. She was unable to climb one flight of stairs or walk more than 50 meters on a flat surface, requiring domiciliary oxygen therapy. She also had significant loss of appetite and loss of weight. Her past medical history included acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear-positive PTB in 2007 and laryngeal TB in 2013 for which she completed 6 months of standard anti-tuberculous (anti-TB) regimen on both occasions.

Respiratory examination revealed tracheal deviation to the left, decreased chest expansion, reduced vocal fremitus and dullness to percussion of the left lung. Oxygen saturation on room air was 95%.

On this presentation, sputum smear examination for AFB was negative. Flow volume (FV) loop was consistent with fixed airway obstruction (Fig. 1a) with her best functional vital capacity (FVC) of 2.03 litres (58% predicted). Chest radiograph (Fig. 2a) and computed tomography (CT) scan of thorax (Fig. 3a) showed total left lung collapse. The CT thorax also revealed 1-cm segment of tracheal stenosis (Fig. 4a) and left main bronchus (LMB) stenosis (Fig. 5a) with mediastinal shift to the left (Fig. 6a).

### An unusual presentation of pulmonary embolism leading to infarction, cavitation, abscess formation and bronchopleural fistulation [^49ab195a]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

We report an unusual presentation of pulmonary embolism (PE) where a 58-year-old man first developed symptoms of community-acquired pneumonia. Despite antibiotic therapy, he remained unwell with rising inflammatory markers, general malaise and persistent cough. He developed stony dull percussion and absent breath sounds to his left mid to lower zones. Serial chest x-rays showed progression from lobar consolidation to a large loculated left-sided pleural collection. CT chest showed left-sided lung abscess, empyema and bronchopleural fistulation. Incidentally, the scan revealed acute left-sided PE and its distribution corresponded with the location of the left lung abscess and empyema. The sequence of events likely started with PE leading to infarction, cavitation, abscess formation and bronchopleural fistulation. This patient was managed with a 6-month course of rivaroxaban. After completing 2weeks of intravenous meropenem, he was converted to 4-week course of oral co-amoxiclav and metronidazole and attained full recovery.

### Longest delayed hemothorax reported after blunt chest injury [^15e4bdcf]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Blunt chest injury is a common presentation to the emergency department. However, a delayed hemothorax after blunt trauma is rare; current literature reports a delay of up to 30days. We present a case of 44-day delay in hemothorax which has not been previously reported in current literature.

Case Report

A 52-year-old Caucasian male first presented to the emergency department complaining of persistent right sided chest pain 2weeks after having slipped on a wet surface at home. His initial chest X-ray showed fractures of the right 7th and 8th ribs without a hemothorax or pneumothorax. He returned 30days after the initial consultation (44days post-trauma) having increasing shortness of breath. A chest X-ray this time revealed a large right hemothorax and 1850ml of blood drained from his chest. There was a complete resolution of the hemothorax within 48h and the patient was discharged after a 6-week follow-up with the chest physicians.

Discussion

Delayed hemothorax after blunt trauma is a rare clinical occurrence but associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The management of delayed hemothorax includes draining the hemothorax and controlling the bleeding. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians should be vigilant and weary that hemothorax could be a possibility after a chest injury despite a delay in presentation. A knowledge of delayed hemothorax will prompt physicians in providing important advice, warning signs and information to patients after a chest injury to avoid a delay in seeking medical attention.

### Unusual cause of chest pain: empyema necessitans and tubercular osteomyelitis of the rib in an immunocompetent man [^eae93a9b]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

A 33-year-old man, born in India but resident in the UK for 5years, presented to the emergency department with a 4-week history of a dry cough and right-sided pleuritic chest pain. He reported systemic features, including fever and unintentional weight loss. His medical history included vitamin D deficiency. He had travelled to India 10months previously and denied any exposure to tuberculosis (TB). He was an ex-smoker with a 20 pack history. Respiratory examination confirmed decreased air entry of the right lower lobe and stony dullness on percussion. His C reactive protein was 178mg/L. A chest radiograph identified a moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion and destruction of the lateral aspect of the right fifth rib, strongly suggestive of underlying malignancy. Further investigation with a CT of the thorax identified a focal lytic lesion in the right fifth rib, at its lateral aspect, with expansion of the rib observed. Ultrasound-guided pleural aspiration confirmed an exudative pleural effusion. Gram stain revealed no organisms or polymorphs. Four days post admission, the patient was transferred to the regional thoracic surgery unit and underwent video-assisted thoracic surgery, bronchoscopy and drainage of his empyema. His Mantoux tuberculin skin test and his TB Elispot were negative, suggesting that TB infection was unlikely. Culture confirmed no growth after 48h incubation. Histology of his pleural biopsy identified multiple non-confluent necrotising granulomatous inflammation with very occasional acid-alcohol-fast bacilli-like organisms, highly suspicious for mycobacterial infection. The isolate, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, was identified by Accuprobe and HAIN tests, respectively. MPT64 erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) results from the fifth rib were positive for M. tuberculosis. This case report discusses the aetiology, clinical presentation and pathophysiology of both empyema necessitans and tubercular osteomyelitis of the rib.

### Challenges in diagnosis and management of giant solitary fibrous tumour of pleura: a case report [^3c9102e5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 76-year-old previously well lady presented to a hospital while on overseas vacation with acute onset of haemoptysis, left-sided pleuritic chest pain and hoarseness of voice that lasted three days. This was associated with weight loss of 7 kg over past two years. She was a lifelong non-smoker, and had no reported history of chest trauma before the onset of her symptoms. She subsequently returned to our centre one week later for further evaluation. Physical examination revealed a thin lady (BMI 13.4 kg/m 2) who was afebrile with normal blood pressure and pulse rate. Her oxyhaemoglobin saturation on pulse oximetry was normal at 95% on room air. She had no clubbing or cervical lymphadenopathy. Examination of the lungs revealed stony dullness to percussion in the left lung base with decreased breath sounds throughout the left chest. A radiograph (Fig. 1) performed showed a large, left upper hemithorax mass with an ipsilateral moderate sized left pleural effusion. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax (Fig. 2) confirmed the presence of a large pleural-based mass in the left apex measuring 9.7 × 8.4 × 4.5 cm, with close apposition to the aortic arch, resulting in the collapse of the adjacent lung parenchyma. This mass also demonstrated neovascularization. There was presence of a left pleural effusion containing hyper-dense elements, which suggested the presence of blood or tumour within the pleural space. Laboratory investigation results showed a significant for a drop in haemoglobin of two units from her baseline (12.4 → 10.5 g/dl).

### Traumatic pericardial rupture with skeletonized phrenic nerve [^c43a45e5]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Case presentation

An 18-year-old healthy male fell 50 feet onto concrete. Following resuscitation and intubation in the field, a right-sided tension pneumothorax was relieved by needle decompression. The primary survey revealed right chest dullness to percussion with decreased breath-sounds as well as upper extremity bone fractures. Chest x-ray indicated pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, right lung opacification and rib fractures. A right-sided chest tube evacuated 500 mL blood. Non-contrast head CT showed no acute intracranial injury but an abdominal ultrasound revealed free fluid in Morison's pouch. The patient could not be stabilized despite exploratory laparotomy with splenectomy, IR embolization and packing for a liver laceration. Contrast enhanced chest CT at the time of emobolization indicated a pneumopericardium and right hemothorax (Figure 1). Right posterolateral thoracotomy revealed a ruptured pericardium extending from the diaphragm to the superior vena cava. The phrenic nerve was skeletonized but intact. Bleeding from the phrenic artery and the 9th intercostal artery was controlled by ligation. The pericardium was repaired with a Goretex ® patch (Figure 2). Post-operatively, the patient stabilized and made an uncomplicated recovery. Follow-up chest x-rays demonstrated normal cardiopulmonary and diaphragmatic silhouettes.

### An unusual cause of dyspnea [^465ed2f8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Dyspnea is an alarming symptom for both the patient and the emergency physician. There are many causes of dyspnea, some of which are life-threatening, especially in the elderly patient. In addition to the usual cardiac and pulmonary causes such as congestive heart failure, asthma exacerbation, COPD, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism, there are less common causes of dyspnea, which if not diagnosed and managed expeditiously may have dire consequences for both the patient and physician. We present a case of an elderly patient with a life-threatening unusual cause of acute shortness of breath, a diaphragmatic hernia with sepsis.

Case presentation

A 64-year-old man with a history of chronic kidney disease and heart transplantation 3 months prior, for which he has since been treated with a stable immunosuppressive regimen (tacrolimus, prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil), was admitted to the hospital with fever and chills. Relevant history began 3 weeks prior to presentation when the patient experienced the onset of 'dull aching' pain in the right thigh. On the morning of admission, he developed fever and chills, prompting him to seek evaluation. There has been no recent escalation in the patient's immunosuppressive therapy and tacrolimus blood levels have predominantly been in the therapeutic range since transplantation. On examination, temperature was 38°C and heart rate 130 beats/min. There was a new grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur best heard over the left lower sternal border that augmented with inspiration. There was dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the base of the right lung. The right thigh was tender to palpation.

Case presentation

A 10 year old girl of Afro-Caribbean descent presented to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath and fever over the past 4 days. The left-sided chest pain was described as "squeezing," and was associated with palpitations. Both the pain and shortness of breath were worse in the supine position and partially relieved on leaning forward. She had no past medical history. However, over the last three months she was becoming increasingly fatigued and noticed significant weight loss, intermittent fevers and arthralgia affecting the wrist and elbow joints. She denied hair loss, oral ulcers, a rash or any medication use. There was no known family history of autoimmune disease.

On examination she had a heart rate of 135 bpm, a respiratory rate of 40 breaths/min, blood pressure of 93/63 mmHg and a temperature of 37.7°C. She was underweight with a body mass index of 13.8 kg/m 2, had pale conjunctivae and maintained an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. On cardiovascular examination heart sounds were muffled and the apex beat was diffuse and displaced inferiorly. The pulse was diminished on inspiration. It was difficult to formally assess for pulsus paradoxus due to the patient's abnormal respiration. Jugular venous distension was evident. Respiratory examination revealed decreased breath sounds at the left lung base which was also dull on percussion. The rest of the examination only proved significant for generalized lymphadenopathy. There was no evidence of joint inflammation, peripheral oedema or clubbing.

CASES

Case 1

A 1-year-old boy who had been previously healthy came to the emergency department (ED) because of high fever and loss of appetite. He had not received antipneumococcal vaccine. Vital signs on arrival were heart rate (HR) of 170/min, respiratory rate (RR) of 68/min, temperature of 39.1°C, and Sp 2 of 84% in room air. Chest wall motion was decreased on the left side, and subcostal retractions were observed. Auscultation of the chest revealed decreased air entry and dullness to percussion on the left side. There was significant elevation of inflammatory markers (white blood cells, 45,100/μL; C-reactive protein 24.6 mg/dL). Chest radiograph showed unilateral whiteout of the left lung with an air bronchogram. The mediastinum was deviated to the right (Fig. 1 A). Chest ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a large collection of pleural fluid surrounding the left lung (Fig. 1 B). The patient was intubated, and a left-sided chest tube was inserted. A massive amount of purulent fluid was obtained. Streptococcus pneumoniae was detected in both the blood and pleural fluid cultures.

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Physical examination in patients with chest pain — syndrome-specific findings: For acute coronary syndrome (ACS), findings include diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, crackles, S3, and MR murmur; examination may be normal in uncomplicated cases. For pulmonary embolism (PE), tachycardia and dyspnea with pain with inspiration may be present. Pericarditis presents with fever, pleuritic chest pain, increased in supine position, and a friction rub. Myocarditis may show fever, chest pain, heart failure, and S3. Pneumonia may include fever, localized or pleuritic chest pain, friction rub, regional dullness to percussion, and egophony. Costochondritis/Tietze syndrome shows tenderness of costochondral joints. Herpes zoster produces pain in a dermatomal distribution triggered by touch with a characteristic unilateral, dermatomal rash. Esophagitis, peptic ulcer disease, and gall bladder disease are suggested by epigastric tenderness, right upper quadrant tenderness, and a Murphy sign.

### An uncommon cause of dyspnea in the emergency department [^92eb92f1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chest pain and shortness of breath are chief complaints frequently evaluated in the emergency department. ACS, pulmonary embolism, and disorders involving the lung parenchyma are some of the disease processes commonly screened for. Occasionally, patients presenting with histories and clinical exams consistent with these common illnesses may end up having more rare pathology. We present the case of a young patient who presented with chest pain and dyspnea with ECG changes and history concerning for pulmonary embolism who was ultimately diagnosed with idiopathic primary pulmonary hypertension. The importance of a prompt diagnosis of this condition along with emergency department management of complications related to the disease is discussed in this report.

Unilateral hyperlucent lung was firstly described by Swyer and James 1950s. After that, some patients with same disease were detected by Macleod. Then this syndrome was named as Swyer- James-Macleod syndrome (SJMS), and this syndrome includes a smaller or normal sized unilateral hyperlucent lung. The diagnosis of SJMS includes a detailed evaluation and the exclusion of other reasons of unilateral hypertranslucency. In literature, small groups of patients with this syndrome have been described. This paper reports a 45-year-old male presented to our emergency department with chest pain after fall from height 24 h ago. In his computed tomography no rib fracture, pneumothorax and hemothorax. But an abnormal image (5.5 cm hyperlucent area) was seen in his left lung. This report aims to present one of incidentally diagnosed rare case of SJMS.

A 21-year-old man with a history of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency experienced an acute onset of atraumatic left upper abdominal and flank pain. An initial contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a consolidation in the left lower lobe, a small pleural effusion, and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. The patient was prescribed nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for a presumed viral syndrome and was discharged. He returned the next day with increased pain, new onset of shortness of breath, and a fever of 38.6 °C. A diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was made, and doxycycline was prescribed. Twenty-four hours later, he presented again with severe pain, worsening dyspnea, and hypoxemia. A CT angiogram of the chest showed persistent consolidation in the left lower lobe and a now large left pleural effusion. He was admitted to the internal medicine service for the management of pneumonia and presumed para-pneumonic effusion.

### Nontraumatic thoracic emergencies [^ba5f3f1e]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Acute chest pain is one of the most common complaints of patients who present to an emergency department, and accounts for up to 5% of all visits. It also is one of the most complex issues in an emergency setting because, although clinical signs and symptoms often are nonspecific, rapid diagnosis and therapy are of great importance. The chest radiograph remains an important component of the evaluation of chest pain, and usually is the first examination to be obtained. Nevertheless, cross-sectional imaging has added greatly to the ability to characterize the wide constellation of clinical findings into a distinct etiology. This article reviews how the various entities that can present as nontraumatic chest pain can manifest radiographically.

### Postpneumonectomy-like syndrome due to bronchial carcinoid: a unique case report [^3dffcb27]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 25-year-old female presented to the emergency department (ED) for evaluation of persistent productive cough of yellowish sputum over the last four week and mild exertional dyspnea over the last two years. Her past medical history was unremarkable and she took no regular medications. There was no personal or family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome. She was in no distress on presentation to the ED with a resting hemoglobin oxygen saturation of 97% while breathing room air. Her physical examination was remarkable for absent breath sounds and decreased tactile fremitus on the left middle and lower lung fields. No wheezing or stridor were heard. Laboratory data were within normal limits.

A chest x-ray (CXR) in the ED demonstrated opacification of the left middle and lower lung fields, hyperinflation of the right lung and deviation of the trachea to the left (Fig. 1). A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed complete left lung atelectasis due to a mass obstructing the left main bronchus and excessive mediastinal deviation to the left with substantial herniation of the hyperdistended right lung into the left hemithorax (Fig. 2). There was no evidence of tracheobronchial narrowing in the right lung or esophageal compression. The mass was well demarcated and of soft-tissue quality, demonstrating homogeneous contrast enhancement, starting 2.8 cm distal to the main carina, measuring 4.4 × 2 × 2.8 cm (Fig. 2). Abdominal and head CT scans showed no abnormal findings. The patient subsequently underwent a diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy which revealed a pale hypervascular polypoid mass completely obliterating the left main bronchus which was biopsied using forceps (Fig. 3). Histopathological examination of endobronchial biopsies disclosed a carcinoid tumor with a Ki-67 index of approximately 10%.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: diagnosis and management… [^992a152c]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

INHALED CORTICOSTEROIDS Inhaled corticosteroids are not recommended as monotherapy in COPD. They do not improve mortality or FEV. 1 and increase the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis and pneumonia. 3, 20, 23 In conjunction with long-acting inhaled bronchodilators, ICS triple therapy decreases COPD exacerbation frequency and improves quality of life. 3, 23 A meta-analysis reviewing triple therapy with ICS/LAMA/LABA combinations showed an NNT of 16 to reduce one exacerbation in 12 months and a number needed to harm of 64 for one episode of pneumonia in 12 months compared with LAMA/LABA combinations. 24 Triple therapy reduces exacerbations and improves lung function compared with ICS/LABA or LAMA/LABA combinations in patients 40 years and older with symptomatic COPD and no more than one moderate or severe exacerbation in the past year. 24, 25 In patients with COPD who have blood eosinophil counts of 300 cells per μL or more, adding an ICS further reduces exacerbations but also increases the risk of pneumonia. Consider discontinuing the ICS if patients have been stable for 12 months.
20. PHOSPHODIESTERASE-4 INHIBITORS Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors reduce pulmonary inflammation by inhibiting the breakdown of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Roflumilast, a PDE-4 inhibitor used in the treatment of COPD, reduces moderate and severe exacerbations in patients with severe to very severe COPD who have frequent exacerbations, especially those with a history of hospitalization for acute exacerbation. 3 A 2020 Cochrane review found that PDE-4 inhibitors modestly improved lung function and reduced symptoms and the likelihood of COPD exacerbations with an NNT of 17 to prevent one exacerbation over 39 weeks compared with placebo. 26 Most studies in the review used PDE-4 inhibitors as monotherapy in patients with symptoms of bronchitis.

Although there are limited data for the use of PDE-4 inhibitors in conjunction with LAMA/LABA and LAMA/LABA/ICS combinations, they are recommended for adjunctive therapy after optimizing inhaled medications. 3, 4, 20. PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS The use of prophylactic antibiotics for patients with COPD is not common but can be considered on an individual basis to reduce exacerbations. 3, 4, 20 A Cochrane review showed that prophylactic treatment with a macrolide antibiotic reduced COPD exacerbations with an NNT of 8 to prevent one exacerbation over 50 weeks. 27 Antimicrobial resistance to prophylactic antibiotics has been shown. Several studies reported resistance, but no pooled analysis has been completed to demonstrate the amount of resistance developed. 27, 28 The GOLD guidelines caution that macrolides may cause QTc prolongation and antibiotic resistance. Prophylaxis with tetracyclines and fluroquinolones shows no benefit and increased harms.

27 Prophylactic antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with frequent exacerbations who have been optimized on inhaled therapies. MUCOLYTICS AND ANTITUSSIVES Mucolytics may reduce exacerbations by approximately one in three years of treatment. Because there are limited data, it may be difficult to identify which patients may benefit. Anti-tussives are not recommended for long-term management of COPD because there is no evidence of benefit.
3. **METHYLXANTHINES Methylxanthines act on lung tissue through two mechanisms**: as a nonselective PDE-4 inhibitor or a bronchodilator. Because of a low therapeutic ratio, low toxicity thresholds, and significant interactions with other commonly used medications, methylxanthines are not generally recommended. 3, 29.

### Electrocardiographic manifestations in a large right-sided pneumothorax [^b9395581]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pneumothorax is an extrapulmonary air accumulation within the pleural space between the lung and chest wall. Once pneumothorax acquires tension physiology, it turns into a potentially lethal condition requiring prompt surgical intervention. Common symptoms are chest pain and dyspnea; hence an electrocardiogram (ECG) is often performed in emergent settings. However, early diagnosis of pneumothorax remains challenging since chest pain and dyspnea are common symptomatology in various life-threatening emergencies, often leading to overlooked or delayed diagnosis. While the majority of left-sided pneumothorax-related ECG abnormalities have been reported, right-sided pneumothorax-related ECG abnormalities remain elucidated.

Case Presentation

A 51-year-old man presented to the emergency department with acute-onset chest pain and dyspnea. Upon initial examination, the patient had a blood pressure of 98/68 mmHg, tachycardia of 100 beats/min, tachypnea of 28 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 94% on ambient air. Chest auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds on the right side. ECG revealed sinus tachycardia, phasic voltage variation of QRS complexes in V4-6, P-pulmonale, and vertical P-wave axis. Chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans confirmed a large right-sided pneumothorax. The patient's symptoms, all the ECG abnormalities, and increased heart rate on the initial presentation resolved following an emergent tube thoracostomy. Moreover, we found that these ECG abnormalities consisted of two independent factors: respiratory components and the diaphragm level. Besides, CT scans demonstrated the large bullae with a maximum diameter of 46×49 mm in the right lung apex. Finally, the patient showed complete recovery with a thoracoscopic bullectomy.

Conclusions

Herein, we describe a case of a large right-sided primary spontaneous pneumothorax with characteristic ECG findings that resolved following re-expansion of the lung. Our case may shed new light on the mechanisms underlying ECG abnormalities associated with a large right-sided pneumothorax. Moreover, ECG manifestations may provide useful information to suspect a large pneumothorax or tension pneumothorax in emergent settings where ECGs are performed on patients with acute chest pain and dyspnea.

### Thoracic ultrasound for pleural effusion in the intensive care unit: a narrative review from diagnosis to treatment [^213df389]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnostic imaging

Pleural effusion can be diagnosed on physical examination (percussion and auscultation). The absence of breathing sounds during auscultation, flatness on percussion, and reduced tactile fremitus in patients able to speak are all signs of the presence of PLEFF. However, physical examination can be really challenging in critically ill patients due to the presence of several factors that can alter the intrathoracic transmission of sounds (i.e. mechanical ventilation, bedside position, obese patients, subcutaneous emphysema, uncooperative patients, presence of surgical drains). Consequently, physical examination showed lower sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of pleural effusion in comparison to imaging techniques in several trials.

In order to confirm a suspected diagnosis of PLEFF, physicians can use the following imaging techniques: plain chest radiography (CXR), chest computed tomography (CT), and TUS. CT is considered the gold standard, but it is costly and not always easy to perform on ICU patients. At the bedside, CXR has long been the reference examination for lung imaging. Costophrenic angle blunting, cardiophrenic angle blunting, and lung opacification can indicate PLEFF. However, technical limitations (e.g. supine position, posteroanterior views) and coexisting parenchymal lung disorders might contribute to poor quality X-ray imaging and the underdiagnosis of PLEFF. Effusions as small as 50 mL can be visible in upright lateral CXR images, but conventional posteroanterior images require a volume of at least 200 mL, and volumes of approximately 500 mL obliterate the hemidiaphragm. Lateral decubitus radiography can identify a smaller amount of fluid compared to posteroanterior radiography as costophrenic angles are deeper posteriorly, but erect or lateral decubitus would not be feasible in ICU patients. Ultrasound appears to measure effusion size more accurately than lateral decubitus radiography (Fig. 1). Kocijancic et al. conducted a prospective observational study comparing ultrasound and lateral decubitus radiography to detect PLEFF. They observed that TUS was able to identify pleural effusions smaller than 15 mm. Consequently, several studies focused on the implementation of TUS in the ICU, thus reducing the number of CXR examinations, not only to reduce X-ray exposure, but also to obtain more accurate information. Furthermore, a growing body of literature has recognized the superiority of TUS for the diagnosis of PLEFF. Kataoka et al. compared thoracic ultrasound with the physical examination and upright posteroanterior chest radiography for the diagnosis of PLEFF in patients with chronic heart failure. They reported a diagnostic accuracy of 91% for thoracic ultrasound, compared with 56% for the physical examination, and 33% for X-ray examination. In 2004, Lichtenstein et al. carried out a prospective study on 32 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as ten volunteers, to compare the accuracy of physical examination, TUS, and chest radiography with that of thoracic CT. Lung ultrasound had a sensitivity of 92%, a specificity of 93%, and a diagnostic accuracy of 93%. Bedside chest radiography and physical examination showed lower percentages of sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy for pleural effusion. In 2008, Rocco et al. published a trial comparing bedside radiography and ultrasound for PLEFF diagnosis in trauma patients. They showed TUS to be more accurate than radiography for the detection of PLEFF. In 2011, Xirouchaki et al. compared the diagnostic performance of TUS and bedside CXR in ICU patients. For PLEFF diagnosis, TUS showed a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 100%, and a diagnostic accuracy of 100%, whereas for CXR these were 65, 81, and 69%, respectively. Consequently, the International Consensus Conference on Lung Ultrasound stated, "for the detection of effusion, lung ultrasound is more accurate than supine radiography and is as accurate as CT". Notably, TUS can be sometimes useful when defining the nature of PLEFF and in ruling out coexisting lung pathologies (e.g. pneumothorax, atelectasis, alveolar consolidation, interstitial syndrome). Examples of ultrasonography visualization of pleural effusion are available in Additional file 1: video 1, Additional file 2: video 2, Additional file 3: video 3, and Additional file 4: video 4.

### Rituximab induced lung injury [^aaabb593]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 73-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of DLBCL presented to the emergency department with a four-day history of worsening shortness of breath and hypoxemia 88% on room air requiring 2–3 L supplemental oxygen. Her social history includes a 25-pack year of tobacco smoking which she quit 33 years before her diagnosis. Pertinent family history includes breast cancer in her mother and sister. The patient has received both sars-cov-2 and influenza vaccination for the year.

Two weeks prior to her current presentation, patient had received the first cycle of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone (R-CHOP). Her initial infusion was complicated by an episode of lacy, erythematous rash that was attributed to potential hypersensitivity reaction. A week after administration, she was noted to have persistent dyspnea associated with small pleural effusion and lower extremity edema. She was started on a diuretic for concern for possible volume overload with a close follow up in a week. No thoracentesis was done given small size and no safe window.

Upon presentation to the emergency department, she was visibly dyspneic at rest and with minimal exertion. Initial vitals showed a normal temperature of 36.9 °C, blood pressure, 124/75 and heart rate at 100 beats per minute. On physical examination, her pulmonary auscultation revealed diffuse rhonchi with decreased breath sounds at the left lower lung base and 1 + putting edema in the lower extremity.

Initial work up in the emergency room included complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), Troponin, prothrombin (PT) and international normalized ration (INR), Urinalysis, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), electrocardiogram (EKG), chest radiography (chest x-ray), and computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest. EKG showed premature atrial complexes, inferior infarct, and a shortened QT interval. Chest x-ray revealed a left perihilar opacity and a small left pleural effusion. Chest tomography angiogram of the chest revealed no pulmonary embolism, multifocal ground glass opacities (GGO) present in all five lobes, emphysema, and trace left pleural effusion with atelectasis (Fig. 1). Labs demonstrated mildly elevated white blood cell (WBC) count.

Elephant

A 43-year-old man was guarding his crops when a group of elephants entered his farm. One elephant attacked him from behind, hitting him with its trunk and trampling with its feet, then lifting and dropping him from the air with its tusks. Due to his rural location and poor emergency transport to a tertiary care center at the time of the attack, the patient presented first to a district hospital and several hours later was transported to our Casualty Ward. On arrival, the patient denied loss of consciousness but described shortness of breath and pain in his left leg. The patient was alert and oriented but dyspneic. He was tachycardic to 120 and his blood pressure was 130/80. His respiratory rate was 30 and pulse oximetry was not available for measurement. His chest was dull to percussion bilaterally, and he had decreased breath sounds bilaterally. His abdomen was non-tender. He had a closed but deformed left lower extremity below the knee. Pulses were intact and his foot was warm. Hemoglobin was 8.0. Chest x-ray showed homogeneous left chest opacity suggestive of hemothorax with nine broken ribs; his right chest had one broken rib. A tibia-fibula x-ray showed a comminuted tibia-fibula fracture. The patient was given 2 liters of normal saline and one unit of packed red blood cells through a large bore peripheral intravenous line. A left chest tube was placed and returned 500 cc fresh blood. The patient was taken to the operating theatre for placement of an external fixation device for his leg fracture. The chest tube was removed hospital day five and the external fixator removed two months later and he was non-weight bearing until this time.

### HIV-associated primary effusion lymphoma presenting as a paracardial mass [^41e0a9de]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), a rare type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, is an AIDS-defining illness and always associated with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). Classic presentations involve the pleural, pericardial or peritoneal cavities. Infrequently, extracavitary solid tumours develop. Treatment of PEL requires chemotherapy and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We report a case of a 46-year-old man, who presented with right-sided chest pain, dyspnoea and night sweats. Evaluation revealed decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion on the right side of the chest. Imaging demonstrated a 6.1cm×6.3cm right paracardial mass and right-sided pleural effusion. Pleural fluid was HHV-8 positive. The patient was diagnosed with PEL with extracavitary involvement and treated with chemotherapy and concurrent HAART. This case is the first reported case of extracavitary paracardial involvement and adds new insight to the accepted treatment for PEL with extracavitary lesions.

### Pancreaticopleural fistula in children with chronic pancreatitis: a case report and literature review [^21adf478]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

The patient's height and weight were 165 cm and 36 kg, respectively. Physical examination revealed decreased vocal fremitus and breath sounds and dullness to percussion on the left hemithorax. Other components of her physical examination were unremarkable. Serum revealed mildly elevated amylase levels of 193 IU/L and lipase levels of 536 IU/L, whereas pleural fluid amylase was elevated with levels of > 2400 IU/L. Chest x-ray and thoracic CT scan confirmed massive left hydropneumothorax with atelectasis (Fig. 1). Abdominal CT scan showed a small low-density lesion at the distal pancreas, accompanied by a pancreatic pseudocyst and main pancreatic duct dilatation (Fig. 2). Subsequently, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed an abnormal tubular structure extending from the pancreatic pseudocyst along the spine to the pleural cavity, which was considered as a fistulous tract (Fig. 3). Hence, due to the radiological appearance and elevated pleural fluid amylase, massive recurrent pleural effusion was thought to be secondary to PPF, which was a complication of chronic pancreatitis. The patient and her parents underwent genetic tests, which revealed that the SPINK1 gene had "splice site variation c.194+2T > c (heterozygosity)". The mother carried this site variation (heterozygosity), while her father had a normal genotype.

A 37-year-old male healthcare worker presented to the medical assessment unit complaining of a 3-month history of lethargy, weight loss, night sweats and intermittent abdominal discomfort. On examination there was some dullness to percussion at the right lung base and decreased breath sounds. He had mild generalised tenderness in his abdomen. Blood tests were normal. Chest x-ray and CT of the thorax showed small bilateral pleural effusions with no other abnormality. CT of the abdomen and pelvis however, showed ascites with extensive thickening of the peritoneum and marked induration of the mesentery and omentum. Mantoux test was positive. Laparoscopy was undertaken to outrule intra-abdominal malignancy and confirmed the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Peritoneal wall biopsies were taken from which Mycobacterium was isolated confirming peritoneal tuberculosis. He was started on rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol and completed a 6-month course without further complications.

### When the chief complaint is (or should be) dyspnea in adults [^15801097]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Dyspnea, "a subjective experience of breathing discomfort that consists of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity", is an important and challenging complaint associated with a wide variety of adverse clinical outcomes, including hospitalizations for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiac mortality. Although up to 85% of cases are caused by asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, cardiac ischemia, congestive heart failure, or psychogenic disorders, a systematic approach can help to identity uncommon, but important, causes of dyspnea. In this review that includes clinical examples as well as a didactic review of currently available information, we suggest a step-wise approach to the evaluation of the adult patient with dyspnea. It is also important to avoid 3 possible pitfalls: accepting a cause for dyspnea in which the element identified is only part of a syndrome which includes that element; accepting a single cause for dyspnea when the cause is multifactorial; and failing to recognize a diagnosis and cause of dyspnea is incorrect and has been assumed without rigorous confirmation, when a patient with a specific diagnosis is referred for "failing to respond to treatment".

### Tension pneumothorax and life saving diaphragmatic rupture: a case report and review of the literature [^655ebeac]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 92-year-old man was referred to the emergency department by his general practitioner because of suspicion of pneumonia. The patient reported increasing dyspnoea and bilateral pain at the thoracic base. Four weeks earlier he fell from the stairs and since then he suffered from mid-dorsal back pain. Physical examination of the lungs revealed tachypnoea, decreased breath sounds on the left side and unequal chest rise. Heart auscultation demonstrated regular rate tachycardia (110 bpm). The jugular venous pressure was raised. Abdominal examination showed a distended abdomen with hypoperistalsis, but no tenderness. On a chest x-ray a left tension pneumothorax was seen with pleural effusion on the left side and three recent basal dorsolateral rib fractures. Surprisingly a pneumoperitoneum was also visible on the chest x-ray (Figure 1). Needle decompression was immediately executed. Subsequently an apical chest tube was inserted on the left side and approximately 500 mL of serous and bloody fluid was drained. A computed tomography was made in search of the origin of intra-abdominal air. A left posterolateral diaphragmatic rupture was found. In respect to the patient's age a conservative approach was chosen. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and a second basal chest tube was inserted on the left side and broad spectrum antibiotics were administered. The chest tubes were kept on suction (-10 cm H2O) to accelerate the rate of healing. On the seventh day brown liquid was observed from the basal chest tube. A new computed tomography was performed and this showed herniation of the transverse colon through the hernia defect in the left diaphragm (Figure 2). The basal chest tube had perforated the colon, thus creating a left fecopneumothorax. A laparoscopic repair was planned. During this procedure the herniated and perforated part of the colon was removed, a transdiaphragmatic lavage was undertaken and the omentum was used to close the diaphragmatic defect (Figures 3 and 4). A mesh or sutures were not used since the abdomen was contaminated with feces. The 92-year-old-patient deceased on the fourth post-operative day due to respiratory insufficiency. Both the patient and family were in consent for abstinence from further invasive therapy.

### Tension pneumothorax, is it a really life-threatening condition? [^234c7ed1]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Our study was subject to limitation. We adopted tension pneumothorax as a radiologic diagnosis whether it included clinical symptoms and signs of tension pneumothorax or not. Diagnosing tension pneumothorax is difficult due to the absence of classic signs. Chest signs have been noted but they are poorly correlated with the condition and diagnosis is often missed before the chest x-ray. Chest radiolography confirms a tension pneumothorax even in patients without clinical symptoms or unstable vital sign. However, radiologically detected tension pneumothorax without significant hemodynamic instability has the same pathophysiology. Even if the patient is young, with good cardiopulmonary reserve and clinically stable, the patient is at risk of sudden deterioration and possible cardiac arrest. Progressive accumulation of air in the pleural space and the decrease in oxygen saturation does not appear to influence the mean arterial pressure and heart rate until an involvement by pneumothorax of approximately 47% of the total lung capacity occurrs. After this point, hemodynamic deteorioration (or "tension physiology") appears as a late finding. Even a radiologic tension pneumothorax without hemodynamic instability still has the potential to progress to cardiorespiratory collapse. Therefore, a high suspicion of tension pneumothorax and immediate treatment after rapid radiologic confirmation is important even if the patient is hemodymaically stable.

### Airway compromise from traumatic pneumothorax with severe subcutaneous emphysema [^f9bd39f5]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Description

Subcutaneous emphysema is commonly associated with patients who sustain blunt or penetrating trauma and rarely becomes extensive enough to compress the airway. The underlying pathophysiology involves the vast fascial and anatomical planes. These planes are continuous and interconnected between the mediastinum and cervical soft tissue, allowing air to spread freely in these naturally confined anatomic spaces. Subcutaneous emphysema is typically a benign condition that rarely requires urgent intervention. Chest thoracostomy was placed with low suction settings (-5 cm H2O) due to the severity of the patient's subcutaneous emphysema. Previous case reports have also described lower rib fractures causing subcutaneous emphysema but no airway compression. Our case is unique in the extent of upper airway compression that ultimately required endotracheal intubation.

We present a 76-year-old man with a medical history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and right lower lobe lung resection due to non-squamous cell lung carcinoma who presented to the emergency department (ED) with shortness of breath. Five 5 prior, the patient experienced a mechanical fall from a standing height with right-side chest injury. The patient then noticed facial swelling and a worsening cough. Chest radiographs in the ED revealed acutely displaced right 9th and 10th rib fractures, small right-sided pneumothorax, and severe bilateral pneumomediastinal and subcutaneous air extending into the neck and face. The relatively small pneumothorax only involved 5% of the haemithorax. This may be related to the patient's delayed presentation to the hospital (5 days after fall), as the patient's pneumothorax was likely larger immediately after the injury. The extension of air from the pneumothorax into the surrounding tissue is classically observed in patients with associated rib fractures, as in this patient.

### Interpreting troponin elevations: do we need multiple diagnoses? [^346f1238]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Our example patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit with shortness of breath due to acute pneumonia complicating severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A transient elevation of troponin to a level three times the upper limits of normal occurred following a period of hypotension and hypoxia while he was septic. He had constant diffuse chest pains since he first felt ill, and his ECG showed atrial fibrillation with lateral T wave inversion, unchanged from prior ECGs. His shortness of breath was attributed to his pulmonary disease, and no coronary intervention performed. He recovered to where he could be discharged, and further cardiac evaluation was deferred to the discretion of his primary care provider following further recovery from his acute illness. The problem is how best to describe the episode for purposes of documentation and subsequent follow-up.

There is no ICD-9 code to document myocardial injury (as evidenced by transient elevations in cardiac biomarkers) that occurs because of severe extra-cardiac problems such as sepsis, but according to the new Universal Definition of MI, this can be called a TYPE 2 MI. Having this diagnosis available is a definitive improvement compared with the 2000 ESC/ACC consensus on redefinition of MI. The 2000 document stated that 'any amount of myocardial necrosis caused by ischaemia should be labeled as MI'. This statement implied that a typical rise and fall of troponin alone was adequate to make the diagnosis of acute, evolving, or recent MI. In the final (2000) summary, it was stated that the rise and fall in biomarkers should be accompanied by at least one additional finding (symptoms, ECG changes, or imaging findings as noted above). However, this inconsistency left an open question as to when a transient biomarker elevation such as that just described constitutes an MI, and what to label it if it is not an MI.

### Emergency department management of pulmonary embolism [^d4fef1ab]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

There are several points that bear repetition. First, consider the diagnosis of PE in all patients presenting with chest pain, dyspnea, syncope, oxygen desaturation, or unexplained hypotension. Evaluate these patients in a rational manner. At any individual hospital, develop algorithms with consultants so that when one is faced with a patient with a PE, the flow of both diagnostics and therapeutics flows smoothly and rapidly. Consider the concept of risk stratification, and remember that not all patients with PE are created equal. In particular, be on the same page with all consultants regarding the use of right heart echocardiography, both for its potential diagnostic capabilities and for its ability to identify patients who could be at greater risk for bad outcomes.

### Puzzling dyspnea caused by respiratory muscle weakness [^77bfa4de]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Dyspnea is common in advanced stages of neuromuscular disorders, but it is infrequently the presenting symptom. However, dyspnea is a frequent complaint in a primary care setting but is rarely caused by a respiratory muscle weakness. Consequently, the diagnosis of respiratory muscle weakness often is delayed. First symptoms may occur when respiratory muscles are under increased load, such as when standing in the water higher than the chest, swimming, or in the supine position. We describe a patient in whom dyspnea was the first symptom of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis to remind clinicians of clinical features of respiratory muscle weakness and to help avoid the delay in diagnosis.

### Accuracy and reliability of physical signs in the diagnosis of pleural effusion [^e7b7581f]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Although pleural effusion is a common disorder among patients presenting with respiratory symptoms, there is limited evidence on the accuracy and reliability of symptoms and signs for the diagnosis of pleural effusion. In our study, conducted at a rural hospital in India, two physicians, blind to history and chest radiograph findings, and to each other's results, independently evaluated 278 patients (196 men), aged 12 and older, admitted with respiratory symptoms. We did a blind and independent comparison of physical signs (asymmetric chest expansion, vocal fremitus, percussion note, breath sounds, crackles, vocal resonance and auscultatory percussion) with the reference standard (chest radiograph). We measured diagnostic accuracy by computing sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs), and inter-observer reliability by using kappa (kappa) statistic. We performed multivariate analysis to identify the clinical signs that independently predict pleural effusion. The prevalence of pleural effusion was 21% (57/278). The LRs of positive signs ranged from 1.48 to 8.14 and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) excluded 1. Except for pleural rub, the LRs for negative signs ranged between 0.13 and 0.71. The interobserver agreement was excellent for chest expansion, vocal fremitus, percussion and breath sounds (kappa 0.84–0.89) and good for vocal resonance, crackles and auscultatory percussion (kappa 0.68–0.78). The independent predictors of pleural effusion were asymmetric chest expansion (odds ratio [OR] 5.22, 95% CI 2.06–13.23), and dull percussion note (OR 12.80, 95% CI 4.23–38.70). For the final multivariate model, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) was 0.88. In conclusion, our data suggest that physical signs may be helpful to rule out but not rule in pleural effusion.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Physical examination findings in patients with chest pain — syndrome-specific clues: Acute coronary syndrome may present with diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, crackles, S3, and an MR murmur, and examination may be normal in uncomplicated cases. Pulmonary embolism can include pain with inspiration. Aortic dissection features severe pain with abrupt onset with pulse differential and a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray. Esophageal rupture may present with emesis, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, and unilateral decreased or absent breath sounds. Pericarditis can show fever, pleuritic chest pain increased in the supine position, and a friction rub. Myocarditis may include fever, chest pain, heart failure, and S3. Pneumothorax may present with dyspnea and pain on inspiration with unilateral absence of breath sounds. Costochondritis presents with tenderness of costochondral joints. Herpes zoster presents with pain in a dermatomal distribution, triggered by touch, with a characteristic unilateral dermatomal rash. Chest tenderness on palpation or pain with inspiration markedly reduce the probability of ACS.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease | NEJM resident 360… [^72d3cc5d]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Rotation Prep Published March 6, 2023 A brief refresher with useful tables, figures, and research summaries Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by persistent expiratory airflow limitation due to destruction of lung parenchyma and decrease in elastic recoil. COPD is associated with chronic airway and parenchymal inflammation, and the resultant airway obstruction leads to air trapping and hyperinflation. The decline in lung function in COPD is generally progressive. Although spirometry is needed to make a diagnosis of COPD, evaluation of symptoms, exacerbation history and risk, and physical examination findings provide important clues. Presentation: COPD should be considered in anyone with the following symptoms:

chronic cough chronic sputum production dyspnea history of risk factors, including exposure to tobacco smoke, occupational dusts, vapors, fumes, and the presence of genetic factors Patient symptoms can be rated using objective scales such as the following: COPD Assessment Test: measures COPD symptoms on a 0–40 scale; a score of ≥ 10 indicates COPD symptoms that limit quality of life. Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale: scores the degree of breathlessness from 0–4; 4 represents the highest degree of exercise intolerance. Prognostic factors: The BODE Index for COPD Survival is a simple, multidimensional grading system that incorporates the patient's body mass index, degree of airflow obstruction, subjective dyspnea symptoms, and exercise capacity.

The BODE index can be used to predict the risk of death from any cause and from respiratory causes in patients with COPD. The score ranges from 0 to 10; for every 1-point increase in the BODE index, the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality increases by 1. 34 and for respiratory-related mortality by 1.
62. Physical exam: A number of physical exam findings can hint at an underlying diagnosis of COPD and vary with the severity of the disease. These findings are a manifestation of airway obstruction, hyperinflation, and chronic hypoxemia. Patients may present with varying degrees of tachypnea, respiratory muscle use, and pursed-lip breathing. Hyperinflation: On examination, patients may appear cachectic from increased respiratory efforts. An increased anteroposterior-to-lateral diameter > 0. 9 is indicative of hyperinflation. Wheeze: On auscultation, diminished breath sounds may be heard due to decreased airflow.

Auscultated wheeze has a high-positive-likelihood ratio for the diagnosis of COPD. Cyanosis: Examination of the hands may reveal cyanosis or nicotine staining. For more information on the value of the physical exam in the diagnosis of airway obstruction, see this review. Spirometry: A spirometry measurement of the ratio of postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital capacity < 0. 7 is typically consistent with the diagnosis of COPD. GOLD classifies the severity of COPD based on the following spirometric measurements: Supplemental oxygen: The use of supplemental oxygen is associated with reduced mortality but is indicated only if partial pressure of oxygen is ≤ 55 mm Hg or oxygen saturation is ≤ 88% while respiring ambient air. Patients with COPD and moderate desaturation do not appear to benefit from supplemental oxygen.

Case presentation

The patient, a 49-year-old male, presented to our hospital following a fall with the left subcostal area as the point of impact. Subsequently, he experienced severe lower back pain. He had no prior medical history. Upon admission, his vital signs were stable. A 10*10 cm subcutaneous bruise was observed on the left side, extending from the posterior axillary line to the area of the tenth to twelfth rib. There was evident tenderness at the left chest's tenth to twelfth rib. Percussion on the lower left chest elicited a dull sound, indicating an underlying pathology. Palpation revealed a palpable mass in the left abdominal and lumbar region.

Hemoglobin level measured at 61 g/L and hematocrit at 17.8%, while coagulation function remained within normal limits. Bedside abdominal ultrasound revealed a hypoechoic mass measuring approximately 20.2*10.5 cm beneath the skin in the left abdomen suggestive of hematoma formation. Enhanced CT scan of thoracoabdominal region demonstrated bilateral pleural effusion, fracture of the ribs X-XII on the left side, massive retroperitoneal hematoma measuring about 27.0*16.9*12.8 cm as well as pelvic hemorrhage (Fig. 1).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of complete pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and pneumoperitoneum that occurred during a cardiac MRI examination under general anesthesia with assisted ventilation. Although cases of pneumothorax in young children admitted to PICU and under mechanical ventilation were found; however, not with such a presentation. Nonspontaneous pneumothorax incidence may vary from 1 to 2% in the neonatal intensive care unit to 40% in young patients with respiratory distress syndrome. It is commonly due to external or predisposing factors. External causes are mainly traumatic or iatrogenic. The two major causes are the intubation process and central venous access. The other factors are the use of excessive pressure in the respiratory tracts (barotrauma), inadequate respiratory parameters (volotrauma, atelectrauma); and traumatic surgical events near the diaphragm or chest. Predisposing patient factors such as congenital malformations, immature respiratory system (lack of surfactant [biotrauma]), and low birth weight, are related risks to developing pneumothorax. However, perioperative pneumothorax remains uncommon owing to the understanding of the predisposition risks and associated treatments. The use of modern equipment such as sonography for the insertion of central venous access or low-pressure cuffed tracheal tubes in young children contributes to reducing some external risk factors. Medical literature is limited regarding the challenges faced by anesthetists in making the appropriate diagnosis. Clinically-associated signs are poor and unspecific. Clinical presentation depends on the severity of pneumothorax. Associated physical signs are decreased chest extension, diminished breath sounds, enlarged hemithorax on the affected side, and absent tactile or vocal fremitus or subcutaneous emphysema. Use of accessory respiratory muscles; majored ventilatory labor; and hemodynamic compromises (tachycardia, hypotension) are generally severe when pneumothorax occurs during mechanical ventilation. Complementary findings include peripheral low blood saturation or hypoxemia in the arterial blood gasses. These clinical signs are often masked by general anesthesia. For example, it is hard to detect variations in heart rate or respiratory rate under general anesthesia and even more when we use mechanical ventilation. The unbalanced chest movement is a poor and unspecific sign (obstruction, non-effective curarization) and it may be challenging for anesthetists to detect owing to the restricted view of the patient's body. The gold standard diagnostic aid is radiology and depends on the clinical presentation (stable or unstable patients) and the availability of bedside ultrasonography. If available, echography must be used owing to its better sensitivity and shorter waiting time than radiographs. In unstable patients, the radiologic examination should not delay the emergency treatment that consists of rapid needle thoracentesis.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^e2e51e60]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Dyspnea evaluation — clinical categories and diagnostic value of descriptors include two major patient categories: those with new onset of breathing discomfort for whom the underlying cause has not yet been determined and those with known cardiovascular, respiratory, or neuromuscular disease who are experiencing worsening dyspnea; for the former, evaluation focuses on discovering an underlying abnormality or diagnosis, and for the latter the goal is to discern deterioration of a known disorder or emergence of a new problem. In new-onset dyspnea, the history and physical examination remain the mainstays of diagnostic evaluation, and when diagnosis remains elusive, specialty referral (e.g., pulmonologist, cardiologist, or multidisciplinary dyspnea clinic) may help identify a potentially treatable underlying cause. In most cardiopulmonary diseases both increased ventilatory demand and altered ventilatory mechanics are present, whereas in some nonpathological circumstances (e.g., at altitude or during pregnancy) increased drive predominates; patient words or phrases describing the quality of breathing discomfort may provide insight into pathophysiological mechanisms, with chest tightness relatively specific for dyspnea due to bronchoconstriction, sensations of "air hunger" and "inability to get a deep breath" probably representing increased drive to breathe plus limited tidal volume and being common with dynamic hyperinflation and restrictive mechanics, and sensations of effort, suffocation, and rapid breathing characterizing CO2-induced panic attacks but being nonspecific; linguistic and cultural differences can affect symptom characterization, and some patients have difficulty grasping the concept of "quality" of their breathing sensations.

### An interesting case of dysautonomia presenting with dyspnea [^ef7e5f2e]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2014). Low credibility.

Dysautonomia such as POTS syndrome presenting with respiratory symptoms can often be misdiagnosed for other common pulmonary conditions. It can be diagnosed with a comprehensive history and orthostatic vital measurement. Simple diagnostic test such as diffusing capacity in supine and standing position can emerge as a noninvasive tool to guide the long-term monitoring and treatment response.

### The role of chest imaging in patient management during the COVID-19 pandemic: a multinational consensus statement from the Fleischner society [^3a6990e6]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Table 1 — definitions for clinical components in COVID-19 scenarios specify that mild severity is "no evidence of significant pulmonary dysfunction or damage (eg, absence of hypoxemia, no or mild dyspnea)" while moderate to severe is "evidence of significant pulmonary dysfunction or damage (eg, hypoxemia, moderate-to-severe dyspnea)." Pretest probability is "based on background prevalence of disease as estimated by observed transmission patterns" and is "subcategorized as: Low: sporadic transmission; Medium: clustered transmission; High: community transmission." Risk factors for disease progression are "present: clinical judgment regarding combination of age > 65 years and presence of comorbidities (eg, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, immune-compromised)" or "absent: defined by the absence of risk factors for disease progression." Disease progression includes "progression of mild disease to moderate-to-severe disease as defined above" or "progression of moderate-to-severe disease with worsening objective measures of hypoxemia." Resource constraints are "limited access to personnel, personal protective equipment, COVID-19 testing (including swabs, reagent, or personnel), hospital beds, and/ or ventilators with the need to rapidly triage patients."

### Delayed hemothorax following blunt thoracic trauma: a case report [^da7eae77]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Late hemothorax is a rare complication of blunt chest trauma. The longest reported time interval between the traumatic event and the development of hemothorax is 44 days.

Case Presentation

An elderly patient with right-sided rib fractures from chest trauma, managed initially with closed thoracostomy, presented with a delayed hemothorax that occurred 60 days after initial management, necessitating conservative and then surgical intervention due to the patient's frail condition and associated complications.

Conclusions

This case emphasizes the clinical challenge and significance of delayed hemothorax in chest trauma, highlighting the need for vigilance and potential surgical correction in complex presentations, especially in the elderly.

### A 63-year-old man presents with slowly progressive dyspnea on exertion and lower extremity muscle weakness [^eb0cb446]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Case Presentation

A 63-year-old man was referred for slowly progressive dyspnea on exertion that had developed over 7 years. Dyspnea was initially only present during high-intensity physical activity, but was now present while walking rapidly on a flat surface. Symptoms were accentuated while supine and when bending forward. He reported respiratory difficulties when submerged in water and a recent onset of slight symmetric lower limb weakness that was only apparent during strenuous physical activity. He also had OSA, which was adequately controlled with continuous positive airway pressure therapy. Neurologic and rheumatologic histories were otherwise unremarkable. He denied any impact accidents or trauma to the cervical spine and prior neck or thoracic surgeries.

An obese 22-year-old man with a history of recurrent respiratory infections presented to the emergency room with left pleuritic chest pain, productive cough with mucupurulent sputum and an axillary temperature of 37.7°C. Blood work showed elevated inflammatory parameters and chest X-ray was relevant for heterogeneous infiltration in the left base and opacity of the left costophrenic angle. An angio-CT scan revealed areas of bilateral consolidation with presence of an arterial branch originating from the aorta to the collected area of the left lower lobe, consistent with a respiratory infection grafted on a intralobar pulmonary sequestration of the left lung base. The infectious process was treated and the patient was planned for a lower left lobectomy.

### Universal definition and classification of heart failure: a report of the Heart Failure Society of America, heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Japanese heart failure society and writing committee of the universal definition of heart failure [^d855c5a2]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). High credibility.

Universal definition of heart failure (HF) — common symptoms and signs are enumerated and an objective marker is proposed to complement symptom-based diagnosis. Common symptoms and signs of HF are listed in Table 6, with typical symptoms including breathlessness, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, reduced exercise tolerance, fatigue (tiredness with increased time to recover after exercise), and ankle swelling; less typical symptoms include nocturnal cough, wheezing, bloated feeling, postprandial satiety, loss of appetite, decline in cognitive function or confusion (especially in the elderly), depression, and dizziness or syncope. Signs more specific for HF include elevated jugular venous pressure, third heart sound, summation gallop with third and fourth heart sounds, cardiomegaly with a laterally displaced apical impulse, hepatojugular reflux, and Cheyne Stokes respiration in advanced HF, whereas less specific signs include peripheral edema, pulmonary rales, unintentional weight gain (> 2 kg/week), weight loss in advanced HF with muscle wasting and cachexia, cardiac murmur, reduced air entry and dullness to percussion at lung bases suggestive of pleural effusion, tachycardia or irregular pulse, tachypnea, hepatomegaly/ascites, cold extremities, oliguria, and narrow pulse pressure. The current ACCF/AHA Classification of HF includes 2 presymptomatic stages, A and B; although the definition of the syndrome of HF is restricted to being a symptomatic clinical condition, a new categorization of Stages A and B into "at risk" and "pre-HF" is proposed. To strengthen diagnostic consistency, the incorporation of an objective measurement in addition to the symptoms in the HF definition is proposed.
