## Question

Sepsis fluids in CHF

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about fluid resuscitation in septic patients with heart failure, preserving the thinking process and self-verification along the way. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical conflict between sepsis and heart failure physiology. Then, I should verify what major guidelines actually recommend and how they have evolved. Next, I will examine the direct and indirect evidence for fluid volumes in sepsis with HF, including observational and meta-analytic data. After that, I need to synthesize a practical, individualized approach with thresholds, monitoring, and vasopressor integration. Finally, I should acknowledge limitations and propose a cautious, evidence-informed recommendation with explicit caveats and research gaps.

> Let me first confirm the core clinical conflict. Sepsis typically presents with vasodilation and relative hypovolemia, prompting early fluid resuscitation, whereas heart failure is characterized by impaired forward flow and susceptibility to pulmonary edema with excess preload, creating a therapeutic paradox that demands careful balance between perfusion and congestion.

> I need to check guideline positions before jumping to conclusions. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 recommends administering at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloids within the first 3 hours for sepsis-induced hypoperfusion or septic shock, but this is a weak recommendation with low-quality evidence and explicitly calls for individualized reassessment thereafter, which is crucial for HF patients [^116J7mUS] [^1125qQDd] [^1114EULe]. The ESICM 2025 guidance similarly allows up to 30 mL/kg initially but emphasizes frequent reassessment and individualized optimization, again signaling caution in volume-intolerant patients like those with HF [^112JaomB]. Hold on, I should verify the evolution: SSC has moved from a strong to a weak recommendation for the 30 mL/kg bolus, underscoring uncertainty and the need for personalization [^1132kVgt].

> Next, I should review direct evidence in sepsis with HF. Observational cohorts suggest a U-shaped relationship between early fluid volume and mortality, with the lowest risk around 10–15 mL/kg in the first 3 hours, and both lower and higher volumes associated with worse outcomes; importantly, volumes above 20 mL/kg increased intubation risk, which is highly relevant in HF [^116R1ZZm] [^117DWYTJ] [^1147aP1p]. Wait, let me verify consistency: subgroup analyses of NYHA III–IV, HFrEF, and high BNP patients repeatedly show the same 10–15 mL/kg sweet spot, supporting external validity within the severe HF phenotype [^116R1ZZm] [^1147aP1p].

> I should double-check whether restrictive strategies are uniformly harmful. A meta-analysis of sepsis patients with HF found that failing to meet the 30 mL/kg by 3 hours target was associated with higher in-hospital mortality, suggesting under-resuscitation can be dangerous even in HF; however, this does not prove that 30 mL/kg is optimal for HF, only that withholding fluids entirely may worsen outcomes [^111VPttT]. But wait, what if aggressive fluids are harmful in fluid-overloaded HF? Indeed, another meta-analysis in CHF/ESRD found a non-significant trend toward higher mortality with ≥ 30 mL/kg, reinforcing the need for moderation and close monitoring in these comorbidities [^113sfvkK].

> Let me consider broader sepsis evidence to avoid over-extrapolation. Large pragmatic datasets indicate that moderate day-1 fluid volumes around 3–4 L are associated with lower mortality than very low or very high volumes, and this pattern persists in subgroups with CHF, ESRD, and pulmonary hypertension, supporting a middle-path approach rather than extremes [^111qD8Sh] [^116eLbCU]. I should confirm that this aligns with RCT signals: CLOVERS showed no mortality difference between early vasopressors to limit fluids versus usual care, implying equipoise and reinforcing the need for individualized titration rather than a fixed-volume dogma [^112HKtz6].

> Now, I will synthesize a practical approach. For septic patients with HF and sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, a reasonable initial strategy is 10–15 mL/kg of balanced crystalloid over the first 3 hours, with immediate reassessment of perfusion, respiratory status, and markers of congestion; this balances the risk of under-resuscitation with the danger of precipitating pulmonary edema in HF [^116R1ZZm] [^117DWYTJ]. Hold on, I should verify monitoring tools: dynamic measures such as passive leg raise with cardiac output or stroke volume assessment, or pulse pressure/stroke volume variation where appropriate, outperform static parameters; CVP can be used as a safety variable to detect rising filling pressures, but it is imperfect for predicting fluid responsiveness and should not be used in isolation [^115WgDpQ] [^112wpAHe] [^112HK5mj].

> I need to ensure vasopressor integration is explicit. If hypotension persists after the initial 10–15 mL/kg or if there are early signs of respiratory compromise, norepinephrine should be initiated promptly rather than continuing large crystalloid boluses; SSC endorses norepinephrine as first-line and supports early inotropy when myocardial dysfunction limits output despite adequate filling, which is common in mixed septic–cardiogenic shock [^112JGk5n]. Let me reconsider the timing: early vasopressors can reduce cumulative fluid exposure without worsening outcomes in many contexts, aligning with a conservative-but-adequate fluid strategy in HF [^112HKtz6].

> Next, I should review deresuscitation and decongestion. Once perfusion improves, a planned transition to net negative fluid balance is prudent in HF, using diuretics guided by clinical congestion, lung ultrasound, and biomarkers such as BNP; positive fluid balance in the first 24 hours has been linked to higher mortality in HF with sepsis, so active decongestion is warranted once hemodynamics allow [^117SPWqX] [^111DkebB]. I should confirm that guidelines endorse reassessment and de-escalation after initial stabilization; SSC emphasizes ongoing evaluation and individualized fluid management beyond the initial bolus, which fits this deresuscitation phase [^1114EULe].

> But wait, what about real-world practice patterns and adherence? Multiple cohorts show clinicians often deliver less fluid to HF patients and struggle to meet 30 mL/kg by 3 hours, yet some data suggest mortality differences are attenuated after adjustment, implying that careful, individualized care may mitigate harm even when targets are not fully met; this reinforces the need for a structured, monitored approach rather than rigid compliance to a volume threshold [^113Cojpi] [^113Nifbr] [^115WNENf]. I should confirm that this does not justify withholding fluids; rather, it supports judicious dosing with close follow-up and dynamic assessment [^111VPttT] [^112wpAHe].

> I will now examine special populations and edge cases. In severe HFrEF or NYHA IV, the optimal early volume appears to be at the lower end of 10–15 mL/kg, with a lower threshold for early inotropy and vasopressors; conversely, in mild chronic HF without acute decompensation, a slightly higher initial volume may be acceptable if fluid responsiveness is demonstrated, but this requires vigilant monitoring for decompensation [^116R1ZZm] [^1147aP1p]. Hold on, I should verify that echocardiography at the bedside can help stratify risk and guide therapy; early LV function assessment informs inotrope decisions and helps anticipate poor tolerance to fluids in reduced EF [^116BPyq3].

> Let me summarize the evidence-based recommendation with explicit caveats. For septic patients with HF and sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, start with 10–15 mL/kg of balanced crystalloid in the first 3 hours, reassess perfusion and respiratory status frequently, and escalate to norepinephrine if hypotension persists or if there are early signs of pulmonary congestion; avoid exceeding 20 mL/kg in the initial phase given increased intubation risk, and transition to deresuscitation once perfusion is secured, recognizing that both under-resuscitation and over-resuscitation are harmful in this population [^116R1ZZm] [^117DWYTJ] [^1147aP1p]. I should double-check that this aligns with guidelines: SSC and ESICM endorse individualized reassessment after initial fluids, which operationalizes this moderate, response-guided approach rather than a fixed 30 mL/kg mandate for all comers [^1114EULe] [^112JaomB].

> Finally, I need to acknowledge limitations and future directions. Most data are observational and retrospective, with potential confounding by indication; true equipoise remains, and definitive RCTs in sepsis with HF are urgently needed to test restrictive versus moderate versus liberal strategies with protocolized deresuscitation and dynamic monitoring; until then, clinicians should document reassessments, use dynamic measures when available, and avoid both therapeutic nihilism and fluid indifference in this high-risk group [^116JnXM9] [^112HKtz6]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that 30 mL/kg is contraindicated in HF; it is not absolutely contraindicated, but in decompensated HF the balance of harms and benefits favors a more conservative, closely monitored initial volume with early vasopressor support to mitigate fluid overload while preventing under-resuscitation [^116J7mUS] [^112JaomB].

In sepsis with CHF, **start with 10–15 mL/kg of balanced crystalloids within 3 hours** [^1111uMeL] and reassess frequently to avoid overload [^1145gRY3]. Use **dynamic measures** (passive leg raise, stroke volume variation) to guide further fluids [^115WgDpQ], and **escalate to vasopressors early** if hypotension persists [^115N8Kuu]. Avoid exceeding 20 mL/kg [^116R1ZZm] [^1147aP1p] due to higher risks of intubation and mortality, and tailor therapy to clinical response and fluid responsiveness [^116XQTiT] [^112wpAHe].

---

## Physiological considerations

- **Sepsis physiology**: Vasodilation, capillary leak, and relative hypovolemia drive early fluid needs to restore perfusion [^112QyNpi].

- **CHF physiology**: Reduced contractility and compliance limit preload tolerance, increasing pulmonary edema risk with excess fluids [^notfound].

- **Balance**: Early, moderate fluids can improve perfusion without precipitating overload if carefully titrated and monitored [^116eLbCU].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **SSC 2021**: Initial 30 mL/kg crystalloids for sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, but individualize in high-risk groups like CHF [^116J7mUS] [^116JnXM9].

- **ESICM 2025**: Up to 30 mL/kg initially, then individualize based on response and frequent reassessment [^1145gRY3].

- **Observational data**: In CHF, 10–15 mL/kg in the first 3 hours is associated with lower mortality and intubation than < 10 or > 20 mL/kg [^1111uMeL] [^116R1ZZm].

## Risks and benefits of fluid resuscitation in CHF

| **Benefits** | **Risks** |
|-|-|
| Improved perfusion and organ function | Pulmonary edema and respiratory failure [^1147aP1p] |
| Reduced vasopressor requirement | Worsening heart failure and AKI [^112HK5mj] |
| Potential mortality benefit if appropriately titrated | Increased ICU admission and length of stay [^notfound] |

---

## Recommended fluid resuscitation strategy

- **Initial fluid bolus**: 10–15 mL/kg balanced crystalloids (e.g. Lactated Ringer's) within 3 hours [^1111uMeL].

- **Reassessment**: Use dynamic measures (PLR, stroke volume variation) to guide additional fluids [^115WgDpQ].

- **Vasopressors**: Start norepinephrine early if hypotension persists after initial bolus [^111pLVtd].

- **Avoidance**: Do not exceed 20 mL/kg due to higher intubation and mortality risk [^116R1ZZm].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

- **Clinical parameters**: MAP, HR, RR, urine output, oxygen saturation, and signs of overload (JVP, crackles, edema).

- **Laboratory markers**: Lactate, BNP, and renal function tests.

- **Imaging**: Chest X-ray or lung ultrasound for pulmonary edema.

- **Fluid responsiveness**: Use PLR or stroke volume variation to guide further fluids [^115fLWoS].

---

## Special considerations

- **Cardiogenic shock**: Use inotropes (e.g. dobutamine) if persistent hypoperfusion despite adequate volume [^112JGk5n].

- **Renal dysfunction**: Monitor closely for AKI and adjust fluids accordingly [^notfound].

- **Obesity**: Use ideal body weight for fluid calculations to avoid overload.

## Summary of recommendations

| **Step** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Initial bolus | 10–15 mL/kg balanced crystalloids within 3 hours [^1111uMeL] |
| Reassessment | Dynamic measures (PLR, stroke volume variation) [^115fLWoS] |
| Vasopressors | Early norepinephrine if hypotension persists [^111pLVtd] |
| Avoidance | Do not exceed 20 mL/kg total fluids [^116R1ZZm] |
| Monitoring | - Clinical parameters <br/> - Laboratory markers <br/> - Imaging [^111fSKis] |

---

Fluid resuscitation in sepsis with CHF requires a **carefully titrated, response-guided approach**: start with 10–15 mL/kg, reassess dynamically, and escalate to vasopressors as needed to balance perfusion and avoid overload [^116R1ZZm].

### Optimal fluid resuscitation targets in septic patients with acutely decompensated heart failure [^1125qQDd]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis, a life-threatening syndrome resulting from a dysregulated host response to infection, continues to be a significant global health concern. Timely and appropriate fluid resuscitation is a cornerstone of sepsis management. According to the latest guidelines from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC), it is still recommended to administer an initial intravenous (IV) 30 mL/kg crystalloid bolus within 3 h for septic patients with hypotension, indiscriminate of comorbidities. However, it is important to note that this recommendation is primarily based on several early observational studies. Despite being endorsed in the SSC guidelines, it is considered a weak recommendation with low-quality evidence.

The lack of consideration in this standard fluid resuscitation dose for the heterogeneity among patient populations, particularly those with heart failure (HF), is a significant concern. This one-size-fits-all fluid resuscitation strategy fails to acknowledge the complexities associated with specific comorbidities. Patients with HF may respond differently to excessive fluid resuscitation due to compromised cardiac function, potentially leading to an increased risk of further deterioration.

Limited literature exists regarding fluid resuscitation in septic patients with comorbid HF. However, the available evidence tends to support guideline recommendations. Despite the inclination to align with the recommended 30 mL/kg resuscitation volume in sepsis guidelines, there is still a critical gap in understanding whether this approach is suitable for the heterogeneous population of patients with varying degrees of HF. Real-world clinical practice shows that septic patients with HF often receive less fluid resuscitation or experience delays in achieving the recommended 30 mL/kg target. These deviations from guidelines may have different impacts on patient outcomes, highlighting clinicians' concerns regarding fluid resuscitation in this population.

In the case of a septic patient with HF, there is a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the appropriate amount of fluid resuscitation and its tolerability. Our study aims to address this knowledge gap by examining the relationship between initial fluid resuscitation volumes and mortality rates in septic patients with HF. Our study specifically examines the impact of early fluid dosing in septic patients with ADHF, a scenario that presents unique challenges compared to stable chronic HF. While the overall prevalence of HF in sepsis is well-documented, the acute decompensation superimposed on sepsis is less studied, and our work aims to fill this gap. By focusing on this distinct subset of patients, we aim to provide more nuanced insights into fluid management strategies that could potentially improve clinical outcomes.

### Sepsis, the administration of IV fluids, and respiratory failure: a retrospective analysis-SAIFR study [^11215eq2]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although resuscitation with IV fluids is the cornerstone of sepsis management, consensus regarding their association with improvement in clinical outcomes is lacking.

Research Question

Is there a difference in the incidence of respiratory failure in patients with sepsis who received guideline-recommended initial IV fluid bolus of 30 mL/kg or more conservative resuscitation of less than 30 mL/kg?

Study Design and Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected clinical data conducted at an academic medical center in Omaha, Nebraska. We abstracted data from 214 patients with sepsis admitted to a single academic medical center between June 2017 and June 2018. Patients were stratified by receipt of guideline-recommended fluid bolus. The primary outcome was respiratory failure defined as an increase in oxygen flow rate or more intense oxygenation and ventilation support; oxygen requirement and volume were measured at admission, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and at discharge. Subgroup analyses were conducted in high-risk patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) as well as those with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Results

A total of 62 patients (29.0%) received appropriate bolus treatment. The overall rate of respiratory failure was not statistically different between patients who received appropriate bolus or did not (40.3% vs 36.8%; p = 0.634). Likewise, no differences were observed in time to respiratory failure (P = 0.645) or risk of respiratory failure (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.1 [95% CI, 0.7–1.7]; p = 0.774). Results were similar within the high-risk CHF and CKD subgroups.

Interpretation

In this single-center retrospective study, we found that by broadly defining respiratory failure as an increase in oxygen requirements, a conservative initial IV fluid resuscitation strategy did not correlate with decreased rates of hypoxemic respiratory failure.

### Guideline-based and restricted fluid resuscitation strategy in sepsis patients with heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111VPttT]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To examine whether a fluid resuscitation strategy based on guidelines (at least 30 mL/kg IV crystalloids) vs. a restrictive approach with < 30 mL/kg within three hours affects in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis and a history of heart failure (HF).

Data Sources

On 03/07/2023, we searched Embase, PubMed, and Scopus for peer-reviewed papers and abstracts using the PRISMA guidelines.

Study Selection

The language was limited to English. Studies published since 2016 included if they had sepsis patients with a history of HF, or a subgroup of patients with HF, and in-hospital mortality data on these patients that did or did not meet the 30 mL/kg by 3 h (30 × 3) goal. Duplicate studies, studies that focused on a broader period than 3 h from the diagnosis of sepsis or without mortality breakdown for HF patients or with unrelated title/abstract, or without an IRB approval were excluded.

Data Extraction

In-hospital mortality data was taken from the final studies for HF patients with sepsis who did or did not meet the 30 × 3 goal.

Data Synthesis

The meta-analysis was performed using the Review Manager 5.4 program with ORs as the effect measure. The ProMeta program version 3.0 was used to evaluate the publication bias. Egger's linear regression and Berg and Mazumdar's rank correlation was used to evaluate the publication bias. The result was visually represented by a funnel plot. To estimate the proportion of variance attributable to heterogeneity, the I 2 statistic was calculated.

Results

The search yielded 26,069 records, which were narrowed down to 4 studies. Compared to those who met the 30 × 3 goal, the < 30 × 3 group had a significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.13–2.89, P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Restrictive fluid resuscitation increased the risk of in-hospital mortality in HF patients with sepsis. More rigorous research is required to determine the optimal fluid resuscitation strategy for this population.

### Association between preexisting heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and fluid administration among patients with sepsis [^1132kVgt]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, and more than 1 in 5 patients admitted with sepsis die during their hospital stay. Intravenous fluid administration is a key component of clinical practice guidelines and federally mandated performance benchmarks for the management of sepsis and septic shock. However, there is little evidence from randomized clinical trials to support a strategy of aggressive intravenous fluid administration, and there is increasing concern about the downstream harms of fluid overload.

Guidelines recently downgraded the recommendation for a 30-mL/kg intravenous fluid bolus among all patients with sepsis-induced hypoperfusion from a strong to a weak recommendation. However, controversy remains because aggressive intravenous fluid administration is a component of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) SEP-1 bundle and is widely used in clinical practice. Clinicians are particularly concerned about the potential harms of empirical fluid administration to patients with underlying heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), who may be at higher risk of complications. A greater understanding of the epidemiology of preexisting HFrEF prior to sepsis and its association with outcomes is needed to balance the pros and cons of fluid resuscitation for these patients at high risk. To address these knowledge gaps, in a multicenter cohort study, we explored the epidemiology of HFrEF diagnosed prior to hospitalization for sepsis and its risk-adjusted association with guideline-recommended intravenous fluid administration and outcome during emergency care of septic shock.

### Outcomes of CMS-mandated fluid administration among fluid-overloaded patients with sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113sfvkK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The outcomes of large-volume IVF administration to septic shock patients with comorbid congestive heart failure (CHF) and/or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are uncertain and widely debated in the existing literature. Despite this uncertainty, CMS continues to recommend that 30 ml/kg of an intravenous crystalloid solution be administered to patients in septic shock starting within 3 h of presentation. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the relationship between adherence to this guideline and outcomes among patients whose underlying comorbidities present a risk of fluid overload.

Methods

Our search was conducted on PubMed and Scopus through November 5, 2021 to identify studies that evaluated clinical outcomes among septic patients with CHF/ESRD based on volume of fluid administered. The primary outcome measured was mortality at 30 days post-hospital discharge. Other outcomes included the rates of vasopressor requirements, invasive mechanical ventilation during hospitalization, as well as length of stay in the intensive care unit and/or hospital. We used random effects meta-analysis when two or more studies reported the same outcome.

Results

We included five studies in the final meta-analysis, which comprised 5804 patients, 5260 (91%) of whom received non-aggressive fluid resuscitation, as defined by the studies' authors. Random-effects meta-analysis for all-cause mortality showed that aggressive fluid resuscitation was associated with statistically non-significant increased odds of mortality (OR 1.42, 95% CI 0.88–2.3, P = 0.15, I² = 35%). There was no statistical association between volume of IVF administration and other outcomes evaluated.

Conclusion

Among septic shock patients with CHF and/or ESRD, administration of greater than or equal to 30 ml/kg IVF was associated with a non-significant increase in odds of mortality. All other outcomes measured were found to be non-significant, although there was a trend toward better outcomes among patients in the restricted-volume compared to the standard-volume IVF groups. Since this meta-analysis only included five observational studies, more studies are needed to guide an optimal volume and rate of fluid administration in this patient population.

### Association between preexisting heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and fluid administration among patients with sepsis [^113Cojpi]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the association between preexisting heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and appropriate fluid resuscitation among patients with sepsis?

Findings

In this cohort study of 5278 patients with community-onset sepsis, 884 (17%) had preexisting HFrEF, which was associated with a lower risk-adjusted odds of receiving 30 mL/kg of intravenous fluids within 6 hours of sepsis onset. However, there was no association between HFrEF and in-hospital mortality.

Meaning

The results of this study suggest that preexisting HFrEF is common among patients with septic shock and is associated with reduced odds of receiving guideline-recommended intravenous fluids.

### Optimal fluid resuscitation targets in septic patients with acutely decompensated heart failure [^1133QL6E]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Individualized fluid management in sepsis improves outcomes in patients with septic shock. The recommendation of 30 mL/kg fluid resuscitation originates from the early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) trial conducted by Rivers et al. in 2001. Subsequently, both the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) and Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock Early Management Bundle (SEP-1) have endorsed this approach. From 2014 to 2015, three independent, government-funded, multicenter randomized controlled trials were conducted: early septic shock in the United States (ProCESS), sepsis resuscitation assessment in Australia (ARISE), and sepsis programmed management in the UK (ProMISe). The average fluid volume administered to patients prior to randomization in these studies was also around 30 mL/kg, which led to the adoption of 30 mL/kg fluid resuscitation volume in routine clinical practice. However, there has been significant debate regarding the optimal fluid volume for sepsis management. Increasing evidence suggests that the fluid administration during the EGDT era, which followed a permissive intravenous fluid strategy, resulted in suboptimal treatment outcomes. This has raised persistent questions about the appropriateness of the 30 mL/kg fluid resuscitation volume. Additionally, the guidelines do not mention a specific rehydration scheme for septic patients at risk of volume overload, and there is no randomized controlled study for reference. Individualized fluid resuscitation may be necessary for patients at risk of volume overload, as the fixed fluid rehydration amount of 30 mL/kg may not be suitable for all sepsis subgroups. The CLOVERS trial demonstrated that early administration of vasopressors to reduce fluid resuscitation volumes did not decrease the 90-day mortality rate in patients with septic hypotension. In line with these findings, our study emphasizes the importance of tailored fluid management strategies in sepsis, particularly for patients with comorbid heart failure, where the optimal initial fluid resuscitation volume of 10–15 mL/kg within the first 3 h may offer the best clinical outcomes.

### Association between fluid balance and mortality for heart failure and sepsis: a propensity score-matching analysis [^116kUqJU]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Heart failure, as an increasing global prevalent disease, is featured as cardiovascular dysfunction with high morbidity and mortality. More than 64 million people worldwide suffer from heart failure, which seriously affects their quality of life, especially for the elderly. Among these patients, chronic heart failure is more common than new-onset heart failure. Infection is a common precipitating factor to induce acute decompensation in chronic heart failure. The OFICA study published by Logeart et al. demonstrated over a quarter of acute heart failure patients were induced by infection. Furthermore, an Israeli study showed 38% of patients with heart failure were hospitalized because of infection-related factors. Sepsis is regarded as a serious and life-threatening disease featured with multiple organ dysfunction due to patients' dysregulation to infection. Thus, heart failure with sepsis has a complicated pathophysiological mechanism, with high mortality and a high probability of being admitted into the intensive care unit (ICU). The treatment for these patients is full of challenge since the therapeutic strategies for sepsis and heart failure are contradictory. Fluid resuscitation, as an important treatment for early management, is necessary to resolve the tissue and organ hypoperfusion induced by sepsis according to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. However, excessive fluid intake can worsen the congestive symptom and increase the risk of poor prognosis for heart failure patients. Current strategies are empirical, and no relevant guidelines individually provide specific approaches according to various haemodynamic states. There still remained unclear on patients' management for fluid balance status. Therefore, this study mainly discussed the association between fluid balance (FB) of the first 24 h after ICU admission and mortality in critically ill patients with heart failure and sepsis.

### Optimal fluid resuscitation targets in septic patients with acutely decompensated heart failure [^1111uMeL]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, based on the available evidence, it seems that an initial fluid resuscitation volume of 10–15 mL/kg within the first 3 h is considered to be the optimal range for early resuscitation in sepsis-induced hypoperfusion patients with HF, especially in individuals with deteriorated cardiac function. However, it is important to note that further large-scale randomized controlled trials are required to validate and reinforce these findings.

Discussion

Fluid resuscitation is a cornerstone of sepsis management, yet determining the optimal fluid volume for individual patients, especially those with HF, presents a formidable challenge. Our results suggest that the traditional "one-size-fits-all" approach to fluid resuscitation in sepsis may not be appropriate for patients with ADHD. The high BNP levels and the prevalent use of diuretics observed in our study population are indicative of a more active HF process, which may respond differently to fluid management strategies.

Our data indicate that an initial fluid resuscitation volume of 10–15 mL/kg within the first 3 h may be optimal for patients with sepsis and ADHD, particularly in those with worsened cardiac function. This finding is significant as it suggests a tailored approach to fluid management that takes into account the acute changes in cardiac status that can occur in the context of sepsis. It is important to note that for fluid volumes within 15–20 mL/kg, there were no statistically significant differences in in-hospital mortality, 30-day, and 1-year mortality rates compared to the 10–15 mL/kg range. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that this higher range significantly increases the risk of endotracheal intubation. Subgroup analysis revealed that patients classified as NYHA III and IV experienced the greatest benefits from fluid resuscitation within the 10–15 mL/kg range. This range notably outperformed other ranges in terms of reducing mortality rates, as well as intubation rates. Our analysis found no significant association between fluid volume and ICU admission, suggesting that clinicians may lean towards ICU admission for such patients regardless of the administered fluid volume.

### Association between fluid balance and mortality for heart failure and sepsis: a propensity score-matching analysis [^117SPWqX]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, for critically ill patients with heart failure and sepsis, high FB within the first 24 h after ICU admission could serve as an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality and 30-day mortality. The avoidance of fluid overload exerts important effects on reducing mortality in such patients. Future studies are needed to further establish the optimal strategy on fluid status management for patients with heart failure and sepsis.

### Optimal fluid resuscitation targets in septic patients with acutely decompensated heart failure [^1163vtSi]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and population

This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary urban medical center with approximately 175,000 annual hospital admissions. The study spanned from June 1, 2015, to December 31, 2022. This study followed the guidelines outlined in the Reporting of studies Conducted using observational Routinely collected health Data (RECORD) statement and received approval from the Institutional Review Board.

Participants

Participants who met the following eligibility criteria were selected: (1) ≥ 18 years old, (2) diagnosed with sepsis, and (3) had a documented history of pre-existing HF. The definition of sepsis was based on the criteria set forth by the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) as the presence of infection or suspected infection, accompanied by an acute increase in the total Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of at least 2 points. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification was ascertained through medical record review within the last year prior to the onset of sepsis, allowing for an assessment of heart function that is proximate to the patient's condition at the time of sepsis diagnosis. Exclusion criteria consisted of patients (1) with age < 18 years, (2) without signs of infection, (3) had multiple hospitalizations, (4) whose hospital length of stay < 1 day, (5) without a documented HF diagnosis, (6) with indeterminate NYHA classification, (7) who were diagnosed with HF only during the current hospitalization, (8) diagnosed with sepsis after being hospitalized for more than 7 days, (9) transferred from other medical facilities who had already undergone fluid resuscitation, (10) requiring endotracheal intubation prior to fluid resuscitation, and (11) for whom height and weight measurements were unavailable. All included patients were hospitalized; for patients with multiple hospital admissions for sepsis, only their initial admission was considered for analysis.

Background

Emergency physicians express concern administering a 30-cc/kg fluid bolus to septic shock patients with pre-existing congestive heart failure (CHF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or obesity, due to the perceived risk of precipitating a fluid overload state.

Objective

Our aim was to determine whether there is a difference in fluid administration to septic shock patients with these pre-existing conditions in the emergency department (ED). Secondary objectives focused on whether compliance impacts mortality, need for intubation, and length of stay.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective chart review of 470,558 ED patient encounters at a single urban academic center during a 5-year period.

Results

Of 847 patients with septic shock, 308 (36.36%) had no pre-existing condition and 199 (23.49%), 17 (2.01%), and 154 (18.18%) had the single pre-existing condition of CHF, ESRD, and obesity, respectively, and 169 (19.95%) had multiple pre-existing conditions. Weight-based fluid compliance was achieved in 460 patients (54.31%). There was a lower likelihood of compliance among patients with CHF (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24–0.52; p < 0.001), ESRD (aOR 0.11, 95% CI 0.04–0.32; p < 0.001), and obesity (aOR 0.29, 95% CI 0.19–0.44; p < 0.001) compared with patients with no pre-existing conditions. Compliance decreased further in patients with multiple pre-existing conditions (aOR 0.49, 95% CI 0.33–0.72; p < 0.001). Compliance was not associated with mortality in patients with CHF and ESRD, but was protective in patients with obesity and those with no pre-existing conditions.

Conclusions

Septic shock patients with pre-existing CHF, ESRD, or obesity are less likely to achieve compliance with a 30-cc/kg weight-based fluid goal compared with those without these pre-existing conditions.

Results

Patient characteristic

Following a rigorous selection process, 598 septic patients who had a well-documented history of HF were included as participants (Fig. 1). The majority of patients (494, 83.9%) were classified as NYHA functional class III, with a smaller cohort in class IV (22, 3.74%). Approximately 38.4% of patients exhibited an EF less than 50%. Sepsis-induced hypoperfusion was prevalent in 405 (68.8%) patients, primarily originating from pulmonary infections, which accounted for 269 (45.7%) cases. Fluid resuscitation was administered with an average volume of 7.3 ± 7.9 mL/kg (431 ± 462 mL) within the first 3 h, 9.1 ± 8.9 mL/kg (533 ± 518 mL) within the initial 6 h, and 10.7 ± 10.6 mL/kg (624 ± 614 mL) within the first 12 h. Notably, 247 (41.9%) patients did not receive fluid therapy during the initial 3 h, 215 (36.5%) during the first 6 h, and 196 (33.3%) within the first 12 h. Among the entire cohort, 153 (26.0%) patients required mechanical ventilation support. The in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, and 1-year mortality were 147 (25.0%), 129 (21.9%), and 157 (26.7%), respectively. Detailed baseline characteristics are presented in Additional file 1: Table S1.

Outcomes

The primary endpoint was the in-hospital mortality, established by the survival situation of the patient upon their discharge from the hospital. The secondary endpoints were 30-day mortality, 1-year mortality, the need for invasive ventilation within 72 h after fluid bolus, and ICU admission.

### Therapeutic dilemmas in mixed septic-cardiogenic shock [^1174yjZH]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is an increasing cause of decompensation in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction. Sepsis and decompensated heart failure results in a mixed septic-cardiogenic shock that poses several therapeutic dilemmas: Rapid fluid resuscitation is the cornerstone of sepsis management, while loop diuretics are the main stay of decompensated heart failure treatment. Whether inotropic therapy with dobutamine or inodilators improves microvascular alterations remains unsettled in sepsis. When to resume loop diuretic therapy in patients with sepsis and decompensated heart failure is unclear. In the absence of relevant guidelines, we review vasopressor therapy, the timing and volume of fluid resuscitation, and the need for inotropic therapy in patients who, with sepsis and decompensated heart failure, present with a mixed septic-cardiogenic shock.

### Optimal fluid resuscitation targets in septic patients with acutely decompensated heart failure [^113VuqhT]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Several limitations should be acknowledged in this study. Firstly, being a retrospective study, there is a possibility of unrecorded data in medical records, making it challenging to fully account for potential biases that could affect the analysis. Secondly, despite our efforts to consider all possible factors, there may still be unadjusted variables that could impact the results. Thirdly, it is difficult to assess the specific reasons behind patients not receiving fluids, whether due to concerns about fluid overload or other valid reasons. Fourthly, our patient population includes individuals from both the emergency department and the wards, and the timing of sepsis recognition by different physicians or the duration of pre-admission sepsis may vary, potentially influencing patient outcomes. Fifthly, when collecting data on fluid volumes, we solely focused on crystalloid solutions administered for resuscitation purposes, excluding maintenance fluids intended for hypoperfusion correction. Sixth, we recognize that the distinction between chronic and acute HF is not always clear-cut, and our study's findings should be interpreted in the context of a patient population that is likely experiencing an acute exacerbation of their HF. Future research should continue to explore the nuances of fluid management in this complex patient population, with the goal of developing evidence-based guidelines that can improve outcomes for patients with sepsis and HF. Another limitation of our study is the sample size constraint, which limited our ability to perform subgroup analyses for HF categories with EF < 50% as recommended by ACC/AHA guidelines, potentially affecting the generalizability of our findings to more diverse HF populations. Seventh, we have acknowledged the limitations related to the lack of more detailed clinical indicators of acute HF (i.e. pulmonary edema, echo showing cardiogenic shock, peripheral edema/JVP). We recognize that the absence of such data may limit our ability to fully characterize the acute decompensation status of our patients. Finally, our study is its conduct within a single tertiary care center, which may constrain the generalizability of our findings to other healthcare settings or diverse patient populations.

### Comparison of outcomes from sepsis between patients with and without pre-existing left ventricular dysfunction: a case-control analysis [^114bXFUD]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Fluid management in critically ill patients with sepsis is complex, in part because the clinical endpoints for fluid administration change during the course of the septic episode. Initially, there is a general consensus that fluid administration should be liberal and aggressive. Clinical management during the initial 24 hours of therapy emphasize the use of resuscitation goals that implicate sufficient tissue delivery of oxygen and include not only traditional hemodynamic measurements and urine output but also variables related to oxygen delivery and consumption, such as hemoglobin and mixed venous oxygen saturation. Subsequently, however, patient outcomes are improved in critically ill septic patients by observing conservative fluid management strategies. The supporting rationale for the application of conservative fluid management strategies during the late stages of sepsis stem from observations of improved patient outcomes from the use of such strategies for the treatment of acute lung injury. Complex patients with both pre-existing LVD and sepsis might be perceived as being more susceptible than other septic patients to developing respiratory complications from aggressive initial fluid resuscitation because pulmonary edema is a component of the congestive heart failure syndrome. Although patients with an LVEF below 35% did not have a different severity of illness nor different outcomes than patients with LVD but with higher LVEF, they did receive statistically less intravenous fluid during this resuscitation. We speculate that this may reflect practice patterns directed by the assumption just noted. We observed that patients with both sepsis and pre-existing LVD were no more likely to be intubated and require mechanical ventilation than case-matched controls, although the need for intubation was a mortality risk factor in these patients. Additionally, we found no correlation between the amount of resuscitative fluid administered over the first 24 hours and oxygenation in that group of cases and controls for whom data were available. We suggest that patients with sepsis and pre-existing LVD may be no more likely than other patients to develop respiratory compromise from goal-directed volume resuscitation in early sepsis.

### Optimal fluid resuscitation targets in septic patients with acutely decompensated heart failure [^116Jq6KJ]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our optimal liquid volume range was 10–15 mL/kg, which is inconsistent with previous studies. This discrepancy may be attributed to the predominantly severe HF patients in our study cohort. As the severity of HF escalates, the volume of fluid resuscitation required tends to decrease. Therefore, our recommended fluid volume ranges are particularly applicable to patients with severe HF. For patients with milder HF, fluid requirements may exceed 15 mL/kg. Unfortunately, a precise estimate for this subgroup could not be determined due to the limited sample size. Although the 15–20 mL/kg fluid resuscitation range did not statistically differentiate in-hospital mortality in the NYHA III and IV subgroups and the BNP > 4000 subgroup, it significantly increased the rate of tracheal intubation. In the HFrEF < 50 subgroup, our study did not find a correlation between fluid volume and intubation, which may be due to the inherently high intubation rate within this subgroup and the limited sample size that did not show statistical significance.

This study has several strengths. Firstly, we utilized a generalized additive model, which takes into account the nonlinear relationship between fluid volume and outcomes, allowing for exploration of the optimal fluid volume range. Secondly, we gathered comprehensive data for all outcome events. Thirdly, although this study is retrospective, the inclusion criteria for septic patients strictly adhered to the Sepsis 3.0 definition. This means that even patients treated before 2016 were classified according to the latest definition. The diagnosis of HF was also based on clearly documented NYHA classifications in EMR, with all ambiguous cases excluded. Finally, our study exclusively focused on patients who were considered for standard care and fluid resuscitation management. Patients who were under comfort care or hospice care protocols were not included in this analysis to ensure that our findings reflect the impact of fluid resuscitation in patients who are candidates for aggressive treatment measures, and this research is based on real-world data.

### Association between fluid balance and mortality for heart failure and sepsis: a propensity score-matching analysis [^111DkebB]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

As is well-known, limiting fluid intake and increasing fluid output is the principle of heart failure treatment, which is paradoxical with medical treatment for sepsis. Koell et al. noted that fluid overload was associated with adverse prognosis in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction. Fluid accumulation and redistribution result in the expansion of interstitial and intravascular space in organs. Right heart hemodynamic data lack reliability for precise fluid management because of its provided limited information, although commonly utilized for the evaluation of fluid balance status in ICU. Regarding studies on heart failure with sepsis, it has been reported that almost 25% of heart failure patients died of sepsis. The survivors accepted more fluid intake within the first 6 h for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and septic shock.

On the basis of current researches combined with our results, early fluid resuscitation can correct hypotension and increase cardiac output, while late fluid overload by continuous volume intake is harmful. We resume that FB status should be paid attention and the strategy of limited fluid intake should be adopted as long as vital signs have been corrected and reached stability. The cut-off value of FB, instead of positive or negative FB, may provide guidance for the assessment of patients' states and prognosis, and timely adjust the treatment strategy. The speed and amount of fluid intake should be cautiously treated in patients with heart failure and sepsis.

### Optimal fluid resuscitation targets in septic patients with acutely decompensated heart failure [^116R1ZZm]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

To determine the optimal fluid resuscitation volume in septic patients with acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF).

Methods

Septic patients with ADHF were identified from a tertiary urban medical center. The generalized additive models were used to explore the association between fluid resuscitation volume and endpoints, and the initial 3 h fluid resuscitation volume was divided into four groups according to this model: < 10 mL/kg group, ≥ 10 to ≤ 15 mL/kg group, > 15 to ≤ 20 mL/kg group, and > 20 mL/kg group. Logistic and Cox regression models were employed to explore the association between resuscitation volume and primary endpoint, in-hospital mortality, as well as secondary endpoints including 30-day mortality, 1-year mortality, invasive ventilation, and ICU admission.

Results

A total of 598 septic patients with a well-documented history of HF were enrolled in the study; 405 patients (68.8%) had sepsis-induced hypoperfusion. Patients with NYHA functional class III and IV were 494 (83.9%) and 22 (3.74%), respectively. Resuscitation volumes above 20 mL/kg (OR 3.19, 95% CI 1.31–8.15) or below 10 mL/kg (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.14–5.20) significantly increased the risk of in-hospital mortality in septic patients, while resuscitation volumes between 15 and 20 mL/kg were not associated with the risk of in-hospital death in septic patients (OR 1.79, 95% CI 0.68–4.81). In the multivariable Cox models, the effect of resuscitation volume on 30-day and 1-year mortality in septic patients was similar to the effect on in-hospital mortality. Resuscitation volume exceeds 15 mL/kg significantly increased the risk of tracheal intubation, while fluid resuscitation volume was not associated with ICU admission in the septic patients. In septic patients with hypoperfusion, these fluid resuscitation volumes have similar effects on patient outcomes. This association was consistent across the three subgroups with worsened cardiac function, as well as in sensitivity analyses.

Conclusions

Our study observed that an initial fluid resuscitation volume of 10–15 mL/kg in the first 3 h was optimal for early resuscitation in septic patients with ADHF, particularly those with worsened cardiac function. These results need to be confirmed in randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes.

### Pharmacological management of fluid overload [^11172Z4g]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Standard treatment practice for the hypotensive patient with poor tissue perfusion is rapid volume resuscitation; in some scenarios, such as septic shock, this is performed with targeted goal-directed endpoints within 6 h of presentation. As a result, patients often develop significant positive fluid accumulation, which has been associated with poor outcomes above certain thresholds.

Methods

The aim of the current paper is to provide guidance for active pharmacological fluid management in the patient with, or at risk for, clinically significant positive fluid balance from either resuscitation for hypovolaemic shock or acute decompensated heart failure.

Results

We develop rationale for pharmacological fluid management targets (prevention of worsening fluid accumulation, achievement of slow vs rapid net negative fluid balance) in the context of phases of critical illness provided in the earlier Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative 12 papers.

### Association between preexisting heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and fluid administration among patients with sepsis [^115vFG2z]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In an integrated multicenter health care system of community and academic hospitals, preexisting HFrEF was common and associated with a reduced risk-adjusted odds of receiving guideline-recommended intravenous fluids among patients with community-acquired septic shock. Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction was not associated with in-hospital mortality, and intravenous fluid administration did not modify the association between preexisting HFrEF and outcome.

Aggressive, early intravenous fluid administration for septic shock is controversial. Some observational studies show a potential benefit associated with the administration of fluids early in sepsis. However, to our knowledge, no randomized clinical trials demonstrate a specific fluid volume or resuscitation strategy that improves outcomes. Furthermore, excess fluid administration can lead to adverse outcomes, including mechanical ventilation and mortality. Patients with preexisting HFrEF are a particularly challenging subgroup of patients with sepsis, for whom the evidence is even more inconsistent. Our study expands on existing knowledge by showing that patients with preexisting HFrEF are less likely to receive guideline-recommended intravenous fluids, despite showing no differences in markers of illness severity or completion rates of other guideline-recommended care (eg, prompt antibiotics and measurement of serum lactate level).

These results also show that differences in fluid administration practice patterns are not associated with different clinical outcomes, even among patients with preexisting HFrEF. Prior studies have reached variable conclusions about the association of HFrEF with mortality among patients with sepsis, with some studies showing no association and others showing increased mortality among patients with HFrEF. One potential explanation for these variable findings is the inconsistency in how heart failure is defined. Many groups rely on administrative billing codes to define HFrEF; these codes may have poor sensitivity and positive predictive value. To more accurately classify patients, we included only patients with a transthoracic echocardiogram within 1 year of incident sepsis to characterize the presence or absence of preexisting HFrEF by the AHA definition. In addition, our echocardiographic data included other cardiac traits, such as RV and valvular dysfunction.

### Association of positive fluid balance at discharge after sepsis management with 30-day readmission [^112KMvXV]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is a leading cause of hospital death and readmission in the United States. Prior work has suggested that early intravenous fluid administration during sepsis hospitalization is associated with lower mortality, even among patients considered to be at risk for fluid overload, such as those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or heart failure. Thus, adequate fluid administration during the early phase of sepsis care is recommended in current guidelines.

At the same time, a growing body of evidence suggests that excess fluid accumulation is harmful for hospitalized patients, with many concerned about positive fluid balance in sepsis being associated with adverse in-hospital and postsepsis sequelae. Positive fluid balance in critically ill patients has been associated with increased mortality, and fluid-restrictive strategies have resulted in improved outcomes for this population. However, positive fluid balance during hospitalization for sepsis is widely recognized as a surrogate measure of illness severity and thus may be less amenable to practice change.

To our knowledge, few studies address fluid practice in patients with sepsis outside of the intensive care unit (ICU). Although a previous study showed that nearly 80% of patients with sepsis do not require ICU level of care, little evidence is available to guide practice. In addition, many are concerned about the potential that aggressive fluid resuscitation among patients with sepsis is associated with subsequent rehospitalization. For example, heart failure is a leading diagnosis among patients with sepsis who are readmitted, yet the association of interventions such as diuretics (shown to be beneficial in patients with acute decompensated heart failure,) with net fluid balance and readmission risk in patients with sepsis remains poorly understood. To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the association between fluid balance and readmission, yet it is plausible that conservative fluid management may be associated with considerable postdischarge benefit.

We therefore undertook this study to evaluate whether positive fluid balance among non–critically ill patients with sepsis was associated with increased readmission risk, including readmission for heart failure. We sought to test the association between net fluid balance at discharge and 30-day readmission and additionally to evaluate if readmission characteristics differ by net fluid balance during the preceding hospitalization for sepsis.

### Should we measure the central venous pressure to guide fluid management? Ten answers to 10 questions [^112HK5mj]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Question 4: Can CVP be used as a safety variable?

One way to look at changes in CVP during a fluid challenge is to consider CVP as a safety variable. After all, the decision to administer fluids is based on a benefit/risk analysis; the benefits are related to an increase in cardiac output, and the risks to an increase in hydrostatic pressure increasing edema formation. CVP is an excellent variable to estimate the risk associated with extrathoracic organ congestion. Limiting CVP in liver surgery is associated with less risk of bleeding and better perioperative outcomes. Similarly, the incidence of acute kidney injury is increased in patients with sepsis or with congestive heart failure who have elevated CVP values. In patients with sepsis, the risk of developing acute kidney injury increased with the mean CVP values over the first 12 h after admission. In patients with congestive heart failure, those in the two upper quartiles of CVP had more severe renal impairment compared to the other quartiles, even though cardiac output was similar in the four quartiles. These data strongly demonstrate an association between an elevated CVP and an increased risk of developing acute kidney injury, but they do not demonstrate a causal link.

Importantly, the CVP may fail to reflect the risk of developing pulmonary edema, which depends on capillary pressure and hence on left atrial pressure. In these conditions, measurements of pulmonary artery occluded pressure may be preferred as safety variables for the lungs, and/or measurements of extravascular lung water to estimate the severity of lung edema.

### Association between preexisting heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and fluid administration among patients with sepsis [^113Nifbr]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Intravenous fluid administration is recommended to improve outcomes for patients with septic shock. However, there are few data on fluid administration for patients with preexisting heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Objective

To evaluate the association between preexisting HFrEF, guideline-recommended intravenous fluid resuscitation, and mortality among patients with community-acquired sepsis and septic shock.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A cohort study was conducted of adult patients hospitalized in an integrated health care system from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2015, with community-acquired sepsis and preexisting assessment of cardiac function. Follow-up occurred through July 1, 2016. Data analyses were performed from November 1, 2020, to August 8, 2022.

Exposures

Preexisting heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (≤ 40%) measured by transthoracic echocardiogram within 1 year prior to hospitalization for sepsis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Multivariable models were adjusted for patient factors and sepsis severity and clustered at the hospital level to generate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs. The primary outcome was the administration of 30 mL/kg of intravenous fluid within 6 hours of sepsis onset. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit admission, rate of invasive mechanical ventilation, and administration of vasoactive medications.

Results

Of 5278 patients with sepsis (2673 men [51%]; median age, 70 years [IQR, 60–81 years]; 4349 White patients [82%]; median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, 4 [IQR, 3–5]), 884 (17%) had preexisting HFrEF, and 2291 (43%) met criteria for septic shock. Patients with septic shock and HFrEF were less likely to receive guideline-recommended intravenous fluid than those with septic shock without HFrEF (96 of 380 [25%] vs 699 of 1911 [37%]; P < .001), but in-hospital mortality was similar (47 of 380 [12%] vs 244 of 1911 [13%]; p = 0.83). In multivariable models, HFrEF was associated with a decreased risk-adjusted odds of receiving 30 mL/kg of intravenous fluid within the first 6 hours of sepsis onset (aOR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47–0.85; p = 0.002). The risk-adjusted mortality was not significantly different among patients with HFrEF (aOR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.69–1.24; p = 0.59) compared with those without, and there was no interaction with intravenous fluid volume (aOR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.98–1.03; p = 0.72).

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this cohort study of patients with community-acquired septic shock suggest that preexisting HFrEF was common and was associated with reduced odds of receiving guideline-recommended intravenous fluids.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111xdtrT]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — most patients admitted with heart failure (HF) have clinical evidence of congestion without apparent hypoperfusion, and although right- and left-sided cardiac filling pressures are usually proportional in decompensation of chronic HF with low EF, up to 1 in 4 patients have a mismatch between right- and left-sided filling pressures. Elevated natriuretic peptides can help identify HF in the urgent care setting but with less utility in certain situations, including decreased sensitivity with obesity and HFpEF and decreased specificity in the setting of sepsis. Elevated serum lactate levels may indicate hypoperfusion and impending cardiogenic shock.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^115rZTMg]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What is not known — gaps in our understanding — directions for future research.

1) Should vasopressor agent selection be personalized based on patient characteristics (e.g. home medicines and chronic disease conditions)? A decisional process to determine how to individualize vasopressor therapies does not currently exist. Identifying patient-specific factors affecting organ perfusion and vasopressor response in order to adjust perfusion targets is not commonly used in clinical practice. There is recognition that underlying chronic disease states may affect organ perfusion, yet there is a lack of evidence as to how to guide vasopressor selection based on patient-specific factors in the clinical setting.
2) What should the starting dose of norepinephrine be?
3) Is norepinephrine always the appropriate choice as a first-line vasopressor in sepsis? The data surrounding this recommendation are relatively scant. Is there a potential benefit to use vasopressin as a first-line therapy in select patients with septic shock in the broader population or in a select group of patients (e.g. atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease)?
4) Which agent should be considered as second-line therapy, and does this change based upon patient characteristics?
5) What are appropriate thresholds for adding a second vasopressor agent? Trials comparing adjunctive vasopressor strategies have evaluated different endpoints. Whether adding adjunctive therapies to norepinephrine improves safety and survival is largely unknown. Meaningful clinical endpoints aside from survival may potentially include (but are not limited to) need for renal replacement therapy, new arrhythmias, heart failure, thromboembolic disease, digit necrosis, and quality of life. This is vital to understand since adding an adjunctive agent to reduce the dose of norepinephrine without improving survival or reducing adverse events would result in increased costs, possibly without improving patient-centric clinical outcomes.
6) When should patients receive fluid resuscitation versus vasopressor initiation versus both?
7) When should angiotensin II be initiated? Although the ATHOS-3 trial established the efficacy of angiotensin II as a vasopressor agent to raise blood pressure, important questions remain regarding angiotensin II's role in clinical practice, primarily due to the lack of comparative data and potential safety concerns related to the higher rate of thromboembolism observed in clinical trials to date. Although an argument can be made for the benefits of multimodal vasopressor therapy, more outcome and comparative data are necessary both to determine if angiotensin II is clearly beneficial in subpopulations (such as potentially in patients requiring renal replacement therapy) or is potentially harmful when compared with a strategy that does not use this agent.
8) What is the role of phenylephrine, if any, in the management of sepsis?
9) What is the ideal target MAP in septic patients?
10) How do chronic comorbidities (hypertension, CKD), and baseline medications, impact both goal MAP and vasopressor response?
11) What is the cost effectiveness of different vasopressor strategies? Although cost of care has traditionally not been prioritized, it is a significant factor in the clinical environment where utility and efficiency are measured by stakeholders. Understanding that healthcare economics vary widely between countries, in an environment where healthcare costs are rapidly increasing, evaluations of vasopressors need to factor in costs.
12) How should vasopressor therapies be weaned?

In general, individuals in the mortality group exhibited a higher NYHA functional class, a lower EF, and elevated BNP levels. However, when stratified by mortality alone, the initial volume of fluid resuscitation was comparable between the two groups.

In contrast, among sepsis-induced hypoperfusion patients, a U-shaped relationship (P < 0.001) is evident, with the lowest mortality rates observed when fluid resuscitation volumes range from 10 to 15 mL/kg (500–1000 mL) within the initial 3 h (Fig. 2). It is worth noting that among patients experiencing hypoperfusion, 64 individuals (15.8%) did not receive fluid resuscitation within the initial 3 h, and 32 patients (7.9%) still had not received fluid therapy within the first 6 h.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — post-hospital follow-up after sepsis: For adults with sepsis or septic shock who developed new impairments, we recommend hospital discharge plans include follow-up with clinicians able to support and manage new and long-term sequelae (best practice statement), while There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on early post-hospital discharge follow-up compared to routine post-hospital discharge follow-up. The rationale notes that Hospital readmission within 90 days of discharge occurs in approximately 40% of sepsis survivors, and observational data from other populations associate early follow-up — early (within 7–14 days) after discharge in congestive heart failure or within 7 days with a primary care physician among older adults — with reduced or lower 30-day readmission; however, Three studies, one RCT and two observational studies in critical illness did not specifically evaluate sepsis, and the panel recommends follow-up with a provider after hospital discharge but is unable to make a recommendation for early (7–14 days) provider follow-up versus routine follow-up.

### Moderate IV fluid resuscitation is associated with decreased sepsis mortality [^116eLbCU]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Sepsis Mortality and Secondary Outcomes

Patients who received care from physicians in the moderate fluid group experienced a reduced adjusted mortality compared with all other fluid groups: –2.5% vs. very low, –1.4% vs. low, –0.5% vs. high, and –2.5% vs. very high (p < 0.01 vs. very low, low, and very high; p = 0.06 vs. high). These observed differences in mortality persisted, but were smaller for the lower severity and sepsis without day-1 vasopressors subgroups, and were larger for those in the higher severity and sepsis with day-1 vasopressors (Table 2; and Table S6 and Figs. S5 and S6). Analyses that examined risk-adjusted mortality each day (days 1–8) showed that the mortality benefit associated with the moderate fluid group was present at the completion of day-1 and increased each day until day 6, after which the mortality benefit persisted but did not increase in magnitude (Table S7). Physicians in the moderate group administered less median IVFD 1 to patients with preexisting congestive heart failure (3.1 L), end-stage renal disease (2.6 L), and pulmonary hypertension (3.0 L) POA compared with the total cohort (4.0 L). Patients within these groups experienced reduced mortality compared with the very low or very high fluid groups (Fig. S7).

We observed that patients in the moderate fluid group required a lower risk-adjusted rate of mechanical ventilation: –5.8% vs. very low, –2.7% vs. low, –1.2% vs. high, and –5.1% vs. very high during the first day of care (p < 0.01 for all comparisons). This finding persisted across both lower and higher severity groups, among patient subgroups that did/did not require vasopressors on day-1, and patients with congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease, and pulmonary hypertension POA. We observed that physicians who administered a very low or low IVFD 1 did not prescribe higher risk-adjusted rates of vasopressors, while physicians who administered very high IVFD 1 did prescribe more vasopressors (Table 2 and Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Association between fluid resuscitation volume and in-hospital mortality among hypotensive patients with HF. A, C, E, and G represent the relationship between the resuscitation volume (in mL) at 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h, respectively, and in-hospital. B, D, F, and H represent the relationship between the resuscitation volume (in mL/kg) at 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h, respectively, and in-hospital mortality

Subsequently, patient fluid volumes ranged from < 10 mL/kg, ≥ 10 to ≤ 15 mL/kg, > 15 to ≤ 20 mL/kg, and > 20 mL/kg based on 3-h resuscitation volume and in-hospital mortality curves. Among these four groups, the in-hospital mortality rates for hypoperfusion patients were 94 (23.6%), 11 (13.9%), 16 (30.8%), and 26 (43.3%), respectively (Table 2).

Table 2
Demographics and clinical characteristics based on initial 3 h fluid resuscitation volumes (n = 405)

a Restricted to patients who survive more than 48 h

b Restricted to patients who survive more than 72 h

In unadjusted models, resuscitation volumes above 15 mL/kg was associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality compared to 10–15 mL/kg resuscitation volumes, for all septic patients and specifically within the hypotensive patient subset. Resuscitation volumes below 10 mL/kg in hypotensive patients were also linked to an elevated risk of in-hospital mortality. In the multivariable adjusted logistic regression models, fluid resuscitation between 15 and 20 mL/kg is no longer associated with in-hospital mortality (OR 1.79, 95% CI 0.68 to 4.81), while above 20 mL/kg (OR 3.19, 95% CI 1.31 to 8.15) or below 10 mL/kg (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.14 to 5.20) still increased the risk of in-hospital mortality in all septic patients after adjusting for APACHE-II, age, gender, Charlson index, vasopressor use, antibiotic initiation time, lactate, and BNP. Similar results were observed in the hypotensive patient subset (Table 3).

Fluid resuscitation volume and invasive ventilation

Additional file 1: Figs. S5 and S6 demonstrate a clear linear correlation between the volume of fluid resuscitation and the need for invasive ventilation in septic patients as well as in the subgroup of hypotensive patients (P < 0.05). In the hypotensive subgroup, invasive ventilation accounted for 128 cases, which is equivalent to 31.6% of the total. Both unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models consistently showed that resuscitation volumes above 20 mL/kg significantly increased the risk of endotracheal intubation (Additional file 1: Table S4).

Fluid resuscitation volume and ICU admission

In the unadjusted logistic regression model, there appears to be a correlation between fluid resuscitation volume and ICU admission. However, after adjusting for multiple variables, the initial fluid resuscitation volume is no longer associated with ICU admission, either in all septic patients or the hypotensive subgroup (Additional file 1: Table S5).

Subgroup analyses

Subsequently, subgroup analysis was conducted on sepsis-induced hypotensive patients based on NYHA classification, HFrEF, and BNP levels. The subgroups consisted of NYHA class III and IV, HFrEF (< 50%), and BNP > 4000. The results consistently supported the previously drawn conclusions regarding the effect of initial fluid resuscitation volume on various outcomes in these subgroups (Table 5). The Kaplan–Meier curves for each subgroup showed that the optimal resuscitation group had the lowest mortality rate, which was significantly different from the other resuscitation volume groups (Fig. 3). It is important to note that there was no significant difference in fluid resuscitation volume related to mechanical ventilation in the HFrEF < 50% subgroup (Table 5). However, the rate of mechanical ventilation in this specific subgroup was 39%.

Sensitivity analyses

In the sensitivity analysis, the impact of various initial fluid resuscitation volumes on in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, 1-year mortality, mechanical ventilation, and ICU admission remained consistently in line with the previous findings. Additionally, the results within the subgroup of patients showed similar trends (Additional file 1: Tables S6–S11).

### Association of positive fluid balance at discharge after sepsis management with 30-day readmission [^115z5ozP]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Post Hoc Sensitivity Analyses

We did not identify a statistically significant association between fluids received and 30-day all-cause readmission in our sensitivity analyses. Among patients who received larger cumulative volumes of intravenous fluids at discharge, for every 1-L increase, there was decreased risk of heart failure–related readmission (aHR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.90–0.95]) but no association with all-cause readmission (aHR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.99–1.00]) (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Similarly, among patients who received early adequate fluid resuscitation of at least 2.1 L within 24 hours, there was no association between net positive fluid balance at discharge and all-cause readmission (aHR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.92–1.13]) or heart failure–related readmission (aHR, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.78–1.79]) (eTable 5 in the Supplement).

### Association between preexisting heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and fluid administration among patients with sepsis [^111pJoDu]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Study Design and Patients

We evaluated patients with community-onset sepsis. Inclusion criteria were (1) adults (aged ≥ 18 years) hospitalized for more than 24 hours, (2) meeting Sepsis-3criteria within the first 6 hours of presentation, and (3) with transthoracic echocardiography performed at UPMC between 1 and 365 days prior to their presentation with sepsis.

To identify patients meeting Sepsis-3 criteria in the electronic health record, patients had to have met the following criteria within 6 hours of arrival to the emergency department: (1) evidence of suspected infection and (2) presence of organ dysfunction. Evidence of suspected infection was defined as the combination of administration of antibiotics (oral or parenteral) and a body fluid culture specimen obtained. The presence of organ dysfunction was defined as a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scoreof 2 or higher. To understand the performance of guideline-recommended care, we identified patients as having septic shock based on the CMS SEP-1 criteria for hypoperfusion: (1) mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or lower within the first 6 hours, (2) serum lactate level of 4 mmol/L or higher (to convert to milligrams per deciliter, divide by 0.111) within the first 6 hours, or (3) requirement of vasopressors within the first 48 hours. Patients were excluded if they were transferred from non-UPMC institutions.

The primary exposure was HFrEF. Patients were classified as having HFrEF if they met the 2013 American Heart Association (AHA) criterion of ejection fraction (EF) of 40% or less on transthoracic echocardiogram prior to hospitalization for sepsis. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction was not examined owing to concerns about inaccurate patient classification using electronic health record data alone.

Study Outcomes

The primary outcome was the administration of 30 mL/kg or more of intravenous fluids within the first 6 hours of presentation, as recommended by the CMS SEP-1 bundle. Intravenous fluids included any crystalloid solution (eg, 0.9%, sodium chloride; lactated Ringer solution; and commercial balanced crystalloid solution [Plasma-Lyte; Baxter International Inc]). Secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit admission, rate of invasive mechanical ventilation, and administration of vasoactive medications.

### Procalcitonin-guided diagnosis and antibiotic stewardship revisited [^112C8Vz2]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Interestingly, a multicentre trial including 11 Australian ICUs and almost 400 patients found only a modest effect of PCT testing in regard to antibiotic reductions (median number of antibiotic treatment days 9 versus 11). The authors used a 0.1 ng/ml cut-off to stop antibiotic treatment, which may explain the differences to other sepsis trials that used a 0.5 ng/ml cut-off.

In addition, similar to other sepsis markers, PCT has been found to predict the severity of illness. A meta-analysis from 2015 showed a significant difference in PCT on day 1 and 3 between survivors and non-survivors. But cut-off values varied between studies and it was not possible to pool data to a common cut-off value. There have been several trials investigating prognostic scores to determine the severity of SIRS, such as the Predisposition, Insult, Response, Organ dysfunction (PIRO) model and the Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis (MEDS) score. An important consideration in septic patients is that renal impairment and a reduced glomerular filtration rate may lower PCT clearance and levels thus may be higher than expected.

Congestive heart failure

Patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) often present to the ED with dyspnea. It can be challenging to differentiate acute heart failure from a lung infection. PCT may be helpful in this indication for ruling in or ruling out an infection. PCT has thus been proposed as a promising marker for cardiologists. A large study from China found that the severity of CHF was also a predictor for PCT levels in patients with infection complicated by heart failure. A large observational study found a worse outcome in patients with a diagnosis of CHF and an elevated PCT concentration (> 0.21 ng/mL) if they were not treated with antibiotics (p = 0.046). Patients with low PCT values (< 0.05 ng/mL) had a better outcome if they did not receive antibiotic therapy (p = 0.049). Similar results were also found in a secondary analysis of a previous randomized trial and it was speculated that more appropriate treatment decisions due to PCT monitoring could explain this effect (diuretic therapy with liquid restriction in case of acute heart failure versus antibiotics and fluids in case of infection). The role of PCT in the setting of decompensated CHF has potential and needs to be elucidated in future studies. Results from the IMPACT-EU trial may be of high relevance.

### Assessment of outcomes in patients with heart failure and end-stage kidney disease after fluid resuscitation for sepsis and septic shock [^1169Qj74]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis fluid resuscitation is controversial, especially for patients with volume overload risk. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends a 30-mL/kg crystalloid fluid bolus for patients with sepsis-induced hypoperfusion. Criticism of this approach includes excessive fluid resuscitation in certain patients.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of guideline-concordant fluid resuscitation in patients with sepsis and heart failure (HF) or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients with sepsis who qualified for guideline-directed fluid resuscitation and concomitant HF or ESKD. Those receiving crystalloid fluid boluses of at least 30 mL/kg within 3 h of sepsis diagnosis were placed in the concordant group and all others in the nonconcordant group. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay (LOS); vasoactive medications and net volume over 24 h; new mechanical ventilation, new or increased volume removal, and acute kidney injury within 48 h; and shock-free survival at 7 days.

Results

One hundred twenty-five patients were included in each group. In-hospital mortality was 34.4% in the concordant group and 44.8% in the nonconcordant group (p = 0.1205). The concordant group had a shorter ICU LOS (7.6 vs. 10.5 days; p = 0.0214) and hospital LOS (12.9 vs. 18.3 days; p = 0.0163), but increased new mechanical ventilation (37.6 vs. 20.8%; p = 0.0052). No differences in other outcomes were observed.

Conclusions

Receipt of a 30-mL/kg fluid bolus did not affect outcomes in a cohort of patients with mixed types of HF and sepsis-induced hypoperfusion.

Hypovolemia is frequent in patients with sepsis and may contribute to worse outcome. The management of these patients is impeded by the low quality of the evidence for many of the specific components of the care. In this paper, we discuss recent advances and controversies in this field and give expert statements for the management of hypovolemia in patients with sepsis including triggers and targets for fluid therapy and volumes and types of fluid to be given. Finally, we point to unanswered questions and suggest a roadmap for future research.

### Prevalence and predictors of sepsis death in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction [^1165wJt7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Sepsis accounts for almost a quarter of deaths in people with HF‐REF receiving contemporary care, suggesting that ongoing efforts to improve survival will need to carefully consider sepsis prevention and management. Sepsis death is associated with a risk marker profile distinct from other important modes of death, suggesting that it may be amenable to prediction and prevention.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — fluid bolus strategy beyond initial resuscitation: If fluid therapy beyond the initial 30 mL/kg administration is required, clinicians may use repeated small boluses guided by objective measures of stroke volume (SV) and/or cardiac output (CO). In post-cardiac surgery patients, fluid challenges of 4 mL/kg compared to 1 to 3 mL/kg increased sensitivity for detecting fluid responsiveness based on CO measurement. In resource-limited regions where CO or SV cannot be measured, a > 15% increase in pulse pressure during a passive leg-raise test for 60–90 seconds could indicate fluid responsiveness.

### Understanding how clinicians personalize fluid and vasopressor decisions in early sepsis management [^114A7cVu]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Clinical assessment of a patient's volume status also had significant associations with fluid and vasopressor decisions. When a patient was assessed as having dry volume status, an adjusted 66.9% (95% CI, 62.5%-71.2%) of respondents prescribed additional fluid and an adjusted 70.8% (95% CI, 66.2%–75.3%) initiated vasopressors. Conversely, when the patient was assessed as having wet volume status (ie, overload), an adjusted 26.5% (95% CI, 22.3%-30.6%) of respondents prescribed additional fluid while an adjusted 89.3% (95% CI, 86.3%-92.2%) initiated vasopressors (Figure 1 and eTable 4 in Supplement 1).

### Fluid balance and cardiac function in septic shock as predictors of hospital mortality [^1133dzWq]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Cumulative fluid balance and cardiac function predict outcome in patients with septic shock.

- Clinicians treating patients with septic shock should carefully assess the need for intravenous fluids both in the immediate resuscitation period and over the subsequent days of treatment.

- The use of more conservative fluid administration protocols in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock needs additional study to determine their relative efficacy compared to standard of care therapy.

### Understanding how clinicians personalize fluid and vasopressor decisions in early sepsis management [^11379hZ4]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Our results suggest that these fluid volumes are ingrained in practice and guide resuscitation decisions, while other clinical factors appear to play a much smaller role in personalizing resuscitation decisions, at least on average. For example, history of heart failure and kidney failure have historically been associated with increased risk for fluid overload. However, in our study, history of kidney failure and receiving dialysis had a small association with fluid administration decisions while history of HFrEF had no association. This finding may reflect the fact that clinicians are willing to give fluids to patients with these comorbidities, which is potentially beneficial, given evidence that suggests fluids may decrease mortality in these patients. In contrast, respiratory failure has been associated with harm from fluid resuscitation in sepsis trials in lower-resource settings. Additionally, in the CLASSIC trial, there was a signal for potential harm among patients on respiratory support in the fluid-liberal group. Yet, in our survey, oxygen requirement and respiratory rate only had small associations with resuscitation decisions, outweighed by fluid volume. Finally, there is some evidence to support guiding fluid resuscitation by lactate clearance, as suggested in the SSC guidelines. Despite this guideline, we found that lactate trend was not associated with changes in clinical decision-making.

These findings may suggest that apart from fluid volume received, clinicians are not using clinical factors to personalize resuscitation decisions. However, there are several potential alternative explanations for this apparent lack of personalization (Table 2). Importantly, our study only provides an average measure of personalization, measuring effects in the same direction. However, clinicians may be using clinical factors to personalize care in more nuanced ways. Indeed, we observed a range of responses across cases, even in cases where respondents saw the same fluid volume received (eg, all 1 L), which suggests potential unmeasured personalization was occurring.

Table 2.
Limitations and Possible Explanations for the Finding of Lack of Personalization

There are also other tools besides clinical factors that can be used to personalize resuscitation. For example, dynamic measures of fluid-responsiveness may help determine when patients need more fluids vs vasopressors. While these tools have been validated to assess fluid-responsiveness, their role in improving patient outcomes in sepsis has not been well studied. Yet, in free-text responses, many respondents requested dynamic fluid-responsiveness measures (eg, point-of-care ultrasonography or noninvasive cardiac output monitoring), suggesting that clinicians are using these bedside tools. More work is needed to understand how dynamic tools are used in practice and to determine their association with patient outcomes.

### Association of positive fluid balance at discharge after sepsis management with 30-day readmission [^112MoL79]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Although early fluid administration has been shown to lower sepsis mortality, positive fluid balance has been associated with adverse outcomes. Little is known about associations in non-intensive care unit settings, with growing concern about readmission from excess fluid accumulation in patients with sepsis.

Objective

To evaluate whether positive fluid balance among non-critically ill patients with sepsis was associated with increased readmission risk, including readmission for heart failure.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2017, among 57 032 non-critically ill adults hospitalized for sepsis at 21 hospitals across Northern California. Kaiser Permanente Northern California is an integrated health care system with a community-based population of more than 4.4 million members. Statistical analysis was performed from January 1 to December 31, 2019.

Exposures

Intake and output net fluid balance (I/O) measured daily and cumulatively at discharge (positive vs negative).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was 30-day readmission. The secondary outcomes were readmission stratified by category and mortality after living discharge.

Results

The cohort included 57 032 patients who were hospitalized for sepsis (28 779 women [50.5%]; mean [SD] age, 73.7 [15.5] years). Compared with patients with positive I/O (40 940 [71.8%]), those with negative I/O (16 092 [28.2%]) were older, with increased comorbidity, acute illness severity, preexisting heart failure or chronic kidney disease, diuretic use, and decreased fluid administration volume. During 30-day follow-up, 8719 patients (15.3%) were readmitted and 3639 patients (6.4%) died. There was no difference in readmission between patients with positive vs negative I/O (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.95–1.05). No association was detected between readmission and I/O using continuous, splined, and quadratic function transformations. Positive I/O was associated with decreased heart failure-related readmission (HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.71–0.91]) and increased 30-day mortality (HR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.15–1.31]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this large observational study of non-critically ill patients hospitalized with sepsis, there was no association between positive fluid balance at the time of discharge and readmission. However, these findings may have been limited by variable recording and documentation of fluid intake and output; additional studies are needed to examine the association of fluid status with outcomes in patients with sepsis to reduce readmission risk.

### Moderate IV fluid resuscitation is associated with decreased sepsis mortality [^111qD8Sh]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We examined physician and hospital IV fluid resuscitation practices for patients with sepsis and septic shock using the Premier Healthcare Database. We found that while baseline patient characteristics predict that patients with sepsis should receive a relatively narrow range of mean IV fluids on day-1 (95% range, 3.6–4.5 L), in practice they received a much wider range (95% range, 1.7–7.4 L). Our findings indicate that being treated by a physician who on average administers a moderate amount of IVFD 1 (4.0 L; IQR, 2.4–5.1 L) is associated with decreased mortality. Moderate IVFD 1 is also associated with decreased rates of mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use, and new hemodialysis. Contrary to current recommendations to initiate vasopressors early and the common practice of using early vasopressors to reduce resuscitation volumes, we did not observe increased utilization of vasopressors in the lower fluid groups despite increased mortality rates. This may reflect a component of clinical mismanagement as physicians who intentionally adopt a low fluid resuscitation strategy typically supplement fluid with vasopressors to achieve mean arterial pressure resuscitation targets. In a subgroup analysis of patients with baseline heart failure, end-stage renal disease, and pulmonary hypertension, resuscitation with a median of 2–3 L of IVFD 1 is associated with reduced mortality compared with lower or higher IVFD 1. This is consistent with prior work, which demonstrated septic patients with preexisting heart and renal failure experienced reduced mortality following implementation of a sepsis bundle that mandated a bolus of 30 mL/kg compared with lower volumes of IVFD 1. Finally, an analysis that accounted for within- and between-hospital differences found that most of the observed variation in IVFD 1 is attributed to within-hospital physician variation. Physician behavior, independent of patient characteristics that might either trigger IV fluid resuscitation or prompt withholding of IV fluid, accounts for the majority of variation in IVFD 1 practices observed between fluid groups.

### Moderate IV fluid resuscitation is associated with decreased sepsis mortality [^1166hQGA]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Measures

The primary outcome was hospital mortality. The primary independent variable was the attending fluid group based upon resuscitative IV fluid administered before the end of hospital day-1 (IVFD 1). Secondary outcomes were use of vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, diuretics, and the initiation of new hemodialysis (Table S2).

Statistical Analysis

We performed multivariable linear regression that included an analysis of variance to predict the mean amount of IVFD 1 patients should have received based upon patient characteristics POA. These factors included: patient demographics (age and sex), conditions that trigger IV fluid resuscitation (electrolyte disorders and acute organ dysfunctions), and factors that prompt withholding IV fluid resuscitation (end-stage renal disease, heart failure, chronic bronchitis, and pulmonary hypertension) (Supplemental Methods and Table S3). We then used output from this model to examine the attending physician mean residual (observed–expected) IVFD 1. We assigned the physicians by increasing mean residual IVFD 1 into nine equally sized groups. Following inspection, we reduced the groups to five attending fluid groups to make the difference in IVFD 1 between groups clinically meaningful: very low (11%), low (22%), moderate (33%), high (22%), and very high (11%) (Fig. S2).

For our primary and secondary analyses, we used logistic regression to determine the risk of our outcomes for each attending group adjusted for previously validated patient demographics and the severity of illness POA (Table S2). To create the lower and higher severity patient subgroups, we ordered the patients in ascending risk of predicted hospital mortality and split the cohort equally (Fig. S3). In subgroup analyses, we compared outcomes for patients who did and did not require vasopressors on hospital day-1 as well as for patients with congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease, and pulmonary hypertension POA. We then compared primary and secondary outcomes between the fluid groups using the Student t test.

To examine whether differences in mortality associated with IVFD 1 were attributed to physician practices within a given hospital or differences between hospitals, we constructed a fixed-effects logistic regression model that included the hospital identification number as well as the patient variables included in our primary analysis. A flowchart outlining the statistical approach is provided (Fig. S4). Databases were constructed in FoxPro (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA), all statistical analyses were performed in Data Desk (Data Description, Ithaca, NY).

### Do septic patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction require a low-volume resuscitative strategy? [^116BPyq3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Many clinicians are wary of administering 30 cc/kg of intravenous fluid (IVF) to septic patients with reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction (rLVEF), fearing volume overload. Prior studies have used history of heart failure, rather than LVEF measured at presentation, thereby potentially distorting the relationship between rLVEF, IVF, and adverse outcomes. Our goal was to assess the relationship between IVF volume and outcomes in patients with, versus without, rLVEF.

Methods

This was a prospective observational study performed at an urban Emergency Department (ED). Included patients were adults with suspected sepsis, defined as being treated for infection plus either systolic blood pressure < 90 mm/Hg or lactate > 2 mmol/L. All patients had LVEF assessed by ED echocardiogram, prior to receipt of > 1 l IVF.

Measurements and Main Results

We enrolled 73 patients, of whom 33 had rLVEF, defined as < 40%. Patients with rLVEF were older, had greater initial lactate, more ICU admission, and more vasopressor use. IVF volume was similar between LVEF groups at 3-h (2.2 (IQR 0.8) vs 2.0 (IQR 2.4) liters) while patients with rLVEF were more likely to achieve 30 cc/kg (61% (CI 44–75) vs 45% (CI 31–60). In the reduced versus not-reduced LVEF groups, hospital days, ICU days, and ventilator days were similar: 8 (IQR 7) vs 6.5 (8.5) days, 7 (IQR 7) vs 5 (4) days, and 4 (IQR 8) vs. 5 (10) days, respectively.

Conclusions

Septic patients with rLVEF at presentation received similar volume of IVF as those without rLVEF, without an increase in adverse outcomes attributable to volume overload. While validation is needed, our results suggest that limiting IVF administration in the setting of rLVEF is not necessary.

### European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) 2025 clinical practice guideline on fluid therapy in adult critically ill patients: part 2-the volume of resuscitation fluids [^112JaomB]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on the volume of early resuscitation fluid for adult critically ill patients.

Methods

An international panel of experts developed the guideline, focusing on fluid resuscitation volume in adult critically ill patients with circulatory failure. Using the PICO format, questions were formulated, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was applied to assess evidence and formulate recommendations.

Results

In adults with sepsis or septic shock, the guideline suggests administering up to 30 ml/kg of intravenous crystalloids in the initial phase, with adjustments based on clinical context and frequent reassessments (very low certainty of evidence). We suggest using an individualized approach in the optimization phase (very low certainty of evidence). No recommendation could be made for or against restrictive or liberal fluid strategies in the optimization phase (moderate certainty of no effect). For hemorrhagic shock, a restrictive fluid strategy is suggested after blunt trauma (moderate certainty) and penetrating trauma (low certainty), with fluid administration for non-traumatic hemorrhagic shock guided by hemodynamic and biochemical parameters (ungraded best practice). For circulatory failure due to left-sided cardiogenic shock, fluid resuscitation as the primary treatment is not recommended. Fluids should be administered cautiously for cardiac tamponade until definitive treatment and guided by surrogate markers of right heart congestion in acute pulmonary embolism (ungraded best practice). No recommendation could be made for circulatory failure associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Conclusions

The panel made four conditional recommendations and four ungraded best practice statements. No recommendations were made for two questions. Knowledge gaps were identified, and suggestions for future research were provided.

Data extraction

We use SQL (Structured Query Language) for data extraction. The patientunitstayid identifier of the patients with sepsis was used to extract the general information of the patient, including age, gender, weight, height, and ICU type; intervention measures: dialysis, ventilator, and vasopressor; comorbidity: stroke, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), renal failure, liver diseases, diabetes, and cancer; severity scores, namely, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation scoring system (APACHE) IV and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores; infection source; and the number of patients in and out 5 days after the diagnosis of sepsis. Day 1 was defined as 24 h after the diagnosis of sepsis. The daily fluid intake is calculated as the sum of all intravenous and oral fluids. The daily output is calculated as the sum of urine output, stool volume, emesis, blood loss, dialysis ultrafiltrate yield, drainage fluid volume, puncture fluid volume (e.g. ascites, pleural fluid) etc. The invisible losses of liquids were not taken into account because they were difficult to estimate. The daily fluid balance was determined as the difference between the total intake and the total output and was divided into the negative balance group (NB/−) and the positive balance group (PB/+) on the basis of the difference.

The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and the secondary outcome was duration of ventilator use.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^116JnXM9]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What is not known — gaps in our understanding — directions for future research.

1) Should we individualize the initial amount of fluid resuscitation and, if so, how? Applying a standard fluid dose to all patients with sepsis is inconsistent with other areas of sepsis management, where efforts are made to personalize care where possible. What alternative strategies can be readily used in clinical practice to individualize the initial amount of fluid resuscitation to maximize benefit and reduce harms?
2) Which variables should be used to titrate fluid resuscitation? Rigorous trials comparing various dynamic and static variables to evaluate fluid responsiveness are needed. Furthermore, testing various dynamic variables in subgroups of patients with sepsis would be informative. Trials should be designed to incorporate multiple methods of assessing fluid responsiveness.
3) What is the optimal timing for fluid resuscitation? After rapid identification of sepsis and septic shock, time-series studies of fluid resuscitation are needed, especially evaluating the benefits and harms of additional therapies (e.g. vasopressors) and their respective interplay.
4) Which variables should be used to trigger fluid resuscitation and deresuscitation? Related to the timing of fluid resuscitation, should a particular set of physiologic variables be assessed in a serial fashion to determine when to shift from resuscitation to deresuscitation in a structured manner?
5) Is a combined approach using several indices of fluid responsiveness better than using a single measurement in isolation? Furthermore, how should various measures be prioritized to inform clinical judgment?
6) What is the efficacy of using CRT to guide resuscitation in patients with normal lactate levels? Would the use of a rapidly assessable physiologic test be of value in patients without a derangement in lactate levels?
7) What is the duration of effect of fluid resuscitation? Recognizing that the duration of benefit of fluid resuscitation will vary between patients, having some population estimates in mind via pharmacokinetic studies would be useful to clinicians in evaluating therapeutic options and subsequent care.
8) Do early vasopressors limit the amount of fluids required to reach the same hemodynamic target? If so, what is the appropriate ratio of fluids and vasopressors? Identifying if there is a benefit to applying a polytherapeutic approach to early resuscitation is particularly interesting given the concerns regarding excessive fluid administration. A polytherapeutic approach of early fluid administration and vasopressors using a standardized assessment approach considerate of patient variables may be more precise and individualized, thereby maximizing benefit and limiting adverse effects.
9) Should the initial resuscitation of fluids be restricted to hypotensive patients or patients with lactate greater than or equal to 4 mmol/L? In an effort to limit the effects of excessive fluid administration while maximizing benefit in those patients with malperfusion, comparing strategies of fluid resuscitation in distinctive groups of septic shock would be useful.
10) Should the initial fluid resuscitation be administered as a fixed dose of 30 mL/kg or should it be administered in smaller aliquots, with further administration contingent on reassessing the patient condition prior to administering the next bolus? Although the 30 mL/kg bolus carries the risk of under- and overdosing, it has the advantage of being relatively simple to apply, especially in resource-limited settings where advanced measurements cannot be obtained. Administration of smaller doses, repeated as needed according to hemodynamic assessment, has the advantage of fine-tuning fluid administration according to an individual patient's needs. The risk associated with this approach is the potential for adding additional complexity, while still resulting with relatively similar amount of fluids administered and diverting the healthcare team from completing other essential tasks in the initial management of the patient with sepsis.
11) Should sicker patients receive a greater amount of initial resuscitation? In the continuum of sepsis and septic shock, should those patients with more severe physiologic derangements receive greater initial amounts of fluid resuscitation to restore perfusion at the cellular level? Understanding that there may be dose gradient to the initial volume of fluid resuscitation based on the severity of shock would be informative and guide further, targeted research in the field.
12) Should resuscitation differ in patient populations less able to tolerate large volumes? In an effort to individualize sepsis care for subgroups at greater risk of harm from vigorous resuscitation, trials evaluating subgroups of patients with particular comorbidities (heart failure, dysrhythmias, end-stage renal disease) are necessary. The ideal trial in this domain should test two fluid resuscitation strategies using tiered severity in the triggering variables, whereas the fluid boluses should be of similar amount and given only after the evaluation of fluid responsiveness. Ideally, the study should be stratified for subgroups such as heart failure and kidney disease.
13) What is the optimal strategy for fluid resuscitation in resource-limited settings? Data on resuscitation vary significantly between well-resourced and resource-limited settings, as in sub-Saharan Africa, the administration of fluids was associated with an increased risk of death. Understanding the physiology of fluid resuscitation in the absence of other elements of critical care provided in ICUs with higher resources is a key question for a large portion of the world's population. Developing simplified strategies for patient assessment and fluid administration would greatly improve the quality of care delivered.

### Prevalence and predictors of sepsis death in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction [^117FDPgd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our analysis of a large well‐characterized cohort with CHF and reduced LVEF shows that sepsis accounts for almost a quarter of deaths, making this the second most common mode of death after progressive heart failure. We also present the first‐ever analysis of sepsis death risk markers and show that this risk marker profile is distinct from other common modes of death. Importantly, our major observations were unchanged in sensitivity analyses restricted to people with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HF‐REF) defined using the most contemporary definitions (ie, LVEF < 40%). This may have major implications for strategies to further improve the outcomes of people with CHF and poses important questions about whether sepsis can be prevented or mitigated to improve net survival. More broadly, our analyses highlight the heterogeneous mortality of people with CHF, further emphasizing that more nuanced risk stratification and intervention may offer a more effective approach to improve overall survival.

### Prevalence and predictors of sepsis death in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction [^114bDHo4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Advances in the management of cardiovascular disease have been associated with a progressive rise in the prevalence of chronic heart failure (CHF). 1 Similar advances in heart failure care have been associated with greater survival of people who develop heart failure. 2, 3, 4 Importantly, the reduced mortality of people with heart failure has also been associated with an increasing contribution of noncardiovascular modes of death. 2, 5, 6 Sepsis has been identified as a contributor to noncardiovascular death 6, 7 and hospitalization 8, 9 in mixed heart‐failure populations including people with preserved and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). However, which people are at greatest risk of sepsis death and whether a sepsis‐specific risk marker profile exists remain uncertain. We aimed to define the prevalence of sepsis death in ambulant CHF patients with reduced LVEF, define risk markers for sepsis death, and then contrast the risk marker profile of sepsis death with those of other competing modes.

### Early goal-directed therapy: what do we do now? [^113yg4KL]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Does this mean we should go back to the era of 'do whatever you want'? No consensus exists among clinicians regarding optimal hemodynamic monitoring, and to date no method has been proven to be superior. Given the amount of fluids given prior to randomization in the ProCESS and ARISE trials, 'usual care' appears to now include aggressive, early fluid resuscitation with at least 20 mL/kg of crystalloid and rapid administration of appropriate antibiotics. Certainly, this reflects the impact of the original trial by Rivers and colleagues and the broad-based implementation of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines and bundles. If this continues to define 'usual care', then perhaps it is no longer necessary to mandate specific protocols for resuscitation, as it appears that standard sepsis management has evolved to be consistent with published protocols. That would be good news indeed for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

Sepsis as a Distinct Mode of Death

A key finding of our study is the distinct contribution of baseline patient characteristics to the prediction of sepsis, other noncardiovascular, progressive heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. This implies that sepsis is a distinct mode of death and not simply a misclassification of other modes of death. Perhaps more importantly, by showing unique/specific risk markers for each mode of death, our observations suggest that more nuanced risk prediction could guide targeted interventions to improve survival. However, the primary aim of these analyses was to define whether mode‐specific risk marker profiles exist, so further work will be required to understand whether this knowledge can improve care. Importantly, our data do not imply that heart failure–directed care is unimportant to improving outcomes of people most at risk of sepsis death, or vice versa; indeed, heart failure status is likely to be a critical factor in survival from severe sepsis. Instead, our observations highlight prevention and/or treatment priorities to further improve outcomes of patient groups already established on contemporary evidence‐based heart failure therapy. It is also important to clarify that our data cannot be used to infer specific subtypes of sepsis death, such as those related primarily to respiratory failure versus multiorgan failure, but it is likely that sepsis deaths are heterogeneous.

Strengths and Limitations

Our study provides entirely novel insights regarding the prevalence, nature, and predictors of sepsis in people with CHF, with potentially important implications for how we can continue to improve survival. However, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of our study that will need to be addressed by future research. First, we cannot comment on whether increased sepsis incidence or case fatality underpins the association of our identified risk markers with sepsis death. This differentiation is important because it could inform us about the potential value of better sepsis prevention versus sepsis care. Second, the observational nature of our study prevents us from reaching causal inferences about the identified associations of risk markers. Third, it is possible that our data are not generalizable to all heart failure populations, particularly those with preserved ejection fraction, but the existing data from mixed CHF populations across the world provide some support for the high prevalence of sepsis death. Fourth, we do not have data on specific pathogens in most of our patients, reflecting the challenge in establishing this in many cases of respiratory tract infection. Finally, it remains unclear how preventing sepsis death would impact on other outcomes important to people with CHF, and valuable insights may be gained by studying changes in the quality of life of people with CHF surviving severe sepsis.

Wider Context of Sepsis Death

Severe sepsis hospitalization rates more than doubled in the United States between 2000 and 2007, 15 and sepsis has been estimated to contribute to between a third and a half of deaths occurring in US hospitals. 16 CHF is an established risk marker for adverse outcomes during hospitalization with sepsis, 17, 18 and so the improving survival of people with CHF is likely to increase the adverse coincidence of sepsis and CHF. Influenza and pneumococcus vaccinations are an important strategy to prevent sepsis in people with CHF, 19, 20 but given the high uptake of these in UK primary care, 19 our data may suggest that additional strategies are needed. Unfortunately, we do not have data on the provision of vaccination and the incidence of (nonfatal) sepsis in our cohort. A further window of opportunity may be during the management of early sepsis, when recognition of the adverse risk associated with CHF could prompt more intensive monitoring and treatment. However, further research is required to address these issues.

Risk Markers of Sepsis Death

Our study is the first to define risk markers for sepsis death in unselected people with CHF. We found that a wide range of patient factors were associated with sepsis death in univariate analyses, and these broadly reflected age, heart failure severity, and comorbidity. Our multivariate analysis narrowed these to advancing age, COPD, male sex, lower vitamin D, and higher platelet count. Although advancing age is a risk marker for most adverse events, and COPD is unsurprising given that most sepsis deaths were respiratory tract in origin, the other risk markers were potentially less anticipated. Indeed, there are no data linking vitamin D status to sepsis events in people with heart failure; however, low serum vitamin D has been associated with sepsis incidence and mortality in other populations, 21 and a recent meta‐analysis suggested that correction of vitamin D deficiency may reduce respiratory infections. 22

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — dynamic assessment to guide fluid therapy: Heart rate, central venous pressure (CVP) and systolic blood pressure alone are poor indicators of fluid status, and dynamic measures have demonstrated better diagnostic accuracy at predicting fluid responsiveness, including passive leg raising with cardiac output (CO) measurement and stroke volume (SV)–based fluid challenges. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, dynamic assessment to guide fluid therapy was associated with reduced mortality (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.83), ICU length of stay (MD -1.16 days; 95% CI, -1.97 to -0.36), and duration of mechanical ventilation (-2.98 hours; 95% CI, -5.08 to -0.89), although another meta-analysis found no significant difference in mortality versus standard resuscitative strategies. An RCT in Zambia using protocolized IV fluids guided by jugular venous pressure, respiratory rate, and arterial oxygen saturation only led to more fluids in the first 6 hours (median 3.5 L [IQR, 2.7–4.0] versus 2.0 L [IQR, 1.0–2.5]) and higher hospital mortality (48.1% versus 33%) than standard care.

### Association of positive fluid balance at discharge after sepsis management with 30-day readmission [^115b4X3T]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

Our study has some strengths, including our large multicenter sample, use of validated algorithms to identify patients with sepsis, rigorous predefined exclusion criteria, and analysis incorporating granular data drawn from a comprehensive EHR system. We used existing algorithms to identify a cohort of contemporary patients who met Sepsis-3 criteria within 6 hours of presentation. We took careful steps to exclude patients who were critically ill, receiving comfort care, or died during hospitalization. We also excluded patients whose fluid balance might be more challenging to quantify (eg, patients with end-stage renal disease or dialysis requirement who had oliguria or anuria) or whose fluid administration would differ clinically (eg, patients with hypoalbuminemia contributing to edema formation and patients with acute liver failure with low systemic vascular resistance and intravascular depletion). We also excluded patients whose hospitalization was longer than 7 days, as a previous study showed that the mean length of stay for sepsis was 4 days. Finally, we investigated readmission characteristics and stratified patients based on the presence of underlying heart failure or CKD in our primary, secondary, and sensitivity analyses. Our study findings, drawn from multiple community-based hospitals throughout Northern California, are generalizable to the larger community and establish equipoise for clinical trials.

Our study also has some limitations. Despite using detailed EHR data with excellent longitudinal follow-up, we found no association between net fluid balance and readmission. Our findings were very likely to have been impacted by difficulties in ascertaining true, reliable measures of fluid intake and output during the course of a hospitalization, which is a key limitation of our study. Accurate measurement of fluid balance in clinical practice, even in a monitored hospital setting, is problematic for several reasons: difficulty measuring strict oral fluid intake volume, errors of documentation and measurement for urine and stool output, and increased gaps in documentation for healthier, ambulatory patients without fluid restriction orders who do not require urine collection instruments. Thus, it remains likely that electronically documented I/O data fail to represent the full extent of daily fluid intake and output. Although we interpret our findings in light of these challenges, our study helps to establish the need for sepsis fluid management studies that carefully incorporate prospectively collected measures of fluid balance without depending only on EHR documentation.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^115ynsKg]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Fluid balance in sepsis and septic shock — restrictive versus liberal strategies after initial resuscitation: Recommendation 45 states "There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of restrictive versus liberal fluid strategies in the first 24 hours of resuscitation in patients with sepsis and septic shock who still have signs of hypoperfusion and volume depletion after initial resuscitation", with the remark that "Fluid resuscitation should be given only if patients present with signs of hypoperfusion". The rationale notes that "The four largest clinical trials in sepsis resuscitation used moderate to large amounts of fluids in the first 72 hours", with Rivers administering "over 13 L of fluids" and ProCESS, ARISE and ProMISe "approximately 7 to 8 L in the usual care groups"; recent evidence "suggests that IV fluids used to restore organ perfusion may damage vascular integrity and lead to organ dysfunction", and observational and African data have shown an "association of high-volume fluid resuscitation and increased mortality", though generalizability is limited by comorbidities and resource constraints.

### Roundtable debate: controversies in the management of the septic patient – desperately seeking consensus [^1152Hvxt]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Despite continuous advances in technologic and pharmacologic management, the mortality rate from septic shock remains high. Care of patients with sepsis includes measures to support the circulatory system and treat the underlying infection. There is a substantial body of knowledge indicating that fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, and antibiotics accomplish these goals. Recent clinical trials have provided new information on the addition of individual adjuvant therapies. Consensus on how current therapies should be prescribed is lacking. We present the reasoning and preferences of a group of intensivists who met to discuss the management of an actual case. The focus is on management, with emphasis on the criteria by which treatment decisions are made. It is clear from the discussion that there are areas where there is agreement and areas where opinions diverge. This presentation is intended to show how experienced intensivists apply clinical science to their practice of critical care medicine.

### What is the preferred resuscitation fluid for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock? [^1142X2co]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines for the management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock recommend crystalloids as the initial fluid solution of choice in the resuscitation of these patients. In recent years, there have been numerous studies published on the type of fluid used in the resuscitation of patients with sepsis. The primary goal of this article is to determine the preferred intravenous fluid for the resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

Methods

A MEDLINE literature review was completed to identify studies that investigated the type of resuscitation fluid in the management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Articles included were those published in English between 2011 and 2016, enrolled human subjects, and limited to the following types: randomized controlled trial, prospective observational trial, retrospective cohort trial, and meta-analyses. All selected articles then underwent a structured review by the authors.

Results

Nine thousand sixty-two articles were identified in the search. After use of predetermined criteria, 17 articles were selected for review. Eleven of these were original investigations and six were meta-analyses and systemic reviews.

Conclusion

Crystalloids are the preferred solution for the resuscitation of emergency department patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Balanced crystalloids may improve patient-centered outcomes and should be considered as an alternative to normal saline, if available. There is strong evidence that suggests semi-synthetic colloids decrease survival and should be avoided. The role of albumin in the resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis and sepsis is uncertain.

### Fluid management in the critically ill [^111fSKis]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

Fluid therapy, which is provided to restore and maintain tissue perfusion, is part of routine management for almost all critically ill patients. However, because either too much or too little fluid can have a negative impact on patient outcomes, fluid administration must be titrated carefully for each patient. The "salvage, optimization, stabilization, de-escalation" (SOSD) mnemonic should be used as a general guide to fluid resuscitation, and fluid administration should be adapted according to the course of the disease. In the initial salvage phase, lifesaving fluid should be administered generously. Once hemodynamic monitoring is available, fluid administration should be optimized by determining the patient's fluid status and the need for further fluid. This determination can be difficult, however; clinical indicators of hypovolemia, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and urine output, may not detect early hypovolemia, and edema is a late sign of fluid overload. Dynamic tests of fluid responsiveness such as pulse pressure or stroke volume variation can be used in only a small percentage of critically ill patients, and thus a fluid challenge technique is most frequently used to assess ongoing fluid requirements. Once a patient has been stabilized, efforts should start to concentrate on removing excess fluid. Which fluid should be used remains a matter of some debate. Crystalloid solutions are cheaper than colloid solutions, but colloid solutions remain in the intravascular space for a longer period, making edema less likely. Thus crystalloids and colloids should be used together, especially in patients likely to require large fluid volumes. Human albumin is a natural colloid and may have beneficial effects in patients with sepsis in addition to its volume effects. Fluids should be prescribed as are other medications, taking into account individual patient factors, disease processes, and other treatments.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008 [^111pLVtd]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the original Surviving Sepsis Campaign clinical management guidelines, "Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock", published in 2004.

Design

Modified Delphi method with a consensus conference of 55 international experts, several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. This process was conducted independently of any industry funding.

Methods

We used the GRADE system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. A strong recommendation indicates that an intervention's desirable effects clearly outweigh its undesirable effects (risk, burden, cost), or clearly do not. Weak recommendations indicate that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects is less clear. The grade of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. In areas without complete agreement, a formal process of resolution was developed and applied. Recommendations are grouped into those directly targeting severe sepsis, recommendations targeting general care of the critically ill patient that are considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category, include: early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures prior to antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hr of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filing pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for post-operative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B) targeting a blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper GI bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B).

Conclusion

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^114P8Wsu]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Shortly after administration, most patients respond to fluids in the form of improved blood pressure, but this proportion decreases rapidly over time. After initial fluid bolusing, the amount of fluid required to maintain goal blood pressure varies between patients based upon a number of factors, ranging from severity of dehydration to ongoing fluid losses to severity of illness to underlying comorbidities. Understanding when to continue volume loading and when to discontinue additional fluid administration is of critical importance, since excessive fluid administration appears to be detrimental, as suggested by the association between positive fluid balance and poor outcome in observational trials. A meta-analysis of nine randomized trials comparing "low" versus "high" volumes of resuscitation found no difference in outcome, suggesting that individualization of fluid therapy is desired. The duration of the hemodynamic effects of fluids is determined by the amount of fluid administered, capillary leak, and hemodynamic adjustments (including volume adjustments between stressed and nonstressed volumes) resulting from the resolution of compensatory mechanisms initiated during hypovolemia. Very few studies have evaluated the impact of the duration of the hemodynamic effects of fluids in critically ill patients, and it seems that these effects may last less than 2 hours. Conceptually, fluid administration improves cardiac output and tissue perfusion. However, it is critical to note that fluid administration yields inconsistent effects in a cohort of patients. As such, there is increasing recognition of the need for individualizing care. Resuscitation by formula is not suitable for achieving endpoints of resuscitation across a heterogeneous group of patients, as varied needs would result in some patients receiving too much and others not enough fluids. Further, although the rationale for initiating fluid resuscitation is the correction of tissue malperfusion through an improvement in cardiac output, in practice, fluids are often administered in order to correct hypotension or oliguria, whereas indices assessing tissue perfusion, including cardiac output, are often not readily assessable.

A hypotensive episode is associated with an increased risk of death, and the response to an adequate fluid challenge improves upon this discriminatory value for risk stratification. Early fluid therapy targeted to endpoints is associated with a decrease in systemic inflammation, vasopressor use, and mortality and must be distinguished from late aggressive fluid therapy (,–). Multiple studies have shown that the fluid challenge of 30 mL/kg fluid volume within 3 hours of presentation is associated with increased MAP, normalization of Sc 2, and decreased vasopressor use at 6 hours. There is also a 19% relative reduction in in-hospital 30-day mortality and hospital length of stay. This benefit is realized even in patients with a history of renal and heart failure. The benefits of fluid administration are maximal when initiated within 30 minutes, making the fluid challenge an important aspect of early sepsis care. Lee et al concluded that "earlier fluid resuscitation may account for the lack of outcome differences between the original EGDT publication and the more recent three trials (ProCESS, ARISE, and ProMISe) and may have contributed to the overall low 60-day in-hospital mortality rate of 19%".

From hospital arrival (prerandomization period) to the end of the 6-hour study period, the total fluid volume was similar and ranged from 3.5 to 5.5 L for the original EGDT publication and ProCESS, ARISE, and ProMISe study groups. Because of the greater lead time prior to enrollment into these trials, between 2 and 2.6 L of fluid was given prior to randomization. There is striking similarity in the amount of fluid given in all trials that approximates the intravascular volume of 5 L. However, the comparative differences in fluid therapy was 1,482 mL (42.4%), 697 mL (16%), 175 mL (4.1%), and 229 mL (4.4%) between the EGDT and usual or control care treatment groups in the EGDT, ProCESS, ARISE, and ProMISe trials, respectively (Table 1).

MECHANISMS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HYPOVOLEMIA IN SEPSIS

Sepsis-induced hypovolemia can be a result of vomiting (poor intake), diarrhea, sweating, edema, peritonitis, or other exogenous losses. Further contributions to hypovolemia may result from vasodilatation, peripheral blood pooling, extravasation of fluid into the interstitial space, and increased capillary endothelial permeability. Hypovolemia and vasodilatation can be exaggerated in patients with comorbidities such as cardiovascular and renal disease where chronic therapy includes diuretics and afterload reduction. All of these mechanisms result in a decrease in intravascular volume which gives rise to a critical reduction in ventricular preload (central venous pressure [CVP]), ventricular diastolic pressure, stroke volume, cardiac output, systemic oxygen delivery, and an increase in systemic oxygen demands (decreased central venous oxygen saturation [Sc 2]).

Compensatory responses as a reaction to decreased circulating blood volume are mediated by the activation of the neuroendocrine system. A redistribution of blood flow away from skeletal muscle beds and the splanchnic viscera supports vital organ blood flow to the heart and brain, with the augmentation of myocardial contractility leading to increased stroke volume. The constriction of arterial and venous capacitance vessels, particularly in the splanchnic bed, augments the venous return. The activation of the renin-angiotensin axis releases aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Changes in serum osmolarity lead to arginine-vasopressin release from the posterior pituitary. Both enhance fluid retention (,–). Comorbidities, such as congestive heart failure, renal failure, liver disease, and adrenal dysfunction, may modify this salt and water homeostasis and the dynamic "ebb and flow" landscape.

Microcirculatory changes observed in early sepsis such as acidosis, pyrexia, and increased RBC 2,3-diphosphoglycerate occur, creating a local tissue environment to enhance the unloading of oxygen to tissues. Multiple factors may contribute to microvascular alterations, including driving pressure, alterations in RBC rheology, viscosity (local hematocrit), and leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, endothelial dysfunction, and interstitial edema. This is further complicated by the use of vasopressors. The use of techniques evaluating the microcirculation to optimize volume therapy remains to be validated.

TITRATION OF FLUIDS — A WORK IN PROGRESS

Titration of fluid therapy is performed with numerous methodologies. Frequently, more than one method is required to make an accurate assessment. History, physical examination, dynamic, static and volumetric devices, and ultrasound and metabolic variables can be used, each with certain limitations. Inherent in measuring intravascular pressures is the inference that pressure equals volume. There are many instances for which the pressure within an intracardiac chamber may be elevated and the intravascular volume status may be diminished. The goal is to infuse "adequate" volume to restore perfusion before the onset of irreversible tissue damage without raising cardiac filling pressure to a level that produces hydrostatic pulmonary edema. Hemodynamic monitoring used to accomplish these goals can vary and have not been shown to have outcomes superiority. Although much maligned as a predictor of fluid responsiveness, the general use of CVP in the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock has been associated with improved outcomes.

For example, a patient with a CVP of 30 mm Hg, mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 70 mm Hg, heart rate of 80 beats/min, lactate of 5 mM/L, and normal hemoglobin and arterial oxygen saturation and Sc 2 of 44% would get an inotrope. Interestingly, this scenario is associated with increased fluid administration because the CVP is lowered with improved ventricular compliance. A patient with a CVP of 4 mm Hg, MAP of 70 mm Hg, heart rate of 80 beats/min, lactate of 5 mM/L, and normal hemoglobin and arterial oxygen saturation and Sc 2 of 44% would get fluid therapy. If CVP was taken in isolation in the first scenario, one would not assume fluid therapy is indicated and some may mistakenly use a diuretic. An elevated CVP has been associated with increased mortality as an interpretation of volume overload when in reality it may be myocardial suppression. Thus, using all endpoints in an algorithmic approach is the foundation of a comprehensive resuscitation. The discussion regarding CVP is best summarized by Sondergaard et al who stated:

"Knowledge of the CVP is essential for the measurement of the volume state, the performance of the heart and the SVR. It enters considerations of heart, volume and power efficiency. The CVP provides a floating ground for the differential measurement of intravascular pressures. It does not inherently measure preload or the volume state but its measurement is essential to their calculation. Once the above principles are understood, precise control of the circulation becomes a straightforward mathematically predictable process".

Objectives

Rapid fluid resuscitation has become standard in sepsis care, despite "low-quality" evidence and absence of guidelines for populations "at risk" for volume overload. Our objectives include as follows: 1) identify predictors of reaching a 30mL/kg crystalloid bolus within 3 hours of sepsis onset (30by3); 2) assess the impact of 30by3 and fluid dosing on clinical outcomes; 3) examine differences in perceived "at-risk" volume-sensitive populations, including end-stage renal disease, heart failure, obesity, advanced age, or with documentation of volume "overload" by bedside examination.

Design

Retrospective cohort study. All outcome analyses controlled for sex, end-stage renal disease, heart failure, sepsis severity (severe sepsis vs septic shock), obesity, Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis score, and time to antibiotics.

Setting

Urban, tertiary care center between January 1, 2014, and May 31, 2017.

Patients

Emergency Department treated adults (age ≥ 18 yr; n = 1,032) with severe sepsis or septic shock.

Interventions

Administration of IV fluids by bolus.

Measurements and Main Results

In total, 509 patients received 30by3 (49.3%). Overall mortality was 17.1% (n = 176), with 20.4% mortality in the shock group. Patients who were elderly (odds ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.46–0.83), male (odds ratio, 0.66; CI, 0.49–0.87), obese (odds ratio, 0.18; CI, 0.13–0.25), or with end-stage renal disease (odds ratio, 0.23; CI, 0.13–0.40), heart failure (odds ratio, 0.42; CI, 0.29–0.60), or documented volume "overload" (odds ratio, 0.30; CI, 0.20–0.45) were less likely to achieve 30by3. Failure to meet 30by3 had increased odds of mortality (odds ratio, 1.52; CI, 1.03–2.24), delayed hypotension (odds ratio, 1.42; CI, 1.02–1.99), and increased ICU stay (~2 d) (β = 2.0; CI, 0.5–3.6), without differential effects for "at-risk" groups. Higher fluid volumes administered by 3 hours correlated with decreased mortality, with a plateau effect between 35 and 45mL/kg (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

Failure to reach 30by3 was associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality, irrespective of comorbidities. Predictors of inadequate resuscitation can be identified, potentially leading to interventions to improve survival. These findings are retrospective and require future validation.

### Association between fluid balance and mortality for heart failure and sepsis: a propensity score-matching analysis [^113Ttu63]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Data extraction

The following data were collected at the first ICU admission as baseline characteristics: age, gender, weight, ethnicity, infection site, left ventricular ejection fraction, mean arterial pressure (MAP). Laboratory parameters included white blood cell, hemoglobin, pH, serum potassium, serum sodium, serum bicarbonate, serum chloride, serum lactate, serum creatinine, Troponin T, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Medications included angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB), beta-blocker, and vasopressor. The severity of illness was evaluated by sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. Comorbidities included coronary heart disease, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), cirrhosis, and diabetes. Vasopressor included epinephrine, norepinephrine, vasopressin, dopamine, dobutamine, and phenylephrine. Fluid intake and output were recorded at the first 24 h after ICU admission. Fluid intake included crystalloid, colloid, and blood products. Fluid output was defined as urine output, drainage fluid from chest and cerebral tubes, and stool. We calculated the difference between fluid input and fluid output as fluid balance (FB). All the fluid volumes have been corrected for each individual's body weight. All baseline data were included within 24 h after ICU admission.

### Association of positive fluid balance at discharge after sepsis management with 30-day readmission [^112h2knq]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Exposure

Our exposure of interest was cumulative intake and output net fluid balance (I/O) at discharge, calculated from daily flowsheets. Daily flowsheet data obtained from the electronic health record (EHR) measured patients' total intake and output at every 24-hour interval from midnight until midnight the following day. Net fluid balance was characterized both continuously and dichotomously as positive (> 0) vs negative (≤ 0) at discharge. Electronic health record I/O data were reviewed by clinicians for accuracy of fluids received and documented in a random sample of 120 patient records and were found to be concordant, including confirmation that fluid electronically recorded as being administered in the emergency department was captured in the EHR flowsheets. However, as this study was retrospective, we were unable to confirm the accuracy of actual fluid administration and output with electronic documentation, as no non-EHR I/O record exists. We evaluated net fluid balance distribution at discharge, excluding patients with extreme outlier I/O values, defined as those whose values were less than 0.1% (< −19.0 L) or greater than 99.9% (> 20.8 L) at the distribution percentiles. Finally, we compared total fluid intake with total intravenous fluid intake at discharge.

Outcomes

Our primary outcome was 30-day all-cause hospital readmission. Our secondary outcomes were 30-day readmission stratified by category (heart failure, any infection without heart failure, or other) and mortality after living discharge. Readmission categories were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes from the principal discharge diagnosis, primary diagnosis, and secondary diagnoses reported for the hospitalization. Patients were followed up from index visit discharge date until death or 30 days after discharge, whichever came first. Reasons for readmission were further validated by clinician record review of a random sample of 386 patients, including 126 of 2520 patients (5.0%) from the "infection without heart failure" category and 260 of 5212 patients (5.0%) from the "other" category.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^113KRqXV]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Overview of the Presentation

The three fluid and vasopressor questions identified by the Task Force as a whole are as follows:

1) What are ideal endpoints for volume resuscitation and how should volume resuscitation be titrated?
2) What is the optimal fluid for sepsis resuscitation?
3) What is the optimal approach to selection, dose titration, and escalation of vasopressor therapy?

The format for each of the three questions directly mirrors that used in the previously published overview, which contains a more extensive description of the methods. One question was assigned to each author for review and summary. The presentation of each question is followed by a critique of the existing evidence of what is currently known of the subject. Subsequently, each author presented what is not known regarding each question and the gaps in our current understanding of the subject. For each question, the suggested research questions are iterative and aim to address broad areas of uncertainty. Accordingly, clinical outcomes may need to be refined to not only determine mortality benefit but also inform stakeholders on relevant outcomes of interest, such as, quality of life, organ function, and resource utilization. Finally, each author concluded their overarching question by presenting a proposed list of research questions deemed worthy of further inquiry. This list of questions was purposefully intended to be exhaustive, and the authors acknowledge that they may not be answered in the coming decade but are necessary to describe so as to provide a roadmap for where research efforts should be directed.

Question 1: What Are Ideal Endpoints for Volume Resuscitation and How Should Volume Resuscitation Be Titrated?

What is known.

The rationale for fluid resuscitation is largely derived from multiple experimental and clinical studies. Fluid resuscitation increases cardiac output, at least at the early stages of sepsis. In addition, fluid resuscitation increases microvascular perfusion in patients with septic shock, and this is associated with improved organ function.

The impact of fluid resuscitation on outcome is less obvious and is mostly supported by experimental data. Large-scale interventional trials investigating goal-directed therapy did not directly address the amount, timing, or guiding clinical variables beyond central venous oxygenation (Sc 2). In preclinical models of sepsis, fluid administration prolongs survival time compared with no fluid resuscitation, even though long-term outcomes could not be evaluated from these types of studies. Specifically, out-of-hospital fluid administration during transport by paramedics is associated with an improved outcome in hypotensive patients (19), it has not been associated with a benefit, and it may even be associated with increased mortality, in normotensive patients.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008 [^113GKuUS]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the original Surviving Sepsis Campaign clinical management guidelines, "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", published in 2004.

Design

Modified Delphi method with a consensus conference of 55 international experts, several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. This process was conducted independently of any industry funding.

Methods

We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. A strong recommendation (1) indicates that an intervention's desirable effects clearly outweigh its undesirable effects (risk, burden, cost) or clearly do not. Weak recommendations (2) indicate that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects is less clear. The grade of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. In areas without complete agreement, a formal process of resolution was developed and applied. Recommendations are grouped into those directly targeting severe sepsis, recommendations targeting general care of the critically ill patient that are considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hr of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filing pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for postoperative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B), targeting a blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); and a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B).

Conclusions

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Fluid volume overload and congestion in heart failure: time to reconsider pathophysiology and how volume is assessed [^1127sRdH]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Volume regulation, assessment, and management remain basic issues in patients with heart failure. The discussion presented here is directed at opening a reassessment of the pathophysiology of congestion in congestive heart failure and the methods by which we determine volume overload status. Peer-reviewed historical and contemporary literatures are reviewed. Volume overload and fluid congestion remain primary issues for patients with chronic heart failure. The pathophysiology is complex, and the simple concept of intravascular fluid accumulation is not adequate. The dynamics of interstitial and intravascular fluid compartment interactions and fluid redistribution from venous splanchnic beds to central pulmonary circulation need to be taken into account in strategies of volume management. Clinical bedside evaluations and right heart hemodynamic assessments can alert clinicians of changes in volume status, but only the quantitative measurement of total blood volume can help identify the heterogeneity in plasma volume and red blood cell mass that are features of volume overload in patients with chronic heart failure and help guide individualized, appropriate therapy-not all volume overload is the same.

### A rational approach to fluid therapy in sepsis [^112ePTTs]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Aggressive fluid resuscitation to achieve a central venous pressure (CVP) greater than 8 mm Hg has been promoted as the standard of care, in the management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. However recent clinical trials have demonstrated that this approach does not improve the outcome of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Pathophysiologically, sepsis is characterized by vasoplegia with loss of arterial tone, venodilation with sequestration of blood in the unstressed blood compartment and changes in ventricular function with reduced compliance and reduced preload responsiveness. These data suggest that sepsis is primarily not a volume-depleted state and recent evidence demonstrates that most septic patients are poorly responsive to fluids. Furthermore, almost all of the administered fluid is sequestered in the tissues, resulting in severe oedema in vital organs and, thereby, increasing the risk of organ dysfunction. These data suggest that a physiologic, haemodynamically guided conservative approach to fluid therapy in patients with sepsis would be prudent and would likely reduce the morbidity and improve the outcome of this disease.

### Fluid therapy for critically ill adults with sepsis: a review… [^112HKtz6]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance Approximately 20% to 30% of patients admitted to an intensive care unit have sepsis. While fluid therapy typically begins in the emergency department, intravenous fluids in the intensive care unit are an essential component of therapy for sepsis. Observations. Among 3723 patients with sepsis who received 1 to 2 L of fluid, 3 randomized clinical trials reported that goal-directed therapy administering fluid boluses to attain a central venous pressure of 8 to 12 mm Hg, vasopressors to attain a mean arterial blood pressure of 65 to 90 mm Hg, and red blood cell transfusions or inotropes to attain a central venous oxygen saturation of at least 70% did not decrease mortality compared with unstructured clinical care. Among 1563 patients with sepsis and hypotension who received 1 L of fluid, an RCT reported that favoring vasopressor treatment did not improve mortality compared with further fluid administration.

Another RCT reported that among 1554 patients in the intensive care unit with septic shock treated with at least 1 L of fluid compared with more liberal fluid administration, restricting fluid administration in the absence of severe hypoperfusion did not reduce mortality. An RCT of 1000 patients with acute respiratory distress during the evacuation phase reported that limiting fluid administration and administering diuretics improved the number of days alive without mechanical ventilation compared with fluid treatment to attain higher intracardiac pressure, and it reported that hydroxyethyl starch significantly increased the incidence of kidney replacement therapy compared with saline, Ringer lactate, or Ringer acetate. Conclusions and Relevance Fluids are an important component of treating patients who are critically ill with sepsis.

Although optimal fluid management in patients with sepsis remains uncertain, clinicians should consider the risks and benefits of fluid administration in each phase of critical illness, avoid use of hydroxyethyl starch, and facilitate fluid removal for patients recovering from acute respiratory distress syndrome.

### Association between early intravenous fluids and in-hospital mortality among patients with sepsis… [^115CqT8R]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Exposures Intravenous fluids administered by paramedics at the point of first contact and during transportation to the hospital. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included prehospital and emergency department treatment times. Results. Earlier identification of sepsis and initiation of treatment are essential to reducing mortality in patients with sepsis. 1–3 Early intravenous fluid resuscitation is recommended for the management of sepsis, 4 but the optimal strategy for providing intravenous fluids remains controversial. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, documented in either the NACRS or Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database.

Secondary outcomes included the total volume of intravenous fluids provided by paramedics, total prehospital time interval, or the time to assessment by a physician after arrival at the hospital. The total volume of intravenous fluids was determined from the documented "total volume" field or by summing all documented bolus volumes. Time to physician assessment was calculated from the difference between initial assessment time by an ED physician and the documented triage time, both from the NACRS. More than half of the patients with sepsis received intravenous fluids from paramedics, while 142 patients with sepsis received only a saline lock but no intravenous fluids, and 714 patients with sepsis received no intravenous fluids. Among patients who received intravenous fluids, the median volume provided was 400 mL.

Patients for whom paramedics documented a suspicion of sepsis received more fluids than patients with no documented suspicion of sepsis. The association of intravenous fluids with mortality depended on the patient's initial systolic blood pressure. In crude analysis, patients who received any fluids had increased odds of mortality, as did those who received a bolus dose of fluids.
