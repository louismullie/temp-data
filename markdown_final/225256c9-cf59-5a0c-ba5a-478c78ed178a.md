A. 5
B. [5/2]
C. [5/3]
D. [2/3]

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the distance from the focus to the directrix of the conic given by the polar equation ρ = 5/(3 − 2 cos θ). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard polar form of a conic and identify the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum. Then, I should verify how the directrix distance relates to these parameters. Next, I will extract the specific values from the given equation and compute the directrix distance. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and match the result to the correct option.

> Let me first confirm the standard form. The polar equation of a conic with a focus at the pole is ρ = ed/(1 − e cos θ), where e is the eccentricity and d is the distance from the focus to the directrix; this assumes the directrix is perpendicular to the polar axis and on the side opposite to the positive polar axis, which is the conventional setup for this form [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the given equation against that standard. The provided equation is ρ = 5/(3 − 2 cos θ). To match the standard form, I need to divide numerator and denominator by 3 so the constant term in the denominator is 1, yielding ρ = (5/3)/(1 − (2/3) cos θ). From this, I can read off e = 2/3 and ed = 5/3, where d is the directrix distance I'm trying to find [^notfound].

> I will now examine the relationship to isolate d. Since ed = 5/3 and e = 2/3, I can solve for d by dividing ed by e: d = (5/3) ÷ (2/3) = 5/2. Hold on, I should verify that division: multiplying numerator and denominator by 3 gives 5/2, which is correct [^notfound].

> Let me consider the geometric interpretation to ensure consistency. For a conic with eccentricity e < 1, the directrix is a fixed line such that the ratio of the distance from any point on the conic to the focus to the distance from that point to the directrix equals e; here e = 2/3 confirms an ellipse, and the computed d = 5/2 aligns with that definition, so the setup is internally consistent [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the answer choices and select the match. The calculated directrix distance is 5/2, which corresponds to option B. I should double-check that none of the other options equal 5/2; indeed, 5, 5/3, and 2/3 are all different, so B is the correct choice [^notfound].

The distance from the focus to the directrix is **5/2**. This is found by rewriting the polar equation in standard form, ρ = [ed/(1 − e cos θ)], where e = [2/3] and ed = [5/3]. Solving for d gives d = [5/3] ÷ [2/3] = [5/2].

---

## Step-by-step solution

### Step 1: rewrite the equation in standard form

The standard polar form of a conic section with a focus at the pole is:

ρ = [ed/(1 − e cos θ)]

where:

- (e) is the eccentricity,
- (d) is the distance from the focus to the directrix.

Given the equation:

ρ = [5/(3 − 2 cos θ)]

divide the numerator and denominator by 3 to match the standard form:

ρ = [(5/3)/(1 − (2/3) cos θ)]

---

### Step 2: identify eccentricity and ed

From the standard form, we can identify:

- e = [2/3]
- ed = [5/3]

---

### Step 3: solve for the distance to the directrix

Since (ed = [5/3]) and (e = [2/3]), solve for (d):

d = [ed/e] = [(5/3)/(2/3)] = [5/2]

---

## Final answer

The distance from the focus to the corresponding directrix is **5/2**.

---

The correct option is **B**.

3.2 Overview of Analytic Workflow

In Figure 2, we present a high‐level overview of all the steps in the multivariate extreme value framework we propose. In brief, we first estimated a normative model for all the IDPs using age, sex, and site as our covariates. We then applied a warped Bayesian Linear Regression (wBLR) model, which helped us to predict the neuroimaging data from the covariates whilst modeling non‐Gaussianity and providing us with posterior predictive intervals for each prediction. This essentially follows an approach we have validated previously (Rutherford, Fraza, et al; Fraza et al.). We then evaluated the performance of the wBLR model and the likelihood warping by examining multiple error metrics, namely explained variance, mean standardized log loss (MSLL), kurtosis, and skewness (see the supplement for details). Then, we collected the deviation or z ‐scores for each participant and all the IDPs into one z ‐scores matrix, including all the IDPs we modeled. Next, we transformed the marginals and converted them to polar coordinates, which are standard operations in extreme value statistics and will be explained in more detail below. Then, we thresholded the data at the 95‐quantile in polar coordinates. Finally, the TPDM was calculated, based on the extreme quantiles of the data. On this matrix, we performed an eigenvalue decomposition, which gave us an eigenbasis that explains most of the extremal structure in the first few eigenvectors. Finally, we correlated the first few extreme PCs back to behavior to establish a brain‐behavior relationship. These steps are explained in more detail in the next sections.

Left ventricular (LV) standard segmentation and polar map display — slice scheme and map construction: The standard segmentation model divides the LV into three major short-axis slices (apical, mid-cavity, and basal), the apical short-axis slice is divided into four segments, the mid-cavity and basal slices are divided into six segments, and the apex is analyzed separately; data from short-axis tomograms can be combined to create a polar map display representing a 2D compilation of all the 3D short-axis perfusion data, but these derivative polar maps should not be considered a substitute for examination of standard short-axis and long-axis cardiac tomographic slices.

### Adaptive and context-aware volumetric printing [^dba3fa04]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

To enable the 3D mapping of features embedded within the printing volume, we developed a protocol that synchronized the motion hardware with the imaging and printing systems (Extended Data Fig. 1a, Supplementary Video 1 and Supplementary Methods 1–4). On initial homing of the vial, the light sheet acquires images that serve as the input of the computer-vision routines. The resultant fluorescent emission of the optical section is captured by the camera at many angular increments to obtain a dense set of polar cross-sections through the axis of the vial. The process can be repeated for different fluorescence channels. The extracted data are then assigned corresponding per-pixel Cartesian coordinates, producing a 3D point cloud in print-volume coordinate space. Depending on the scanned features and intended model, the raw data can either be sent directly to parametric modelling software or undergo further processing in the form of cluster detection. For this, we used density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), chosen for its efficiency with large datasets, ability to identify arbitrarily shaped clusters, automatic outlier exclusion and lack of requirement for pre-defining the cluster count. Clustering detection was applied when numerical indexing of individual features was required or when centroid coordinates were preferred, as is the case with symmetrical features such as particles, organoids or microspheres. We tested our imaging and feature-detection accuracy with suspensions of standardized polyethylene microspheres (diameter 150 or 500 µm), acquiring images using both a DMD-generated and an external light sheet. The results were benchmarked against conventional microscopy, showing no difference in size detection accuracy (Supplementary Methods 5 and Supplementary Fig. 1). This workflow provided robust feature detection in complex, heterogeneous samples, with the resultant coordinate data passed to the parametric modelling software to automatically generate geometries targeted around those scanned features (Extended Data Fig. 1b and Supplementary Figs. 2–4).

Regions of interest definition in V1 using population-receptive field mapping (pRFs)

Following the retinotopic mapping-based estimation of V1, we identified our regions of interest in V1 using an approach informed by pRF mapping (Supplementary Fig. 2). Using visual field mapping stimulation, population-receptive field mapping allows to estimate which portion of the visual field an fMRI voxel is most responsive to. To compute pRFs, we first created model time courses that predicted how a voxel's time course responsive to a certain portion of the visual field would look during eccentricity and polar angle mapping stimulation. We assumed a standard isotropic Gaussian model; we first created a Gaussian window for every portion of the visual field, defined by its spatial coordinates x and y, as well as by its size (i.e. standard deviation in the Gaussian model). Models of 24 different sizes (i.e. standard deviations) were estimated, with the centre of each Gaussian window being one standard deviation apart from the next. Then, we estimated for each of these models how a voxel's response to the polar angle and eccentricity stimulation should look over time, if it was responsive to that visual portion. In a next step, we computed the correlations between every V1 voxel's actual time course, and the predicted time courses for all portions of the visual field. For every voxel, we then determined which visual portion it was most responsive to, based on which model explained most of the variance of the voxel's responses (r 2) over time.

### Automated discovery of experimental designs in super-resolution microscopy with XLuminA [^af3a40d0]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

We initialize XLuminA with the virtual optical table in Supplementary Fig. 6 a. The loss function corresponds to Equation (2), considering the radial component of the effective beam resulting from the STED process. The discovered topology is depicted in Fig. 4 a. It shapes the depletion beam into a doughnut using phase mask # 2, which corresponds to the spiral phase pattern originally used in STED microscopy. We compute the horizontal cross-section of the focused intensity patterns for both excitation and depletion beams (green and orange lines in Fig. 4 b, respectively) and the effective beam (dotted blue line in Fig. 4 b). The behavior across the vertical axis yields similar features. For comparison, we also feature the radial intensity profile of the simulated STED reference.

The excitation and depletion beams are diffraction-limited. The effective response breaks the diffraction limit. c Discovered optical topology for Dorn, Quabis, and Leuchs (2003). The minimum value of the loss function is demonstrated in detector # 3. Phase masks # 1 and # 2 correspond to the polarization converter demonstrated in Dorn, Quabis, and Leuchs (2003) and a radial phase pattern originally used in STED microscopy, respectively. Both phase patterns generate, independently, a doughnut-shaped beam. d Normalized longitudinal intensity profile, ∣ E z ∣ 2, for Dorn, Quabis, and Leuchs (2003) and the identified solution (black dotted, and green lines, respectively) and radial intensity profile, ∣ E x ∣ 2 + ∣ E y ∣ 2, of the diffraction-limited linearly polarized beam (orange dotted line). Lateral position indicates lateral distance from the optical axis. The spot size is computed as ϕ = (π /4)FWHM x FWHM y, where FWHM denotes Full Width Half Maximum. The discovered approach breaks the diffraction limit, demonstrating a spot size close to the reference. Also, it does not feature side lobes (indicated with a gray arrow), which can limit practical imaging techniques. Details of the initial optical setup, phase masks, and identified optical parameters can be found in Supplementary Information section Rediscovery Through Exploration of Optical Topologies.

### Activity mapping of children in play using multivariate analysis of movement events [^9df454b1]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Medium credibility.

where δ t i and δ d i are the time and amplitude differences, respectively (see Fig. 2 C), t motif is the duration of the motif signal, and n DTW is the total number of samples in the time warped signals. These event parameters can be displayed for a complete activity session in the form of a simple scatter plot. The plot obtained from the sample trace in Figure 1 is shown in Figure 2 D. This provides an individualized, contextual map of movement, and a ready visualization of the child's activity during play. Each point identifies a movement event, thus their density quantifies the amount of activity undertaken and corresponds to the information gathered in a traditional approach, where activity counts are recorded. Here, however, there is also information on the form of each movement, captured in the x and y coordinate values. The Δ d value gives an immediate indication as to the intensity of the movement with the zero point being the reference level of walking (~3 MET·h for the 4 km·h −1 motif). The Δ t value informs on how close the time phasing of acceleration is to a walk step. Values of Δ t > 0 indicate the magnitude of the fractional difference in duration of each movement event to that of the walking stride motif. This is an absolute number and so does not differentiate between shorter or longer duration. Comparison to the motif standard also allows benchmarking of the child's activity to that undertaken in a controlled environment. The areas outlined in red in Figure 2 B indicate the range of values obtained when the motif is compared with other events in the treadmill-study acceleration signal, from which it is extracted. This shows the evolution from walk areas (low Δ t, 3–5 km·h −1) to running (high Δ t, 9–13 km·h −1). The red shaded area centered at zero Δ d is the parameter state space covered by multiple step events acquired at 4 km·h −1 (i.e. stride-to-stride variability in the motif itself). The overlay of data from a staged walk to run exercise of the treadmill (red sections) onto the map of the child's movement (black circles) provides an immediate visual assessment of their activity in the 40 min of play. The spread of data shows the range of activity intensity and indicates the degree of variability compared with the controlled movement on a treadmill running through a sequence of set speeds. A number of features are evident in the child's movement map: (i) a majority of low-intensity events have greater Δ t values than the motif sequence (3–5 km·h −1 section), this reflects the shorter stride duration relative to the adult walk motif; (ii) there is a wide range of movement profile with events (black circles) spanning a continuous area that encompasses the 3- to 13-km·h −1 treadmill reference set; (iii) there are ultrahigh intensity outlier events, which reflect movement for which the sum acceleration is well above that within a gait step produced by an adult running at high speed (13 km·h −1).

### EAE / ASE recommendations for image acquisition and display using three-dimensional echocardiography [^847a61f1]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2012). Medium credibility.

Three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) surface rendering and quantitative analysis — Surface rendering is of primary value for global and regional functional measurements, including 3D echocardiography–guided 2D imaging for measurement of LV volume, ejection fraction and mass. Most vendors offer software packages for both online and offline quantitative analysis of the left ventricle, and typically, this process involves segmentation of the 3DE data set into several equiangular 2D longitudinal planes after initialization of a few anatomic landmarks, such as the mitral annulus and apex, in several conventional 2D planes. If necessary, manual corrections to the endocardial borders can be performed, after which a semiautomated blood endocardial interface detection algorithm allows the calculation of cavity contours and display of their changes during the cardiac cycle providing a volume-versus-time curve. A surface-rendered cavity cast of the left ventricle is then constructed, from which LV volume is computed without geometric assumptions, directly from voxel counts. Wireframe models are effective for defining sections of the left ventricle in position and time, and these 3DE data can be used to assess LV synchrony, regional strain, curvature, and wall stress, although these steps are computationally intensive and are not performed in routine practice. The analysis of regional function is more complex to communicate than global function or even shape; one option is a polar map display incorporating wall motion scoring, and a similar and more dynamic process may be illustrated using contraction front mapping, which illustrates the spatial distribution of contraction and relaxation.

### Engineering phase and polarization singularity sheets [^555d0017]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Engineered polarization singularity sheet

The process for engineering 2D phase-singularity sheets is also directly applicable to engineering 2D polarization singularity sheets. A detailed review of the connection between phase and polarization singularities is provided by Ruchi et al. Polarization singularities can take multiple forms, but here we focus on C -point singularities in which the polarization azimuth Ψ (in a paraxial field, with negligible E z contribution) is singular. Ψ is the angle that the major axis of the polarization ellipse makes with the transverse x -direction (Supplementary Fig. 10). Together with the ellipticity angle θ, which determines the eccentricity and handedness of the ellipse, the pair (Ψ, θ) parameterizes the space of fully polarized light. To deploy phase gradient maximization, we need to identify a complex scalar field σ such that arg(σ) ∝ Ψ. This complex field will exhibit the same geometries in Fig. 1. Maximizing the phase gradient of σ then maximizes the azimuth gradient and produces polarization singularities. One such field is σ = | E x | 2 − | E y | 2 + 2 i ·Re(E x E y *) for which arg(σ) = 2Ψ. This can be written as σ = s 1 + is 2 using the Stokes polarization parameters, which comprise four experimentally measurable intensities that parametrize the full space of polarized (and partially polarized) light. They are defined in Eqs. (4)–(7) using the left-handed convention.where I j refers to the intensity of the polarization component projected in the j direction. For fully polarized light, s 0 2 = s 1 2 + s 2 2 + s 3 2, which allows all polarization states to be assigned a unique point on a sphere in (s 1, s 2, s 3) space — the Poincaré sphere (Supplementary Fig. 10). Lines of constant Ψ are longitudes on the sphere. Just as globe longitudes intersect at the poles so that the longitudinal coordinate is undefined there, Ψ is singular at the Poincaré sphere poles at which circularly polarized light resides. There, s 1 and s 2 go to zero, in analogy to the vanishing of the real and imaginary parts of a scalar complex field at a phase singularity. It is noteworthy, however, that the overall field intensity at the polarization singularity can be non-zero, because s 3 may not vanish.

### Effects of white matter microstructure on phase and susceptibility maps [^7e7b71d7]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The simulated frequency map, due to a sample embedded in a reference medium can be written aswhereandare scalar values describing the isotropic and anisotropic components of a cylindrically symmetric susceptibility tensor, representing the magnetic properties of the sample relative to the surrounding medium such thatwhereandare the magnetic susceptibility of the sample parallel and perpendicular to the principal axis of the cylindrically symmetric susceptibility tensor.andin Equation [1] represent the field perturbations per unit of isotropic and anisotropic magnetic susceptibility, and are given by:

Here, andare spherical polar coordinates in k-space, with the z -axis aligned with the direction of B 0, andare spherical polar coordinates describing the direction of the principal axis of the susceptibility tensor (defined as the x -axis in Eq. [2]) relative to the B 0 direction and denotes a 3D (inverse) Fourier transform. The shape of the sample is represented by the digitized mask function, M, which takes a value of 1 in voxels lying within the sample and a value of 0 in voxels in the surrounding reference medium. Equation [3] is the standard Fourier representation of the field perturbation due to a 3D distribution of isotropic magnetic susceptibility. The derivation of the Fourier expression in Eq. [4], which can be used to calculate the field due to a zero-trace, cylindrically symmetric susceptibility tensor is described in our previous work. For this approach to be valid, the sample must have homogenous magnetic properties: That is, the values ofand, as well as the direction of the principal axis of the susceptibility tensor, must be uniform over the entire sample. The sample used in this study should satisfy these conditions because the direction of the nerve fibers, and the extent to which these nerve fibers are myelinated, is expected to be fairly uniform over a short section of optic nerve.

### Cooperative folding of intrinsically disordered domains drives assembly of a strong elongated protein [^1502a168]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Detection and localization of single fluorophores

Fluorescent spots were detected using the multi-step test (using standardized full width at half maximum and intensity threshold values) in GMimPro. Fluorophores that photobleached in two steps were manually selected and their x, y coordinates exported. Spot intensities for individual particles were then extracted in ImageJas an image stack for a 10 × 10 pixel 2 area. Subsequently in MATLAB (MathWorks, Cambridge, UK), the intensity profile of each particle was processed using a Chung-Kennedy filterand a derivative-based step detection method was implemented to identify the three intensity states of the particle: I 1, two fluorophores fluorescing; I 2, one fluorescing; I 3, none fluorescing. Mean images of the seven frames before and after the first step were used to calculate I 1 and I 2, respectively. Fluorophore locations were determined by fitting a two-dimensional Gaussian function (with integration over each pixel) to I 2 and the difference between I 1 and I 2:

where A is amplitude with centre (x 0, y 0), σ x and σ y describe the widths, θ specifies rotation of the function about the centre and B accounts for background intensity. End-to-end distances were calculated for pairs of fluorophores with eccentricity < 0.04 and presented as histograms. A bin size of 25 nm was chosen to satisfy the Freedman–Diaconis rule. A Gaussian distribution of the form

was fitted to each histogram.

### Routine use of a standardized mastectomy diagram by surgeons improves accuracy and timeliness of the final pathological report [^5d671e5b]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

In the second 6 months, a standardized mastectomy diagram was completed by the surgeons at the time of mastectomy noting the location and preoperative pathologic diagnosis of all benign and malignant lesions, and areas of radiographic concern. A copy of the standardized mastectomy diagram is shown in Fig. 1. The diagrams were usually completed during preoperative case review in preparation for surgery. Surgeon compliance was 100%. These diagrams were provided to the pathology department along with the usual standard pathology forms. The diagrams were then reviewed by the pathologists, pathology assistants, and team of technicians prior to any specimen handling, grossing, and microscopic evaluation. The processing of the specimens followed the same protocol with the following modifications:
The diagram was used as a mastectomy lesion map to direct lesion localization.
Sections submitted to histology were based on the location specified by the surgeon on the diagram.
All sections were labeled with a specific block code and recorded on the breast diagram form.
During microscopic evaluation, the pathologists correlated each histologic section with its corresponding block and location as identified on the breast diagram form.

Fig. 1
Standardized breast mastectomy diagram

The entire pathology department was instructed on how to use the standardized mastectomy diagram. During specimen processing in the mastectomy diagram group, the pathologists performed the same steps in the usual processing method in addition to focusing on the lesions outlined in the mastectomy diagram to ensure that no lesions were overlooked. A sample of a completed standardized breast diagram form, first completed by the surgeon and then by the pathology team, is depicted in Fig. 2.

### Evaluation of ocular residual astigmatism in eyes with myopia and myopic astigmatism and its interaction with other forms of astigmatism [^3442e2b7]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Step 3: Conversion of Astigmatism from Polar to Vector Form

Different forms of astigmatism measured for each eye (RA, ACA, PCA, TNP) are converted from their polar notation of cylinder and axis to the corresponding vector notation of J 0 and J 45 using the following equations by Thibos and Hornerand corresponding Microsoft Excel functions as demonstrated by Millerwhere J 0 is the component of astigmatism that can be represented by the power of a Jackson's cross cylinder at 0°/180°, J 45 is the component of astigmatism that can be represented by the power of a Jackson's cross cylinder at 45°, C is the polar cylinder of astigmatism, and α is the polar axis of astigmatism.

J0 = −(C + 0.00001)/2 × COS(2 × α × π/180)

J45 = −(C + 0.00001)/2 × SIN(2 × α × π/180)

As Miller explains, these equations include conversion from degrees to radians, as this is the form accepted by Microsoft Excel for transcendental functions, as well as a very small number to negate the need to test for 0 or special handling.

Step 4: Calculation of ORA in Vector Notation

ORA is calculated for each eye in vector notation by subtracting the corresponding J 0 and J 45 of ACA from RA. In order to evaluate whether accounting for the posterior cornea affects ORA, we also calculated ORA by subtracting TNP from RA.

Step 5: Conversion of ORA from Vector to Clinical Form

ORA is then converted from vector notation to polar notation using the following Microsoft Excel functionbased on the equations by Thibos and Horner.

C = 2 × √(J0² + J45²)

α = 0.5 × (ATAN2(J0, J45) × 180/π) + 90

Step 7: Statistical Analysis

Data analysis was performed using the software SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 26. Statistical tests were then performed including the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test of normality, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare non-parametric paired sample data, and the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for the direction and strength of correlation between non-normally distributed variables. Statistical significance in this study is defined as a p-value < 0.05, and was considered highly statistically significant if P ≤ 0.001.

### Radiocarbon monoxide indicates increasing atmospheric oxidizing capacity [^13e9d64b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Cosmogenic 14 CO production can thus be thought of as a function of magnetic latitude, pressure, and the SMP, where the "magnetic latitude" is the latitude relative to the magnetic, not the geographic, poles. In conventional, geographic latitude-longitude coordinates, this implies an explicit dependence also on longitude. The generation functionis displayed in Fig. 5.

Fig. 5
The 14 CO galactic source function.

Thick contour: For illustration, the approximate annual-average tropopause pressure. c 14 CO production rate averaged over the Antarctic polar cap (90°S-60°S) as a function of the SMP (section "Normalization of the 14 CO data") and pressure. Contours: Polynomial regression fit to the logarithm of the 14 C production rate (equation 2).

The production maximizes over both poles and is decreasing markedly for an increasing SMP. The contours in Fig. 5 c represent least-squares fits of the formexpressing the logarithm of the production function E as a quadratic polynomial in the SMP s with coefficients U i depending on pressure p. Figure 5 illustrates that 14 CO is dominantly produced over both poles, with production rates around two orders of magnitude larger at 100 hPa than at the surface. However, transport times between the lower stratosphere and the surface can be considerable, relative to the global mean lifetime of 14 CO, especially during summer when upward motion prevails over much of the polar stratosphere, inhibiting any 14 CO reaching the surface. These factors help explain the large seasonality in 14 CO evident in Fig. 1.

### Finding defects in glasses through machine learning [^8f92de01]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Fig. 2
Flowchart of the machine learning model.

The dataset is constructed by comparing all the pairs of inherent structures (IS), focusing on the M atoms that displace the most between two IS (highlighted by colors: bright, resp. dark, indicate small, resp. large particle radius). Specific features are extracted to construct the input vector X. We then train a classifier to predict whether a pair of inherent structures forms a double well potential (DW) or not. The DW is finally processed using a multi-layer stacking strategy to predict the quantum splitting of the double well potential. Our pipeline analyses a given pair of IS in ~10 −4 s.

Its workflow is similar to the standard one, with some major improvements. It proceeds with the following steps: (1)–(3) The first 3 steps are similar to the standard procedure to obtain a collection of inherent structures from a dynamical exploration. (4) Apply the ML model to all possible pairs of IS to predict which pairs form a DW potential. (5) Apply the ML model to predict the quantum splitting (QS) for all predicted DW and filter out the configurations that are not predicted to be TLS by the ML model. (6)–(8) For the pairs predicted to be TLS by the ML model only, run the NEB algorithm and select the pairs that form a DW potential. Solve the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation in order to obtain the exact value of the quantum splitting.

In the Methods section, we provide details on how steps 1–3 are performed: glass preparation, exploration of the potential energy landscape via molecular dynamics simulations and minimization procedure, as well as NEB computation. We also explain how it is possible to use steps 4–5 as a single shot or as an iterative training approach, see Methods Sec. IV H.

Importantly, the well-trained ML model has two significant advantages over the standard approach. First, pairs of IS are scanned to identify TLS, compared to a much smaller numberin the standard procedure. Second, if a pair of IS passes step 5 and goes through the full procedure it is very likely to be a real TLS. As a consequence, by using the ML approach one can spend more time doing steps 2–3 to produce new IS, since fewer pairs pass step 5. At the same time, for any given number of IS, the ML approach can analyze all possible pairs and is, therefore, able to identify many more TLS, as we demonstrate below.

### Tagging of cardiac magnetic resonance images in the polar coordinate system: physical principles and practical implementation [^fe65899f]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

In current magnetic resonance practice, myocardial tagging is implemented by laying down a rectilinear presaturation grid over the heart. Although both the geometry and the deformation of the heart are better described in the polar coordinate system, practical methods for laying down polar grids have been elusive. The theory and implementation of high-density tagging in the polar coordinate system is described in this study.

Methods

Tagging sequences for generating high-density tagging patterns in both radial and circular directions have been developed. The approach, theoretical basis, and experimental results of the suggested sequences for efficient polar tagging are described in this article.

Results

A 10-ms preparation tagging sequence was tested for generating compact radial and circular tag patterns in a magnetization preparation time comparable to binomial rectilinear grid tagging. The sequence was successfully tested on both phantoms and human subjects.

Conclusion

Direct myocardial tagging in the polar coordinate system is practical in acquisition times similar to Cartesian tagging. The deformation patterns of radial and circular tag lines can be used to isolate and analyze the circumferential and radial components of myocardial motion. Further work remains to establish the reliability and robustness of the techniques for a variety of clinical applications.

### Light-microscopy-based connectomic reconstruction of mammalian brain tissue [^47ecd5ef]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

From these measurement errors, the root mean square (RMS) error was calculated across different measurement scales. Finally, the mean and standard deviation of RMS errors across the n = 4 technical replicates were plotted for individual expansion cycles and transformations. For display purposes, we smoothed the measurement error curve with a one-dimensional median filter.

Stitching and fusion of imaging tiles

We extended SOFIMA (, git hash 64d5c7c) to support seamless stitching of 3D tiles. In brief, we processed every volumetric tile with CLAHE, applied independently to every in-plane (xy) section of the tile. The tiles had an in-plane size of 2,048 × 2,048 voxel 2 and an axial extent varying depending on the experiment. We laid out the tiles on a 2D grid according to imaging metadata, and used a coarse positioning step to find their initial location in the coordinate system of the output volume. This was followed by fine alignment to elastically deform them to obtain seamless matches between adjacent tiles and form 3D sections, around 20–30-μm thick. The tiles were then rendered with linear-distance-weighted blending of overlapping image content.

### ASNC imaging guidelines / SNMMI procedure standard for positron emission tomography (PET) nuclear cardiology procedures [^4c9c36a2]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Absolute myocardial glucose utilization — quantitative analysis of myocardial metabolism requires serial imaging for 60 minutes beginning with tracer injection; regions of interest (ROIs) are placed on the myocardium and LV blood pool and copied to all images to generate myocardial tissue and blood pool time-activity curves. These curves are corrected for spillover and radioactive decay, then fitted with a validated tracer kinetic model to obtain regional myocardial glucose utilization in micromoles of glucose per minute per gram of myocardium. Determining glucose metabolic rates further requires glucose concentrations in arterial or arterialized venous blood, and parametric images and polar maps are available, with regional rates color-coded and determined non-invasively via ROIs assigned to the polar map.

### Tracking changes in cardiac output: statistical considerations on the 4-quadrant plot and the polar plot methodology [^45b5d634]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2015). Low credibility.

When comparing 2 technologies for measuring hemodynamic parameters with regard to their ability to track changes, 2 graphical tools are omnipresent in the literature: the 4-quadrant plot and the polar plot recently proposed by Critchley et al. The polar plot is thought to be the more advanced statistical tool, but care should be taken when it comes to its interpretation. The polar plot excludes possibly important measurements from the data. The polar plot transforms the data nonlinearily, which may prevent it from being seen clearly. In this article, we compare the 4-quadrant and the polar plot in detail and thoroughly describe advantages and limitations of each. We also discuss pitfalls concerning the methods to prepare the researcher for the sound use of both methods. Finally, we briefly revisit the Bland-Altman plot for the use in this context.

### Intrinsic neuronal properties represent song and error in zebra finch vocal learning [^bb215c49]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

After the formation of a GΩ seal and achieving whole-cell access, a waiting period of 5–10 min followed while the cell was dialyzed with the pipette solution. A standard stimulation protocol was applied to each neuron, comprising 40 pA steps that were either depolarizing (up to 200 pA) or hyperpolarizing (down to −200 pA). Each 200 ms current step was preceded and followed by 200 ms of quiescence. We also applied currents with mathematically defined complex, chaotic dynamicsresulting in a random mixture of ramps, sinusoids, steps and other forms. Input resistance was measured periodically during each recording and calculated from the change in membrane potential evoked by small (5–25 pA) hyperpolarizing current steps, 200 or 300 ms in duration.

Histology

We filled neurons with 0.5% Biocytin. Slices were processed using standard immunohistochemistry procedures. Mounted sections were screened for successful labeling under epifluorescence using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope. Images stacks were acquired with Zen2010 software (Supplementary Fig. 1a) and viewed using ImageJ. For the developmental studies, we did not see clear axons for 2 neurons out of the 26 recorded from juvenile birds, and since physiological identification of HVC X in juvenile birds was far less secure than in adult birds, we excluded these neurons from our developmental analysis.

Retrograde tracers

Birds were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and the head was secured in a stereotaxic frame. Small craniotomies over left and right Area X were made using predetermined coordinates. Tracer (tetramethylrhodamine dextran; Invitrogen; ~2–5 nl) was delivered into Area X bilaterally via a glass micropipette attached to a gas pressure injection system (Picospritzer, Parker). After a 6–7 day period for tracer transport, the birds were used for brain slice electrophysiology studies. HVC neurons that were retrogradely labeled were easily identified in the recording chamber with the use of epifluorescence illumination. Unlabeled neurons were also recorded to confirm that only retrogradely labeled cells display the physiological phenotype of the targeted HVC X neurons.

### Identification of phases, symmetries and defects through local crystallography [^ce0dffda]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Shown in Fig. 5a–f are eigenvectors (represented as deviations from the average 6 neighbour shape, located in the upper left corner) and their corresponding loading maps. The scree plot is shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. The first eigenvector is the average, and the loading map shows the residual intensity of all six components. To visualize the higher eigenmodes, we plot them as deformation of the average, represented as vectors of deformation from the ideal lattice positions of the neighbours. We further note that these statistical normal modes do not have well defined physical meaning. Practically, they reveal spatial frequencies present in the image from which symmetry can be inferred, allowing the interpreter to ascribe a likely physical interpretation to some earlier PCA components. For example, the second eigenmode corresponds to the uniform shift of the coordinate sphere along one of the principal directions of the primitive hexagonal cell. In this case, the displacement of the entire nearest neighbour sphere is clearly equivalent to the displacement of the central atom in the opposite direction, a polar distortion. In a more general case, the vector sum of the shifts of the nearest neighbour atoms will determine whether the collective distortion being considered is polar or non-polar in nature (non-zero vector sum versus zero vector sum, respectively). The loading map reflects the previously reported antipolar structure characteristic of the M2 phase; interestingly, the antiphase boundary is not apparent on the loading map, suggesting that the antipolar structure is not altered by the presence of the boundary. The third eigenvector corresponds to a symmetric deformation of the neighbourhood similar to a shear mode. The corresponding map is almost uniform, but close examination shows that the contrast of the map exhibits the shift associated with the antiphase boundary, even though no contrast alteration is associated with the boundary itself. The fourth, fifth and sixth components are more difficult to interpret, as the distortions appear to be very complex. The fifth component is somewhat reminiscent of the rotational transformation of the third. Interestingly, the loading maps associated with the third and forth components show very clear contrast at the antiphase boundary, suggesting that these distortions might be characteristic of the frustrated environment of that defect. In contrast, the loading map for the fifth component, similarly to the second, shows no contrast shift at the antiphase boundary. Information of this type could be tremendously useful when determining polar character of different extended defects.

### Myocardial delineation via registration in a polar coordinate system [^e8408650]. Academic Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of premature death in the western world. Analysis of cardiac function provides clinically useful diagnostic and prognostic information; however, manual analysis of function via delineation is prohibitively time consuming. This article describes a technique for analysis of dynamic magnetic resonance images of the left ventricle using a non-rigid registration algorithm. A manually delineated contour of a single phase was propagated through the dynamic sequence.

Materials and Methods

Short-axis cine magnetic resonance images were resampled into polar coordinates before all the time frames were aligned using a non-rigid registration algorithm. The technique was tested on 10 patient data sets, a total of 1,052 images were analyzed.

Results

Results of this approach were investigated and compared with manual delineation at all phases in the cardiac cycle, and with registration performed in a Cartesian coordinate system. The results correlated very well with manually delineated contours.

Conclusion

A novel approach to the registration and subsequent delineation of cardiac magnetic resonance images has been introduced. For the endocardium, the polar resampling technique correlated well with manual delineation, and better than for images registered without radial resampling in a Cartesian coordinate system. For the epicardium, the difference was not as apparent with both techniques correlating well.

### Using grid cells for navigation [^f3e2d7fc]. Neuron (2015). Low credibility.

Algorithmic Solution in 2D

In 2D, the location of an activity bump can be defined by considering any two non-collinear axes (denoted by unit vectorsand). An activity bump at phasein module i then maps onto an infinite series of periodic locations+, wherecan be any pair of integers. We initially assume, for simplicity, that the orientations of different grid modules are aligned, i.e.andare independent of i and that grid firing fields are circularly symmetric as opposed to elliptical, i.e. the scale s i is the same for directionsand(but see). In this case, the location of an activity bump within grid module i can be visualized on a cylindrical polar plot as, whererepresents the direction of the grid axes (e.g.and). Considering the phases of the goal representation along each axis, and following the logic of the 1D solution, the distance and direction to the goal location is indicated by the maximum gradient of a plane through the origin that fits the phase points p j, i + 2 πn j, i for all modules i and axes j and lies within the capacity of the grid cell system (Figure 4 C).

Again, this result can be generalized to arbitrary current and goal locations by replacing the absolute phases p j, i that define the goal location with the phase difference Δp j, i between the current and goal locations on each axis and in each module. This solution is consistent with the Fourier shift theorem (see), with the sets of grid cells in each module that share a common phase on each axis acting as Fourier components of the spatial representation. If grid cell orientations are identical across modules, then the displacement between start and goal locations can be solved independently on each axis as in the 1D case: by finding the line through the origin that best fits the phase points along that axis. We note that it is sufficient to solve for two directions, as more axes do not provide additional independent information — the constraint thatfor 3 directions separated by 120° is implicitly included by fitting lines through the origin. However, given independent noise in the firing rates of biological neurons, pooling estimates across directions could potentially mitigate error in the extracted translation vector. Additionally, if grid cell orientations are not conserved across modules, or if grid firing fields are elliptical, then the solution still holds, but the plane must be fit to a family of phase points that differ in axesacross grid cell modules and in spatial scale s i across axes.

### Spatial tomography of light resolved in time, spectrum, and polarisation [^ccfaedc9]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Measuring polarisation, spectrum, temporal dynamics, and spatial complex amplitude of optical beams is essential to studying phenomena in laser dynamics, telecommunications and nonlinear optics. Current characterisation techniques apply in limited contexts. Non-interferometric methods struggle to distinguish spatial phase, while phase-sensitive approaches necessitate either an auxiliary reference source or a self-reference, neither of which is universally available. Deciphering complex wavefronts of multiple co-propagating incoherent fields remains particularly challenging. We harness principles of spatial state tomography to circumvent these limitations and measure a complete description of an unknown beam as a set of spectrally, temporally, and polarisation resolved spatial state density matrices. Each density matrix slice resolves the spatial complex amplitude of multiple mutually incoherent fields, which over several slices reveals the spectral or temporal evolution of these fields even when fields spectrally or temporally overlap. We demonstrate these features by characterising the spatiotemporal and spatiospectral output of a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser.

### Development methodology of the novel endoscopic stone treatment step 2 / A training / assessment curriculum and a roadmap on developing hands-on training curriculums in future: an international collaborative work by European Association of Urology sections [^9f691d12]. Journal of Endourology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background: Basic simulation training in endourology was established with the endoscopic stone treatment step 1 (EST-s1), which is now recognized worldwide for training and examination. Following on from EST-s1, the endoscopic stone treatment step 2 (EST-s2) was started by the European Association of Urology (EAU) sections. Objective: We describe the methodology used in the development of EST-s2 assessment curriculum. Materials and Methods: The "full-life cycle curriculum development" template was followed for curriculum development, focusing on intermediate training of EST protocol with complex endourologic tasks. A cognitive task analysis (CTA) was run in accordance with EAU Urolithiasis guidelines. The protocol and its details underwent a first consensus by Delphi method with EAU Urolithiasis Section experts in March 2017. Once the outcome and metrics were decided, curriculum development was carried out. Purpose-built stones were developed, and simulator system requirement was defined. Preliminary testing was done in European Urology Residents Education Programme 2019 and in phase five the protocol was finalized with full tutor instruction sheet. Results: The EST-s2/A curriculum development took 38 months and involved EAU Uro-technology and urolithiasis sections with coordination from the European School of Urology training group. Starting from the initial CTA, a 1277-word revision with preliminary task description was produced. Nine intermediate skills were identified and included in the final training protocol. The training content and session evaluations were carried out by 26 experts and 16 final year trainees, respectively. Although the experts agreed that EST-s2/A protocol was well structured (96%), covered the complex endourologic maneuvers (92%), and was useful to optimize and improve hands-on-training (HoT) sessions (92%), the overall evaluation was scored 4.25/5 by trainees. Conclusion: We describe the development methodology for intermediate EST curriculum, which also provides a roadmap on developing other HoT protocols in future. Patients Summary: In this report we described the development of the novel intermediate training curriculum for EST, called EST-s2, which took 3 years of collaborative work inside the EAU. This article is aimed to strengthen the standards in curriculum development and clearly describe the background of this new EAU official endourology protocol.

Optimization of the polarized Raman signal collection geometry.

Comparison between theoretical (red line) and experimental (blue circles) responses of the sum of Si modes versus wafer rotation angle ψ plotted in polar coordinates for Si wafer with surface plane (111) for on-axis (a) and off-axis (b) polarized Raman scattering channels (c), illustration of the incident/scattering polarization and signal collection geometries for a solution with nine polarized channels.

Here, using a concept of ambiguity-free orientation determination data analysis and simultaneous registration of multiple Raman scattering spectra obtained at different polarizations, our approach allows for 2D and 3D quantitative orientation mapping of multigrain materials. First results for silicon, a pharmaceutical tablet and for sapphire reveal favorable specifications: sub-micrometer resolution, fast data acquisition, and a high orientation resolution. The method applies to all Raman active materials independent of crystal symmetry and requires no sample preparation.

### High-dimensional one-shot optical field compressive sensing of structured light [^cb75b8fc]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Now we can calculate the 3D spatiospectral and spatiotemporal light field profiles. Fourier transformation along the spectral domain onyields the 3D spatiotemporal profileof the-polarized light field. For the-polarized light, the 3D spatiospectral phase profile is, and the amplitude one is. The complex amplitudes of- and-polarized light components unambiguously determine the 3D spatiospectral polarization state with a method different from previous approaches using metasurfaces. The 3D spatiotemporal field profileis obtained again through Fourier transformation on, and complete light field information is obtained using Eq. (1). The data reconstruction procedure of the 3D spatiotemporal vectorial optical field is systematically illustrated in Fig. 1e, including all key calculation steps mentioned above.

To prove the concept, we first generate less structured light fields with 3D homogeneous linear, circular, and elliptical polarization states, and test the capability of resolving 3D spatiotemporal amplitude, phase, polarization, and wavelength information. An-polarized, 800 nm, 40 fs laser pulse coming from a 1 kHz Ti:Sapphire laser amplifier transmits through a half-wave plate (WPZ2325-795 from Union Optics Inc.) whose optical axis is −15° to the-direction, so the output laser field is expected to be linearly polarized along -30° to the-direction. Figure 2a shows the actual field profile along the linear polarization direction with the carrier laser frequency reduced by 0.4 times for clear illustration. Meanwhile, the polarization directions of the laser field at selected time slices are labeled by white arrows around −30° to the-direction in Fig. 2b. The 3D intensity profile has a 38 fs temporal duration.

### Microfluidic multipoles theory and applications [^31dd0050]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Upon inspection, the problem can be transformed to streamline coordinates (Fig. 2a) using the function

In the streamline domain Φ, the problem is equivalent to a channel geometry with flows of concentration c = 1 and c = 0 separated by a no-flux boundary condition on the origin. At the stagnation point, the no-flux condition is dropped, and the flows are free to mix (Fig. 2a) (see Supplementary Table 2 for more details on the streamline problem). The separating streamline going from the stagnation point to the aspiration aperture corresponds to the semi-infinite segment of the horizontal axis where the fluids can mix. If the Péclet number is high enough (higher than about 10, which is always realized in microfluidics applications), this segment can be taken to have concentration c = 1/2 and the walls of the channel geometry can be safely ignored (Supplementary Note 1). The problem can thus be decomposed in two problems of advection-diffusion around semi-infinite obstacles of fixed concentration. The problem of advection-diffusion around such a semi-infinite obstacle has been extensively studied in theoretical fluid mechanics, notably in the theory of dendrite solidification, and in the study of out of plane flow in Burgers vortex sheets. It yields the solutionwhere Φ stag is the image of the stagnation point and erf(x) is the error function. The sign of ± is determined by whether we have an incoming flow of concentration c = 0 or c = 1. However, neither of these concentration profiles represent the full dipole footprint when transformed. This can be seen physically in the flow dipole, in which there is both incoming fluid at concentration 0 (aspirated from the system's surroundings), and incoming fluid at concentration 1 (injected by the aperture). To solve this issue, we separate the problem into an "interior" and an "exterior" domain at the streamline of concentration c = 1/2 (see checkerboard insets in Fig. 2). There remains a discontinuity in our solution due to the branch cut of the logarithm functions in Eq. (1), but the solution can be made continuous by placing the singularities on the real axis and using it as an axis of symmetry. The final step is then to obtain the entire solution as a piecewise function assembling the "interior" and "exterior" solutions, given by transforming Eq. (6) back to the dipole flow domain Z. The interior and exterior domains can be defined either by checking the sign of Φ in the streamline domain or by using the expression for the separating line in the Z domain in polar coordinates (see Supplementary Note 2).

### Oxygen evolution reaction on IrO (110) is governed by walden-type mechanisms [^447102a5]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key process for sustainable energy, although renewable sources require the use of proton exchange membrane electrolyzers, with IrO 2 -based materials being the gold standard under anodic polarization conditions. However, even for the (110) facet of a single-crystalline IrO 2 model electrode, the reaction mechanism is not settled yet due to contradictory reports in literature. In the present manuscript, we disentangle the conflicting results of previous theoretical studies in the density functional theory approximation. We demonstrate that dissimilar reaction mechanisms and limiting steps for the OER over IrO 2 (110) are obtained for different active surface configurations present on the IrO 2 electrode. In contrast to previous studies, we factor Walden-type mechanisms, in which the formation of the product O 2 and adsorption of the reactant H 2 O occur simultaneously, into the analysis of the elementary steps. Combining free-energy diagrams along the reaction coordinate and Bader charge analysis of the active site, we elucidate why mononuclear- or bifunctional-Walden pathways excel the traditional OER mechanisms for the OER over IrO 2 (110). Our computational methodology to identify the reaction mechanism and limiting step of proton-coupled electron transfer steps is widely applicable to electrochemical processes in the field of energy conversion and storage.

### Origin and structure of polar domains in doped molecular crystals [^164deab3]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

To calculate different components of the pyroelectric coefficient α, we incorporate key aspects of the T -dependent crystal properties. Temperature change influences the polarization in four ways: first, the lattice parameters change with T, leaving the internal coordinates (that is, locations of nuclei in the cell) fixed; second, the nuclear coordinates can be relaxed to the T = 0 equilibrium positions corresponding to the lattice parameters obtained at the finite T; third, the nuclear coordinates can be updated to appropriate finite- T equilibrium positions (including effects of anharmonic thermal motions); fourth, the lattice parameters change and 'stretch' the passivating surface charges, thereby changing their areal density and contribution to polarization. Using experimentally determined lattice parameters of the host (from neutron diffraction at a range of temperatures, Fig. 3), we incorporate the strain-driven contributions to pyroelectricity.

We can then calculate the average pyroelectric coefficient from a two-point derivative for structures with lattice parameters corresponding to temperatures of 5 and 88 °C, according to the following equation (for more details, see Supplementary Discussion):

where T is the temperature, P is the polarization, ɛ is the strain, σ is the stress, S is the surface area of the unit cell and the subscript '0' in the second term of the equation refers to values derived from the 5 °C structure. The results obtained (−3.0 × 10 −12 C K −1 cm −2, −8.9 × 10 −12 C K −1 cm −2 and −4.8 × 10 −12 C K −1 cm −2 for alanine-, threonine- and serine-doped structures, respectively) are within a factor of two from experiment for all three dopants, but do not reproduce the unique temperature dependence of the serine-doped crystal. We therefore deduced that the dynamic effect, namely, the variation of polarization due to anharmonicity, which is missing from these static DFT calculations, is of importance for distinguishing the pyroelectric trends of the different dopants.

Rare-event analysis/UQ of catastrophic shifts (financial "bubbles") via the identified mean-field SDE

Given the identified steady states at a fixed value of g we performed escape time computations. For g = 45.25, we estimated the average escape time needed for a trajectory initiated at the stable steady state to reach, i.e. sufficiently above the unstable branch. As shown in Fig. 2 b, ψ 1 and R + are effectively one-to-one with, and we can easily find the corresponding critical values for ψ 1 = −0.01 (flipped) and R + = 0.16. We now report a comparison between the escape times of an SDE identified based on the DMAPs coordinate ψ 1 and those of the full ABM. In section F3 of Supplementary Information (SI) we also report the escape times of the SDE forand R + observables. To estimate these escape times we sampled a large number (10,000 in our case) of trajectories. In section F4 of Supplementary Information (SI) we also include the escape time computation by using the closed-form formula for the 1D case. The computation there was performed numerically by using quadrature and the milestoning approach.

In Fig. 2 e, the histograms of the escape times for the identified SDE trained on ψ 1 for g = 45.25 and g = 43.75 are shown. In Fig. 2 f, we also illustrate the empirical histogram of escape times of the full ABM for g = 45.25. The estimated values for the mean and standard deviation, as computed with temporal simulations from the SDE trained on the DMAPs variable ψ 1 for g = 45.25, g = 43.75 and the full ABM at g = 45.25 are here reported in Table 1.

### A model for the fragmentation kinetics of crumpled thin sheets [^a2bca16c]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

As a preliminary step, we derive the final displacement of the strip when folded at each break, in the absence of confinement. This problem can be mapped to the displacement of a walker performing a one-dimensional random walk with gamma-distributed steps. To enforce the concept of folding, the walker's steps occur in alternating directions. The distribution f Z (z) of position Z after 2 k steps accurate for all k is derived in full in Supplementary Note 2. However, the salient trends may be likewise observed by applying the central limit theorem and considering the position Z valid for large k, or small step size, which givesand describes a normal distribution of zero mean and variance L 0 θ.

If a confinement is now introduced at the locations ∣ z ∣ = w, we next ask with what likelihood the walker steps beyond this confinement. One approach to approximate this probability is to integrate Eq. (16) for all ∣ z ∣ > w, producing a two-sided survival function of Eq. (16). Although this is not equivalent to our initial question, as intermediate steps may also have landed past ∣ z ∣ > w, it proves an acceptable estimate as the last step has the greatest variance. A more accurate calculation would be to evaluate the likelihood that a given walk escapes the confinement at any step; however, looking at the last step is useful for its simplicity in analytical form, and still captures the anticipated behavior. A comparison to the more accurate formulation is made numerically and provided in Supplementary Fig. 9. Once again, we pursue here the simpler form of the survival function valid for large k, and refer to Supplementary Note 2 for the exact derivation valid at all k. The survival function of Eq. (16), S Z (w; θ) = P (∣ Z ∣ > w; w ≥ 0), for a threshold confinement w, is given bywhere erf(z) is the error function. In order for walkers at ∣ z ∣ > w to be restored within the limits of confinement, one or more of their steps must fragment, thereby increasing the number of steps taken and decreasing the overall average, which drives the evolution of fragmentation. This articulates our key claim: considering our original, cylindrically shaped sheets as a statistical ensemble of one-dimensional random walks, we suggest that the progression of fragmentation measured by a change d t, over a single crumpling iteration d n, should be proportional to the fraction of walks in the ensemble which leave the confinement imposed at ∣ z ∣ = w: d t /d n ~ S Z (w; θ). Equivalently, this is the likelihood that a single random walk leaves the critical confinement. We note that this resulting fragmentation rate describes an average fragmentation likelihood given only a confinement w and current temporal parameter t = 1/ θ describing the maturity of the fragmentation process thus far; it does not enforce direct correlations between successive crumpling iterations, whereby new folds should occur preferentially along previous ones. Instead, the decrease in fragmentation rate with n is encoded through the decreasing mean facet area with t. Moreover, while stronger correlation is expected between walks representing nearby transects of the sheet, here we consider the statistical behavior of the sheet as a whole, and account for the increased fragmentation likelihood for facets with larger horizontal extent through the weighting introduced in Eq. (15). At present, Eq. (17) gives the likelihood that new creases will form; however, it does not yet describe how much new damage is created, for which two additional factors should be considered: (1) When the sheet is strongly confined in closely packed layers, the layers tend to collectively fragment, as alluded to by Sultan and Boudaoudand Gottesman et al. thus contributing a factor p ~ 1/ L such that halving the final height doubles the number of additional ridges. (2) In the opposite limit of low compaction, facets are not in close proximity and need not behave cooperatively; thus, new damage scales linearly with the amount of compression L 0 − L, as argued in Gottesman et al. With these additional considerations, we propose that the evolution of the fragmentation process with crumpling iteration behaves aswhere α is a fitted constant of proportionality. We indicate the explicit dependence on t here, as t and θ are inversely related. The critical width w is determined by the geometry of the imposed confinement, as illustrated in Fig. 6 d; a complete derivation is provided in Supplementary Note 4 :where R is the radius of the container. By consequence of Eq. (14) we can directly relate Eqs. (18) and (12) asand obtain a fit to the proportionality constant α. By performing an asymptotic approximation in the limit of large t, detailed in Supplementary Note 3, Eq. (18) may be analytically integrated to provide a scaling relationwhich bears similarity toof Eq. (11):where, and L 0 and R are the sheet length (equivalently the confining container height) and container radius, respectively. Taken together, Eqs. (14) and (21) thereby provide a theoretically motivated expressionbased on properties of fragmentation kinetics and a simple mechanism for re-fragmentation formulated as a random walk. Figure 7 compares the agreement of the empirical relations δ ℓ empir. and ℓ empir. as well as the derived models δ ℓ model and, with the measured quantitiesand ℓ meas. for various n. Collectively, the results of Figs. 4 and 7 demonstrate clear consistency of the fragmentation model with the anticipated logarithmic growth.

### Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging guidelines: instrumentation, acquisition, processing, and interpretation [^79404bd3]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

SPECT myocardial perfusion quantitation — normal database–referenced metrics and reversibility criteria are defined as follows: it is customary to use separate, normal databases specific to the imaging camera, the reconstruction method, the patient's gender, as well as the perfusion agent used. Defect extent may be quantitatively expressed as a percentage of the entire LV, or as a percentage of individual vascular territories, and defect severity may be quantitatively expressed as the number of standard deviations by which the average varies from the normal range for that particular segment; segmental scores can also be computed automatically, and an integrated measure of defect extent and severity (total perfusion defect) may provide valuable diagnostic and prognostic information. Quantitative analysis should only be used as an adjunct to, and not a substitute for, visual analysis. Reversibility of perfusion defects may be categorized qualitatively as partial or complete; on a semiquantitative scoring system it may be defined as a greater than or equal to 2-grade improvement or improvement to a score of 1, and on a quantitative polar plot reversibility is typically described as improvement to a pixel density of less than 2.5 standard deviations from the normal reference redistribution or resting database, although the number of pixels required is arbitrary. Reverse redistribution refers to segments with decreased or normal intensity on the initial set of images that show even less relative intensity on the delayed images.

### Engineering phase and polarization singularity sheets [^d73719c8]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fig. 2
Comparison between phase gradient maximization and field minimization to obtain phase singularities.

Both methods can be used to obtain phase singularities, but they produce different field behavior in terms of its real (blue) and imaginary (red) zero-isosurfaces. Yellow dots label the positions at which the field and phase gradients are optimized. Inset surface plots are the logarithmically scaled field intensities at z = 0 μm over the same XY domain. The z = 0 μm plane is indicated with the gray plane in each isosurface plot. a When the phase gradient in a specified direction is maximized, the two zero-isosurfaces align approximately tangentially and in the direction normal to that specified gradient. This produces a flat low field intensity structure along these aligned zero-isosurfaces. b Minimizing the field amplitude at a point to produce a singularity merely enforces a crossing of the zero-isosurfaces without any alignment, producing a 1D line singularity. c Simultaneously optimizing two nearby points with directed phase gradients can extend the range of the singularity sheet. d Minimizing the field amplitude at two points simultaneously does not guarantee alignment of the zero-isosurfaces and can instead produce multiple crossing lines, each producing a 1D line singularity.

### Practical guide for interpreting and reporting cardiac PET measurements of myocardial blood flow: an information statement from the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology, and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging [^b4a2d4ce]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Compartment model — placement of ROIs and time-activity curves includes reviewing myocardial ROI placement in each frame, correcting motion (particularly in the blood pool phase) and interpreting any study with patient motion with caution, and recognizing that dynamic curves show the blood pool and myocardial activities, the model fit, blood pool spillover, and the partial-volume-corrected myocardial curve; the blood pool and myocardial activity curves should start at zero with at least one background frame prior to radiotracer infusion and have single peaks, rest and stress blood pool curves should have similar shapes and peaks with stress peaks somewhat lower, uptake and myocardial blood flow (MBF) maps should have similar regional distributions with homogeneous goodness-of-fit parameter polar maps showing high values for the R² map and low values for the χ² map, and blood pool spillover polar maps used for partial-volume correction should be carefully examined because asymmetric spillover distribution may suggest patient motion or improper contours.

### Microscopic response to inhomogeneous deformations in curvilinear coordinates [^3649c2b2]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

A mechanical deformation of a continuum can be expressed as a generalized coordinate transformation of space. Consequently, the equations of electrostatics in deformable media must satisfy covariance requirements with respect to such transformations, a problem that has long been addressed in the context of general relativity. Here we show how these ideas can be incorporated into the framework of density-functional perturbation theory, providing access to the microscopic charge density and electrostatic potential response to an arbitrary deformation field. We demonstrate the power of our approach by deriving, in full generality, the surface contributions to the flexoelectric response of a finite object, a topic that has recently been a matter of controversy. The breakdown of translational periodicity produces consequences that might seem highly paradoxical at first sight: for example, the macroscopic bulk polarization does not always correspond to the physical surface charge.

Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Quality assurance for 82Rb stress PET myocardial blood flow (MBF) analysis using a one-tissue compartment model is illustrated with checks across images, curves, and parametric maps. Orientation assesses the left ventricular (LV) long axis to the center of the short axis, and LV tissue contours are centered on the myocardium while the LV blood pool region does not overlap the myocardium. Dynamic time-activity curves include arterial blood pool input, myocardial tissue, spillover and partial-volume-corrected myocardial curves, and a kinetic model curve fitting through myocardial tissue points with residuals randomly scattered around zero. Regional polar maps show relative uptake (ACTIVITY), MBF (FLOW), uptake rate constant (K1), total blood volume fraction (TBV), and goodness-of-fit parameters including the normalized χ² (ideally < 3), R² (ideally close to 1), Convergence (Conv) of model fitting within the iterations (Iter) limit or other Errors, and whether fitted parameters are within expected Bounds (upper and lower limits).

### The emerging role of metabolomics analysis in genetic and genomic testing: a points to consider statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^b938abff]. Genetics in Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Point 2 — metabolomics is an emerging and heterogeneous field that lacks standard approaches to testing and quality assurance. Metabolomic data acquisition can be targeted, with measurements restricted to a predetermined set of compounds, untargeted using unbiased detection parameters, or a hybrid of both. Targeted methods sacrifice the scope of compounds detected for improved sensitivity and specificity and can be designed to enable metabolite quantitation. Untargeted data are not quantitative, are typically less precise and reproducible than targeted data, and often require extensive curation to confidently identify metabolites. It is important to distinguish between the steps of data acquisition and analysis, and urine organic acid analysis often involves untargeted data acquisition followed by some form of targeted analysis to identify relevant compounds. To achieve the broadest coverage, most metabolomics platforms use a composite of multiple orthogonal tests run in parallel utilizing multiple different approaches to sample preparation, chromatographic separation, and ionization.

### Polarization structured light 3D depth image sensor for scenes with reflective surfaces [^327a6551]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Seeing against the reflective noise

In Fig. 1 c, we also show the principle of working against reflective noise. In this sketch, the influence of natural light (S in3, P in3) is indicated by the gray dash line, whose incident plane is in the x – z plane. Its reflected component is stronger in S-polarization (y direction, S out3) according to Fresnel equations. Hence it can be eliminated when a P-polarized TX and RX are used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), enabling clear 3D image acquisition of the whole scene where there is strong reflective noise from the natural light. The process for this mission can be concluded into four steps, as illustrated in the flow of Fig. 1 c. Step 1 is the projection of polarized structured light with specific polarization direction (P in1). Step 2 is the determination of polarization direction of noise (S out3). Step 3 is the setting of RX polarization direction to be orthogonal to the reflective noise. Step 4 is obtaining the correct depth information of the scene (P out1).

### Periodically-modulated unipolar and bipolar orders in nematic fluids towards miniaturized nonlinear vectorial optics [^b744bd1c]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we demonstrate the capability of generating both linear and nonlinear perfect vector beams (PVBs) using a single-layer patterned polar LC device (Fig. 5a). As a new type of vector beamwith cylindrical symmetry in polarization, PVB has sparked considerable interest because its radius and intensity profile are independent of the polarization topological charge l, demonstrating superior capabilities in optical manipulation, microscopy imaging, and laser micromachining. Although PVBs have been widely studied in the framework of linear optics, the direct generation of SH PVBs from a single nonlinear optical element has not been realized due to previous challenges in manipulating in-plane polar ordering. Here, we design the orientation distribution α of polar LCs based on Eqs. (3) and (4), taking into account the near-field polarization, phase, and intensity distributions. Supplementary Fig. S20a depicts the designed orientation distribution of polar LCs,.represents the Fourier series coefficients, T = 100 μm is the period of concentric rings, r and φ denote the radial distance and azimuthal angle in the polar coordinate, and l is the polarization topological charge. In this case, the simulated near-field instantaneous electric field vector, when Fourier-transformed to the far field, enables an intensity profile and polarization distribution that meet the criteria of a nonlinear perfect vector beam. Accordingly, we show the surface anchoring pattern for both substrates of the device in Fig. 5a. The alignment direction continuously changes in the azimuthal angle, and the orientations in adjacent rings maintain a consistent perpendicular relationship in the radial direction. By employing photoalignment technology in conjunction with a self-developed digital micromirror device-based microlithography system ("Methods"), we achieved high-quality in-plane polar LC domain engineering, accomplished through the effective utilization of surface anchoring energy to dictate the LC orientation. The resulting polar LC superstructure is characterized under a crossed-PLM, which highlights the unique hierarchical and topological features of our device, incorporating both continuous and discontinuous variations of dipole orientations. The visible Maltese cross and the periodic circular domain walls shown in Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. S20b indicate that the LC director orientations are faithfully imprinted according to our design. A schematic of a cross-section of the LC cell is provided in Supplementary Fig. S21. The polar ordering is further confirmed by SHG-I imaging (Supplementary Fig. S22), with the local polar orientation distribution at the center shown in Fig. 5c.

### Prospective randomized study comparing sentinel lymph node evaluation with standard pathologic evaluation for the staging of colon carcinoma: results from the United States military cancer institute clinical trials group study GI-01 [^2b58ec86]. Annals of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The principal role of sentinel lymph node (SLN) sampling and ultrastaging in colon cancer is enhanced staging accuracy. The utility of this technique for patients with colon cancer remains controversial.

Purpose

This multicenter randomized trial was conducted to determine if focused assessment of the SLN with step sectioning and immunohistochemistry (IHC) enhances the ability to stage the regional nodal basin over conventional histopathology in patients with resectable colon cancer.

Patients and Methods

Between August 2002 and April 2006 we randomly assigned 161 patients with stage I-III colon cancer to standard histopathologic evaluation or SLN mapping (ex vivo, subserosal, peritumoral, 1% isosulfan blue dye) and ultrastaging with pan-cytokeratin IHC in conjunction with standard histopathology. SLN-positive disease was defined as individual tumor cells or cell aggregates identified by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and/or IHC. Primary end point was the rate of nodal upstaging.

Results

Significant nodal upstaging was identified with SLN ultrastaging (Control vs. SLN: 38.7% vs. 57.3%, P = 0.019). When SLNs with cell aggregates ≤ 0.2 mm in size were excluded, no statistically significant difference in node-positive rate was apparent between the control and SLN arms (38.7% vs. 39.0%, P = 0.97). However, a 10.7% (6/56) nodal upstaging was identified by evaluation of H&E stained step sections of SLNs among study arm patients who would have otherwise been staged node-negative (N0) by conventional pathologic assessment alone.

Conclusion

SLN mapping, step sectioning, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) identifies small volume nodal disease and improves staging in patients with resectable colon cancer. A prospective trial is ongoing to determine the clinical significance of colon cancer micrometastasis in sentinel lymph nodes.

### Emergent biaxiality in chiral hybrid liquid crystals [^b57ae5cb]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The colloidal orientations, representing the normal direction of the disk or the long axis of the rod, are analyzed based on its projections on multiple two-dimensional (2D) optical slices of a 3D sample using ImageJ software (freeware from the National Institute of Health). The ensuing data are transferred to Matlab software for visualization as well as for further analysis. The contrast and brightness of the images are carefully adjusted to avoid the interference of colloids out of focus. From the 3D stacks of images, the-slice plane perpendicular to the helical axisgives the azimuthal orientational distribution (φ), whereas the vertical slice plane parallel toreveals the polar distribution (θ) of colloidal orientations. We follow the methodology described in detail in refs. – and perform a complete analysis of angles describing the colloidal orientations relative to the helical far-field background by imaging the entire sample volume. After the analysis of particles by ImageJ, average azimuthal colloidal orientations are calculated for the data obtained in eachslice plane and plotted against the sample depth (z) position of the cross-sectional plane, revealing the helical twist of the colloidal axes. The corresponding helical pitch p of each 3D volume is subsequently calculated from the slope of the linear dependence of the azimuthal angle on the vertical position (d φ / d z = q = 360°/ p) and is in agreement with the initially designed value mentioned above, confirming the undisturbed molecular helical pitch at relatively low colloidal concentrations. Finally, the colloidal orientation distribution is visualized in the cholesteric frame as follows: the azimuthal angle in the molecular coordinate is calculated by subtracting the molecular twist from the measured colloidal orientations, δ = φ − q z representing the fluctuation of colloidal orientation around that of a perfect helix. The non-orientable property of the colloidal axisenabled us to express the fluctuation angles, δ = δ + π, for example, within a [-90°,90°] range. Histograms of the angular probability distribution with 5° bin width are calculated for each fluctuation angle, and numerical fitting based on the theoretical model is performed to each distribution accordingly and the peak width is quantified at half peak height (full width at half maximum, FWHM). The fit function is justified from the analytical prediction for the angular dependence of the surface anchoring energy (Eq. (20) and Eq. (23) below) and the elastic energy Eq. (4) discussed in the sections below. The visualization of angle distributions is cropped to a smaller angle range after calculation performed in the full [-90°,90°] range. The histogram data sets are subsequently utilized in the computation of the colloidal orientation order parameters, as summarized in the Results.

### Polarization structured light 3D depth image sensor for scenes with reflective surfaces [^f7e6dd6d]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Seeing through the reflective surface

According to the polarization feature of the HCG-VCSEL-based PSL 3D sensor, we can fully exploit its merits for 3D imaging in scenarios with large reflective surfaces. Based on Fresnel equations, when S- or P- polarized light is incident on a highly reflective surface, the reflection will maintain the same polarized direction. As shown in the upper picture of Fig. 1 b, TX of the PSL 3D sensor projects TM-polarization (P-polarization, P in1) structured light onto the scene. The reflected light from the reflective surface (P out1), which is denoted by the black solid line, will bounce back with the same polarization as the TX, while the light reflected from the object behind the reflective surface (S out2, P out2), whose light path is denoted by the black dot line, is polarized in various directions due to diffuse reflection. Then RX can receive the signals (P out1,2) of both the reflective surface and the object behind with its polarizer set in the same polarized direction, i.e. x direction. As shown in the lower picture of Fig. 1 b, if we change the direction of the polarizer to be orthogonal, i.e. y direction, the depth information of the reflective surface is eliminated, leaving that (S out2) from the diffuse object behind.

Thus, for seeing through the reflective surface, the process can be divided into three steps, as illustrated in the flow of Fig. 1 b. Step 1 is the projection of polarized structured light with a specific polarization direction (P in1). Step 2 is the setting of RX polarization direction to be orthogonal to TX. Step 3 is obtaining the depth information of the scene (S out2), where the part of the reflective surface (P out1) is removed. In addition, the distinction between two polarization settings of RX can be further used to complete the reflective surface.

### Single-shot polarimetry of vector beams by supervised learning [^6630cb2a]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

States of light encoding multiple polarizations - vector beams - offer unique capabilities in metrology and communication. However, their practical application is limited by the lack of methods for measuring many polarizations in a scalable and compact way. Here we demonstrate polarimetry of vector beams in a single shot without any polarization optics. We map the beam polarization content into a spatial intensity distribution through light scattering and exploit supervised learning for single-shot measurements of multiple polarizations. We characterize structured light encoding up to nine polarizations with accuracy beyond 95% on each Stokes parameter. The method also allows us to classify beams with an unknown number of polarization modes, a functionality missing in conventional techniques. Our findings enable a fast and compact polarimeter for polarization-structured light, a general tool that may radically impact optical devices for sensing, imaging, and computing.

Step 1.	Visual Guidelines for AdreView Cardiac Uptake on Anterior Planar Chest Images

Figure 1.	Normal anterior planar AdreView image of the chest
b.	Abnormal:

Homogeneously or heterogeneously decreased cardiac uptake, with indistinct or absent visualization of the left ventricular myocardium. Cardiac activity is usually less than or equal to that of the adjacent left lung (Figure 2a). In extreme cases, little or no AdreView uptake is seen in the left lower chest (Figure 2b).
Figure 2.	Abnormal anterior planar AdreView images of the chest: a) Heterogeneously reduced cardiac uptake; b) Absent cardiac uptake

Step 2.	Quantitate AdreView Cardiac Uptake

The AdreView H/M ratio is determined from the activity in heart (H) and mediastinum (M) regions of interest (ROIs) drawn on the anterior planar chest image (Figure 3) using the following procedure:

Draw an irregular ROI defining the epicardial border of the heart. If the epicardial border cannot be defined because all or the majority of the myocardium is not visualized, draw the ROI based upon the presumed location of the heart, using the medial aspects of the left and right lower lung for anatomical guidance.
Draw a horizontal line to mark the estimated location of the lung apices. If the most superior aspect of the image does not include the lung apices (because of limited field of view for a small gamma camera), draw this line at the top of the image display.
Draw a vertical line approximately equidistant from the medial aspects of the right and left lung.
Examine the counts for the 12 pixels along the vertical line starting 4 pixels below the intersection point with the horizontal line determined in step 2, and identify the pixel with the lowest counts. If more than one pixel has this same number of counts, choose the most superiorly located pixel.
Using the pixel defined in step 4 as the center, draw a square ROI of 7×7 dimensions.
Calculate the H/M ratio by dividing the counts/pixel in the total myocardium ROI determined in step 1 by the counts/pixel in the 7×7 pixel mediastinal ROI determined in step 5.

### Fast and quantitative 2D and 3D orientation mapping using raman microscopy [^dae06fb2]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Simultaneous measurement of polarized Raman spectra

One of the most critical steps which needed to be solved in SAROM is achievement of high speed of polarization measurements. For this purpose, we designed and constructed a Raman setup without moving parts, capable to illuminate the sample with multiple laser beams at different laser polarizations and simultaneously detect Raman scattering beams at multiple analyzer orientations (Supplementary Fig. 8). The working principle of the simultaneous measurement with nine polarized Raman channels is schematically shown in Supplementary Fig. 7b. Before starting the optical design having such complicated structure, we performed test measurements in a 'traditional' polarized Raman microscope layoutin order to find the minimum number of polarization measurements required for obtaining valid crystal orientations (Table 1). The 'traditional' optical setup can acquire one polarized Raman spectrum per measurement. Therefore, it requires a set of sequential measurements with different combinations of incident laser polarization angle ψ i and analyzer angle ψ s. In order to get more flexibility in the definition of incident laser/analyzer orientation we slightly modified the common used Porto notationsfor the back scattering on-axis and off-axis measurement configuration to the following form: z (ψ I, ψ s).

We performed test simulations and data fitting on the surface of monocrystalline Si wafers with surface planes (100), (110), and (111), respectively. It was determined that at least three differently polarized laser orientations and three analyzer orientations are required, with mandatory presence of off-axis channels. In total, we got nine combinations of polarization measurements which can be defined as. The angles ψ i, ψ s generally can have different values, however in the case of Si analysis with O h symmetry we used the following angles: We chose these values as a result of optimization (see Supplementary Note 4, Table 1). Simultaneously obtained experimental data in SAROM setup are shown in Supplementary Figs. 2–4. In general, our system can work at any ψ i, ψ s which can be beneficial for a specific crystal symmetry. If required, SAROM is capable to work with more than nine simultaneously acquired polarized channels. The actual number of channels is limited only by the optical design of the system and spectroscopic sensor dimensions.

### A selection and targeting framework of cortical locations for line-scanning fMRI [^7d5ce816]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Anatomical measures confirm accurate line‐planning

First, we used anatomical information to assess planning accuracy. We created a binarized mask representing the nominal line by taking the middle 16 voxels (indicative of the nominal 4 mm gap between saturation pulses) in the phase encoding direction along the frequency encoding direction. Of note, due to the imperfect nature of these saturation slabs, there are contaminating signals coming from outside the region‐of‐interest (Raimondo, Knapen, et al; Raimondo, Priovoulos, et al.). Because the full registration cascade from target vertex to the line through the low‐resolution image, partial FOV image, and single slice is known, we can project the nominal line image back onto the surface (Figure 3a, b). This showed that for all subjects, the line was indeed placed on the target site as per the overlap of the line (white) and target vertex (red spot) (Figure 3c).

FIGURE 3
Assessment of line‐placement accuracy using anatomical measures. The registration cascade from target vertex (a) to line‐scanning acquisition (b; outer right panel) is known after registering the anatomical image from Session 1 (high‐res) to the anatomical image from Session 2 (low‐res). Within Session 2, we acquired a partial field‐of‐view image (partial FOV), as well as the anatomical slice without OVS pulses (slice). From this slice, we created an image representing the nominal line (line). For each subject, we projected this nominal line image back to the surface from which the target vertex originated, showing sufficient overlap between the target vertex (red dot) and nominal line image (white patches) (c). The patches represent the location at which the nominal line image intersects with GM and looks scattered due to unfolding of the cortex.

### Engineering phase and polarization singularity sheets [^352c3afb]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Engineered phase-singularity sheet

As a proof-of-concept for singularity sheet engineering, we design a 2D phase-singularity sheet with a heart-shaped cross-section (Fig. 3). The heart-shaped singularity is centered at z = 10 mm and is designed for the scalar field associated with the x -polarized electric field at λ 0 = 532 nm emitted from a 0.8 mm × 0.8 mm patterned aperture. The paraxial scalar field approximation (qualitatively supported by the propagation distance to the target plane being much larger than the aperture size) is justified by a full vectorial propagationof the electromagnetic fields, which shows that the time-averaged energy density associated with the y (transverse) and z (axial) polarization components over the volume of interest is much smaller (in this case, < 0.05%) than that of the x -polarization. The sheet singularity is constructed by maximizing the phase gradient in the directions oriented normally to a heart-shape at the target z = 10 mm plane. The free parameters are the propagation phase delay (from 0 to 2 π) at each pixel on the patterned aperture located at z = 0 mm. The optimized phase pattern is shown in Fig. 3b and does not exhibit any discernible long-scale pattern apart from a series of concentric rings, which appear to apply a focusing effect. Figure 3a shows a field intensity isosurface of the singularity profile to depict its orientation in 3D space (real and imaginary zero-isosurfaces are plotted in Supplementary Fig. 3), along with the locations and directions at which the phase gradient maximization was performed. This surface represents the points at which the phase gradient is very large, nearly reaching 100 times the wavenumber k 0. Simulated cross-sectional intensity and phase plots at the z = 10 mm plane are depicted in Fig. 3d, g, respectively. There is a visible phase jump of π radians across the singularity boundary as the field changes sign. The phase profile is in fact continuously differentiable with a well-defined phase gradient and just achieves a large gradient value at the singularity boundary. In Fig. 3c, we plot this phase gradient magnitude |∇ ⊥ ϕ | 2 = (∂ x ϕ) 2 + (∂ y ϕ) 2 profile alongside the intensity and phase profiles for the linear cut indicated in Fig. 3d. These profiles are qualitatively similar to those of a transverse cut through the singular optical axis of a fundamental LG 0,1 vortex beam of the same wavelength (with a beam waist diameter equal to the diagonal of the 0.8 mm × 0.8 mm square aperture), which are plotted using dotted lines in Fig. 3c. The transverse phase gradient over the transverse plane is plotted in Supplementary Fig. 4. This phase gradient achieves large magnitudes near the heart-shaped boundary and even exceeds k 0 by an order of magnitude, thereby exhibiting superoscillatory behavior. The longitudinal behavior of this cut profile with z is displayed in Supplementary Fig. 5, which shows that |∇ ⊥ ϕ | exceeds k 0 for a superoscillatory region ~150 μm in front of and behind the target z = 10 mm plane. The characteristic depth of this singularity sheet using this superoscillatory region is thus around 300 μm. The depth of a singularity sheet can be extended by maximizing the phase gradient over more than one transverse plane. We also exhibit additional phase-singularity sheet shapes (flat sheet and double-walled cylinders) in Supplementary Fig. 6 to demonstrate the versatility of this algorithm.

### A unifying mechanism for cation effect modulating C1 and C2 productions from COelectroreduction [^89e72b19]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Using DFT-CES simulations, we investigate the cation-coordinating ability of 28 possible intermediate species that can be formed during the reaction paths of CO 2 RR (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1); a path to form CO (Fig. 1b; blue), CH 4 (Fig. 1c, green), and C 2 H 4 via a C–C coupling step (Fig. 1d, red). Cu(100) surface, known to be active for C–C coupling reactions, was chosen as the model catalyst surface for CH 4 and C 2 H 4 formation paths, as well as Ag(111) surface for CO formation path. At two different potentials of −0.5 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) for the potential at point of zero charge (E PZC) and −1.0 V SHE for the interface charge of −18 μC cm −2 (Supplementary Fig. 2), DFT-CES simulations identified 6 intermediate species — *CO 2, *COOH, *CHO, *OCCO, *OCCOH, and *HOCCOH — to be coordinated by a cation; herein K + (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Figs. 3–5).

### Motion-compensated b-tensor encoding for in vivo cardiac diffusion-weighted imaging [^5d2fb5fd]. NMR in Biomedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

3 METHODS

3.1 Generating spherical tensor encoding waveforms

Gradient waveforms for STE with K‐nulling and moment nulling up to the 2nd order were generated according to the principles outlined in the Theory section (see Figure 1). For our proof‐of‐concept experiments, we used trapezoidal gradient waveforms. Such waveforms are known for their high b‐value efficiency, ease of specification, and are routinely employed in both imaging and diffusion‐weighting.

Our STE gradient waveforms with moments nulled up to order n = 0, 1, 2 (shown in Figure 2) were generated based on the following steps:
Two gradient waveforms with n + 1 (waveform 1) and n + 2 (waveform 2) trapezoidal lobes were generated. The duration of these waveforms was chosen to fit on each side of the refocusing pulse while also allowing for gradients to be turned off during the interval surrounding the refocusing pulse (see timing in Figure 2). Ramp times of 1.6 ms were used.
Copies of waveform 1 were used with opposite polarities on each side of the refocusing pulse along the x‐axis (axis 1 in Figure 1). Copies of waveform 2 were used with opposite polarities on each side of the refocusing pulse along the y‐axis (axis 2 in Figure 1) and with equal polarities on each side of the refocusing pulse along the z‐axis (axis 3 in Figure 1).
The resulting waveforms were scaled to yield isotropic b‐tensors.
Finally, the waveforms were rotated to achieve K‐nulling.

Matlab code to generate gradient waveforms for tensor‐valued diffusion encoding with gradient moment nulling up to 2nd order as well as nulling effects of concomitant gradients are available upon request.

### All-optical geometric image transformations enabled by ultrathin metasurfaces [^e131c144]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Geometric transformation for binary images

With the optimized meta-atom design in hand, we employed metasurfaces with minimized neighboring-coupling-induced phase errors to perform geometric image transformations. We initially demonstrated the geometric transformation for binary images (i.e. images whose pixels have two possible intensity values: 0 and 1) and realized Cartesian to log-polar coordinate transformation as an example. In this instance, the metasurface transforms an image with unity transmittance in the Cartesian coordinate to a deformed image in the log-polar coordinate, simultaneously converting the in-plane rotation and scale variations of the input image into translations of the transformed image.

To comprehend the properties of log-polar transformation, we considered an arbitrary point (P) in the Cartesian coordinatemapping to point P' in the log-polar coordinate(Fig. 3). Assuming the length of the segment OP is r and the orientation of OP is α, the coordinates of P' can be written aswith two scale factorsand. For example, mapping a circular ring from the Cartesian into the log-polar coordinates results in a rectangle (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, we can observe that the scale of r and the increment of α are converted to a linear shift alongandaxes, respectively, in log-polar coordinate. As a result, the original image is transformed into a reformed image that is immune to scale and rotation variations, except for certain translations in the new coordinate.

### Degenerate boundaries for multiple-alternative decisions [^8ec71b12]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

There are geometric implications of using sequential Bayesian inference as coordinates for n -dimensional decision trajectories (Fig. 1 a, b). Although the decision trajectories have n probability-coordinates, P n, they are constrained such that ∑ i P i (t) = 1; therefore, the decision trajectories populate (n − 1)D simplices. For example, 2AFC decision dynamics are represented as a particle constrained to have P 0 (t) + P 1 (t) = 1, which is the 1D line P 1 = 1 − P 0 on a 2D (P 0, P 1) plot of the beliefs. It follows that 3AFC dynamics take place on a 2D plane (Fig. 1 a) and 4AFC dynamics in a 3D tetrahedron (Fig. 1 b) and so forth. Note that if any hypothesis has zero probability P i (t) = 0, then the space in which the decision trajectory evolves collapses to the remaining non-zero directions. For example, each face of the 4-choice tetrahedron in Fig. 1 b is a combination of three choices with non-zero probabilities and each edge a combination of two such choices.

As a result, decision boundaries are (n − 2)-dimensional objects in n -dimensional probability space. So for n > 2 choices, boundaries can have spatial dependence with respect to the decision space visualized in Fig. 1 a, b. For 2AFC tasks, decision boundaries are points on a 2D line, which are simply the transformed boundaries (equation 2) of the standard two-choice integration-to-threshold model. Likewise, for 3AFC, the decision boundaries are lines on a plane (Fig. 1 a, dashed lines) and for 4AFC are planes within a tetrahedron (Fig. 1 a, dark gray planes). The example boundaries shown are flat with a constant decision threshold in each dimension. An interesting consequence is that high-dimensional boundaries can have a nonlinear structure as a function of the n -dimensional beliefs P. Then, the linear 3AFC boundaries (Fig. 1 a, dashed lines) generalize to curves and the planar 4AFC boundaries (Fig. 1 b, dark gray planes) generalize to curved surfaces.

### Identification of phases, symmetries and defects through local crystallography [^5fabe4e7]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Advances in electron and probe microscopies allow 10pm or higher precision in measurements of atomic positions. This level of fidelity is sufficient to correlate the length (and hence energy) of bonds, as well as bond angles to functional properties of materials. Traditionally, this relied on mapping locally measured parameters to macroscopic variables, for example, average unit cell. This description effectively ignores the information contained in the microscopic degrees of freedom available in a high-resolution image. Here we introduce an approach for local analysis of material structure based on statistical analysis of individual atomic neighbourhoods. Clustering and multivariate algorithms such as principal component analysis explore the connectivity of lattice and bond structure, as well as identify minute structural distortions, thus allowing for chemical description and identification of phases. This analysis lays the framework for building image genomes and structure-property libraries, based on conjoining structural and spectral realms through local atomic behaviour.

The statement adds that "Following are 3 examples that were discussed in multiple workgroup meetings but remain in the document", including a detachable parts section where "any one of the following measures are recommended: (1) Use of single-use biopsy port caps and single-use valves; (2) Sterilization of reusable valves and caps, preferably using steam sterilization when materials are compatible; (3) High level disinfection of valves and caps, either keeping the valve/caps together with the endoscope as a set or tracking the individual valve/cap to the patient and the procedure", with the societies stating "we had successfully explained the impracticality of the third recommended option" yet it remains. It also states, "The standard supports marketing of cleaning verification assays for duodenoscopes" with claims to "(1) measure bacteria on reprocessed endoscopes, or (2) verify that a reprocessed endoscope is safe, or (3) assure proper high-level disinfection or sterilization", and that "such claims are considered illegal by the FDA as no such assays have received 510(k) clearance". Lastly, "The GI societies proposed for the normative section of the standard that endoscope culture and repair history should accompany loaned endoscopes" but "This was moved and then included in the formative section".

### Changes in myocardial microstructure and mechanics with progressive left Ventricular pressure overload [^bc2ad2eb]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2020). Medium credibility.

SHG imaging

LV myocardial collagen microstructure was analyzed in subset of the referent control (n = 5), 4 weeks post-LVPO (n = 6), and 5 weeks post-LVPO (n = 7) pigs using SHG imaging. Briefly, the pigs were euthanized (5% isoflurane), the LV removed, and a 1-inch thick circumferential section was fixed in 10% formalin — preserving the native orientation and configuration of the LV myocardial collagen fibers — for 24 h at 4°C. The LV lateral free-wall myocardium was later sectioned into 200 μm sections and placed on the motorized stage of a multiphoton microscope (Leica TCS SP8 MP, Leica Microsystems). Short-pulsed infrared lasers were used to create nonlinear polarization effects in the form of SHG signals at a magnification of 25×. SHG images were acquired for a fixed sample area of 0.2 mm 2 at depth intervals of 1.5 μm.

Automated tracing of individual collagen fibers

Two-dimensional images acquired from the multiphoton microscope were converted to 8-bit grayscale and virtually stacked in 3 dimensions using the Amira software package. For automated tracing of individual collagen fibers, we modified the previously described techniques developed for electron tomography, which were packaged into the XTracing filament detection extension available for Amira. In brief, this tracing algorithm consists of 2 main steps: template matching and a line search approach. Template matching uses a graphics processing unit (NVIDIA Quadro M2000, Santa Clara, California) to compute the voxel cross-correlation field in a 3-dimensional image stack, with a cylindrical template that mimics a collagen fiber segment with a mask radius of 5 μm and a length of 20 μm. The line search approach identifies the voxels that form the centerline of each collagen fiber. From an initial seed point, a search cone spanning 20 μm and 45 degrees identifies candidate collagen fiber points that are scored for continuity, curvature, and deviations from the orientation field. The line search stops when the search cone fails to identify candidate points with scores above the minimum threshold.

### Resolution limit of the eye-how many pixels can we see? [^c5757511]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

A different procedure was used for the experiment involving text stimuli. We created two images with the same text but in opposite polarities; one with a white background and black text, and the other with a black background and white text. The contrast between the text and the background in both images was 0.96. The task was to detect a sharper stimulus from the two: one rendered at the native resolution of the display and one upscaled from the lower resolution using a n × n box filter. The reported ppd values correspond to the effective resolution of the upscaled image (reduced by the factor of n). To ensure that the text was the same size regardless of viewing distance, the native resolution image was obtained by resampling a high-resolution reference image using a Lanczos filter (a = 3), so that the stimulus spanned 12.63° × 7.12° visual degrees at all viewing distances. For reference, the height of a capital letter (e.g. "I") was 0.28° and the body size (i.e. the full vertical extent of the text, including any parts that extend above or below the typical height of capital letters) was 0.5°. At a typical reading distance of 40 cm, this corresponds to a capital letter height of 5.6 pt, and a font size of 10 pt in standard printed documents. For the text experiment, the luminance of the white background was 191 cd/m 2, and for the black background, it was 8.67 cd/m 2. Only foveal stimuli with free viewing were used for the text stimuli. The stimuli used in our experiments are shown in Fig. 1. More details of the stimuli generation methods are provided in the Supplementary Section 3.2 ("Stimuli").

### A unique analytical solution of the white matter standard model using linear and planar encodings [^f12d8453]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

It is known that white matter modeling based on commonly used linear diffusion encoding is an ill-posed problem. We analyze the additional information gained from a double pulsed diffusion encoding.

Methods

Zeroth (spherical means) and second-order (harmonic powers) rotation invariant signal features are used to factor micro- and mesoscopic contributions. The b-value dependency up to second-order of the features form 6 nonlinear equations, which are analyzed.

Results

The 6 derived equations can be uniquely solved for all relevant biophysical parameters. No assumptions about the form of the mesoscopic contribution (fiber dispersion) is necessary. Under certain conditions the solution still shows a certain degeneracy which is inherent to model. It is further shown that a combination of second-order information from single and spherical diffusion encoding is not enough to solve the problem.

Conclusions

A combination of single and double pulsed diffusion encodings is sufficient to solve the full 3 compartment white matter model uniquely.

### Laparoscopic approach for ectopic pregnancy in a rudimentary horn: stepwise demonstration of surgical technique [^9762cb0d]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide a comprehensive, step-by-step presentation of the laparoscopic resolution of ectopic pregnancy within a rudimentary uterine horn.

Design

A detailed demonstration of the laparoscopic technique presented through narrated video footage.

Setting

Pregnancy occurring in the rudimentary horn of a unicornuate uterus represents a rare form of ectopic pregnancy [1]. This condition is associated with a high risk of uterine rupture. Early detection is crucial for effective management and prevention of potential complications [2,3]. In this manuscript, we present a case study of a patient diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy in a rudimentary horn, who underwent successful laparoscopic resection.

Interventions

Ten main steps were identified and described in detail during the laparoscopic resection: Step 1: identification of the anatomy; Step 2: uterine mobilization; Step 3: Open retroperitoneum; Step 4: Coagulation and section of left round ligament; Step 5: Bladder dissection; Step 6: Identification of vessels; Step 7: Coagulation and section of left utero-ovarian vessels; Step 8: Coagulation and section of uterine vessels; Step 9: Section of uterine septum; Step 10: Specimen removed.

Conclusion

This publication offers a detailed and instructive account of the laparoscopic resection of ectopic pregnancy within a rudimentary uterine horn. The stepwise approach demonstrated in the accompanying video contributes to a deeper understanding of this complex surgical technique. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

### Flortaucipir f-18 (Tauvid) [^da74189e]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.4 Image Display

The goal of the read is to identify and locate areas of flortaucipir activity in the neocortex that are greater than the background activity (background activity is defined as up to 1.65-fold the measured cerebellar average). For optimal display, select a color scale with a rapid transition between two distinct colors and adjust the scale so that the transition occurs at the 1.65-fold threshold. Examine the posterolateral temporal (PLT), occipital, parietal, and frontal regions bilaterally. Neocortical activity in either hemisphere contributes to image interpretation. Activity in white matter or regions outside the brain does not contribute to image interpretation. To help identify the PLT, consider subdividing the temporal lobe into four quadrants as instructed below. Activity in the anterior and medial temporal lobe does not contribute to image interpretation of a positive TAUVID pattern.

Image Display and Orientation

Display images in the transverse, sagittal, and coronal planes. Reorient images to remove head tilt in the transverse and coronal plane. Use a sagittal slice just off the midline to align the inferior frontal and inferior occipital poles in the horizontal plane.

Select and Adjust the Color Scale

To create a visual threshold for positivity:

Draw a region of interest around the cerebellum in the transverse plane.
Select the plane to go through the cerebellum at the maximum cross-sectional area of the cerebellum.
Record the mean activity or cerebellar counts (MCC). The region of interest should be drawn with the scan in gray scale and in the transverse plane as seen in the example in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Example of Cerebellar Region of Interest

Select a color scale for image display that has a rapid transition between two distinct colors in the general range of 25% to 60% of maximum intensity.
Set the upper contrast value (UCV) of the color scale. Use the following formula to set the visual threshold of 1.65 × MCC to match the rapid transition in the color scale:

If additional guidance on image display is needed, refer to the TAUVID User Guide for PET Image Display available by request from the manufacturer.

### Diagnosis of the sentinel lymph node in breast cancer: a reproducible molecular method: a multicentric Spanish study [^4dda79a7]. Histopathology (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

Standardization of the sentinel node (SN) as a diagnostic tool has not yet been achieved, because the protocol for histopathological study is highly variable between centres. We compared the results of a new method with conventional histological tests and evaluated its feasibility for intra-operative evaluation, and propose it as a method to standardize the sentinel node evaluation procedure.

Methods and Results

Trial 1 included 181 cases; in parallel, 2-mm-thick sections of the SN were processed alternately for histological analysis and for the one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) procedure. A final concordance of 99.45% was observed in the first trial of our study. For trial 2, the timing of every procedural step was recorded in an electronic database in order to discern the time spent for each step, the total SN evaluation time and to identify areas of improvement. In the second trial, after a learning period and feedback on data recorded, we spent a mean of 31 min for the entire SN evaluation procedure.

Conclusion

Our multi-centric trial using the OSNA assay for sentinel node evaluation in breast cancer demonstrates that this is a highly sensitive, specific and reproducible technique that allows for standardization of the SN diagnostic procedure, a necessary, and until now unresolved, issue.

### Nanoscale design of polarization in ultrathin ferroelectric heterostructures [^4f28e652]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

In the first step, we need to understand the emergence of polarization in a single film during the growth process with layer-by-layer resolution. We begin with BaTiO 3 films that we grow epitaxially on SrRuO 3 -buffered (001)-oriented SrTiO 3 (BTO|SRO||STO, see Methods section for details). Reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) is performed simultaneously to ISHG for calibrating the ISHG yield to the thickness of the BTO film with unit-cell accuracy (Fig. 1b).

At zero coverage, Fig. 1a merely yields a surface-induced background ISHG contribution on the order of 1% of the maximum net ISHG signal. It is deconvoluted from the data (Methods section) before calculating the unit-cell polarization in Fig. 1c. The onset of a macroscopic polarization in BTO, indicated by the steady increase of the ISHG signal, occurs around 4 unit cells. This critical thickness is in agreement with previous reports, but here we observe the emergence in a single, continuous experimental run. According to Fig. 1c, the unit-cell polarization of our film saturates around 16 unit cells.

### Human seizures couple across spatial scales through travelling wave dynamics [^36a451bb]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

To identify waves travelling within the microelectrode array during each window, we performed a linear regression of the delays D as a function of the 2D microelectrode positions (X, Y) such that D = b 0 + b 1 X + b 2 Y, where b 0, b 1 and b 2 are the parameters to estimate. Here we consider delays at each microelectrode relative to the microelectrode at the center of the MEA. Two criteria were required for the 2D fit to be considered valid: (i) At least 50% of the electrodes for that time window must have a defined delay; (ii) The fit must be significantly better than a constant term model (P < 0.05, F-test that the two slope estimates are both 0). When a wave is identified (that is, a valid fit), two statistics were computed from the fit: the wave speed estimated as; and the direction of the wave source, estimated as the four-quadrant inverse tangent, with horizontal coordinate b 1 and vertical coordinate b 2. To quantify the consistency of the wave source directions θ j in a given interval containing N direction estimates, we compute the phase locking value φ defined as; see ref. We refer to the result here as the 'direction consistency' to avoid confusion with the phase estimated from the coherence. We perform a similar procedure for the macroelectrode data. The delay between the MEA and a single macroelectrode was computed as the mean delay between all microelectrodes and the macroelectrode. We considered the 30 macroelectrodes closest to the MEA, and electrode positions on the brain surface were estimated through coregistration (see section Anatomical Figures).

### Fast and quantitative 2D and 3D orientation mapping using raman microscopy [^96a985a2]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

However, so far no one has presented a stand-alone orientation map based on Raman scattering, due to several experimental and theoretical problems. In particular, polarized Raman experiments have so far been carried out by rotating the sample or rotating a set of wave plates in the incident laser or on scattered beams in the Raman setup. Such optical layouts require multiple Raman spectra measurements using numerous combinations of the orientation of the polarization state of the incident laser and orientation of the analyzer. Due to this, Raman orientation mapping would need sequential polarization measurements at each raster-scanning point, which would make such hypothetical mapping procedures very complex and extremely slow and thus practically impossible. In addition, existing experimental PRM setups introduce ambiguities in measurements, implying that the approach fails completely for some orientations. As an example, in a scheme with normal sample illumination and on-axis collection of scattered light, it is impossible to determine a rotation of a (111) Si wafer around the [111] axis (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Note 1). Such problem can be partially avoided by tilting the sample or by realization of polarized off-axis Raman scattering registration(Fig. 1b). However, as we show below, polarized Raman spectroscopy with off-axis registration also provides ambiguities in the determination of Euler angles, thus some combination of on-axis and off-axis channels must be used. To our knowledge, a theoretical investigation of the optimal number of on-axis/off-axis polarized Raman scattering channels in PRM has not been performed. Therefore, a measurement strategy for how to perform quantitative orientation mapping with an angular accuracy comparable with EBSD needs to be developed.

### Spatial resolution requirements for accurate identification of drivers of atrial fibrillation [^47bee56a]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2017). Low credibility.

Resolution requirements were determined for the 10 cm×10 cm sheet by uniformly spatially downsampling voltage data to different resolutions, ranging from 1 to 25 mm. For the atrial bilayer model, we considered subsets of nodes corresponding to the average distance between nodes, termed mesh resolution (MR), of 1.62 to 17.1 mm.

To compare results between different resolutions, downsampled phase (uniformly downsampled resolutions: 1–25 mm) was interpolated using cubic splines to full grid resolution (0.1 mm) for the 2D sheet (Figure 1 B) or to 1.62 mm MR for the bilayer model (MR = 1.62–17.1 mm, 4813–36 points). Phase rather than voltage was interpolated (Section 1.2 in the) because electrograms vary in magnitude (particularly bipoles) making their interpolation challenging.

For focal source identification, we calculated the divergence of the CV field(Figure I in the). For each AP, activation time was calculated as the location of the maximum temporal derivative. CV vectors were calculated by differencing the activation times of four neighboring points. The point of maximum divergence of the normalized CV field identified the origin of focal sources.

Criteria for Determining Required Resolutions

The accuracy of rotor identification was assessed using 2 measures: (1) visual inspection of isopotential plots over time and (2) error in the center of the rotor trajectory calculated using phase (time-averaged center error criterion; success if within an ablation catheter diameter of 4 mm). For (2), PS locations were calculated as detailed above. To separate these PSs into rotor PSs and false detections, a rotor PS was seeded in an initial frame of the simulation and tracked over time subject to a movement threshold to detect rotor PSs over the simulation duration. Other PSs were then defined to be false detections (Figure 2 B). To assess the influence of false detections on correct rotor identification, both the number and distribution of falsely identified PSs were assessed.

a, PESs of S 0, D 0, D 1, D 2 and D 3 using XMS-CASPT2 corrections of the SA-CASSCF(8,8) energies. All the PESs in a are plotted on the basis of the energy difference (Δ E) in comparison with the global minima of each state. The functions of the Br 1 –C 1 –C 2 –C 3 and Br 2 –C 3 –C 2 –C 1 dihedral angles depicted in the PESs offer insights into identifying the cationic excited state that initiates the induction period. b, Overall structural dynamics of DBP followed by the [2 + 1] REMPI process. Initially, no substantial structural change is observed for a period of about 3.6 ps. Afterwards, a transient species, iso -DBP +, is formed with a time constant of 15 ps. Finally, the loosely bound Br in iso -DBP + escapes, yielding the bromonium MBP + with a time constant of 77 ps.

Source Data

To obtain further support for the observed induction period, surface-hopping simulations were carried out up to 1 ps, considering D 2 as the initial active state. The trajectories show that DBP + does not exhibit noticeable structural changes for several hundred femtoseconds after excitation, as evidenced by the computed averaged difference scattering curve (Extended Data Fig. 7). Comprehensive discussions are provided in the 'Results of surface hopping simulations' section of the Supplementary Information. Furthermore, we conducted intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations to enhance our understanding of the reaction dynamics (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Fig. 18). These calculations involved the determination of transition states and an intermediate species, and the results of vibrational frequency calculations for the transition states and intermediate species are provided in Supplementary Tables 7 and 8. On the basis of the results of IRC calculations, we conducted calculations to locate a conical intersection (CI1) that connects the D 1 state to iso -DBP +. A detailed description of the computational methods is provided in the 'Computational details' and 'Details of surface hopping simulation' sections in the Supplementary Information. The plausible reaction coordinates and pathways for the formation of iso -DBP + and MBP + can be proposed as detailed in the 'Reaction pathways to form iso -DBP + and MBP + ' section in the Supplementary Information.

### Off-axis metasurfaces for folded flat optics [^1668cff1]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

To realize the off-axis-focusing metasurface reflector shown in Fig. 1a, a set of metagratings are optimized over the desired area of 2 × 2 cm 2 with a focal distance of 1 cm, resulting in a 90° × 90° angle-of-view or 110° diagonally. Up to this point, the work has investigated discrete positions along the metasurface's0 cross-section, as seen in Fig. 2. To allow focusing in two dimensions, the surface-relief ridges are curved according to the grating equation generalized in spherical coordinates. Alternatively, the position and orientation of each element can be found by simply superimposing the electric field of an off-axis plane wave with a spherical wave centered at the desired focal distance. This second method is implemented to define the metasurface supercells' pitch, position, and orientation. The metagratings are optimized by RCWA at 400 × 400 discrete points across the 2 × 2 cm surface under the assumption of an infinitely repeating supercell period at each position. This approximation is sufficiently accurate for large centimeter-scale metasurfaces given the slowly varying phase profile of a large parabolic mirror. The structure within each supercell is determined by the nearest optimized RCWA point, effectively creating 50 × 50 µm pixels where the optimized duty cycles are constant. These duty cycles are multiplied by the local pitch such that elements still vary in width across these rounded pixels. Figure 3a illustrates the resultant metasurface, though it is a scaled down 100 × 100 μm version to make the elements visible. This rescaling is achieved by analytically recalculating the grating pattern for a 50 μm focal distance and re-interpolating to the RCWA data. Upon inspection of Fig. 3a, the results of optimization are seen to produce an ensemble of all the metagratings building blocks previously explored in Fig. 2. Each element is denoted in order from light blue, dark blue, black, to red. The width of each element slowly varies with transitions occurring when the number of elements in a 2π phase-wrapped period changes. This is illustrated in the inset where the number of elements decreases from four to three. Figure 3b provides the simulated first-order diffraction efficiency of the metasurface as a function of position. The estimated mean efficiency is 95%, with a maximum of 98% and a minimum of 83%. A histogram of the efficiency distribution is included in Supplementary Fig. S3 of the Supplementary Information. In Fig. 3c, the diffraction efficiency is converted to normalized luminance in sRGB color space to illustrate the expected uniformity seen by the human eye. This is calculated using the CIE 1931 color matching function at 532 nm and converted from XYZ tristimulus values to sRGB color space values with gamma correction. These results demonstrate the design can achieve high diffraction efficiencies and uniformity for all output diffraction angles within the targeted NA.

### Current and evolving echocardiographic techniques for the quantitative evaluation of cardiac mechanics: ASE / EAE consensus statement on methodology and indications endorsed by the Japanese society of echocardiography [^3abdf36d]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2011). Medium credibility.

Two-dimensional (2D) STE image acquisition — Frame rates of 40 to 80 frames/sec have been used in applications involving normal heart rates, and higher frame rates are advisable to avoid undersampling in tachycardia; the focus should be positioned at an intermediate depth, sector depth and width should be adjusted to include as little as possible outside the region of interest, and artifacts resembling speckle patterns should be avoided. For software that process single beats, data sampling should start ≈100 msec before the peak R wave of the first QRS complex and end 200 msec after the last QRS to allow correct identification of the QRS complex, because failure may result in erroneous drift compensation; apical foreshortening seriously affects 2D STE and should therefore be minimized, and short-axis cuts of the left ventricle should be circular shaped to assess deformation in the anatomically correct circumferential and radial directions.

### Lanthanide-doped moSwith enhanced oxygen reduction activity and biperiodic chemical trends [^cb7cd0ba]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Polarization-curve simulations for ORR

A thermodynamic model may underestimate the ORR activity, because it only yields the active condition with all the involved steps being exothermic. However, some endothermic reaction steps can be kinetically overcome in realistic conditions (e.g. at room temperature), and it actually is the kinetic activity that is directly associated with many experimental measurements, e.g. current–potential polarization curves. For example, the single-Fe-atom catalyst on N-doped graphene may be predicted to be ORR inactive according to its low U limit (0.25–0.43 V), however, the measured/simulated polarization curves clearly reveal its high ORR activity comparable with the standard Pt(111) surface possessing a high U limit at 0.79 V. Furthermore, in many previous theoretical simulations of different material surfaces, certain simplified water configurations are frequently usedor the kinetic barriers for ORR steps on Pt(111) are simply borrowed. However, the above analysis of water effects and the following kinetic results can show that it is highly desired to use the appropriate water-molecular structure for the Ln-MoS 2 /water interface (with a loose morphology and a specific chemical character) into the simulation of kinetic processes. To accurately understand the ORR activity and guide future related experiments, microkinetic simulations for the multiple-step ORR processes on Ln-MoS 2 surfaces are carried out here to obtain the potential-dependent current densities (j). The activation energy (E a) of each ORR step is first calculated to derive its reaction rate constant, and then the obtained rate constants of all the steps are used to solve the simultaneous reaction equations for the ORR on a rotating disk electrode (RDE). More theoretical details are given in the METHODS section below and the section K in SI.

### Bayesian data analysis reveals no preference for cardinal tafel slopes in COreduction electrocatalysis [^1b664b4e]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The Tafel slope is an important parameter to judge the performance of a catalyst because it quantifies the amount of additional applied potential required to observe a logarithmic increase in the measured current. Hence, studies that develop a novel electrocatalytic material often measure current–voltage data in the kinetic control regime, and then use these data to estimate a Tafel slope for their catalytic system. Experimental limitations impose a number of practical constraints on the Tafel slope estimation procedure. First, for several electrochemical reactions (CO 2 reduction, N 2 reduction, organic electrosynthesis, etc.), accurately determining a kinetic current for a specific reaction requires product quantification after a constant potential/current hold. Due to throughput limitations for quantification techniques, the Tafel slope often must be estimated from just a handful of data points (roughly, 3–10). Another important practical constraint arises from limiting-current phenomena observed in many electrocatalytic systems. At sufficiently high overpotentials, the reaction rate exceeds the rate of another physical process required for the reaction to proceed. In this regime, the system is no longer under kinetic control, and the measured current plateaus to a limiting current, becoming independent of the applied voltage. Most commonly, limiting currents in CO 2 reduction systems arise from diffusive transport limitations in the electrolyte, although several other physical reasons for plateau currents have been hypothesized and investigated in the literature –. Consequently, experimentally measured Tafel data usually starts out linear, but curves sublinearly at sufficiently high overpotentials.

In the face of these practical limitations, studies in the literature use a relatively standard protocol for estimating the Tafel slope, depicted schematically in the upper half of Fig. 1. First, a researcher must manually identify an ad hoc cutoff between a linear, kinetically controlled regime (the Tafel regime) and a limiting-current (plateau) regime. All data points in the plateau regime are subsequently discarded, and a Tafel slope is fitted by ordinary least-squares (OLS) linear regression to the data in the Tafel regime. The OLS procedure offers a prescription for extracting the standard error of the Tafel slope; this standard error is sometimes used to construct a confidence interval for the Tafel slope estimate.

### Microfluidic multipoles theory and applications [^5123f2af]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Generalization from microfluidic dipoles to multipoles

Once a solution is known for one particular multipole flow profile, the full power of conformal transforms can be exploited. By using simple functions expressing symmetry operations, such as inversions or power transforms with a suitably placed origin, we can obtain concentration profiles for an infinite family of multipoles. In each case, the transport problem is first solved in the streamline domain (Fig. 2a), then transformed to obtain the flow profile for an asymmetric dipole (Fig. 2b). The dipole solution can then be transformed again to obtain the desired flow patterns. For example, a power law conformal transform generates a polygonal structure with a rotation symmetry whose number of sides is dictated by the exponent of the power transform (as in Fig. 2c). These devices will have injection and aspiration apertures located at new positions, determined by the transform of the initial aperture locations, and can then be fabricated and operated to obtain the predicted patterns. This method gives us a comprehensive toolbox to not only model and explain phenomena in known open-space MFMs in terms of simpler ones, but also to explore new configurations that have not been investigated yet.

While many geometries can be obtained by directly transforming the concentration profile from the microfluidic dipole, an arbitrary placement of injection and aspiration apertures will in general not be reducible to a semi-infinite absorbing leading edge (Fig. 2a). In the more general case, the streamline coordinate problem will exhibit any number of finite and semi-infinite absorbing segments. By solving these streamline coordinate problems, we obtained new families of multipolar devices, such as the two-reagent microfluidic quadrupole (Fig. 2d), which can itself be transformed to obtain new symmetrical patterns (Fig. 2e, f and Supplementary Note 3 for more details).

Table 1 summarizes some common transforms that can be used to obtain the concentration profile for many new devices from the dipole solution without solving any differential equation. A more detailed version, including many more transformation groups is presented in the SI. These configurations include known devices such as the previously published microfluidic quadrupole, but also several geometries that have not yet been investigated such as "flower" multipoles (Fig. 2c, f), alternating multipoles (Fig. 2e), polygonal multipoles and impinging flow multipoles (Table S3),

### Estimating and eliminating the excitation errors in bipolar gradient composite excitations caused by radiofrequency-gradient delay: example of bipolar spokes pulses in parallel transmission [^8639571d]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

For multiple‐subpulse spokes excitation with bipolar gradients, Equation (1) is correct for all subpulses that have their slice‐selective gradient in the opposite polarity to the rephasing lobe, namely, the odd set of subpulses, as shown in Figure 1 a. For the even set of subpulses, where both the slice‐selective and rephasing gradient lobes are in the same polarity, the required rephasing moment, A n, is given by Equation (2) :as in Figure 1 b.

When Δ t ≠ 0, the rephasing moments required by the two sets of subpulses cannot be satisfied by a common gradient lobe. This leads to two types of residual phase errors: First, the through‐slice phase dispersions induced by the two sets of subpulses differ by Equation (3) :whereis the gyromagnetic ratio, Δ z is the slice thickness, and BW is the bandwidth of the RF pulse; Second, at the center of the slice cross‐section, the two sets of subpulses have a phase difference given by Equation (4) :where z is the position of the center of the slice from the gradient isocenter.

Although the difference in through‐slice phase dispersion, cannot be corrected by a common rephasing gradient lobe, its effect is generally small, because BW is typically in the range of kHz and Δ t is expected to be in the order of µs in a well‐calibrated MR system, leavingin the order of 0.1 radians. In contrast, the phase difference between the two sets of subpulses, which scales linearly with the slice position z, can be a factor 10 larger thanand in the order of π radians, for example, for a 2‐mm‐thick slice at 20 mm from the isocenter. When this amount of phase difference is not accounted for, the desired flip‐angle homogenization cannot be achieved. Unlike the first type of phase errors, which can only be corrected by eliminating the delay, the effect of this phase differencecan also be compensated by adding the extra slice‐dependent phase difference between the set of odd and even subpulses according to Equation (4).

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^7e0b2d1d]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Basic stereological measurements for lung imaging — first-order parameters, probes, and reference space are specified. First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D]). Measurements are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D), with probe–voxel interactions generating countable events; raw counts yield ratios that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute lung or subcompartment measures. It is crucial to define and measure a biologically meaningful reference space for analysis and reporting, because measurements expressed only as ratios are subject to "the reference trap", where changes can arise from the numerator, denominator, or both; an efficient volume measurement method, point counting, is used for acinar components by micro-CT and for extrapulmonary organ volume by CT.
