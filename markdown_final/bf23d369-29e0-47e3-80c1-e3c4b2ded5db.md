## Question

What is a starting dose for fenofibrate for mixed hyperlipidemia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate starting dose of fenofibrate for mixed hyperlipidemia, including how to handle different formulations, renal impairment, and administration details. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the indication and whether the label supports treating mixed hyperlipidemia. Then, I should verify the most authoritative FDA labels to determine standard adult starting doses. Next, I will distinguish dose by formulation, including micronized, suprabioavailable, and fenofibric acid. After that, I need to check renal dose adjustments and hepatic or geriatric considerations. Finally, I will confirm administration instructions, monitoring, and how to individualize therapy, before giving a concise, practical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the indication and context. Fenofibrate is indicated as adjunct to diet to reduce elevated LDL-C, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and apo B, and to increase HDL-C in adults with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia, which directly covers mixed hyperlipidemia; it also has an indication for severe hypertriglyceridemia, which is a different clinical scenario, so I need to keep those separate to avoid conflating dosing strategies [^115peega] [^1174BGLQ].

> Wait, let me verify the standard adult dose across authoritative labels. Multiple contemporary FDA sources consistently state that for primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia the recommended dose is 145 mg once daily, which serves as the maintenance and maximum dose in most branded tablet formulations; for example, Tricor lists 145 mg daily as both maintenance and maximum, and the generic tablet labeling mirrors this 145 mg daily regimen, with some older tablet products specifying 160 mg daily, which reflects historical tablet strengths and formulation differences rather than a different starting principle [^115BvHcv] [^1162kZb2] [^111S6YmB].

> Hold on, I should verify formulation-specific differences because not all fenofibrate products are dosed the same. Suprabioavailable and some branded products like Fenoglide use a 120 mg tablet that is bioequivalent to 145–160 mg of older tablet or micronized formulations; thus, Fenoglide's labeled starting dose of 120 mg once daily for mixed dyslipidemia is appropriate and equivalent in exposure to 145 mg in other products, and I need to ensure I do not inadvertently over-dose by assuming 145 mg applies uniformly to all brands [^1132bKoa] [^112gTPhM].

> Let me consider the fenofibric acid analogs as well, since clinicians sometimes use them interchangeably in concept. Fenofibric acid delayed-release (Trilipix and others) is dosed at 135 mg once daily for mixed dyslipidemia, which provides an active moiety exposure approximately comparable to fenofibrate 145 mg; Fibricor, a lower-dose fenofibric acid tablet, uses 105 mg daily for the same indication, and these dose differences reflect potency and bioavailability rather than a fundamentally different treatment target [^111zjFP4] [^113dQqpJ].

> I should double-check renal dosing because this is a critical safety modifier. In mild to moderate renal impairment, the starting dose should be reduced: 48 mg daily for some tablet formulations, 54 mg daily in others, and roughly 40–45 mg daily for fenofibric acid products, with subsequent titration only after assessing lipid response and renal function; in severe renal impairment, fenofibrate and fenofibric acid should generally be avoided, and I need to ensure I do not overlook this contraindication in eGFR < 30 mL/min contexts [^1162kZb2] [^115BvHcv] [^111zjFP4] [^113dQqpJ].

> Next, I should review administration and food requirements, because this affects both tolerability and exposure. Most fenofibrate tablet formulations should be taken with food to optimize absorption, whereas fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules can be taken without regard to meals; I almost said "take all fenofibrate with food", but wait, I should correct that — Trilipix/fenofibric acid DR is the exception and may be dosed irrespective of meals, which can matter for adherence and scheduling with other medications [^1162kZb2] [^1132bKoa] [^111zjFP4].

> I need to ensure I address hepatic and geriatric considerations. Dose selection in older adults should be based on renal function rather than age per se, and patients with active liver disease should generally avoid fibrates; additionally, I should confirm baseline liver enzymes and monitor for transaminase elevations during therapy, given label warnings about hepatotoxicity and clinical reports of liver injury, and I should remember the rare but serious signal of paradoxical HDL-C plummet, prompting early HDL checks after initiation and discontinuation if severely depressed [^1162kZb2] [^114q9mmF] [^114u5Hwk].

> Let me think about monitoring and titration. Lipid panels should be checked about 4–8 weeks after initiation or dose change to individualize therapy; if lipids fall below target ranges or adverse effects emerge, consider dose reduction, and if there is inadequate response after about 2 months at the maximum recommended dose, therapy should be reconsidered or discontinued, with attention to secondary causes of dyslipidemia and adherence [^1162kZb2] [^112MafYo].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on a statin or needs combination therapy. I should confirm that fenofibrate is the preferred fibrate when combining with statins because gemfibrozil meaningfully increases statin exposure and myopathy risk; if combination therapy is chosen, I should ensure baseline CK is not markedly elevated, eGFR is above 30 mL/min, and I monitor closely for muscle symptoms and liver enzymes, recognizing that fenofibrate–statin combinations are used off-label in many jurisdictions and require shared decision-making given mixed outcomes data [^117CS9zG] [^1139QtRM] [^116ToooH].

> I will now examine practical dose selection by common products to synthesize a clear answer. For most modern fenofibrate tablet products, start 145 mg once daily with food; for Fenoglide, start 120 mg once daily with food; for fenofibric acid delayed-release, start 135 mg once daily, which can be taken without regard to meals; for Fibricor, start 105 mg once daily; and in any mild to moderate renal impairment, reduce to the labeled renal starting dose and titrate cautiously based on response and kidney function, avoiding use in severe renal impairment [^115BvHcv] [^1162kZb2] [^1132bKoa] [^111zjFP4] [^113dQqpJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should explicitly answer the question. For an adult with mixed hyperlipidemia and normal renal function, the typical starting dose of fenofibrate is 145 mg orally once daily with food; if using Fenoglide, start 120 mg once daily with food; if using fenofibric acid delayed-release, start 135 mg once daily, which may be taken without regard to meals; and in mild to moderate renal impairment, start at the labeled reduced dose and titrate carefully while avoiding use if eGFR is below 30 mL/min, ensuring baseline liver enzymes and adherence are optimized before and after initiation [^115BvHcv] [^1132bKoa] [^111zjFP4] [^1162kZb2].

---

For mixed hyperlipidemia, the **starting dose of fenofibrate is 145 mg once daily** with food [^112MafYo]. In mild to moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30–59 mL/min), **start at 48 mg once daily** and titrate cautiously [^112MafYo]. For elderly patients, dose based on renal function and monitor closely. Check baseline liver enzymes and creatinine, reassess lipids at 4–8 weeks, and adjust to a maximum of 145 mg daily if needed.

---

## Recommended starting dose

Standard dose: **145 mg once daily with food** for mixed hyperlipidemia [^115BvHcv] [^111S6YmB]. With food: take with meals to **optimize absorption and minimize GI upset** [^1162kZb2].

---

## Dose adjustments based on renal function

Renal impairment warrants dose adjustment because fenofibrate is renally cleared; **reduce dose in mild to moderate impairment** and avoid use in severe impairment [^112MafYo].

| **Renal function (egfr)** | **Recommended starting dose** |
|-|-|
| Normal (≥ 60 mL/min) | 145 mg once daily |
| Mild impairment (30–59 mL/min) | 48 mg once daily |
| Severe impairment (< 30 mL/min) | Contraindicated |

---

## Special considerations for elderly patients

In elderly patients, **dose based on renal function** given age-related decline in GFR [^1162kZb2] and monitor for adverse effects [^114u5Hwk].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Baseline assessment**: liver enzymes (ALT, AST) and renal function (serum creatinine, eGFR) [^112EF3NH].
- **Follow-up**: recheck lipids at 4–8 weeks and adjust dose to a maximum of 145 mg daily if needed [^112MafYo].
- **Ongoing monitoring**: periodic liver enzymes and renal function during therapy [^115cdQLr].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing recommendations

Clinical trials show fenofibrate 145 mg daily **improves LDL-C, TG, and HDL-C** in mixed hyperlipidemia [^117NoyfW]. Dose adjustments in renal impairment are supported by pharmacokinetic and safety data [^1162kZb2].

---

## Summary of dosing recommendations

| **Patient population** | **Recommended starting dose** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| General adult population | 145 mg once daily with food | Standard dose |
| Mild to moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30–59 mL/min) | 48 mg once daily | Dose reduction required |
| Severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min) | Contraindicated | Avoid use |
| Elderly patients | Dose based on renal function | Monitor closely |

---

The starting dose of fenofibrate for mixed hyperlipidemia is **145 mg once daily with food** [^115BvHcv], with dose adjustments for renal impairment and close monitoring of liver and renal function [^112MafYo].

2.1 General Considerations

Patients should be placed on an appropriate lipid-lowering diet before receiving fenofibrate tablets and should continue this diet during treatment with fenofibrate tablets. Fenofibrate tablets should be given with meals, thereby optimizing the bioavailability of the medication.

The initial treatment for dyslipidemia is dietary therapy specific for the type of lipoprotein abnormality. Excess body weight and excess alcoholic intake may be important factors in hypertriglyceridemia and should be addressed prior to any drug therapy. Physical exercise can be an important ancillary measure. Diseases contributory to hyperlipidemia, such as hypothyroidism or diabetes mellitus should be looked for and adequately treated. Estrogen therapy, thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers, are sometimes associated with massive rises in plasma triglycerides, especially in subjects with familial hypertriglyceridemia. In such cases, discontinuation of the specific etiologic agent may obviate the need for specific drug therapy of hypertriglyceridemia.

Lipid levels should be monitored periodically and consideration should be given to reducing the dosage of fenofibrate tablets if lipid levels fall significantly below the targeted range.

Therapy should be withdrawn in patients who do not have an adequate response after two months of treatment with the maximum recommended dose of 160 mg once daily.

2.2 Primary Hypercholesterolemia or Mixed Dyslipidemia

The initial dose of fenofibrate tablet is 160 mg once daily.

2.3 Severe Hypertriglyceridemia

The initial dose is 54 mg per day to 160 mg per day. Dosage should be individualized according to patient response and should be adjusted if necessary following repeat lipid determinations at 4 to 8 week intervals. The maximum dose is 160 mg once daily.

2.4 Impaired Renal Function

Treatment with fenofibrate tablets should be initiated at a dose of 54 mg per day in patients having mild to moderately impaired renal function and increased only after evaluation of the effects on renal function and lipid levels at this dose. The use of fenofibrate tablets should be avoided in patients with severe renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.5 Geriatric Patients

Dose selection for the elderly should be made on the basis of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

### Long-term safety and efficacy of fenofibric acid in combination with statin therapy for the treatment of patients with mixed dyslipidemia [^117VBChk]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Co-administration of a fibrate and statin is an effective treatment option for patients with multiple lipid abnormalities, yet adequate long-term safety and efficacy data are lacking.

Objective

To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of fenofibric acid combined with statins in adults with mixed dyslipidemia.

Methods

Three large, 12-week, phase three, double-blind, randomized, controlled trials evaluated fenofibric acid 135 mg combined with a low- or moderate-dose statin compared to fenofibric acid or statin monotherapy, and a subsequent 52-week open-label extension study evaluated fenofibric acid 135 mg combined with moderate-dose statin (rosuvastatin 20 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, or atorvastatin 40 mg). This prespecified analysis integrated results from these studies to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of combination therapy.

Results

Across the controlled studies and the extension study, 2201 patients received at least one dose of fenofibric acid + statin for a median duration of 364 days. The most common adverse events were headache, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, and back pain, with the incidence of all adverse events being similar across all combination therapy treatment groups. Rhabdomyolysis or treatment-related death was not reported in any group. Combination therapy resulted in sustained improvements in multiple lipid parameters, including triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.

Conclusion

Long-term fenofibric acid + statin combination therapy was generally well tolerated and resulted in comprehensive and sustained improvements in multiple lipid parameters in adults with mixed dyslipidemia.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

14.1 Primary Hypercholesterolemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia

The effects of fenofibrate at a dose equivalent to 160 mg fenofibrate tablets per day were assessed from four randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group studies including patients with the following mean baseline lipid values: total-C 306.9 mg/dL; LDL-C 213.8 mg/dL; HDL-C 52.3 mg/dL; and triglycerides 191 mg/dL. Fenofibrate therapy lowered LDL-C, Total-C, and the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. Fenofibrate therapy also lowered triglycerides and raised HDL-C (see Table 4).

Table 4: Mean Percent Change in Lipid Parameters at End of Treatment †

In a subset of the subjects, measurements of apo B were conducted. Fenofibrate treatment significantly reduced apo B from baseline to endpoint as compared with placebo (-25.1% vs. 2.4%, p < 0.0001, n = 213 and 143 respectively).

14.2 Severe Hypertriglyceridemia

The effects of fenofibrate on serum triglycerides were studied in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 147 hypertriglyceridemic patients. Patients were treated for eight weeks under protocols that differed only in that one entered patients with baseline TG levels of 500 mg/dL to 1,500 mg/dL, and the other TG levels of 350 mg/dL to 500 mg/dL. In patients with hypertriglyceridemia and normal cholesterolemia with or without hyperchylomicronemia, treatment with fenofibrate at dosages equivalent to fenofibrate 160 mg per day decreased primarily very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol. Treatment of patients with elevated triglycerides often results in an increase of LDL-C (see Table 5).

### Efficacy of fenofibric acid plus statins on multiple lipid parameters and its safety in women with mixed dyslipidemia [^117JpDG8]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

The combination of fibrate and statin therapies may be a treatment option for women with multiple lipid abnormalities. We, therefore, initiated the present safety and efficacy analysis to address the paucity of such data in women with mixed dyslipidemia. A total of 1,393 women with mixed dyslipidemia (low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol ≥ 130 mg/dl, triglycerides [TG] ≥ 150 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol < 50 mg/dl), who had enrolled in any 1 of 3 randomized clinical trials, were evaluated. The eligible women were randomized to receive fenofibric acid plus a low- or moderate-dose statin (combination treatment); or low-, moderate-, or high-dose statin monotherapy; or fenofibric acid monotherapy. With low-dose combination treatment, the baseline HDL cholesterol level increased 20% and TG decreased 46% compared to an 8% HDL cholesterol increase and 20% TG decrease with low-dose statins alone. With the moderate-dose combination, the baseline HDL cholesterol increased 21% and TG decreased 44% compared to an 8% HDL cholesterol increase and 26% TG decrease with moderate-dose statins alone. The reduction in baseline LDL cholesterol with low-dose and moderate-dose combinations (37% and 39%, respectively) was comparable to the reduction with corresponding-dose statins (36% and 43%, respectively). High-dose statins decreased the baseline LDL cholesterol 47%; however, the increase in HDL cholesterol (9%) and decrease in TG (25%) were similar to the changes observed with lower doses of statins. The safety profiles of the combinations were comparable to those of the component therapies. In conclusion, these data suggest that a combination of fenofibric acid and a statin could be considered safe and efficacious for treating women with mixed dyslipidemia.

### Efficacy and safety of adding fenofibrate 160 mg in high-risk patients with mixed hyperlipidemia not controlled by pravastatin 40 mg monotherapy [^111ZP1VP]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with mixed hyperlipidemia and at high risk of coronary heart disease may not achieve recommended low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol goals on statin monotherapy. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fenofibrate 160 mg/pravastatin 40 mg fixed-dose combination therapy in high-risk patients not at their LDL cholesterol goal on pravastatin 40 mg. In this 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study, after a run-in on pravastatin 40 mg, 248 patients were randomly assigned to fenofibrate/pravastatin combination therapy or to pravastatin monotherapy. Combination therapy produced significantly greater complementary decreases in non-HDL cholesterol (primary end point) than pravastatin monotherapy (-14.1% vs -6.1%, p = 0.002). Significantly greater improvements were also observed in LDL cholesterol (-11.7% vs -5.9%, p = 0.019), HDL cholesterol (+6.5% vs +2.3%, p = 0.009), triglycerides (-22.6% vs -2.0%, p = 0.006), and apolipoprotein B (-12.6% vs -3.8%, p < 0.0001). Significantly more patients receiving the fenofibrate/pravastatin combination therapy than pravastatin alone achieved the LDL cholesterol (< 100 mg/dl) and non-HDL cholesterol (< 130 mg/dl) goals (p < 0.01). Combination therapy was generally well tolerated with incidences of clinical and laboratory adverse experiences similar between the 2 groups. In conclusion, the fenofibrate 160 mg/pravastatin 40 mg fixed-dose combination therapy significantly improved the global atherogenic lipid profile in high-risk patients with mixed hyperlipidemia not controlled by pravastatin 40 mg monotherapy.

### Fenofibric acid (trilipix) [^117XX6Bb]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Mixed dyslipidemia: 135 mg once daily (2.2).
Hypertriglyceridemia: 45 to 135 mg once daily (2.3).
Renally impaired patients: 45 mg once daily (2.5).
Maximum dose: 135 mg once daily (2.1).
May be taken without regard to food (2.1).
May be taken at the same time as a statin (2.2).
Co-administration with the maximum dose of a statin has not been evaluated in clinical studies and should be avoided unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks (2.2).

2.1 General Considerations

Patients should be placed on an appropriate lipid-lowering diet before receiving Trilipix as monotherapy or co-administered with a statin [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2, 2.3 and 2.4)], and should continue this diet during treatment. Trilipix delayed release capsules can be taken without regard to meals. Serum lipids should be monitored periodically. The maximum dose is 135 mg once daily.

2.2 Co-administration Therapy with Statins for the Treatment of Mixed Dyslipidemia

Trilipix 135 mg may be co-administered with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) in patients with mixed dyslipidemia. For convenience, the daily dose of Trilipix may be taken at the same time as a statin, according to the dosing recommendations for each medication. Co-administration with the maximum dose of a statin has not been evaluated in clinical studies and should be avoided unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks.

2.3 Severe Hypertriglyceridemia

The initial dose of Trilipix is 45 to 135 mg once daily. Dosage should be individualized according to patient response, and should be adjusted if necessary following repeat lipid determinations at 4 to 8 week intervals. The maximum dose is 135 mg once daily.

2.4 Primary Hyperlipidemia or Mixed Dyslipidemia

The dose of Trilipix is 135 mg once daily.

2.5 Impaired Renal Function

Treatment with Trilipix should be initiated at a dose of 45 mg once daily in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and should only be increased after evaluation of the effects on renal function and lipid levels at this dose. The use of Trilipix should be avoided in patients with severely impaired renal function.

2.6 Elderly Patients

Dose selection for the elderly should be made on the basis of renal function [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.5)].

### Efficacy and safety of fenofibric acid in combination with a statin in patients with mixed dyslipidemia: pooled analysis of three phase 3, 12-week randomized, controlled studies [^112hyagd]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with mixed dyslipidemia often require combination therapy to manage multiple lipid abnormalities.

Objective

To evaluate fenofibric acid in combination with a statin across three studies of patients with mixed dyslipidemia.

Methods

As prospectively planned, data were pooled from three randomized, double-blind, phase 3 studies of patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 130mg/dL, triglycerides (TG) ≥ 150mg/dL, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) < 40mg/dL (men) or < 50mg/dL (women). A total of 2715 patients were randomly assigned to 12-week treatment with fenofibric acid 135mg monotherapy; low-, moderate-, or high-dose statin (rosuvastatin, simvastatin, or atorvastatin, depending on study) monotherapy; or fenofibric acid + low- or moderate-dose statin. The primary efficacy comparisons were mean percent change in HDL-C and TG (combination therapy vs. statin) and LDL-C (combination therapy vs. fenofibric acid).

Results

Fenofibric acid + low-dose statin increased HDL-C (18.1% vs. 7.4%) and reduced TG (-43.9% vs. -16.8%) versus low-dose statin monotherapy and reduced LDL-C (-33.1% vs. -5.1%) versus fenofibric acid monotherapy (P < .001 for all). Fenofibric acid + moderate-dose statin increased HDL-C (17.5% vs. 8.7%) and reduced TG (-42.0% vs. -23.7%) versus moderate-dose statin monotherapy and reduced LDL-C (-34.6% vs. -5.1%) versus fenofibric acid monotherapy (P < .001 for all). Combination therapy was generally well tolerated, and safety profiles were similar to monotherapies. No rhabdomyolysis was reported.

Conclusion

In patients with mixed dyslipidemia, combination therapy simultaneously improved multiple lipid abnormalities more effectively than fenofibric acid or statin monotherapies.

### Fenofibrate (fenoglide) [^112gTPhM]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

14.1 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia

The effects of fenofibrate at a dose equivalent to 120 mg Fenoglide per day were assessed from four randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group studies including patients with the following mean baseline lipid values: total-C 306.9 mg/dL; LDL-C 213.8 mg/dL; HDL-C 52.3 mg/dL; and triglycerides 191.0 mg/dL. Fenofibrate therapy lowered LDL-C, Total-C, and the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. Fenofibrate therapy also lowered triglycerides and raised HDL-C (see Table 2).

In a subset of the subjects, measurements of apo B were conducted. Fenofibrate treatment significantly reduced apo B from baseline to endpoint as compared with placebo (-25.1% vs. 2.4%, p < 0.0001, n = 213 and 143 respectively).

14.2 Hypertriglyceridemia

The effects of fenofibrate on serum triglycerides were studied in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 147 hypertriglyceridemic patients. Patients were treated for eight weeks under protocols that differed only in that one entered patients with baseline triglyceride (TG) levels of 500 to 1500 mg/dL, and the other TG levels of 350 to 500 mg/dL. In patients with hypertriglyceridemia and normal cholesterolemia with or without hyperchylomicronemia, treatment with fenofibrate at dosages equivalent to 120 mg Fenoglide (fenofibrate) Tablets per day decreased primarily very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol. Treatment of patients with elevated triglycerides often results in an increase of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (see Table 3).

### Statins as the cornerstone of drug therapy for dyslipidemia: monotherapy and combination therapy options [^111G8mpH]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction with statin treatment remains the cornerstone of lipid-lowering therapy to reduce risk of coronary heart disease. Combination therapy with a statin poses advantages in certain settings and may allow use of lower doses of multiple drugs rather than maximum doses of a single drug. Bile-acid sequestrants or the cholesterol-absorption inhibitor ezetimibe can be added to a statin to achieve greater LDL cholesterol reductions. Niacin or fenofibrate can be added to a statin for treatment of mixed dyslipidemia. Differences in statin efficacy in reducing LDL cholesterol and meeting recommended LDL cholesterol targets as well as differences among these agents in beneficial effects on other lipid parameters can affect whether and how these agents are prescribed in monotherapy and combination therapy.

### Liver injury caused by fenofibrate within 48 h after first administration: a case report [^114q9mmF]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Fenofibrate is a peroxisome proliferator receptor alpha (PPAR-α) activator which is commonly used in the therapy of hypertriglyceridemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Mild, transient serum aminotransferase elevations may develop in up to 20% of patients receiving fenofibrate. Only 3–5% of patients would exhibit elevation to above 3 times of ULN. In some cases, patients may develop severe chronic injury such as fibrosis or cirrhosis, which could lead to liver transplantation or death. It is widely recognized that liver damage usually occurs several weeks or months after starting of the medication, with some cases extending to 6 months or even years after starting of the medication.

14.3 Primary Hypercholesterolemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia

The effects of fenofibrate at a dose equivalent to Trilipix 135 mg once daily were assessed from four randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group studies including patients with the following mean baseline lipid values: Total-C 306.9 mg/dL; LDL-C 213.8 mg/dL; HDL-C 52.3 mg/dL; and triglycerides 191.0 mg/dL. Fenofibrate therapy lowered LDL-C, Total-C, and the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. Fenofibrate therapy also lowered triglycerides and raised HDL-C (Table 8).

In a subset of the subjects, measurements of Apo B were conducted. Fenofibrate treatment significantly reduced Apo B from baseline to endpoint as compared with placebo (-25.1% vs. 2.4%, p < 0.0001, n = 213 and 143, respectively).

### Safety and efficacy of long-term co-administration of fenofibrate and ezetimibe in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia [^1167n1S8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of co-administered fenofibrate (FENO) and ezetimibe (EZE) in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia.

Background

Both EZE and FENO offer complementary benefits to the lipid profile of patients with mixed hyperlipidemia.

Methods

After completing the 12-week randomized, double-blind base study that compared EZE 10 mg, FENO 160 mg, FENO 160 mg plus EZE 10 mg, and placebo in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia, patients continued into a double-blind, 48-week extension phase. Those patients in the FENO plus EZE and FENO groups continued on their respective base study treatment, and patients in the EZE and placebo groups were switched to FENO plus EZE and FENO, respectively.

Results

Of the 587 patients who completed the base study, 576 continued into the extension study (n = 340 in FENO plus EZE and n = 236 in FENO). The FENO plus EZE produced significantly greater reductions in low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol compared with FENO (-22% vs. -9%, respectively; p < 0.001). There were also significantly greater improvements in triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol, non-HDL-C, and apolipoprotein B with FENO plus EZE compared with FENO. Changes in apolipoprotein A-I and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were similar between groups. Overall, FENO plus EZE was well tolerated during the extension study. The proportion of patients with consecutive elevations of alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase ≥ 3 times upper limit of normal were similar between the FENO plus EZE (1.2%) and FENO (1.7%) groups. No cases of creatine phosphokinase elevations ≥ 10 times upper limit of normal or myopathy were observed in either group.

Conclusions

Long-term, 48-week co-administration of FENO plus EZE was well tolerated and more efficacious than FENO in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia.

### Efficacy and safety of the coadministration of ezetimibe / simvastatin with fenofibrate in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia [^115o9Bmt]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Mixed hyperlipidemia is characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), and TG-rich lipoprotein levels.

Methods

In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm trial, eligible patients were 18 to 79 years of age, with mixed hyperlipidemia (LDL-C 130–220 mg/dL, TG 150–500 mg/dL). Patients with type 2 diabetes were limited to those with LDL-C of 100 to 180 mg/dL. Patients (N = 611) were randomized in a 3:3:3:1 ratio to one of 4 treatment arms for 12 weeks: ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/20 mg (EZE/SIMVA) + fenofibrate 160 mg (FENO), EZE/SIMVA 10/20 mg, FENO 160 mg, or placebo. The primary objective was to evaluate the LDL-C-lowering efficacy of EZE/SIMVA + FENO versus FENO monotherapy.

Results

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was significantly (P < .05) reduced with EZE/SIMVA + FENO (-45.8%) compared with FENO (-15.7%) or placebo (-3.5%), but not when compared with EZE/SIMVA (-47.1%). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels were significantly increased with EZE/SIMVA + FENO (18.7% and 11.1%, respectively) treatment compared with EZE/SIMVA (9.3% and 6.6%) or placebo (1.1% and 1.6%), but not when compared with FENO (18.2% and 10.8%). Triglyceride, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B levels were significantly reduced with EZE/SIMVA + FENO (-50.0%, -50.5%, and -44.7%, respectively) versus all other treatments. Treatment with EZE/SIMVA + FENO was generally well tolerated with a safety profile similar to the EZE/SIMVA and FENO therapies.

Conclusions

Coadministration of EZE/SIMVA + FENO effectively improved the overall atherogenic lipid profile of patients with mixed hyperlipidemia. Clinical trial registry number: NCT 00093899 (http://www. ClinicalTrials.gov).

### Optimal pharmacologic approach to patients with hypertriglyceridemia and low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol: randomized comparison of fenofibrate 160 mg and niacin 1500 mg [^115fgdAY]. Atherosclerosis (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Atherogenic dyslipidemia is emerging as a target of lipid-modifying therapy. However, an optimal pharmacologic approach has not yet been established. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of the typical doses of fenofibrate and niacin.

Methods

After an eight-week dietary run-in, 201 patients who had triglyceride (TG) levels of 150–499 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels of < 45 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels of < 130 mg/dL were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups for 16 weeks: fenofibrate 160 mg or niacin extended release 1500 mg (starting at 500 mg and up-titrated at the fifth and ninth weeks).

Results

One hundred forty patients completed the study. The percent reductions in apoB/A1 were not different between the two groups (-20% and -22% in the fenofibrate and niacin groups, respectively, p = 0.47). The effects of the two regimens on HDL-C were similar (24% and 20%, respectively, p = 0.22), while fenofibrate reduced TG more than did niacin (-53% and -48%, respectively, p = 0.045). Niacin was more effective at lowering LDL-C, Lp (a), and hs-CRP. However, niacin worsened the parameters of glycemic control, whereas fenofibrate improved them. Niacin showed more frequent adverse events including pruritus and skin flushing.

Conclusions

These two regimens have largely comparable lipid-modifying effects. However, their effects on glucose metabolism and inflammation, and their adverse events need to be considered additionally. Our results underscore more individualized pharmacologic approaches to patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia.

### Attainment of goal / desirable lipid levels in patients with mixed dyslipidemia after 12 weeks of treatment with fenofibric acid and rosuvastatin combination therapy: a pooled analysis of controlled studies [^114REpUZ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Goal/desirable lipid levels are underachieved in patients with mixed dyslipidemia. These patients may have substantial residual risk of cardiovascular disease even while receiving optimal LDL-C-lowering therapy and may require additional therapy to improve multiple lipid/lipoprotein levels.

Objective

To evaluate attainment of goal/desirable levels of lipids/lipoproteins after 12-week treatment with combination rosuvastatin + fenofibric acid versus rosuvastatin monotherapy.

Methods

This was a post hoc analysis of patients with mixed dyslipidemia who enrolled in one of two randomized controlled trials, and were treated (N = 2066) with rosuvastatin (5, 10, or 20 mg), fenofibric acid 135 mg, or rosuvastatin + fenofibric acid for 12 weeks. Data were pooled across doses of rosuvastatin as monotherapy and combination therapy.

Results

Compared with rosuvastatin monotherapy, combination therapy had comparable effects in achieving risk-stratified LDL-C goals; however, measures of total atherogenic burden were improved because significantly greater percentages of patients attained non-HDL-C goal in high- (62.9% vs 50.4%, P = 0.006) and moderate-risk groups (87.6% vs 80.4%, P = 0.016) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) < 90 mg/dL in high-risk group (59.8% vs 43.8%, P < .001). In the overall population, more patients treated with the combination therapy achieved desirable levels of HDL-C > 40/50 mg/dL in men/women (P < .001), triglycerides < 150 mg/dL (P < .001), and ApoB < 90 mg/dL (P < .001), compared with rosuvastatin monotherapy. Furthermore, combination therapy resulted in significantly greater percentages of patients achieving simultaneous specified levels of LDL-C + non-HDL-C (P < .015); LDL-C + HDL-C + TG (P < .001); and LDL-C + HDL-C + triglycerides + non-HDL-C + ApoB (P < .001), compared with rosuvastatin monotherapy.

Conclusion

Rosuvastatin + fenofibric acid may be more efficacious than rosuvastatin alone in patients with mixed dyslipidemia.

### Effects of fenofibric acid on carotid intima-media thickness in patients with mixed dyslipidemia on atorvastatin therapy: randomized, placebo-controlled study (FIRST) [^111kiFWL]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess whether adding a fibrate to statin therapy reduces residual cardiovascular risk associated with elevated triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, The Evaluation of Choline Fenofibrate (ABT-335) on Carotid Intima-Media Thickness (cIMT) in Subjects with Type IIb Dyslipidemia with Residual Risk in Addition to Atorvastatin Therapy (FIRST) trial evaluated the effects of fenofibric acid (FA) treatment on cIMT in patients with mixed dyslipidemia on atorvastatin.

Approach and Results

This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed in patients with mixed dyslipidemia (fasting triglycerides, ≥ 150 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, ≤ 45 [men] or 55 mg/dL [women]; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, ≤ 100 mg/dL once and averaging ≤ 105 mg/dL) and a history of coronary heart disease or risk equivalent. Patients on background atorvastatin (continued on starting dose or titrated to 40 mg, if needed) were randomized to FA 135 mg or placebo. The primary end point was rate of change from baseline through week 104 of the mean posterior-wall cIMT, measured by ultrasound. In patients with controlled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol while on atorvastatin background therapy, rate of change in posterior-wall cIMT was similar with FA plus atorvastatin (-0.006 mm/y) versus atorvastatin monotherapy (0.000 mm/y; P = 0.22). FA plus atorvastatin was favored (P < 0.05) in 5 of 24 prespecified subgroups: age ≥ 60 years, history of coronary artery disease, cIMT > 0.795 mm, triglycerides 170 to 235 mg/dL, and statin use at entry. Adverse events were consistent with the known safety profiles of both drugs; however, FA plus atorvastatin was associated with a greater incidence of renal-related adverse events compared with atorvastatin monotherapy (6.5% versus 0.9%).

Conclusions

Compared with atorvastatin monotherapy, FA plus atorvastatin did not further decrease cIMT progression in high-risk patients with mixed dyslipidemia.

### Combination rosuvastatin plus fenofibric acid in a cohort of patients 65 years or older with mixed dyslipidemia: subanalysis of two randomized, controlled studies [^111581Q1]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary heart disease risk increases with advancing age and is further increased in patients with mixed dyslipidemia, characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and high triglycerides (TG). Combination lipid therapy is an option; however, efficacy and safety data among elderly patients are lacking.

Hypothesis

The combination of rosuvastatin and fenofibric acid (R + FA) results in more comprehensive lipid improvements than corresponding-dose monotherapies, without additional safety concerns, in elderly patients with mixed dyslipidemia.

Methods

This post-hoc analysis evaluated data from patients age ≥ 65 years (n = 401) with mixed dyslipidemia (LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL, HDL-C < 40 mg/dL [men] or < 50 mg/dL [women], and TG ≥ 150 mg/dL) in 2 randomized studies. Patients included in this analysis received either monotherapy (as R 5, 10, or 20 mg or FA 135 mg), or combination therapy with R (5, 10, or 20 mg) + FA 135 mg, for 12 weeks. Data were pooled and analyzed, and mean/median percent changes in multiple lipid parameters and biomarkers were compared.

Results

Combination therapy decreased LDL-C by 31.8%-47.2% vs 10.6% with FA monotherapy (P < 0.001). Combination therapy also increased HDL-C by 21.9%-27.0% vs 5.9%-9.9% with R monotherapy (P < 0.001), and decreased TG by 48.3%-53.5% vs 20.7%-32.8% with R monotherapy (P < 0.001). In general, safety profiles were consistent between combination therapy and individual monotherapies.

Conclusions

In these elderly patients with mixed dyslipidemia, R 5, 10, or 20 mg in combination with FA 135 mg improved the overall lipid profile, without new or unexpected safety issues.

### Fenofibrate [^115peega]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Fenofibrate is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha agonist indicated as an adjunct to diet:

To reduce elevated LDL-C, Total-C, TG and Apo B, and to increase HDL-­C in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia. (1.1)
For treatment of adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. (1.2)

Limitations of Use: Fenofibrate was not shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. (5.1)

1.1 Primary Hypercholesterolemia or Mixed Dyslipidemia

Fenofibrate tablets are indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (Total-C), Triglycerides and apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia.

1.2 Severe Hypertriglyceridemia

Fenofibrate tablets are also indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for treatment of adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Improving glycemic control in diabetic patients showing fasting chylomicronemia will usually obviate the need for pharmacologic intervention.

Markedly elevated levels of serum triglycerides (e.g., > 2,000 mg/dL) may increase the risk of developing pancreatitis. The effect of fenofibrate therapy on reducing this risk has not been adequately studied.

1.3 Important Limitations of Use

Fenofibrate at a dose equivalent to 160 mg of fenofibrate tablet was not shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in a large, randomized controlled trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Fixed-dose combination fenofibrate / pravastatin 160 / 40 mg versus simvastatin 20 mg monotherapy in adults with type 2 diabetes and mixed hyperlipidemia uncontrolled with simvastatin 20 mg: a double-blind, randomized comparative study [^115e9hjh]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and mixed hyperlipidemia have an increased cardiovascular risk and may not achieve recommended LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals on statin monotherapy. This study was designed to obtain regulatory approval of a fenofibrate/pravastatin 160/40 mg fixed-dose combination (FDC) capsule.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of this FDC and simvastatin 20 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm study was conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes and mixed hyperlipidemia, without cardiovascular disease, and who were not at lipid goals with simvastatin 20 mg monotherapy. After a 6-week run-in period during which patients received simvastatin 20 mg, those with non-HDL-C concentrations ≥ 130 mg/dL or LDL-C concentrations ≥ 100 mg/dL and triglyceride concentrations 150 to 600 mg/dL were enrolled. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive 12-week treatment with fenofibrate/pravastatin 160/40 mg FDC or simvastatin 20 mg once daily, followed by a 12-week open-label tolerability-assessment period during which all patients received the FDC. The primary efficacy outcome was the mean percentage change in non-HDL-C after 12 weeks. Secondary efficacy outcomes included changes in other lipid and lipoprotein parameters, fibrinogen, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Tolerability was assessed based on the prevalence of adverse events and abnormal laboratory data in each treatment group.

Results

A total of 291 patients were randomized to receive fenofibrate/pravastatin (n = 145) or simvastatin (n = 146). The mean (SD) age of the participants was 56.6 (8.9) years, 48.1% were men, and the body mass index was 31.3 (4.6) kg/m(2). The FDC was associated with a significantly greater reduction in non-HDL-C (primary end point) compared with simvastatin monotherapy (-12.9% [1.8] vs -6.8% [1.8]; P = 0.008). Triglyceride (-28.6% [3.7] vs +5.0% [3.6]; P < 0.001), fibrinogen (-11.5% [1.6] vs +0.3% [1.6]; P < 0.001), and HDL-C (+6.3% [1.3] vs +1.8% [1.3]; P = 0.008) concentrations also were significantly improved with the FDC compared with simvastatin monotherapy. The proportions of patients who achieved the LDL-C target (< 100 mg/dL) were not significantly different between the 2 groups. The proportion of patients who achieved the combined end point of non-HDL-C < 130 mg/dL and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL was significantly greater with fenofibrate/pravastatin compared with simvastatin monotherapy (41 [28.5%] vs 26 [17.9%]; P < 0.05). The prevalences of patients who experienced ≥ 1 adverse event were not statistically different between the fenofibrate/pravastatin and simvastatin groups (17.2% vs 15.1%). However, compared with simvastatin monotherapy, the combination treatment was associated with significantly greater increases in alanine aminotransferase (+9.6% vs +1.5%; P = 0.03 between groups), creatinine (+13.7% vs +6.8%; P = 0.002 between groups), and homocysteine (+36.5% vs +1.6%; P < 0.001 between groups) concentrations.

Conclusions

In this selected population of adults with type 2 diabetes, the fenofibrate/pravastatin 160/40 mg FDC was associated with significantly greater changes from baseline in non-HDL-C, triglyceride, and HDL-C concentrations compared with simvastatin 20 mg. Both treatments were well tolerated.

### Fenofibric acid (Fenofibric acid delayed-release) [^1167oo4Z]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

14.1 Severe Hypertriglyceridemia

The effects of fenofibrate on serum triglycerides were studied in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 147 hypertriglyceridemic patients. Patients were treated for eight weeks under protocols that differed only in that one entered patients with baseline TG levels of 500 to 1,500 mg/dL, and the other TG levels of 350 to 500 mg/dL. In patients with hypertriglyceridemia and normal cholesterolemia with or without hyperchylomicronemia, treatment with fenofibrate at dosages equivalent to 135 mg once daily of fenofibric acid decreased primarily VLDL-TG and VLDL-C. Treatment of patients with elevated TG often results in an increase of LDL-C (Table 4).

14.2 Primary Hypercholesterolemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia

The effects of fenofibrate at a dose equivalent to fenofibric acid 135 mg once daily were assessed from four randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group studies including patients with the following mean baseline lipid values: Total-C 306.9 mg/dL; LDL-C 213.8 mg/dL; HDL-C 52.3 mg/dL; and triglycerides 191.0 mg/dL. Fenofibrate therapy lowered LDL-C, Total-C, and the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. Fenofibrate therapy also lowered triglycerides and raised HDL-C (Table 5).

In a subset of the subjects, measurements of Apo B were conducted. Fenofibrate treatment significantly reduced Apo B from baseline to endpoint as compared with placebo (-25.1% vs. 2.4%, p < 0.0001, n = 213 and 143, respectively).

### Fenofibric acid (Fenofibric acid delayed-release) [^111zjFP4]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Hypertriglyceridemia: 45 mg to 135 mg once daily (2.2).
Primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: 135 mg once daily (2.3).
Renally impaired patients: 45 mg once daily (2.4).
Maximum dose: 135 mg once daily (2.1).
May be taken without regard to food (2.1).

2.1 General Considerations

Patients should be placed on an appropriate lipid-lowering diet before receiving fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules and should continue this diet during treatment. Fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules can be taken without regard to meals. Patients should be advised to swallow fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules whole. Do not open, crush, dissolve, or chew capsules. Serum lipids should be monitored periodically.

2.2 Severe Hypertriglyceridemia

The initial dose of fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules are 45 mg to 135 mg once daily. Dosage should be individualized according to patient response, and should be adjusted if necessary following repeat lipid determinations at 4 to 8 week intervals. The maximum dose is 135 mg once daily.

2.3 Primary Hypercholesterolemia or Mixed Dyslipidemia

The dose of fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules are 135 mg once daily.

2.4 Impaired Renal Function

Treatment with fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules should be initiated at a dose of 45 mg once daily in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and should only be increased after evaluation of the effects on renal function and lipid levels at this dose. The use of fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules should be avoided in patients with severely impaired renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.5 Geriatric Patients

Dose selection for the elderly should be made on the basis of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

### Fenofibric acid (Fibricor) [^111p4waA]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

14.1	Severe Hypertriglyceridemia

The effects of fenofibrate on serum triglycerides were studied in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 147 hypertriglyceridemic patients. Patients were treated for eight weeks under protocols that differed only in that one protocol entered patients with baseline triglyceride (TG) levels of 500 to 1500 mg/dL, and the other TG levels of 350 to 500 mg/dL.

In patients with hypertriglyceridemia and normal cholesterolemia with or without hyperchylomicronemia, treatment with fenofibrate at dosages equivalent to 105 mg of FIBRICOR decreased primarily very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol. Treatment of some with elevated triglycerides often results in an increase of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (see Table 4).

14.2	Primary Hypercholesterolemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia

The effects of fenofibrate at doses equivalent to 105 mg of FIBRICOR were assessed from four randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group studies including patients with the following mean baseline lipid values: Total-C 306.9 mg/dL; LDL-C 213.8 mg/dL; HDL-C 52.3 mg/dL; and triglycerides 191.0 mg/dL. Fenofibrate therapy lowered LDL-C, Total-C, and the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. Fenofibrate therapy also lowered triglycerides and raised HDL-C (see Table 5).

In a subset of the subjects, measurement of Apo B was conducted. Fenofibrate treatment significantly reduced Apo B from baseline to endpoint as compared with placebo (-25.1% vs. 2.4%, p < 0.0001, n = 213 and 143 respectively).

The effect of FIBRICOR on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

### The effects of fenofibric acid alone and with statins on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its diagnostic components in patients with mixed dyslipidemia [^115xZpSq]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Three similarly designed, phase III, randomized, double-blind, 12-week studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of FA in combination with either rosuvastatin, simvastatin, or atorvastatin. After a 6-week lipid-altering drug washout period, all studies enrolled patients with mixed dyslipidemia (HDL cholesterol < 40 mg/dl [< 1.04 mmol/l] for men, < 50 mg/dl [< 1.30 mmol/l] for women; triglycerides [TGs] ≥ 150 mg/dl [≥ 1.70 mmol/l]; and LDL cholesterol ≥ 130 mg/dl [≥ 3.37 mmol/l]). Patients were assigned in a 2:2:2:2:2:1 ratio to 1 of 6 treatment arms: FA 135 mg monotherapy; low-dose statin monotherapy; FA 135 mg + low-dose statin; moderate-dose statin monotherapy; FA 135 mg + moderate-dose statin; or high-dose statin monotherapy. Each study used a different statin, and the respective doses of low-, moderate-, or high-dose statin were rosuvastatin 10, 20, or 40 mg, or simvastatin or atorvastatin 20, 40, or 80 mg. Data were pooled across the 3 studies. For further details regarding patients and study design, see the article by Jones et al.

Assessments included the number and percent of patients with metabolic syndrome at the final visit for each treatment group, as well as the number and percent of patients having individual metabolic syndrome diagnostic criteria at the baseline visit and at the final visit. In order to be included in these analyses, patients were required to have a final visit value for each metabolic syndrome diagnostic criteria. Waist circumference was not measured at final visit; baseline values were carried forward.

Mean changes from baseline to final value in weight, blood pressure, and fasting glucose were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA, comparing combination therapy with corresponding-dose monotherapies. Percent changes in efficacy parameters were compared between combination therapy and corresponding-dose monotherapies as previously described.

### Efficacy and safety of the coadministration of ezetimibe with fenofibrate in patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia [^111DPaM1]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

To examine the efficacy and safety of coadministered ezetimibe (EZE) with fenofibrate (FENO) in patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia.

Methods and Results

This was a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm trial in patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia [LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), 3.4–5.7 mmol/L (2.6–4.7 mmol/L for patients with type 2 diabetes); triglycerides (TG), 2.3–5.7 mmol/L] and no history of coronary heart disease (CHD), CHD-equivalent disease (except for type 2 diabetes), or CHD risk score > 20%. A total of 625 patients was randomized in a 1:3:3:3 ratio to one of four daily treatments for 12 weeks: placebo; EZE 10 mg; FENO 160 mg; FENO 160 mg plus EZE 10 mg (FENO+EZE). The primary endpoint compared the LDL-C lowering efficacy of FENO+EZE vs. FENO alone. LDL-C, non-HDL-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and apolipoprotein B were significantly (P < 0.001) reduced with FENO+EZE when compared with FENO or EZE alone. TG levels were significantly decreased and HDL-C was significantly increased with FENO+EZE and FENO treatments when compared with placebo (P < 0.001). Coadministration therapy reduced LDL-C by 20.4%, non-HDL-C by 30.4%, TG by 44.0%, and increased HDL-C by 19.0%. At baseline, > 70% of all patients exhibited the small, dense LDL pattern B profile. A greater proportion of patients on FENO+EZE and FENO alone treatments shifted from a more atherogenic LDL size pattern to a larger, more buoyant, and less atherogenic LDL size pattern at study endpoint than those on placebo or EZE. All three active therapies were well tolerated.

Conclusion

Coadministration of EZE with FENO provided a complementary efficacy therapy that improves the atherogenic lipid profile of patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia.

### Single-dose bioequivalence of 105-mg fenofibric acid tablets versus 145-mg fenofibrate tablets under fasting and fed conditions: a report of two phase I, open-label, single-dose, randomized, crossover clinical trials [^114KCm1N]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Fenofibrate is used to treat primary hypercholesterolemia, mixed lipidemia, and hypertriglyceridemia in adults who do not respond to nonpharmacologic measures. Fenofibrate is a prodrug that is rapidly and completely hydrolyzed to fenofibric acid, the active moiety. A new orally administered agent, fenofibric acid, was developed as an alternative to fenofibrate.

Objective

Two separate studies were conducted to evaluate the bioequivalence of fenofibric acid relative to fenofibrate under fasted and fed (standard breakfast) conditions, characterize the pharmacokinetic profile, and assess the safety and tolerability of fenofibric acid.

Methods

In study 1 (fasted), during each study period, volunteers received a single 105-mg dose of fenofibric acid or single 145-mg dose of fenofibrate (depending on their randomization scheme) after an overnight fast (a minimum fast of 10 hours). A 7-day washout period followed the first treatment period, after which the volunteers received the alternate treatment. Study 2 followed a similar dosing scheme and differed only in that volunteers received their single dose after being fed a standard meal (575 calories, of which 36% were contributed by fat). Serial blood samples in both studies were collected up to 72 hours after drug administration. The pharmacokinetic parameters of interest for assessing bioequivalence were AUC(0-t), AUC(0-∞), C(max), and T(max). The criterion for a lack of difference between products was a 90% CI between 0.80 and 1.25 for the fenofibric acid:fenofibrate ratios for AUC(0-t), AUC(0-∞), and C(max.) Tolerability was assessed by adverse events (AEs), laboratory parameters, vital signs, and physical examinations.

Results

Volunteers in study 1 (fasted; n = 54) were aged 18 to 43 years; 19 (35%) were men and 35 (65%) were women; mean weight was 155.2 pounds (range, 103.0–267.0 pounds); and 48 (89%) were white, 1 (2%) was black, and 5 (9%) were white/American Indian/Alaskan native/Asian. Volunteers in study 2 (fed; n = 54) were aged 18 to 43 years; 27 (50%) were men and 27 (50%) were women; mean weight was 161.9 pounds (range, 112.0–225.0 pounds); and 51 (94%) were white (including 2 Hispanic) and 3 (6%) were black. The 90% CIs about the ratio of the fenofibric acid geometric mean to the fenofibrate geometric mean were within the 80% and 125% limits for the pharmacokinetic parameters C(max), AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-∞) of the ln-transformed data in both study 1 (fasted) and study 2. In study 1 (fasted), 14 volunteers (26%) experienced a total of 29 AEs; the most common nonlaboratory AEs were dizziness (6%) and headache (4%). In study 2, 12 volunteers (22%) experienced a total of 19 AEs; the most common nonlaboratory AEs were headache (17%) and dry throat (4%). AEs were generally mild or moderate in intensity.

Conclusions

In these 2 single-dose studies, these healthy volunteers administered a single oral dose of 105-mg fenofibric acid met the US Food and Drug Administration regulatory criteria for assuming bioequivalence to a single oral dose of 145-mg fenofibrate tablets with respect to the rate and extent of fenofibric acid absorption in both fed and fasted states. Fenofibric acid at the dose studied was well tolerated in this population.

### Fenofibric acid (Fibricor) [^113dQqpJ]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

2.1	 General Considerations

FIBRICOR can be given without regard to meals. Patients should be advised to swallow FIBRICOR tablets whole. Do not crush, dissolve or chew tablets.

Patients should be placed on an appropriate lipid-lowering diet before receiving FIBRICOR and should continue this diet during treatment with fenofibric acid.

The initial treatment for dyslipidemia is dietary therapy specific for the type of lipoprotein abnormality. Excess body weight and excess alcoholic intake may be important factors in hypertriglyceridemia and should be addressed prior to any drug therapy. Physical exercise can be an important ancillary measure.

Diseases contributory to hyperlipidemia, such as hypothyroidism or diabetes mellitus should be looked for and adequately treated. Estrogen therapy, thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers, are sometimes associated with massive rises in plasma triglycerides, especially in subjects with familial hypertriglyceridemia. In such cases, discontinuation of the specific etiologic agent may obviate the need for specific drug therapy of hypertriglyceridemia.

Periodic determination of serum lipids should be obtained during initial therapy in order to establish the lowest effective dose of FIBRICOR. Therapy should be withdrawn in patients who do not have an adequate response after two months of treatment with the maximum recommended dose of 105 mg per day.

Consideration should be given to reducing the dosage of FIBRICOR if lipid levels fall significantly below the targeted range.

2.2 	Severe Hypertriglyceridemia

The initial dose is 35 to 105 mg per day. Dosage should be individualized according to patient response, and should be adjusted if necessary following repeat lipid determinations at 4 to 8 week intervals. The maximum dose is 105 mg once daily.

2.3	Primary Hypercholesterolemia or Mixed Dyslipidemia

The dose of FIBRICOR is 105 mg per day.

2.4	Impaired Renal Function

In patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment, treatment with FIBRICOR should be initiated at a dose of 35 mg once daily, and increased only after evaluation of the effects on renal function and lipid levels at this dose. The use of FIBRICOR should be avoided in patients with severe renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.5	Geriatric Patients

Dose selection for the elderly should be made on the basis of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### The effects of fenofibric acid alone and with statins on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its diagnostic components in patients with mixed dyslipidemia [^115HwsZu]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare fenofibric acid (FA) + statin to respective monotherapies on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its diagnostic components in patients with mixed dyslipidemia.

Research Design and Methods

Post hoc analysis of over 2,000 metabolic syndrome patients administered either FA + low- or moderate-dose statin; FA alone; or low-, moderate-, or high-dose statin alone.

Results

FA + low- or moderate-dose statin combination therapy reduced the presence of metabolic syndrome (35.7 or 35.9%, respectively) more than low-, moderate-, or high-dose statin monotherapy (15.5, 16.6, or 13.8%, respectively), mostly due to improvements in triglycerides and HDL cholesterol levels. Mean glucose levels slightly decreased with FA monotherapy, slightly increased with statin monotherapy, and were essentially unchanged with FA + statin. FA with or without statin also reduced non-HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, total cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.

Conclusions

FA + statin in patients with mixed dyslipidemia reduces the prevalence of metabolic syndrome.

### Management of mixed dyslipidemia in patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease: a role for combination fibrate therapy [^115iNd1y]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is the primary focus of the management of dyslipidemia in patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease. However, use of a statin alone may be insufficient for the treatment of mixed dyslipidemia, which is characterized by low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated levels of triglycerides, with or without elevated levels of LDL-C.

Objective

This report reviews the evidence for the efficacy and tolerability of different combination treatments for the management of mixed dyslipidemia, as supported by clinical-trial data and recommended by national guidelines.

Methods

Using the terms lipid-modifying therapy, combination therapy, combination statin-fibrate therapy, and mixed dyslipidemia, a search of PubMed was conducted (completed in April 2007, updated to October 2007) to identify English-language publications and pertinent studies of fibrate combination therapy in patients with mixed dyslipidemia, including those with diabetes or the metabolic syndrome.

Results

National guidelines recommend the addition of either niacin (nicotinic acid) or a fibrate to statin therapy in patients with mixed dyslipidemia to achieve better overall lipid control. Fibrates do not have detrimental effects on uric acid levels or glycemic control in patients with diabetes or the metabolic syndrome. Based on data from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System indicating that gemfibrozil plus a statin was associated with a 15-fold higher risk of rhabdomyolysis than fenofibrate plus a statin, fenofibrate may be the fi-brate of choice for use in combination with a statin. As reported by the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes study, fenofibrate treatment has also been associated with microvascular benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes, which is consistent with preliminary evidence from the Diabetes Atherosclerosis Intervention Study.

Conclusion

The addition of fenofibrate to statin therapy may be a useful strategy for the management of mixed dyslipidemia in patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease.

### Efficacy and safety of fenofibric acid in combination with atorvastatin and ezetimibe in patients with mixed dyslipidemia [^116QbVZ6]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Statin and ezetimibe combination therapy may be insufficient to improve lipid and nonlipid parameters beyond low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with mixed dyslipidemia.

Methods

In this phase 3, multicenter, double-blind study, a total of 543 patients with triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL and < 400 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) < 40 mg/dL (< 50 mg/dL for women), and LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL were randomized to 12 weeks of treatment with fenofibric acid 135 mg (FA) or placebo, each coadministered with atorvastatin 40 mg + ezetimibe 10 mg (Atorva/Eze).

Results

Both treatment regimens lowered LDL-C by > 50%; however, FA + Atorva/Eze resulted in significantly (P < .001) greater improvements in HDL-C (13.0% vs 4.2%), triglycerides (-57.3% vs -39.7%), non-HDL-C (-55.6% vs -51.0%), and apoprotein B (-49.1% vs -44.7%) compared with Atorva/Eze. Overall, adverse events were similar in the 2 treatment groups. No unexpected muscle, hepatic, or renal safety signals were identified with either treatment combination.

Conclusions

In patients with mixed dyslipidemia, the combination of FA + Atorva/Eze significantly improved lipid and nonlipid parameters compared with Atorva/Eze and was generally well tolerated.

### NLA scientific statement on statin intolerance: a new definition and key considerations for ASCVD risk reduction in the statin intolerant patient [^111dBaYJ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Fibrates — Lipid effects vary by phenotype: in isolated hypercholesterolemia LDL-C may be reduced by up to 20%; in mixed dyslipidemia LDL-C is reduced modestly (5–15%) with larger TG reductions (25–35%); in severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 300 mg/dL) TG may be reduced by 45–55% while LDL-C may rise. Gemfibrozil monotherapy trials showed benefits versus placebo, whereas fenofibrate trials in type 2 diabetes found no significant overall benefit for composite major coronary or cardiovascular endpoints; meta-analyses of subgroups suggested potential benefit in elevated TG, particularly with reduced HDL-C.

### Fenofibrate in the treatment of dyslipidemia: a review of the data as they relate to the new suprabioavailable tablet formulation [^115cdQLr]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The fibric acid derivative fenofibrate is indicated as an adjunct to dietary modification in adults with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia (types IIa and IIb hyperlipidemia, Fredrickson classification) to reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and apolipoprotein (apo) B, and to increase levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apo A. It is also indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia (types IV and V hyperlipidemia). Initially approved in the United States in a micronized capsule formulation, fenofibrate is now available in a new "suprabioavailable" tablet formulation that has increased bioavailability, achieving equivalent plasma concentrations at lower doses. The 67- and 200-mg micronized capsules can be considered equivalent to the 54- and 160-mg suprabioavailable tablets, respectively.

Objective

This paper reviews the pharmacologic properties, clinical usefulness, and safety profile of fenofibrate in the management of dyslipidemias.

Methods

Recent studies, abstracts, reviews, and consensus statements published in the English-language literature were identified through searches of MEDLINE (1966-January 2002), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-January 2002), and PharmaProjects (1990-January 2002) using the search terms fenofibrate, fibrates, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and dyslipidemia.

Results

Fenofibrate is well absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma levels attained in 6 to 8 hours. The absolute bioavailability of fenofibrate cannot be determined due to its being virtually insoluble in aqueous media suitable for injection; however, after oral administration of a single dose of radiolabeled fenofibrate, approximately 60% of the dose appeared in urine, primarily as fenofibric acid and its glucuronated conjugate, and approximately 25% was excreted in the feces. The apparent volume of distribution is 0.89 L/kg in healthy volunteers, and protein binding is approximately 99% in healthy and hyperlipidemic patients. Neither fenofibrate nor fenofibric acid appears to undergo significant oxidative metabolism in vivo. Fenofibric acid has a half-life of 20 hours. Fenofibrate is effective in lowering TG levels and increasing HDL-C levels. Its LDL-C-lowering effect is greater than that of gemfibrozil. Adverse effects of fenofibrate appear to be similar to those of other fibrates, including gastrointestinal symptoms, cholelithiasis, hepatitis, myositis, and rash. Fenofibrate therapy has been associated with increases in serum aminotransferase levels, and clinical monitoring of these markers of liver function should be performed regularly.

Conclusions

Fenofibrate is effective in reducing levels of TG, TC, and LDL-C, and increasing levels of HDL-C in patients with dyslipidemias. Its efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia and combined hyperlipidemia have been demonstrated in numerous clinical trials. Its use is accompanied by a low incidence of adverse effects and laboratory abnormalities. Fenofibrate protects against coronary heart disease not only through its effects on lipid parameters but also by producing alterations in LDL structure and, possibly, alterations in the various hemostatic parameters. Its uricosuric property may prove to be a useful adjunctive attribute.

### Alirocumab vs usual lipid-lowering care as add-on to statin therapy in individuals with type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidaemia: the ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA randomized trial [^1148UhDw]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

2.3 Study procedures

After a screening period of up to 3 weeks, investigators selected before randomization the most appropriate choice from a range of 5 therapeutic options based on their usual clinical practice, namely, not to add any LLT, or to add 1 of the following: ezetimibe, fenofibrate, omega‐3 fatty acid formulation or nicotinic acid. Participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive, on top of maximally tolerated statin (or no statin if intolerant), either open‐label alirocumab or UC for 24 weeks. Randomization was stratified by the UC option selected by the investigator prior to randomization.

Alirocumab was initiated at a dose of 75 mg every 2 weeks, with blinded dose increase to 150 mg every 2 weeks at week 12 if week 8 non‐HDL cholesterol was ≥ 2.59 mmol/L (≥ 100 mg/dL), henceforth referred to as "alirocumab 75/150 mg every 2 weeks".

2.4 Endpoints and assessments

The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage change in non‐HDL cholesterol from baseline to week 24, analysed using an intention‐to‐treat approach. Further details on secondary endpoints and laboratory and safety assessments are given in Appendix S1.

2.5 Statistical analysis

The primary efficacy endpoint was analysed using a mixed‐effect model with a repeated measures approach to account for missing data. Further information on analysis methods is presented in Appendix S1.

### Treating mixed hyperlipidemia and the atherogenic lipid phenotype for prevention of cardiovascular events [^114GqdEb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Statins reduce cardiovascular events and cardiovascular and total mortality in persons at risk for and with coronary disease, but there remains a significant residual event rate, particularly in those with the atherogenic lipid phenotype that is characterized by a low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and increase in non-HDL cholesterol. Large outcome trials designed to assess the value of combining statins with other agents to target HDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol will not be completed for a few years, but there is ample evidence for the clinician to consider combination therapy. The choices for therapies to supplement statins include niacin, fibrates, and omega-3 fatty acids. We present the argument that after therapeutic lifestyle changes, the first priority should be the maximally tolerated effective dose of a potent statin. Evidence supports the addition of niacin as the second agent. In some situations, high-dose omega-3 fatty acid therapy could be the first agent added to statins. Although fibrate monotherapy alone or in combination with non-statin low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering agents can be effective in mixed hyperlipidemia when statins are not tolerated, the combination of statin+fibrate should be considered second-line therapy until the efficacy and safety are established.

### The effects of fenofibric acid alone and with statins on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its diagnostic components in patients with mixed dyslipidemia [^1112rafy]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This analysis is the first to report the effects of fibrate and statin combinations versus their respective monotherapies on the individual diagnostic components of metabolic syndrome. According to this subgroup analysis, the greatest reduction in the presence of metabolic syndrome occurred with the FA + statin combination, primarily because of the improvements in the TG and HDL cholesterol diagnostic components. Although waist circumference was not measured at the end of the study, the lack of significant weight change in this study made it unlikely that changes in the waist circumference component altered the presence of metabolic syndrome.

Mean glucose levels rose with statins, but this effect was not statin-specific nor did it appear to be dose-related. The combination of FA with statins resulted in essentially no change in fasting blood glucose, similar to a recent report in type 2 diabetic patients, suggesting the possibility that FA may have mitigated the glucose-raising effect of statins. In summary, in this analysis of patients with mixed dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome, FA combined with statins produced greater improvement in multiple metabolic parameters and in the percent of patients meeting diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome compared with either agent alone.

### Fenofibric acid (trilipix) [^1179t3fX]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

14.1 Co-Administration Therapy with Statins

Efficacy and safety of Trilipix co-administered with statins were assessed in three 12-week, double-blind, controlled Phase 3 studies and one 52-week, long-term, open-label extension study in 2698 patients with mixed dyslipidemia. Patients were required to meet the following fasting lipid entry criteria: TG ≥ 150 mg/dL, and HDL-C < 40 mg/dL (males) and < 50 mg/dL (females), and LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL. The three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled studies had similar designs, differing primarily in the statin used for combination therapy/monotherapy. Each study compared the effects of 135 mg Trilipix co-administered with either a low dose or a moderate dose of statin with Trilipix monotherapy and statin monotherapy at the corresponding dose on CHD lipid risk factors. A smaller group of patients received a high dose of statin monotherapy. In study 1, patients received Trilipix co-administered with 10 mg or 20 mg rosuvastatin. In study 2, patients received Trilipix co-administered with 20 mg or 40 mg simvastatin. In study 3, patients received Trilipix co-administered with 20 mg or 40 mg atorvastatin.

### The effects of fenofibric acid alone and with statins on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its diagnostic components in patients with mixed dyslipidemia [^1165cMMv]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Baseline characteristics

Baseline data for all five metabolic syndrome criteria were available for 2,654 treated patients, and 2,190 (82.5%) patients had metabolic syndrome at baseline. The percent of patients with metabolic syndrome at baseline was generally similar within each of the 6 treatment groups and ranged from 79.9% (low-dose statin) to 85.8% (high-dose statin). Across all treatment groups, 569 (26%) had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (supplemental appendix A, available in the online appendix at), and 461 (21.1%) received treatment with at least 1 antidiabetes drug.

Metabolic syndrome analyses

Of the 2,190 patients in the metabolic syndrome subgroup, 2,003 patients had a final visit value for all metabolic syndrome criteria (with the exception of waist circumference since baseline values were carried forward). Following 12 weeks of therapy in the 3 trials, FA + low- or moderate-dose statin reduced the number of patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome by 35.7 and 35.9%, respectively, compared with monotherapy with low-, moderate-, or high-dose statin (15.5, 16.6, and 13.8%, respectively). FA alone reduced metabolic syndrome diagnosis by 25.7%.

The percent of patients at baseline who met each individual metabolic syndrome criterion was comparable among all treatment groups (Table 1). At the final visit, FA + statin substantially reduced the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome diagnostic criteria regarding HDL cholesterol and TG compared with statin monotherapy. The prevalence of the blood pressure metabolic syndrome criteria decreased slightly at the final visit in each treatment group. At the final visit, the prevalence of the fasting blood glucose criterion was decreased slightly following treatment with FA monotherapy or FA + statin but increased slightly in the statin monotherapy groups.

### Ezetimibe (Zetia) [^113DbuBg]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

ZETIA, added to on-going statin therapy, significantly lowered total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C compared with a statin administered alone (see Table 7). LDL-C reductions induced by ZETIA were generally consistent across all statins.

Combination with Statins: ZETIA Initiated Concurrently with a Statin

In four multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week trials, in 2,382 patients (age range 18 to 87 years, 57% female; 88% White, 5% Black or African American, 2% Asian, 5% other races mostly identified as Hispanic or Latino) with hyperlipidemia, ZETIA or placebo was administered alone or with various doses of atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, or lovastatin.

When all patients receiving ZETIA with a statin were compared to all those receiving the corresponding statin alone, ZETIA significantly lowered total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C compared to the statin administered alone. LDL-C reductions induced by ZETIA were generally consistent across all statins. (See footnote, Tables 8 to 11 .)

Combination with Fenofibrate

In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia, 625 patients (age range 20 to 76 years, 44% female; 79% White, 1% Black or African American, 20% other races; and 11% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity) were treated for up to 12 weeks and 576 for up to an additional 48 weeks. Patients were randomized to receive placebo, ZETIA alone, 160 mg fenofibrate alone, or ZETIA and 160 mg fenofibrate in the 12-week trial. After completing the 12-week trial, eligible patients were assigned to ZETIA coadministered with fenofibrate or fenofibrate monotherapy for an additional 48 weeks.

### Efficacy and tolerability of pitavastatin versus pitavastatin / fenofibrate in high-risk Korean patients with mixed dyslipidemia: a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, parallel, therapeutic confirmatory clinical trial [^114vdX3p]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Dyslipidemia is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins are known to effectively reduce not only low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level but also death and nonfatal myocardial infarction due to coronary heart disease. The risk for CVD from atherogenic dyslipidemia persists when elevated triglyceride (TG) and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels are not controlled with statin therapy. Therefore, statin/fenofibrate combination therapy is more effective in reducing CVD risk. Here, we assessed the efficacy and tolerability of pitavastatin/fenofibrate combination therapy in patients with mixed dyslipidemia and a high risk for CVD.

Methods

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, therapeutic-confirmatory clinical trial evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of fixed-dose combination therapy with pitavastatin/fenofibrate 2/160 mg in Korean patients with a high risk for CVD and a controlled LDL-C level (< 100 mg/dL) and a TG level of 150–500 mg/dL after a run-in period with pitavastatin 2 mg alone. In the 8-week main study, 347 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive pitavastatin 2 mg with or without fenofibrate 160 mg after a run-in period. In the extension study, patients with controlled LDL-C and non-HDL-C (< 130 mg/dL) levels were included after the completion of the main study. All participants in the extension study received the pitavastatin/fenofibrate combination therapy for 16 weeks for the assessment of the tolerability of long-term treatment.

Findings

The difference in the mean percentage change in non-HDL-C from baseline to week 8 between the combination therapy and monotherapy groups was -12.45% (95% CI, -17.18 to -7.72), and the combination therapy was associated with a greater reduction in non-HDL-C. The changes in lipid profile, including apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein from baseline to weeks 4 and 8 were statistically significant with combination therapy compared to monotherapy at all time points. Furthermore, the rates of achievement of non-HDL-C and apolipoprotein B targets at week 8 in the combination therapy and monotherapy groups were 88.30% versus 77.98% (P = 0.0110) and 78.94% versus 68.45% (P = 0.0021), respectively. The combination therapy was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of statin monotherapy.

Implications

In these Korean patients with mixed dyslipidemia and a high risk for CVD, combination therapy with pitavastatin/fenofibrate was associated with a greater reduction in non-HDL-C compared with that with pitavastatin monotherapy, and a significantly improvement in other lipid levels. Moreover, the combination therapy was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of statin monotherapy. Therefore, pitavastatin/fenofibrate combination therapy could be effective and well tolerated in patients with mixed dyslipidemia. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03618797.

### Fenofibric acid (Fibricor) [^111NjNRB]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

FIBRICOR is a peroxisome proliferator receptor alpha (PPARα) activator indicated as an adjunct to diet:

to reduce triglyceride (TG) levels in adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL) (1.1).
to reduce elevated total cholesterol (TC), low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), TG and apolipoprotein (Apo) B and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia (1.2).

Important Limitations of Use: Fenofibrate was not shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (1.3).

1.1	Severe Hypertriglyceridemia

FIBRICOR is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL). Improving glycemic control in diabetic patients showing fasting chylomicronemia will usually obviate the need for pharmacologic intervention.

Markedly elevated levels of serum triglycerides > 2000 mg/dL may increase the risk of developing pancreatitis. The effect of fenofibrate therapy on reducing this risk has not been adequately studied.

1.2	Primary Hypercholesterolemia or Mixed Dyslipidemia

FIBRICOR is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (Total-C), triglycerides (TG), and apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia.

1.3	Important Limitations of Use

Fenofibrate at a dose equivalent to 105 mg of FIBRICOR was not shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Regarding metabolic syndrome-associated lipid parameters, FA + low- or moderate-dose statin significantly decreased TG compared with FA or corresponding-dose statin monotherapy (P < 0.001) and significantly increased HDL cholesterol (P < 0.001) compared with corresponding-dose statin (Table 1). FA + low- or moderate-dose statin also resulted in similar or greater reductions in non-HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, total cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein compared with corresponding-dose statin (supplemental appendix B).

The mean changes in glucose were slightly increased in all statin monotherapy groups but were slightly decreased in the FA monotherapy group and essentially unchanged in the FA + statin groups. Mean increases in glucose with statin monotherapy ranged from 2.26 mg/dl (0.13 mmol/l) in the simvastatin 20 mg group to 7.46 mg/dl (0.41 mmol/l) in the atorvastatin 20 mg group. The mean change in fasting glucose was significantly different comparing FA + low- or moderate-dose statin with low- or moderate-dose statin monotherapy, respectively (P ≤ 0.002). Overall, 54 (2.5%) of 2,190 patients in the metabolic syndrome subgroup initiated new antidiabetes medication during the study; percentages were similar among treatment groups. Mean changes in body weight ranged from −0.3 kg in the FA monotherapy group to +0.3 kg in the FA + moderate-dose statin group. Safety results in this metabolic syndrome subgroup were consistent with those observed in the overall population (supplemental appendix C).

### Pleiotropic action of short-term metformin and fenofibrate treatment, combined with lifestyle intervention, in type 2 diabetic patients with mixed dyslipidemia [^113i8xY1]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

The patients included in the study met the following criteria: 1) recently diagnosed and previously untreated type 2 diabetes (fasting plasma glucose at least 126 mg/dl or plasma glucose concentration 2 h after a glucose load at least 200 mg/dl) and 2) mixed dyslipidemia (plasma total cholesterol > 200 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol > 130 mg/dl, triglycerides > 150 mg/dl). The exclusion criteria are presented in the supplemental data, available in an online appendix at. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee. All included patients (n = 128) were given detailed advice about how to achieve the goals of lifestyle modification, which were a reduction in weight of 7% or more if necessary, total fat intake < 30% of total energy intake, saturated fat intake < 7% of energy consumed, cholesterol intake < 200 mg/day, an increase in fiber intake to 15 g per 1,000 kcal, and moderate to vigorous exercise for at least 30 min/day. The patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to metformin (850 mg; n = 66) or placebo (n = 62), which were administered twice daily for 60 days. After 30 days of treatment, patients of each group were again randomized to receive once daily at bedtime either micronized fenofibrate (267 mg daily) or placebo, and the treatment with metformin + fenofibrate (n = 33), metformin + placebo (n = 33), placebo + fenofibrate (n = 31), or placebo + placebo (n = 31) together with lifestyle intervention were continued for the following 30 days. All treatment groups were compared with two age-, sex-, and weight-matched groups of patients: type 2 diabetic subjects with mixed dyslipidemia (n = 32) and control normoglycemic and normolipidemic subjects (n = 32). Patients belonging to both of these groups were briefly informed about the benefits of a healthy diet but were not prescribed any special dietary and exercise recommendations. Lipid profile, plasma glucose, insulin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, homeostasis assessment (HOMA) index, A1C, and monocyte release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin-1β were determined before and after 30 and 60 days of therapy. Statistical analysis was performed as previously described.

### Fenofibric acid (trilipix) [^112qi1ip]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

A total of 1895 patients who completed 12 weeks of treatment in the double-blind, controlled studies were treated in the 52-week, long-term extension study. Patients received Trilipix co-administered with the moderate-dose of the statin that had been used in the double-blind, controlled study in which they were enrolled. Whether combination therapy was initiated during the double-blind, controlled studies or introduced during the long-term extension study, the treatment effect of combination therapy was observed within four weeks, and was sustained over the duration of treatment in the long-term study. A total of 568 patients completed 52 weeks of treatment with Trilipix co-administered with statins. Mean 52-week values and mean percent change from baseline (at time of enrollment in randomized controlled trials) were 91.7 mg/dL (-38.2%) for LDL-C, 47.3 mg/dL (+24.0%) for HDL-C, 135.5 mg/dL (-47.6%) for TG, 117.9 mg/dL (-45.7%) for non-HDL-C, 26.2 mg/dL (-53.1%) for VLDL-C, 165.2 mg/dL (-35.4%) for Total-C, and 81.4 mg/dL (-43.6%) for Apo B.

14.2 Hypertriglyceridemia

The effects of fenofibrate on serum triglycerides were studied in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 147 hypertriglyceridemic patients. Patients were treated for eight weeks under protocols that differed only in that one entered patients with baseline TG levels of 500 to 1500 mg/dL, and the other TG levels of 350 to 500 mg/dL. In patients with hypertriglyceridemia and normal cholesterolemia with or without hyperchylomicronemia, treatment with fenofibrate at dosages equivalent to 135 mg once daily of Trilipix decreased primarily VLDL-TG and VLDL-C. Treatment of patients with elevated TG often results in an increase of LDL-C (Table 7).

### Design and rationale of the ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA trial: lipid-lowering efficacy and safety of alirocumab in individuals with type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidaemia at high cardiovascular risk [^115GxggK]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is often associated with mixed dyslipidaemia, where non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) levels may more closely align with cardiovascular risk than low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). We describe the design and rationale of the ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA study that assesses the efficacy and safety of alirocumab, a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor, versus lipid-lowering usual care in individuals with T2DM and mixed dyslipidaemia at high cardiovascular risk with non-HDL-C inadequately controlled despite maximally tolerated statin therapy. For the first time, atherogenic cholesterol-lowering with a PCSK9 inhibitor will be assessed with non-HDL-C as the primary endpoint with usual care as the comparator.

Methods

DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA is a Phase 3b/4, randomised, open-label, parallel group, multinational study that planned to enrol 420 individuals. Main inclusion criteria were T2DM and mixed dyslipidaemia (non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dl [≥ 2.59 mmol/l], and triglycerides ≥ 150 and < 500 mg/dl [≥ 1.70 and < 5.65 mmol/l]) with documented atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or ≥ 1 additional cardiovascular risk factor. Participants were randomised (2:1) to alirocumab 75 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or lipid-lowering usual care on top of maximally tolerated statin (or no statin if intolerant). If randomised to usual care, investigators were able to add their pre-specified choice of one of the following to the patient's current statin regimen: ezetimibe, fenofibrate, omega-3 fatty acids or nicotinic acid, in accordance with local standard-of-care. Alirocumab-treated individuals with non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dl at week 8 will undergo a blinded dose increase to 150 mg Q2W at week 12. The primary efficacy endpoint is non-HDL-C change from baseline to week 24 with alirocumab versus usual care; other lipid levels (including LDL-C), glycaemia-related measures, safety and tolerability will also be assessed. Alirocumab will be compared to fenofibrate in a secondary analysis.

Results

Recruitment completed with 413 individuals randomised in 14 countries worldwide. Results of this trial are expected in the second quarter of 2017.

Conclusions

ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA will provide information on the efficacy and safety of alirocumab versus lipid-lowering usual care in individuals with T2DM and mixed dyslipidaemia at high cardiovascular risk using non-HDL-C as the primary efficacy endpoint.

### Comparison of the effects of fibrates versus statins on plasma lipoprotein (a) concentrations: a systematic review and meta-analysis of head-to-head randomized controlled trials [^114Z2a2N]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Characteristics of included studies

A total of 1388 individuals were recruited in the 15 randomized controlled studies, including 588, 587, and 213 subjects in the fibrate monotherapy, statin monotherapy, and statin/fibrate combination therapy arms (participants of the cross-over trials were considered in both fibrate and statin monotherapy arms), respectively (Table 1). Included studies were published between 1994 and 2009. The clinical trials used different types and doses of fibrates and statins and evaluated atorvastatin 10 mg/day (n = 2), atorvastatin 20 mg/day (n = 1), atorvastatin 40 mg/day (n = 1), simvastatin 10 mg/day (n = 1), simvastatin 20 mg/day (n = 5), pravastatin 40 mg/day (n = 1), lovastatin 10 mg/day (n = 1), lovastatin 40–80 mg/day (n = 1), fluvastatin 40 mg/day (n = 1), rosuvastatin 10 mg/day (n = 1), fenofibrate 200 mg/day (n = 5), fenofibrate 145 mg/day (n = 1), fenofibrate 160 mg/day (n = 1), gemfibrozil 1200 mg/day (n = 6), and bezafibrate 400 mg/day (n = 3). The range of intervention periods was from 8 weeks to 24 weeks. Study designs of included studies were cross-over and parallel-group. Selected trials enrolled subjects with diabetes, combined hyperlipidemia, familial defective apoB, heart transplantation, primary dyslipoproteinemia, mixed dyslipidemia combined with hyper-Lp(a), primary hypercholesterolemia combined with hyper-Lp(a), primary hypercholesterolemia, and primary hypertriglyceridemia.

### Fenofibrate (fenoglide) [^11683jjB]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Fenoglide is a peroxisome proliferator receptor alpha (PPARα) activator indicated:

as an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated LDL-C, Total-C, TG, and Apo B, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia when response to diet and non-pharmacological interventions alone has been inadequate. (1.1)
as an adjunct to diet to treat patients with hypertriglyceridemia. Improving glycemic control in diabetic patients showing fasting chylomicronemia will usually obviate the need for pharmacologic intervention. (1.2)

Fenofibrate was not shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in a large, randomized controlled trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. (1.3)

1.1 Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia

Fenoglide is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated LDL-C, Total-C, Triglycerides, and Apo B, and to increase HDL-C in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia. Lipid-altering agents should be used in addition to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol when response to diet and nonpharmacological interventions alone has been inadequate.

1.2 Hypertriglyceridemia

Fenoglide is also indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for treatment of adult patients with hypertriglyceridemia. Improving glycemic control in diabetic patients showing fasting chylomicronemia will usually reduce fasting triglycerides and eliminate chylomicronemia thereby obviating the need for pharmacologic intervention.

1.3 General Guidelines

Fenofibrate was not shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in a large, randomized controlled trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) .]

Markedly elevated levels of serum triglycerides (e.g. > 2,000 mg/dL) may increase the risk of developing pancreatitis. The effect of Fenoglide therapy on reducing this risk has not been adequately studied.

Drug therapy is not indicated for patients who have elevations of chylomicrons and plasma triglycerides, but who have normal levels of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Inspection of plasma refrigerated for 14 hours is helpful in distinguishing these patients from those with elevated VLDL.2

### Efficacy and safety of ABT-335 (fenofibric acid) in combination with rosuvastatin in patients with mixed dyslipidemia: a phase 3 study [^112WjNpa]. Atherosclerosis (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate a new formulation of fenofibric acid (ABT-335) co-administered with 2 doses of rosuvastatin in patients with mixed dyslipidemia.

Methods

In a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study, a total of 1445 patients with LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL, TG ≥ 150 mg/dL, and HDL-C < 40 mg/dL (< 50 mg/dL for women) were randomized to either ABT-335 (135 mg), rosuvastatin (10, 20, or 40 mg), or ABT-335+rosuvastatin 10 or 20 mg, and treated for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy comparisons were mean percent change in HDL-C and TG (ABT-335+rosuvastatin vs. corresponding dose of rosuvastatin), and LDL-C (ABT-335+rosuvastatin vs. ABT-335).

Results

Combination therapy with ABT-335+rosuvastatin 10 mg resulted in significantly (p < 0.001) greater improvements in HDL-C (20.3% vs. 8.5%) and TG (-47.1% vs. -24.4%) compared to rosuvastatin 10 mg; and LDL-C (-37.2% vs. -6.5%) compared to ABT-335. Similarly, significantly (p < 0.001) greater improvements were observed with ABT-335+rosuvastatin 20 mg in HDL-C (19.0% vs. 10.3%) and TG (-42.9% vs. -25.6%) compared to rosuvastatin 20 mg; and LDL-C (-38.8% vs. -6.5%) compared to ABT-335 monotherapy. Greater improvements in multiple secondary endpoints were noted with combination therapy compared to prespecified monotherapies. Both combination therapy doses were generally well tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with ABT-335 and rosuvastatin monotherapies. No rhabdomyolysis or unexpected hepatic, renal, or muscle safety signals were identified.

Conclusion

In patients with mixed dyslipidemia, combination therapy with ABT-335+rosuvastatin resulted in more effective control of multiple lipid parameters than either monotherapy alone, with a safety profile similar to both monotherapies. This combination may be an appropriate therapeutic option to treat mixed dyslipidemia.

### Efficacy and safety of ABT-335 (fenofibric acid) in combination with simvastatin in patients with mixed dyslipidemia: a phase 3, randomized, controlled study [^1125qe9A]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with mixed dyslipidemia often require combination therapy to effectively control lipid abnormalities. This study compared the effects of combination therapy with ABT-335 (a new formulation of fenofibric acid) and simvastatin to ABT-335 and simvastatin monotherapies on lipid and nonlipid parameters in patients with mixed dyslipidemia.

Methods

This was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study. A total of 657 patients with mixed dyslipidemia (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] ≥ 130 mg/dL, triglycerides [TGs] ≥ 150 mg/dL, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C] < 40 mg/dL [men] or < 50 mg/dL [women]) were randomized to 12 weeks of treatment with ABT-335 + simvastatin (20 or 40 mg) combination therapy, ABT-335 monotherapy (135 mg), or simvastatin monotherapy (20, 40, or 80 mg).

Results

Combination therapy resulted in significantly greater increases in HDL-C and decreases in TGs compared to the corresponding simvastatin monotherapy dose (P < .001) and decreases in LDL-C compared to ABT-335 monotherapy (P < .001). HDL-C increased 17.8% versus 7.2% and TGs decreased -37.4% versus -14.2% (ABT-335 + simvastatin 20 vs simvastatin 20); LDL-C decreased -24.0% versus -4.0% (ABT-335 + simvastatin 20 vs ABT-335). HDL-C increased 18.9% versus 8.5% and TGs decreased -42.7% versus -22.4% (ABT-335 + simvastatin 40 vs simvastatin 40); LDL-C decreased -25.3% versus -4.0% (ABT-335 + simvastatin 40 vs ABT-335). Twelve-week treatment with combination therapy was generally well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with ABT-335 and simvastatin monotherapies. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported.

Conclusion

For patients with mixed dyslipidemia, combination therapy provided more effective control of multiple lipid parameters than either monotherapy alone, with a safety profile similar to both monotherapies.

### Efficacy and safety of ABT-335 (fenofibric acid) in combination with atorvastatin in patients with mixed dyslipidemia [^1177k5Ki]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

In patients with mixed dyslipidemia characterized by increased triglycerides (TG), decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, monotherapy with lipid-altering drugs often fails to achieve all lipid targets. This multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled study evaluated ABT-335 (fenofibric acid) in combination with 2 doses of atorvastatin in patients with mixed dyslipidemia. A total of 613 patients with LDL cholesterol ≥ 130 mg/dl, TG ≥ 150 mg/dl, and HDL cholesterol < 40 mg/dl for men and < 50 mg/dl for women were randomly assigned to ABT-335 (135 mg), atorvastatin (20, 40, or 80 mg), or combination therapy (ABT-335 + atorvastatin 20 or 40 mg) and treated for 12 weeks. Combination therapy with ABT-335 + atorvastatin 20 mg resulted in significantly greater improvements in TG (-45.6% vs -16.5%) and HDL cholesterol (14.0% vs 6.3%) compared with atorvastatin 20 mg and LDL cholesterol (-33.7% vs -3.4%) compared with ABT-335. Similarly, significantly greater improvements were observed with ABT-335 + atorvastatin 40 mg in TG (-42.1% vs -23.2%) and HDL cholesterol (12.6% vs 5.3%) compared with atorvastatin 40 mg and LDL cholesterol (-35.4% vs -3.4%) compared with ABT-335 monotherapy. Combination therapy also improved multiple secondary variables. Combination therapy was generally well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with those of ABT-335 and atorvastatin monotherapies. No rhabdomyolysis was reported. In conclusion, ABT-335 + atorvastatin combination therapy resulted in more effective control of multiple lipid parameters than either monotherapy and may be an appropriate therapy for patients with mixed dyslipidemia.

### Efficacy and tolerability of atorvastatin / fenofibrate fixed-dose combination tablet compared with atorvastatin and fenofibrate monotherapies in patients with dyslipidemia: a 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study [^117NoyfW]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Coadministration of statin and fenofibrate monotherapies is frequently used to treat patients with dyslipidemia; however, a fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet is not currently marketed.

Objective

This study evaluates a new FDC tablet of atorvastatin 40 mg and fenofibrate 100 mg.

Methods

This was a 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group Phase IIb study. Adults with dyslipidemia (non-HDL-C > 130 mg/dL and triglycerides [TG] ≥ 150 but ≤ 500 mg/dL) were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive the FDC, atorvastatin 40 mg, or fenofibrate 145 mg for 12 weeks. Study medication was taken once daily in the evening, without regard to meals. Patients attended follow-up visits after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of the double-blind treatment. The primary efficacy end points were the mean percentage changes from baseline to the final visit (week 12) in non-HDL-C, HDL-C, and TG. Secondary variables were LDL-C, VLDL-C particle concentration, total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein (a), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, homocysteine, creatinine, myeloperoxidase, and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2. Tolerability was assessed by adverse events, laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical examinations, and ECGs.

Results

Patients (n = 220) were aged 26 to 87 years; 115 (52.3%) were men and 105 (47.7%) were women; 189 (85.9%) were white, 17 (7.7%) were black, and 15 (6.8%) were Hispanic or Latino; and mean (SD) weight was 200.5 (40.85) lb (range, 103.5–367.4 lb). Previous treatments were statins (25.9% [57/220]), fibrates (1.8% [4/220]), and dietary supplements (25.5% [56/220]); 57.7% (127/220) of patients were treatment naive. Use of the FDC was associated with an improvement in non-HDL-C (-44.8%) that was significantly greater than with fenofibrate monotherapy (-16.1%; P < 0.001) but was not significantly different from that with atorvastatin monotherapy (-40.2%; P = NS). HDL-C increased significantly more in the FDC group (19.7%) than with atorvastatin (6.5%; P < 0.001) but was not significantly different from fenofibrate (18.2%; P = NS). TG lowering in the FDC group (-49.1%) was significantly greater than with both atorvastatin (-28.9%; P < 0.001) and fenofibrate (-27.8%; P = 0.001). LDL-C lowering in the FDC group (-42.3%) was significantly greater than with fenofibrate (-13.9%; P < 0.001) but not significantly different from atorvastatin (-43.1%; P = NS). The FDC had either comparable or significantly greater improvements in other lipid variables and multiple secondary variables. The FDC was generally well tolerated; the tolerability profile was consistent with those of atorvastatin and fenofibrate monotherapies. Treatment-emergent adverse events (ie, those occurring after the first dose of study medication) were recorded in 43 of 73 patients (58.9%) for the FDC, 49 of 74 (66.2%) for atorvastatin, and 48 of 73 (65.8%) for fenofibrate.

Conclusions

In this 12-week study, patients with dyslipidemia treated with the 40/100-mg atorvastatin/ fenofibrate FDC had a significantly greater reduction in TG than those treated with atorvastatin 40 mg or higher-dose fenofibrate 145 mg. Treatment with the FDC was also associated with a significantly greater reduction in non-HDL-C compared with fenofibrate alone and a greater increase in HDL-C compared with atorvastatin alone. All treatments were generally well tolerated.

### Efficacy and tolerability of a "suprabioavailable" formulation of fenofibrate in patients with dyslipidemia: a pooled analysis of two open-label trials [^111JMMZQ]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Newer fibrates such as micronized fenofibrate lower triglyceride (TG) levels, raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, and lower fibrinogen levels, in addition to markedly lowering levels of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). A new microcoated "suprabioavailable" formulation of fenofibrate has demonstrated a superior pharmacokinetic profile compared with micronized fenofibrate 200 mg/d and may effectively reduce cardiovascular risk factors at the lower dose of 160 mg/d.

Objective

The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of the suprabioavailable" formulation of fenofibrate in patients with type IIa, type IIb, or type IV dyslipidemia.

Methods

This was a pooled analysis of data from 2 unpublished multicenter, open-label trials with a common protocol. After a 4-week washout period, patients with dyslipidemias not corrected by diet alone were assigned to receive microcoated fenofibrate 160 mg/d for 12 weeks. Changes in lipid profiles and safety variables (vital signs, body weight, and laboratory measures) were monitored throughout the study, and adverse events occurring between visits 1 and 5 were recorded by the study investigators.

Results

The 2 trials included 375 men and women (mean age, 55.2 years) with type IIa (n = 158), type IIb (n = 195), type IV (n = 21), or other (n = 1) dyslipidemias. At end point. HDL-C levels in patients with type IIa, IIb, or IV dyslipidemia were increased by a respective 10.9% (P < 0.001), 16.1% (P < 0.001), and 12.1% (P < 0.05), whereas TG levels were decreased by a respective 27.7% (P < 0.001), 46.4% (P < 0.001), and 40.2% (P < 0.05). In patients with type IIa or IIb dyslipidemia, TC decreased (-14.3% in each group), LDL-C decreased (-20.6% and -13.2%, respectively), and the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio decreased (-26.7% and -22.0%) (all, P < 0.001). Overall, 121 of 375 (32.3%) patients experienced ≥ adverse event (AE) (202 nonserious, 8 serious). Of these, 10.1% were judged to be possibly drug related. The most common nonserious AEs were those affecting the body as a whole (2.7% of patients) and the digestive system (5.3% of patients). No serious AE was considered drug related.

Conclusions

The new "suprabioavailable" microcoated, micronized formulation of fenofibrate appears to maintain the good efficacy and safety profile of micronized fenofibrate. In the study population with moderate dyslipidemia (types IIa and IIb), it promoted beneficial changes in major lipid risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

Sample size determination

A total sample size of 420 individuals (280 alirocumab; 140 usual care) was calculated to provide sufficient power for both the primary analysis and the secondary comparison with fenofibrate.

For the primary analysis (alirocumab versus usual care), a total sample size of 219 individuals (146 alirocumab; 73 usual care) is required to achieve 90% power to detect a difference in mean percent change in non-HDL-C between baseline and week 24 at the 0.025 two-sided significance level, assuming that the percent change will be 39% (standard deviation [SD] 28%) and 24% (SD 30%) in the alirocumab and the usual care group, respectively.

For the secondary analysis (alirocumab versus fenofibrate), the required total sample size is 42 individuals (28 alirocumab; 14 fenofibrate) to achieve 90% power to detect a difference in mean percent change in non-HDL-C between baseline and week 24 at the 0.025 two-sided significance level, assuming that the percent change will be 7% (SD 25%) in the fenofibrate subgroup. The total required sample size of 420 individuals was based on the assumption that 10% of study participants will receive fenofibrate therapy, derived from investigator clinical experience provided during study design development.

Primary analysis

The primary efficacy analysis population is the ITT population, defined as all randomised individuals with an available baseline non-HDL-C value and at least one available non-HDL-C value within one of the analysis windows up to week 24.

The percent change from baseline to week 24 in non-HDL-C levels will be analysed using a mixed-effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) approach to account for missing data. All available post-baseline data within the analysis window (weeks 8–24) will be used. The MMRM model will include fixed categorical effects of treatment group, time point, randomisation strata, treatment-by-time point interaction, and strata-by-time point interaction as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline non-HDL-C value and baseline value-by-time point interaction. Alirocumab will be compared with usual care using appropriate contrasts, and the 97.5% confidence interval of the difference will be provided.

### Efficacy and safety of pemafibrate administration in patients with dyslipidemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111jEqRu]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Description of studies included and assessment of potential bias

In total, 190 papers were extracted from the literature, from which seven RCTs (involving 1623 patients) satisfied the eligibility criteria of this study and were incorporated into the meta-analysis (Fig. 1). The characteristics of these seven RCTs are summarized in Table 1. The dose of pemafibrate in these studies was 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 mg/day. The comparison group was placebo and fenofibrate (100, 106.6, or 200 mg/day). Mean patient age was 52 years, the mean ratio of female patients was 16.9%, and the mean examination period was 16 weeks.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^114QPd75]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Fibrate drugs — gemfibrozil has been shown to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events as monotherapy in primary prevention high risk males with elevated non-HDL-C and for secondary prevention in males with below average HDL-C; the class can reduce TG and non-HDL-C in mixed dyslipidemia and is considered a first-line choice for severe hypertriglyceridemia (TG ≥ 500 mg/dL). In the ACCORD Lipid trial of fenofibrate added to a statin, no benefit was demonstrated in the full study sample compared to statin monotherapy in type 2 diabetes, but a predefined subgroup with TG in the top tertile (≥ 204 mg/dL) and HDL-C in the bottom tertile (≤ 34 mg/dL) had a significantly lower ASCVD event rate with fenofibrate compared to placebo (−29%). Gemfibrozil should not be used with statins because of a drug–drug interaction that increases the risk for myositis; fenofibrate and fenofibric acid have not been found to have this adverse event when combined with statins. Fenofibrate has been shown to reduce the progression of diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy and has not been associated with incident diabetes. Fibrates should not be used in patients with stage 3B CKD or worse, and based on limited outcomes data, consideration of fenofibrate or fenofibric acid as statin combination therapy is in type 2 diabetes patients with a non-HDL-C at goal who also have retinopathy and/or microalbuminuria and who do not have stage 3B or worse CKD.

### Effect of alirocumab on individuals with type 2 diabetes, high triglycerides, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^115zuDCD]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Alirocumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to circulating proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which was previously investigated in individuals with mixed dyslipidemia in the ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA trial. This trial was a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, parallel group, multinational study (NCT02642159) that compared alirocumab with usual care [ezetimibe, fenofibrate, omega-3, niacin, and no additional lipid-lowering therapy (LLT)] in adults with T2DM and mixed dyslipidemia (non‐HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL and TGs ≥ 150 and < 500 mg/dL) receiving stable maximally tolerated statin dose (n = 413). The trial showed that the primary endpoint of reduction in non-HDL-C with alirocumab was superior to usual care overall (mean difference of − 32.5% vs usual care at Week 24; P < 0.0001) and versus fenofibrate (mean difference of − 33.3% vs fenofibrate at Week 24; P < 0.0001), and that alirocumab was generally well tolerated.

The aim of this post hoc analysis of the DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA study was to focus on a higher risk and more difficult to treat subpopulation compared with the primary trial population, and provide analyses of other lipids beyond the primary endpoint.

Efficacy

In the study on the effect on TG level, the number of pooled subjects was 831 in the pemafibrate group and 653 in the placebo group. The statistical heterogeneity was I² = 78% (P < 0.001), indicating significant heterogeneity. In the pemafibrate group, TG level decreased significantly compared with the placebo group (SMD, − 1.38; 95% CI, − 1.63 to − 1.12; P < 0.001; Fig. 2). Regardless of the dose of pemafibrate, TG in the pemafibrate group decreased significantly compared to the placebo group. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in TG level between the pemafibrate and fenofibrate groups (SMD, − 0.16; 95% CI, − 0.36 to 0.03; P = 0.10; Fig. 3).

### Practical guidance for combination lipid-modifying therapy in high-and very-high-risk patients: a statement from a European Atherosclerosis Society task force [^1167fpF9]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

This European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) Task Force provides practical guidance for combination therapy for elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and/or triglycerides (TG) in high-risk and very-high-risk patients.

Methods

Evidence-based review.

Results

Statin-ezetimibe combination treatment is the first choice for managing elevated LDL-C and should be given upfront in very-high-risk patients with high LDL-C unlikely to reach goal with a statin, and in primary prevention familial hypercholesterolaemia patients. A proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor may be added if LDL-C levels remain high. In high and very-high-risk patients with mild to moderately elevated TG levels (> 2.3 and < 5.6 mmol/L [> 200 and < 500 mg/dL) on a statin, treatment with either a fibrate or high-dose omega-3 fatty acids (icosapent ethyl) may be considered, weighing the benefit versus risks. Combination with fenofibrate may be considered for both macro- and microvascular benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Conclusions

This guidance aims to improve real-world use of guideline-recommended combination lipid modifying treatment.

5.11 Paradoxical Decreases in HDL Cholesterol Levels

There have been postmarketing and clinical trial reports of severe decreases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (as low as 2 mg/dL) occurring in patients with and without diabetes initiated on fibrate therapy, including fenofibrate. The decrease in HDL-C is mirrored by a decrease in apolipoprotein A1. This decrease has been reported to occur within 2 weeks to years after initiation of fibrate therapy. The HDL-C levels remain depressed until fibrate therapy has been withdrawn; the response to withdrawal of fibrate therapy is rapid and sustained. The clinical significance of this decrease in HDL-C is unknown. Check HDL-C levels within the first few months after initiation of fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules. If a severely depressed HDL-C level is detected, discontinue fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules and monitor HDL-C until it has returned to baseline. Fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules should not be re-initiated.

### Pleiotropic action of short-term metformin and fenofibrate treatment, combined with lifestyle intervention, in type 2 diabetic patients with mixed dyslipidemia [^1133HpTE]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This prospective partially double-blind placebo-controlled randomized study has shown that fenofibrate exhibited a stronger effect than metformin and nonpharmacological intervention on systemic inflammation, hemostasis, and monocyte secretory function, disturbed by the presence of type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidemia. This multidirectional action of fenofibrate, which was lipid independent and unrelated to the improvement in insulin sensitivity, may contribute to the beneficial action of PPAR-α activators on the reduction of cardiovascular events observed in some, but not other, clinical trials. A weaker than anticipated action of metformin may be, at least in part, explained by all treated subjects complying with lifestyle modification, because placebo-treated patients following the latter strategy were superior to not complying patients in reducing plasma glucose, HOMA, A1C, and triglycerides. In our study, the treatment-induced changes in glucose and lipid metabolism, and in low-grade inflammation, hemostasis, and monocyte cytokine release, were strongest in patients treated with both of these agents. Considering that the assessed markers are regarded as cardiovascular risk factors, the obtained results suggest bringing by metformin-fibrate combination some additional benefits to patients with diabetic dyslipidemia. Taking into account that statins markedly reduce cardiovascular risk and, if tolerated, should be given to all type 2 diabetic patients, administration of metformin with fenofibrate may be considered an alternative treatment option in subjects in whom statin therapy is either contraindicated or results in adverse effects, including drug interactions.

In the study on the influence on HDL-C level, the number of pooled subjects was 722 in the pemafibrate group and 539 in the placebo group. The statistical heterogeneity was I² = 0% (P = 0.45), meaning that no heterogeneity was observed. In the pemafibrate group, HDL-C level increased significantly compared with the placebo group (SMD, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66–0.89; P < 0.001) (see Additional file 1: Fig. S1). Regardless of the dose of pemafibrate, HDL-C level in the pemafibrate group decreased significantly compared to the placebo group. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in HDL-C level between the pemafibrate and fenofibrate groups.

### Comparison of fluvastatin + fenofibrate combination therapy and fluvastatin monotherapy in the treatment of combined hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease: a 12-month, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial [^115WQ7re]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes risk is often complicated by a mixed hyperlipoproteinemia not sufficiently controlled by a single antihyperlipidemic drug; however, there are some concerns about the safety of combined statin and fibrate treatments.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety profile of fluvastatin + fenofibrate combination therapy and those of fluvastatin monotherapy in the treatment of combined hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and coronary heart disease (CHD) (ie, high risk for cardiovascular disease [CVD]).

Methods

This 12-month, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was conducted at the University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy. Patients aged 18 to 80 years with combined hyperlipidemia, type 2 DM, and CHD were randomly assigned to receive combination therapy with extended-release fluvastatin 80 mg + micronized fenofibrate 200 mg or monotherapy with extended-release fluvastatin 80 mg. All treatments were given in tablet form, once daily with the evening meal, for 12 months. Lipid variables (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], total cholesterol [TC], and triglycerides [TG]) at 6 and 12 months were the primary efficacy variables, and glycemic status (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA(1c)], fasting plasma glucose, and postprandial plasma glucose levels) at 6 and 12 months was the secondary efficacy variable. Tolerability was assessed using physical examination, including vital-sign assessment, body-weight measurement, electrocardiography, adverse events, and laboratory tests. A pharmacoeconomic analysis of both treatment regimens was also carried out using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).

Results

A total of 48 patients (24 men, 24 women; mean [SD] age, 60 [5] years) were enrolled. After 6 months, all primary efficacy variables, except for TG level, showed significant improvements from baseline only in the combination-therapy group (changes: LDL-C, -25%; HDL-C, +12%; and TC, -19%; all, P < 0.05 vs baseline). After 12 months, lipid variables showed significant improvements over baseline in both groups (all, P < 0.05), except for TG in the monotherapy group. Significant changes in LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG were found in the combination-therapy group (-35%, +34%, -32%, respectively) versus the monotherapy group (-25%, +14%, -17%, respectively; all, P < 0.05 between groups). The change from baseline in HbA(1c) level was significant with combination therapy (-12% vs -7%; P < 0.05). Both treatments were well tolerated, with no significant differences in the incidences of adverse events between the 2 groups. The ICER showed that each 1% decrease in LDL-C level achieved with the fenofibrate + fluvastatin combination added a cost of 14.97 Euros/y (US 12.25 US dollars/y), and each 1% increase in HDL-C level added a cost of 7.48 Euros/y (6.12/y US dollars), over the cost of monotherapy.

Conclusions

In this selected sample of patients with combined hyperlipidemia, type 2 DM, and CHD, the combination of extended-release fluvastatin + micronized fenofibrate was associated with a more improved lipid profile than fluvastatin monotherapy, and was a well-tolerated and cost-effective therapeutic choice to treat these patients at high risk for CVD.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^117CS9zG]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Statin–fenofibrate/fenofibric acid combination therapy — Patients either treated with a statin or qualifying for statin therapy with fasting triglycerides (TG) ≥ 500 mg/dL, after secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia are ruled out and lifestyle modifications implemented, may proceed when baseline CK is within normal limits or < 3 x ULN and estimated CrCL > 30 mL/min and the patient is not frail or elderly; in this setting, use of fenofibrate/fenofibric acid and statin in combination is acceptable. If CK is > 3 x ULN but < 10 x ULN at baseline and the patient has no symptoms of muscle-related adverse effects, fenofibrate/fenofibric acid is acceptable to initiate with close monitoring. Avoid use of fenofibrate/fenofibric acid if CrCL < 30 mL/min, and consider alternative TG-lowering agents such as omega-3 fatty acids or niacin.

### Fenofibric acid (trilipix) [^1156ZiZM]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Patients were enrolled for a total of approximately 22 weeks, consisting of a 6-week diet run-in/washout period, a 12-week treatment period, and a 30-day safety follow up period. Patients who completed the 12-week treatment period were eligible to participate in the 52-week long-term extension study. Of the 2698 randomized and treated subjects in the controlled studies, 51.6% were female and 48.4% were male; 92.6% of all subjects were White, 4.7% were Black, and 2.8% were of other races. Hispanics comprised 9.9% of the study population. Mean age was 54.9 years.

The primary efficacy endpoints for all three studies were mean percent changes from baseline to final value in HDL-C, TG, and LDL-C. For each statin dose co-administered with Trilipix, there were three primary comparisons. For HDL-C and TG, Trilipix co-administered with each statin dose was compared with statin monotherapy at the corresponding dose. For LDL-C, Trilipix co-administered with each statin dose was compared with Trilipix monotherapy. In order to declare combination therapy successful for a particular statin dose, all three primary comparisons were required to demonstrate superiority of the combination therapy over the corresponding monotherapy. The primary efficacy results were consistent in the three studies and were confirmed by the pooled analysis of the three studies. The results from the individual studies and the pooled analysis demonstrated that Trilipix co-administered with low-dose statins and moderate-dose statins was superior to the corresponding monotherapy. Statistically significant differences were observed for all three primary efficacy comparisons for both doses of combination therapy in all three double-blind, controlled studies as well as the pooled analysis.

Triglyceride management (off label in pediatrics) — omega-3 fatty acids and fibrates: For omega-3 fatty acids, the recommended dose is 4g/day DHA/EPA. For fibrates, counsel about side effects, potential drug interactions, and contraindications; prefer fenofibrate initially due to fewer side effects, better tolerated, and only once daily dosing. Check baseline AST and ALT and again in 4 weeks to monitor; if AST, ALT > 3x ULN, stop fibrate and consider starting at lower dose once labs normalize or refer to lipid specialist. Notes include that TG lowering medications in adults with diabetes have shown inconsistent results with improved CVD benefit; side effects include muscle toxicity and hepatotoxicity with higher risk of muscle toxicity if on fibrate and statin; drug interactions include coumarin anticoagulants, immunosuppressants, and bile acid resins; and contraindications include severe renal dysfunction, acute liver disease, gall bladder disease, hypersensitivity to fibrate, and nursing mothers.

### Effect of alirocumab on individuals with type 2 diabetes, high triglycerides, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^116g6mT4]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Mixed dyslipidemia [elevated non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and triglycerides (TGs), and decreased HDL-C] is common in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Non-HDL-C and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) are the preferred therapeutic targets for mixed dyslipidemia. Alirocumab is a monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) that effectively reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), non-HDL-C, ApoB, and lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]), and is well-tolerated in individuals with T2DM.

Methods

The previously reported open-label ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA trial data demonstrated the effects of alirocumab on individuals with non-HDL-C ≥ 100mg/dL and TGs ≥ 150and < 500 mg/dL receiving stable maximally tolerated statin (n = 413). This post hoc subgroup analysis of the primary trial investigated the effects of alirocumab [75 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) with possible increase to 150 mg Q2W at Week 12] versus usual care [ezetimibe, fenofibrate, or no additional lipid-lowering therapy (LLT)] on non-HDL-C and other lipids in individuals with T2DM and baseline TGs ≥ 200 mg/dL and HDL-C < 40 mg/dL (men) or < 50 mg/dL (women).

Results

Alirocumab significantly reduced non-HDL-C [LS mean difference (standard error (SE)), -35.0% (3.9)], ApoB [LS mean difference (SE), -34.7% (3.6)], LDL-C [LS mean difference (SE), -47.3% (5.2)], LDL particle number [LS mean difference (SE), -40.8% (4.1)], and Lp(a) [LS mean difference (SE), -29.9% (5.4)] versus usual care from baseline to Week 24 (all P < 0.0001). Results were similar for alirocumab versus usual care. TG reductions were similar between alirocumab and usual care (no significant difference), but greater with fenofibrate versus alirocumab (P = 0.3371). Overall, alirocumab significantly increased HDL-C versus usual care [LS mean difference (SE), 7.9% (3.6); P < 0.05], although differences with alirocumab versus ezetimibe or fenofibrate were non-significant. Most individuals receiving alirocumab achieved ApoB < 80 mg/dL (67.9%) and non-HDL-C < 100 mg/dL (60.9%). Adverse event frequency was similar between alirocumab (67.2%) and usual care (70.7%). Additionally, no clinically relevant effect of alirocumab on change in glycemic parameters or use of antihyperglycemic agents was observed.

Conclusions

Alirocumab is an effective therapeutic option for individuals with T2DM, TGs ≥ 200 mg/dL, and HDL-C < 40 mg/dL (men) or < 50 mg/dL (women). Atherogenic lipid (ApoB and non-HDL) reductions were greater with alirocumab than ezetimibe, fenofibrate, or no LLT. Consistent with previous studies, alirocumab was generally well tolerated.

### Pleiotropic action of short-term metformin and fenofibrate treatment, combined with lifestyle intervention, in type 2 diabetic patients with mixed dyslipidemia [^114S6M2G]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of short-term metformin and fenofibrate treatment, administered alone or in sequence, on glucose and lipid metabolism, cardiovascular risk factors, and monocyte cytokine release in type 2 diabetic patients with mixed dyslipidemia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We studied 128 type 2 diabetic patients with mixed dyslipidemia complying throughout the study with lifestyle intervention who were randomized twice, initially to either metformin or placebo, and then to micronized fenofibrate or placebo. RESULTS Fenofibrate alleviated diabetic dyslipidemia-induced changes in plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 and in monocyte cytokine release, whereas metformin or lifestyle intervention improved mainly glucose and lipid metabolism. The strongest pleiotropic effect was observed when fenofibrate was added to metformin. CONCLUSIONS Fenofibrate, particularly administered together with metformin, is superior to metformin and lifestyle intervention in exhibiting beneficial effects on systemic inflammation, hemostasis, and monocyte secretory function in type 2 diabetic patients with mixed dyslipidemia.

### Effects of adding fenofibrate (200 mg / day) to simvastatin (10 mg / day) in patients with combined hyperlipidemia and metabolic syndrome [^113imQwa]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Combined hyperlipidemia predisposes subjects to coronary heart disease. Two lipid abnormalities — increased cholesterol and atherogenic dyslipidemia — are potential targets of lipid-lowering therapy. Successful management of both may require combined drug therapy. Statins are effective low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol-lowering drugs. For atherogenic dyslipidemia (high triglycerides, small LDL, and low high-density lipoprotein [HDL]), fibrates are potentially beneficial. The present study was designed to examine the safety and efficacy of a combination of low-dose simvastatin and fenofibrate in the treatment of combined hyperlipidemia. It was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a crossover design. Three randomized phases were employed (double placebo, simvastatin 10 mg/day and placebo, and simvastatin 10 mg/day plus fenofibrate 200 mg/day). Each phase lasted 3 months, and in the last week of each phase, measurements were made of plasma lipids, lipoprotein cholesterol, plasma apolipoproteins B, C-II, and C-III and LDL speciation on 3 consecutive days. Simvastatin therapy decreased total cholesterol by 27%, non-HDL cholesterol by 30%, total apolipoprotein B by 31%, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) + intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) cholesterol by 37%, VLDL + IDL apolipoprotein B by 14%, LDL cholesterol by 28%, and LDL apolipoprotein B by 21%. The addition of fenofibrate caused an additional decrease in VLDL + IDL cholesterol and VLDL + IDL apolipoprotein B by 36% and 32%, respectively. Simvastatin alone caused a small increase in the ratio of large-to-small LDL, whereas the addition of fenofibrate to simvastatin therapy caused a marked increase in the ratio of large-to-small LDL species. Simvastatin alone produced a small (6%) and insignificant increase in HDL cholesterol concentrations. When fenofibrate was added to simvastatin therapy, HDL cholesterol increased significantly by 23%. No significant side effects were observed with either simvastatin alone or with combined drug therapy. Therefore, a combination of simvastatin 10 mg/day and fenofibrate 200 mg/day appears to be effective and safe for the treatment of atherogenic dyslipidemia in combined hyperlipidemia.

OBJECTIVE

To compare the effect of short-term metformin and fenofibrate treatment, administered alone or in sequence, on glucose and lipid metabolism, cardiovascular risk factors, and monocyte cytokine release in type 2 diabetic patients with mixed dyslipidemia.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

We studied 128 type 2 diabetic patients with mixed dyslipidemia complying throughout the study with lifestyle intervention who were randomized twice, initially to either metformin or placebo, and then to micronized fenofibrate or placebo.

RESULTS

Fenofibrate alleviated diabetic dyslipidemia–induced changes in plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 and in monocyte cytokine release, whereas metformin or lifestyle intervention improved mainly glucose and lipid metabolism. The strongest pleiotropic effect was observed when fenofibrate was added to metformin.

CONCLUSIONS

Fenofibrate, particularly administered together with metformin, is superior to metformin and lifestyle intervention in exhibiting beneficial effects on systemic inflammation, hemostasis, and monocyte secretory function in type 2 diabetic patients with mixed dyslipidemia.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2009 [^114tPXBG]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Alternative LDL cholesterol goals

Virtually all trials of statins and CVD outcomes have tested specific doses of statins against placebo, other doses of statin, or other statins, rather than aiming for specific LDL cholesterol goals. As can be seen in Table 10, placebo-controlled trials generally achieved LDL cholesterol reductions of 30–40% from baseline. Hence, LDL cholesterol lowering of this magnitude is an acceptable outcome for patients who cannot reach LDL cholesterol goals due to severe baseline elevations in LDL cholesterol and/or intolerance of maximal, or any, statin doses. Additionally, for those with baseline LDL cholesterol minimally above 100 mg/dl, prescribing statin therapy to lower LDL cholesterol about 30–40% from baseline is probably more effective than prescribing just enough to get LDL cholesterol slightly below 100 mg/dl.

Recent clinical trials in high-risk patients, such as those with acute coronary syndromes or previous cardiovascular events, have demonstrated that more aggressive therapy with high doses of statins to achieve an LDL cholesterol of < 70 mg/dl led to a significant reduction in further events. Therefore, a reduction in LDL cholesterol to a goal of < 70 mg/dl is an option in very-high-risk diabetic patients with overt CVD.

In individual patients, LDL cholesterol lowering with statins is highly variable, and this variable response is poorly understood. Reduction of CVD events with statins correlates very closely with LDL cholesterol lowering. When maximally tolerated doses of statins fail to significantly lower LDL cholesterol (< 30% reduction from patients baseline), the primary aim of combination therapy should be to achieve additional LDL cholesterol lowering. Niacin, fenofibrate, ezetimibe, and bile acid sequestrants all offer additional LDL cholesterol lowering. The evidence that combination therapy provides a significant increment in CVD risk reduction over statin therapy alone is still elusive.

The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Trial was a randomized, double 2 × 2 factorial design study, which evaluated the effects of intensive glycemic control, intensive blood pressure control, and combined fibrate statin treatment, on the prevention of cardiovascular disease in people with T2DM. It enrolled 10,251 people (mean age 62 years), who had a history of T2DM for a median duration of 10 years, with mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 8.3%. Participants had either a history of previous cardiovascular disease or had elevated risk factors levels. The lipid sub-study was conducted in 5518 of the trial participants. In addition to fulfilling the overarching ACCORD entry criteria, the LIPID participants needed to meet all of the following additional criteria: (1) 60 mg/dl < LDL-C < 180 mg/dl (1.55 to 4.65 mmol/l) if not on a lipid lowering agent during screening, or, if on a lipid-lowering agent, the LDL-C needed to be between prespecified drug/dose-specific cut points, and (2) HDL-C less than 55 mg/dl (1.42 mmol/l) for women or African-Americans, or HDL-C less than 50 mg/dl (1.29 mmol/l) for all other gender and ethnic groups, and (3) triglycerides < 750 mg/dl (8.47 mmol/l) on no therapy or < 400 mg/dl (4.52 mmol/l) on treatment with lipid lowering drugs. Participants were randomly assigned to either simvastatin plus fenofibrate or simvastatin plus placebo. The starting dose of open-labeled simvastatin were determined by presence of cardiovascular disease and the dose of masked fenofibrate/placebo were determined by calculated glomerular filtration rate at randomization. Further changes to the dose of both drugs were made during the trial in accordance to the trial guidelines. At the end of the trial, all surviving ACCORD participants who could be contacted were invited to enter an observational follow-up study (ACCORDION). No active trial therapy was provided in this period, and medical care was provided by the participant's local primary care provider. Data on health outcomes (e.g. hospital records, death certificates, etc.) and medication usage were collected by phone and clinic visits. Physical examinations were conducted at the first and last clinic visits, include the collection of urine and blood samples for analysis.

### Alirocumab vs usual lipid-lowering care as add-on to statin therapy in individuals with type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidaemia: the ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA randomized trial [^116j5arg]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Participating individuals

Eligible individuals were allocated to UC options by the investigator prior to randomization, and were subsequently randomized within each stratum to either alirocumab or UC option in a 2:1 ratio (Figure 1). A total of 413 individuals were randomized to alirocumab (n = 276) or UC (n = 137). The median daily doses of UC treatments are given in Table S1.

Figure 1
Disposition of individuals for the DM‐DYSLIPIDEMIA study. Abbreviations: ALI, alirocumab; FA, fatty acids; ITT, intention‐to‐treat; LLT, lipid‐lowering therapy; Q2W, every 2 weeks. a Thirty‐nine individuals were intended for "no LLT" prior to randomization; however, 37 actually received "no LLT". One individual intended for "no LLT" received fenofibrate and another received ezetimibe. In total, 4 individuals were not included in the ITT analysis (no non‐HDL cholesterol value available within 1 of the analysis windows up to week 24) and 1 individual was not included in the safety analysis (individual did not wish to continue prior to treatment)

Baseline characteristics and lipid variables were generally similar regardless of treatment allocation (Tables 1 and S2). At baseline, 84.0% of individuals in the alirocumab group and 76.6% in the UC group were receiving statin therapy (of these, 46.3% [alirocumab] and 36.2% [UC] were receiving high‐intensity statin). Treatment groups included 34.4% and 34.3% of individuals with a history of ASCVD and 65.6% and 65.7% without ASCVD but with additional CV risk factors in the alirocumab and UC groups, respectively (Table 1).

Methods

Primary analysis

Detailed methods of the DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA study have been reported previously. Briefly, individuals were randomized 2:1 to receive alirocumab or usual care for 24 weeks. All individuals were receiving maximally tolerated statin. Usual care included addition of ezetimibe, fenofibrate, no additional LLT, omega-3 fatty acid, or nicotinic acid. Randomization was stratified by the investigator's choice of usual care therapy, which was prespecified prior to randomization.

The primary analysis included adults with T2DM and mixed dyslipidemia (non‐HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL; TGs ≥ 150 and < 500 mg/dL) receiving stable maximally tolerated statin dose for at least 4 weeks prior to screening, without other LLT, and who had a documented history of ASCVD or at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) < 9.0%. The maximally tolerated dose of statin was based on investigator judgement. Individuals with documented statin intolerance and therefore not receiving statin therapy could also be enrolled.

Post hoc subgroup analysis

In this post hoc subgroup analysis, the effect of alirocumab versus usual care on non-HDL-C and other lipids was investigated in a subgroup of individuals with baseline levels of non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL, TGs ≥ 200 mg/dL, and HDL-C < 40 mg/dL (men) or < 50 mg/dL (women). The thresholds for TGs and HDL-C in this analysis reflect those used in previous analyses of the effects of fenofibrate on cardiovascular events in the ACCORD (TGs ≥ 204 mg/dL, HDL-C ≤ 34 mg/dL) and FIELD trials [TGs ≥ 150.6 mg/dL, HDL-C ≤ 39.8 mg/dL (men) or ≤ 49.9 mg/dL (women)], and icosapent-ethyl in the amended REDUCE-IT trial protocol [TGs 200–499 mg/dL and HDL-C ≤ 40 mg/dL (men) or ≤ 50 mg/dL (women)].

This analysis provides an overall comparison of alirocumab versus usual care (ezetimibe, fenofibrate, no additional LLT, omega-3 fatty acid, and nicotinic acid), and separate analyses of alirocumab versus ezetimibe, fenofibrate, and no LLT. Due to low participant numbers, nicotinic acid and omega-3 fatty acid strata were not compared separately to alirocumab.

Nonstatin lipid-lowering agents — fibric acid derivatives (fibrates) may be coadministered with statins when warranted for complex dyslipidemias or severe hypertriglyceridemia, particularly in patients with obesity, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, or diabetes mellitus; in the United States, gemfibrozil, fenofibrate, and fenofibric acid are the only fibrates approved for clinical use, and both statins and fibrates have been independently associated with a risk of muscle-related toxicity as monotherapy.

### Effects of baseline level of triglycerides on changes in lipid levels from combined fluvastatin + fibrate (bezafibrate, fenofibrate, or gemfibrozil) [^113w6Gcp]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

This analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of baseline triglyceride levels on lipid and lipoprotein changes after treatment with the combination of fluvastatin and fibrates. The analysis involved pooling data from 10 studies that included 1,018 patients with either mixed hyperlipidemia or primary hypercholesterolemia. Patients received a combination of fluvastatin and a fibrate (bezafibrate, fenofibrate, or gemfibrozil) from 16 to 108 weeks. The combination of fluvastatin and a fibrate improved lipid profiles, with reductions in triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol that were dependent on baseline triglyceride levels. The greatest triglyceride reductions were observed in patients with high baseline triglyceride levels (≥ 400 mg/dl) (41%, p < 0.0001). The greatest LDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol reductions occurred in patients with normal baseline triglyceride levels (< 150 mg/dl) (35% and 33%, respectively; p < 0.0001). The combined fluvastatin-fibrate therapy was well tolerated. Two patients (0.2%) (1 patient on fluvastatin 80 mg + gemfibrozil 1,200 mg and 1 patient on fluvastatin 20 mg + fenofibrate 200 mg) had creatine kinase levels ≥ 10 times the upper limit of normal, 11 patients (1.1%) had an elevation in alanine transaminase > 3 times the upper limit of normal, and 7 patients (0.7%) had elevations in aspartate transaminase > 3 times the upper limit of normal. Combined fluvastatin-fibrate therapy takes advantage of the complementary effects of the 2 agents, with the extent of triglyceride, LDL cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol lowering dependent on baseline triglyceride levels. The combination of fluvastatin and fibrates was well tolerated with no major safety concerns.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1139QtRM]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Summary of evidence and recommendations for statin–fibrate drug–drug interactions — On pharmacokinetic evidence, the combination of gemfibrozil with lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin is potentially harmful and should be avoided; although gemfibrozil interacts with atorvastatin, pitavastatin, and rosuvastatin, the result is only a minor increase in statin concentrations, and the combination may be considered if clinically indicated. Fluvastatin may be used in combination with gemfibrozil without any specific dose limitations and does not interact with gemfibrozil, and combination therapy with fenofibrate/fenofibric acid and any statin is reasonable when clinically indicated. When statin-fibrate combination therapy is indicated, fenofibrate or fenofibric acid is preferred, and under any circumstance, the use of gemfibrozil should be avoided in combination with lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin.

c. Alternative LDL cholesterol goals.

Virtually all trials of statins and CVD outcome have tested specific doses of statins against placebo, other doses of statin, or other statins, rather than aiming for specific LDL cholesterol goals. As can be seen in Table 10, placebo-controlled trials generally achieved LDL cholesterol reductions of 30–40% from baseline. Hence, LDL cholesterol lowering of this magnitude is an acceptable outcome for patients who cannot reach LDL cholesterol goals due to severe baseline elevations in LDL cholesterol and/or intolerance of maximal, or any, statin doses. Additionally, for those with baseline LDL cholesterol minimally > 100 mg/dl, prescribing statin therapy to lower LDL cholesterol to ∼30–40% from baseline is probably more effective than prescribing just enough to get LDL cholesterol slightly < 100 mg/dl.

Recent clinical trials in high-risk patients, such as those with acute coronary syndromes or previous cardiovascular events, have demonstrated that more aggressive therapy with high doses of statins to achieve an LDL cholesterol of < 70 mg/dl led to a significant reduction in further events. Therefore, a reduction in LDL cholesterol to a goal of < 70 mg/dl is an option in very-high-risk diabetic patients with overt CVD.

In individual patients, LDL cholesterol lowering with statins is highly variable, and this variable response is poorly understood. Reduction of CVD events with statins correlates very closely with LDL cholesterol lowering. When maximally tolerated doses of statins fail to significantly lower LDL cholesterol (< 30% reduction from patients baseline), the primary aim of combination therapy should be to achieve additional LDL cholesterol lowering. Niacin, fenofibrate, ezetimibe, and bile acid sequestrants all offer additional LDL cholesterol lowering. The evidence that combination therapy provides a significant increment in CVD risk reduction over statin therapy alone is still elusive.

### Effects of a potent and selective PPAR-alpha agonist in patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia or hypercholesterolemia: two randomized controlled trials [^115KkwLd]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Fibrates are weak agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha). No trials have reported effects of more potent and selective agents.

Objectives

To examine the safety and efficacy of LY518674, a PPAR-alpha agonist.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials: 1 in patients with elevated triglycerides and low HDL-C (atherogenic dyslipidemia), the other in patients with elevated LDL-C (hypercholesterolemia). Between August 2005 and August 2006, the dyslipidemia study randomized 309 patients at US centers; the hypercholesterolemia study, 304 patients.

Interventions

Dyslipidemia study: placebo, fenofibrate (200 mg), or LY518674 (10, 25, 50, or 100 microg) for 12 weeks. Hypercholesterolemia study: placebo or atorvastatin (10 or 40 mg) for 4 weeks, then placebo or LY518674 (10 or 50 microg) for 12 more weeks.

Main Outcome Measures

Dyslipidemia study: percentage change in levels of HDL-C and triglycerides. Hypercholesterolemia study: percentage change in levels of LDL-C.

Results

Dyslipidemia study: LY518674 (25 mug) and fenofibrate increased HDL-C by 5.9 and 5.5 mg/dL (15.8% and 14.4%) (both P ≤ .001 vs placebo, P = 0.79 between treatments). Higher LY518674 doses yielded smaller increases. LY518674 decreased triglycerides by 97.3 to 114.5 mg/dL (34.9% to 41.7%) but was similar to fenofibrate. LY518674 produced a dose-dependent increase in LDL-C, reaching 20.4 mg/dL (19.5%) for the 100-mug dose vs 0.3 mg/dL (2.3%) for fenofibrate (P ≤ .01). Fenofibrate and LY518674 (50 microg and 100 microg) increased serum creatinine (P ≤ .001 vs placebo), with 38% and 37.3% of patients exceeding the normal range. Fenofibrate, but not LY518674, increased creatine phosphokinase (P = 0.004 vs placebo). Hypercholesterolemia study: LY518674 (10 mug or 50 microg) decreased LDL-C by 21.4 to 26.0 mg/dL (13.2%-15.8%) and triglycerides approximately 37% for both doses, and increased HDL-C by 6.3 to 6.7 mg/dL (12.5%-15.0%). When added to atorvastatin, LY518674 changed HDL-C by -0.7 to 6.2 mg/dL (-0.6% to 11.9%) and significantly decreased triglycerides but had no additional effect on LDL-C.

Conclusions

In patients with dyslipidemia, LY518674 and fenofibrate decreased triglycerides and increased HDL-C but also increased serum creatinine. LY518674, but not fenofibrate, increased LDL-C. In those with hypercholesterolemia, LY518674 reduced triglycerides and increased HDL-C, but did not further reduce LDL-C in combination with atorvastatin. Fenofibrate and LY518674 both raised safety concerns.

Fenofibrate plus statin — safety, regulatory status, and recommendation: Safety data found no increase in any adverse event endpoint including a creatine kinase at least five times the upper limit of normal, but significant increases were observed in liver function test transaminases at least three times the upper limit of normal and a renal safety endpoint of creatinine increase of ≥ 50%; an observational study of 1,538 primary prevention patients noted no significant differences in cognitive test results between fenofibrate and a statin versus a statin alone; combination therapy entails a higher pill burden with associated decrements in adherence and additional cost for those with co-pays, and based on this data the FDA removed the approval of combinations of statins with fenofibrate in 2016; given the lack of benefit in both primary and secondary prevention and the potential for harm including a possible increase in cardiovascular events in women, the Work Group decided upon a "Weak against" recommendation.

ACC 2021 persistent fasting hypertriglyceridemia 500–999 mg/dL — management includes emphasizing a low-fat diet and that it is reasonable to consider a very low-fat diet in select patients, with consideration of fibrate or prescription omega-3 fatty acids to reduce risk of pancreatitis; for the right-column pathway, actions also include to increase intensity of statin therapy and optimize statin adherence while continuing the same diet and triglyceride-lowering options. Fenofibrate is specified as the preferred fibrate due to safety and interaction profile, and the narrative notes it is reasonable to further reduce triglycerides by implementation of a very-low-fat diet (10% to 15%), avoidance of refined carbohydrates and alcohol, and prescription omega-3. The text also states that the initial step in guideline-based management of severe hypertriglyceridemia is to provide lifestyle counseling.

### Alirocumab therapy in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: analysis of the ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA and DM-INSULIN studies [^116niDWe]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

This analysis included individuals with established ASCVD receiving maximally tolerated statin who were enrolled in the DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA and DM-INSULIN studies. ASCVD was defined as coronary heart disease (CHD; acute and silent MI, and unstable angina), ischemic stroke, or peripheral artery disease (PAD).

The DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA (NCT02642159) is a Phase IIIb/IV randomized, open-label, parallel group, multicenter, multinational clinical trial. Individuals (n = 413) aged ≥ 18 years with T2DM and mixed dyslipidemia whose non-HDL-C level was not adequately controlled (≥ 100 mg/dL [> 2.59 mmol/L]) despite stable maximally tolerated statin dose for ≥ 4 weeks prior to screening visit, without other lipid-lowering therapies (LLTs), and who had either a documented history of ASCVD and/or at least one additional CV risk factor were included. Mixed dyslipidemia was defined as non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (≥ 2.59 mmol/L) and triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL (≥ 1.70 mmol/L) and < 500 mg/dL (< 5.65 mmol/L). Study participants were also required to have a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of < 9% (74.9 mmol/mol). Eligible individuals were randomized to open-label alirocumab 75 mg (with blinded dose increase to 150 mg at week 12 if week 8 non-HDL-C was ≥ 100 mg/dL [≥ 2.59 mmol/L]) or usual care (UC) every 2 weeks for 24 weeks, with UC options selected before stratified randomization based on the investigator's preference for each participant. The following five UC options were included in the study: continued use of maximally tolerated statin therapy with no additional LLT, fenofibrate, ezetimibe, omega-3 fatty acid, and nicotinic acid, reflecting variability in regional practice and therapeutic options available at the time the study was conducted. Safety was assessed through adverse events, laboratory parameters and vital signs. Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as any event that developed, worsened or became serious during the period from first to last open-label dose of alirocumab plus 70 days (if randomized to alirocumab) or, if randomized to UC, 70 days after the last UC treatment or study day 225 (whichever came first).

### Fenofibrate (lipofen) [^1174zz8p]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

The safety of LIPOFEN has been established in adults with hypertriglyceridemia or primary hyperlipidemia based on adequate and well-controlled trials of other formulations of fenofibrate, referenced below as "fenofibrate" [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Dosages of fenofibrate used in these trials were comparable to LIPOFEN 150 mg per day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Adverse reactions reported by 2% or more of patients treated with fenofibrate (and greater than placebo) during the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are listed in Table 1 below. Adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 5% of patients treated with fenofibrate and in 3% treated with placebo. Increases in liver function tests were the most frequent events, causing discontinuation of fenofibrate treatment in 1.6% of patients in double-blind trials.

Other Adverse Reactions

Urticaria

Urticaria was seen in 1.1% vs. 0% and rash in 1.4% vs. 0.8% of fenofibrate and placebo patients respectively in controlled trials.

Increases in Liver Enzymes

In a pooled analysis of 10 placebo controlled trials, increases to > 3 times the upper limit of normal in ALT occurred in 5.3% of patients taking either an intermediate or the maximum recommended daily dosage of fenofibrate versus 1.1% of patients treated with placebo. In an 8-week trial, the incidence of ALT or AST elevations ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal was 13% in patients receiving an intermediate daily dosage or the maximum recommended daily dosage of fenofibrate and was 0% in those receiving the lowest recommended daily dosage of fenofibrate or placebo [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Fenofibrate 145mg 51655–902… [^112MafYo]. FDA (DailyMed) (2015). Low credibility.

1. 1 Primary Hypercholesterolemia or Mixed Dyslipidemia Fenofibrate tablets for oral use are indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, Triglycerides and apolipoprotein B, and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia.
2. 1 General Considerations Patients should be placed on an appropriate lipid-lowering diet before receiving Fenofibrate tablets for oral use, and should continue this diet during treatment with Fenofibrate tablets for oral use. Fenofibrate tablets for oral use can be given without regard to meals. Lipid levels should be monitored periodically and consideration should be given to reducing the dosage of Fenofibrate tablets for oral use if lipid levels fall significantly below the targeted range.

Therapy should be withdrawn in patients who do not have an adequate response after two months of treatment with the maximum recommended dose of 145 mg once daily.
2. 2 Primary Hypercholesterolemia or Mixed Dyslipidemia The initial dose of Fenofibrate tablets for oral use is 145 mg once daily.
2. 3 Severe Hypertriglyceridemia The initial dose is 48 to 145 mg per day. Dosage should be individualized according to patient response, and should be adjusted if necessary following repeat lipid determinations at 4 to 8 week intervals. The maximum dose is 145 mg once daily.
2. 4 Impaired Renal Function Treatment with Fenofibrate tablets for oral use should be initiated at a dose of 48 mg per day in patients having mild to moderately impaired renal function, and increased only after evaluation of the effects on renal function and lipid levels at this dose. The use of Fenofibrate tablets for oral use should be avoided in patients with severe renal impairment. In an 8-week dose-ranging study, the incidence of ALT or AST elevations to at least three times the upper limit of normal was 13% in patients receiving dosages equivalent to 96 mg to 145 mg Fenofibrate tablets for oral use per day and was 0% in those receiving dosages equivalent to 48 mg or less Fenofibrate tablets for oral use per day, or placebo.

### Fenofibrate for treatment of hypertriglyceridemia… [^114LNEVY]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Clofibrate and gemfibrozil are fibrates that increase lipoprotein lipase activity and triglyceride clearance, thus shifting the subgroup pattern of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to one that is less atherogenic. These effects appear to directly modify expression of several genes involved in lipoprotein metabolism; they also decrease hepatic secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and release of fatty acids from adipose tissue. This reduction of VLDL leads to decreased transfer of cholesterol from high-density lipoprotein to VLDL, thus increasing serum HDL levels. Few studies have been published regarding the micronized form of fenofibrate.

Comparative studies in patients with hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia have demonstrated that micronized fenofibrate, in a dosage of 200 mg daily, decreased LDL cholesterol levels slightly less than did a dosage of 20 mg of simvastatin or pravastatin daily, but it had a significantly greater effect on triglyceride levels. The decrease in triglyceride levels was about 30 to 50 percent, with slightly greater increases in HDL cholesterol levels. In one randomized study, atorvastatin was less effective than non-micronized fenofibrate in lowering triglyceride levels or in raising HDL cholesterol levels. Atorvastatin was, however, more effective in lowering LDL cholesterol levels. Although few study comparisons of gemfibrozil and fenofibrate have been conducted, fenofibrate appears to have more favorable effects on the lowering of LDL cholesterol levels.

Micronized fenofibrate is available in 67-mg capsules. The manufacturer recommends an initial dosage of 67 mg, taken once daily with a meal, increasing at four- to eight-week intervals to a maximum dosage of 201 mg daily. The drug should not be used in patients with hepatic or severe renal impairment. The authors conclude that once-daily doses of micronized fenofibrate lower elevated serum triglyceride concentrations, raise serum HDL cholesterol levels and improve LDL cholesterol levels. Based on currently available data, fenofibrate appears to be more convenient than gemfibrozil and may have more favorable effects on LDL cholesterol levels.

### Fenofibrate capsules, micronized… [^114VYe4W]. FDA (DailyMed) (2022). Medium credibility.

In patients with hypertriglyceridemia and normal cholesterolemia with or without hyperchylomicronemia, treatment with fenofibrate at dosages equivalent to 200 mg fenofibrate per day decreased primarily very low density lipoprotein triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol. Treatment of patients with Type IV hyperlipoproteinemia and elevated triglycerides often results in an increase of low density lipoprotein cholesterol. Fenofibrate capsules are indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for the reduction of LDL-C, Total-C, Triglycerides and Apo B in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia. Lipid-altering agents should be used in addition to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol when response to diet and non-pharmacological interventions alone has been inadequate.

Many patients had concurrent elevations of total bilirubin, serum alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase. DILI has been characterized as hepatocellular, chronic active, and cholestatic hepatitis, and cirrhosis has occurred in association with chronic active hepatitis. In clinical trials, fenofibrate at doses equivalent to 134 mg to 200 mg fenofibrate daily has been associated with increases in serum AST or ALT. The incidence of increases in transaminases may be dose-related. Initial Therapy: Laboratory studies should be done to ascertain that the lipid levels are consistently abnormal before instituting fenofibrate therapy. Every attempt should be made to control serum lipids with appropriate diet, exercise, weight loss in obese patients, and control of any medical problems such as diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism that are contributing to the lipid abnormalities.

Medications known to exacerbate hypertriglyceridemia should be discontinued or changed if possible prior to consideration of triglyceride-lowering drug therapy. Continued Therapy: Periodic determination of serum lipids should be obtained during initial therapy in order to establish the lowest effective dose of fenofibrate capsules. Therapy should be withdrawn in patients who do not have an adequate response after two months of treatment with the maximum recommended dose of 200 mg per day. Pancreatitis:.
