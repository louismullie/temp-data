## Question

What are the common symptoms associated with empty sella syndrome?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common symptoms of empty sella syndrome and how they cluster into neurological, endocrine, and neuro-ophthalmologic domains, with prevalence context and a coherent pathophysiology narrative. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining empty sella and clarifying when a radiologic empty sella becomes clinically meaningful empty sella syndrome. Then, I should verify the prevalence of incidental findings versus symptomatic cases. Next, I will categorize the symptom clusters, starting with neurological symptoms like headache and CSF leaks, followed by endocrine manifestations such as hypopituitarism and hyponatremia, and then neuro-ophthalmologic complaints including visual disturbances and field defects. After that, I will consider gender-specific features and special presentations. Finally, I will integrate pathophysiology and highlight red flags and diagnostic implications to close the loop.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions so I don't overstate the clinical implications. Empty sella is typically an incidental MRI finding where the sella is filled with CSF and the pituitary is flattened, but it becomes empty sella syndrome when patients manifest neurological, endocrine, or neuro-ophthalmologic symptoms attributable to this anatomy, with prevalence of incidental empty sella ranging from about 12% to 35% on imaging and up to 38% in autopsy series, which underscores why many are discovered serendipitously rather than due to pituitary complaints [^111TBWN1] [^112DbCsS].

> I will now examine the neurological symptom cluster, starting with headache, since that is most frequently reported and often drives imaging. Wait, let me verify the prevalence ranges and whether they reflect idiopathic intracranial hypertension rather than the empty sella per se. Multiple series and reviews place headache in 59% to 88% of primary empty sella cohorts, and the association with IIH explains both headache and coexisting papilledema in some patients, reinforcing that the pain mechanism is often pressure-related rather than mass effect from the sella itself [^113XJ8FR] [^114sttmM] [^113wbcqV]. Hold on, I should also consider CSF leaks because empty sella can be mechanistically linked to spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea, particularly in middle-aged, obese women, where the empty sella likely signals elevated or dysregulated CSF pressure dynamics and where leaks can precede or follow surgical repair with risk of rebound intracranial hypertension, so I need to ensure I include that in the neurological cluster and counsel on the risk profile [^112rErSH] [^117XCXft] [^114qEMRg].

> Next, I should review the endocrine manifestations, and I need to be careful not to jump to conclusions about frequency without checking the data. Let me verify the prevalence of hypopituitarism in empty sella cohorts; contemporary series report endocrine abnormalities in roughly 19% to 40% of patients, with patterns ranging from isolated growth hormone deficiency to multi-axial deficits and occasional panhypopituitarism, which aligns with the concept that stalk compression and CSF pulsations can impair multiple axes over time [^111TBWN1] [^111PTZ5D] [^112NhQrb]. I should double-check the sequence of axis involvement; while some sources describe a somatotroph, gonadotroph, thyrotroph, corticotroph sequence in structural hypopituitarism, the pattern in empty sella is variable, so I will avoid overgeneralizing and simply note that GH deficiency and hypogonadism are commonly observed when assessed, whereas central adrenal insufficiency and central hypothyroidism also occur and require targeted testing [^111jv7TU] [^113cNupo]. But wait, what if the presentation is primarily hyponatremia; I need to ensure I flag that severe hyponatremia can be the initial clue to secondary adrenal insufficiency from empty sella, with case-based evidence showing dramatic sodium rises after glucocorticoid replacement and the need to monitor potassium and correction rates to avoid osmotic injury, which is a practical clinical pearl [^111vxdd6] [^1128FYdF].

> I will now examine neuro-ophthalmologic symptoms, and I should confirm whether these reflect chiasmal traction, optic neuropathy, or IIH-related papilledema. Visual disturbances including blurred vision, transient visual obscurations, diplopia, and field defects are reported in a meaningful minority of patients, and although many cases are incidental, a subset demonstrate true visual compromise from chiasmal descent or optic pathway injury, with case literature documenting visual loss and optic atrophy in primary empty sella and tethered optic chiasm scenarios that improve with chiasmapexy in selected cases [^1124p8qZ] [^116CBPkL] [^111A6qDK]. Hold on, I should verify the IIH link; imaging features such as empty sella, flattened posterior globe, enlarged ONS, and venous sinus stenoses support IIH as an underlying driver in some patients, which helps explain both headache and papilledema in that subgroup [^112PjEpm] [^114sttmM].

> Let me consider gender-specific and special presentations so I don't miss important nuances. Women more often present with menstrual irregularities, amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and infertility, whereas men more commonly report hypogonadal symptoms such as diminished libido and erectile dysfunction; these patterns mirror the high prevalence of gonadotroph axis involvement when endocrine testing is actually performed, which is too infrequent in general practice and leads to underdiagnosis [^116JVLLy] [^112NhQrb]. I should confirm that hyperprolactinemia can coexist with empty sella even without a demonstrable adenoma; classic series document amenorrhea and galactorrhea in women with primary empty sella and elevated prolactin, supporting the inclusion of prolactin-related symptoms in the spectrum, albeit less commonly than headache or hypogonadism [^115AENvv]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overlooked posterior pituitary involvement; although rare, arginine vasopressin deficiency has been reported with partial empty sella, so polyuria and polydipsia should remain on the radar when the clinical picture fits, even if anterior pituitary testing is otherwise normal [^114g68n5] [^112HLeKN].

> I need to ensure the pathophysiology I weave ties these clusters together coherently. The dominant model is CSF herniation through a deficient diaphragm sellae with pituitary flattening, stalk distortion, and in many patients, elevated or dysregulated intracranial pressure, which mechanistically links headache, CSF leaks, and some neuro-ophthalmic findings, while also explaining variable hypopituitarism via compromised portal circulation and mechanical stress on the stalk and gland [^111TBWN1] [^113WUaxD] [^114sttmM]. Hold on, I should verify that this model also accounts for the IIH overlap; indeed, empty sella is a recognized neuroimaging correlate of IIH, and pressure-driven optic nerve sheath changes and venous outflow abnormalities can amplify visual symptoms in that subgroup, reinforcing the need to assess for IIH when headache and papilledema coexist [^112PjEpm] [^114sttmM].

> Next, I should review red flags and diagnostic implications so the symptom clusters translate into action. Severe hyponatremia with nonspecific weakness or delirium, persistent or progressive visual symptoms, spontaneous clear nasal discharge suggestive of CSF rhinorrhea, and features of IIH such as papilledema warrant expedited endocrine evaluation and targeted neuro-ophthalmic and neurosurgical input, and I need to emphasize that consensus guidance recommends pituitary hormone testing for all incidentally discovered empty sella even if asymptomatic, given poor correlation between symptoms and deficits at presentation [^116EtSwT] [^112HyemM]. I should double-check that under-evaluation is a recurring theme; large registries show most cases are handled outside endocrinology with minimal hormone testing, leading to missed deficiencies, so a low threshold for complete pituitary axis assessment is prudent when empty sella is identified on imaging [^1134oUpP] [^112NhQrb].

> Putting this together, the common symptoms of empty sella syndrome cluster into three domains: neurological features dominated by headache and CSF leaks, endocrine manifestations spanning hypopituitarism with frequent GH and gonadal axis involvement and occasional central adrenal insufficiency with hyponatremia, and neuro-ophthalmologic complaints including blurred vision, field defects, diplopia, and papilledema in those with IIH physiology; gender-specific patterns include menstrual and galactorrhea symptoms in women and hypogonadal symptoms in men, and rare posterior pituitary involvement can present with diabetes insipidus, all of which should prompt structured endocrine testing and multidisciplinary evaluation when clinically suspected [^113XJ8FR] [^111TBWN1] [^1124p8qZ] [^115AENvv] [^114g68n5] [^116EtSwT].

Empty sella syndrome (ESS) commonly presents with **headaches and visual disturbances** (blurred vision, diplopia, field defects) [^113wbcqV] [^1124p8qZ] due to intracranial pressure effects and optic pathway involvement [^113WUaxD]. Endocrine symptoms include **fatigue, menstrual irregularity, galactorrhea, infertility, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction** from variable hypopituitarism (GH, gonadotroph, corticotroph, thyrotroph, prolactin axes) [^116JVLLy] [^117LhtCB]. Severe hyponatremia with weakness, dizziness, or confusion may signal secondary adrenal insufficiency [^111vxdd6] [^111dPRCw]. Less common features include CSF rhinorrhea, hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, and cognitive or mood changes [^115tsBkM] [^117BGbdd] [^116JVLLy]. Many patients are asymptomatic, and symptoms vary with the degree of pituitary compression and hormone deficiency [^111TBWN1] [^116EtSwT].

## Neurological symptoms

- **Headache**: The most frequent symptom, often nonspecific or tension-type, and sometimes associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) [^113XJ8FR] [^114sttmM].

- **Visual disturbances**: Blurred vision, diplopia, and visual field defects (e.g. bitemporal hemianopsia) from optic chiasm or nerve involvement, with rare optic atrophy [^1124p8qZ] [^116CBPkL].

- **Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea**: Spontaneous CSF leaks can occur, especially with elevated intracranial pressure or sellar floor defects [^115tsBkM] [^117XCXft].

- **Hearing loss and tinnitus**: Sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus are reported, likely from intracranial pressure effects on the vestibulocochlear system [^117BGbdd].

- **Vertigo and dizziness**: Common, often with vestibular dysfunction related to pressure changes [^117BGbdd].

- **Cognitive and mood disturbances**: Memory impairment, difficulty concentrating, depression, and anxiety can occur, particularly with significant hypopituitarism [^111PbWhD] [^116JVLLy].

---

## Endocrine symptoms

- **Fatigue and weakness**: Common with growth hormone deficiency or broader hypopituitarism [^113bakCT].

- **Menstrual irregularities and galactorrhea**: Women may have amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, or galactorrhea from hyperprolactinemia or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism [^115AENvv] [^117N9tHe].

- **Infertility**: Both sexes may have infertility due to gonadotropin deficiency [^116JVLLy].

- **Decreased libido and erectile dysfunction**: Men may have hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with low testosterone [^116JVLLy].

### A comprehensive review of empty sella and empty sella syndrome [^117LhtCB]. Endocrine Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Incidental radiographic findings of an empty sella are prevalent in up to 35% of the general population. While empty sella was initially considered clinically insignificant, a subset of patients exhibits endocrine or neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations which are diagnostic of empty sella syndrome (ESS). Recent studies suggest that more patients are affected by ESS than previously recognized, necessitating a deeper understanding of this condition. This comprehensive review describes a practical approach to evaluating and managing ESS.

Methods

Literature review was conducted on etiologies and risk factors associated with primary and secondary empty sella, the radiologic features that differentiate empty sella from other sellar lesions, and the role of clinical history and hormone testing in identifying patients with ESS, as well as treatment modalities.

Results

Pituitary function testing for somatotroph, lactotroph, gonadotroph, corticotroph, and thyrotroph abnormalities is necessary when suspecting ESS. While an isolated empty sella finding does not require treatment, ESS may require pharmacologic or surgical interventions to address hormone deficits or intracranial hypertension. Targeted hormone replacement as directed by the endocrinologist should align with guidelines and patient-specific needs. Treatment may involve a multidisciplinary collaboration with neurology, neurosurgery, or ophthalmology to address patient symptoms.

Conclusion

This review underscores the evolving understanding of ESS, stressing the significance of accurate diagnosis and tailored management to mitigate potential neurologic and endocrine complications in affected individuals.

### Empty sella syndrome: an update [^111TBWN1]. Pituitary (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Empty sella is characterized by a flattened profile of the pituitary gland that represents in most cases only a radiological incidental finding. When endocrine, ophthalmic, and neurological symptoms occur, this condition is described as empty sella syndrome.

Materials and Methods

We searched MEDLINE (PubMed database) with the data filter 2024–2009 using the keywords listed above. The articles met the following inclusion criteria: 1) written in English; 2) published between 1 January 2009, and 31 December 2023; 3) original studies and case series on the epidemiology, characteristics, and treatment of empty sella and empty sella syndrome. Exclusion criteria included: articles written in languages other than English and single case report.

Results

The incidence of empty sella is about 12%, when it comes to neuroimaging, while in clinical practice it can reach 35%. Endocrine pituitary disorders, defined as at least one hormone deficit, were reported in 19% to 40% of patients. Magnetic nuclear imaging (MRI) is confirmed to be the gold standard for radiological diagnosis of empty sella. If no alterations are detected it is suggested a careful revaluation at 24–36 months, in relation to the low risk of progression to PES syndrome.

Conclusions

Empty sella is, in most cases, a radiological finding without clinical manifestations. In people carrying empty sella hormonal pituitary evaluation should be assessed at the moment of the diagnosis, along with a careful imaging using MRI.

### A young man with secondary adrenal insufficiency due to empty sella syndrome [^115ArHR8]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Empty sella syndrome is characterized as herniation of the subarachnoid space within the pituitary fossa, which could have a variable degree of influence on the pituitary gland as well as adjacent bony structures. As correlated with the localized mass effect, adjacent structures are usually affected by a reduction in size, as demonstrated by the commonly decreased size of the sphenoid sinus in previously published cases. Other typical features of empty sella syndrome include headache, irregular menses, excess weight, and visual disturbances. The incidence of primary empty sella is approximately 11% in the normal population without any adjacent structure abnormalities. The mechanism of empty sella-related hyponatremia could be attributed to endocrine abnormalities. Empty sella syndrome could present with hypopituitarism, including adrenal insufficiency, which is secondary to decreased stimulation by adrenocorticotrophic hormone. The consequence of hypocortisolism is failure to suppress vasopressin, leading to impaired free water excretion. Electrolyte changes during management have rarely been discussed. We here present a case of empty sella syndrome initially presenting with severe hyponatremia and subsequent changes in serum potassium upon supplementation with cortisol, which is a distinguishing feature different from previously published cases in the current literature. There were no significant neurologic symptoms after timely reduction of serum sodium, and the patient was stably controlled in the outpatient department.

### Endocrine disturbances in empty sella syndrome: case reports and review of literature [^116g4An8]. Endocrine Practice (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To report 5 cases of empty sella syndrome (ESS) manifesting with various degrees of pituitary dysfunction.

Methods

We describe the initial manifestations in 5 patients with primary ESS and in previous cases of ESS reported in the English language literature.

Results

Review of our recent medical records identified 5 patients referred for evaluation of pituitary deficiencies in whom ESS was diagnosed. Glucocorticoid replacement was required in 3 patients, 2 of whom presented initially with symptoms of severe glucocorticoid deficiency. In each case, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated an empty sella.

Conclusion

Our cases suggest that endocrine abnormalities are not rare as the initial manifestation of ESS and that, contrary to many studies in the literature, the endocrine abnormalities may be quite severe.

### Clinical presentation, evaluation and case management of primary empty sella syndrome: a retrospective analysis of 10-year single-center patient data [^1161Uwcr]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Empty Sella (ES) is a rare pituitary condition often characterized by the herniated appearance of the pituitary, making it appear flattened with partial or complete filling of the sella turcica space by cerebrospinal fluid. Although the term is referred to as 'empty', the pituitary may still function normally. The severity of the syndrome depends on the absence of one or more pituitary hormones due to the extent of involvement of pituitary stalk. The empty sella has been categorized as primary empty sella or secondary empty sella based on the etiology, which is mostly unclear while many hypotheses have been proposed. The congenital absence of diaphragm sellae is the only established etiology for PES, while other causes may include relative changes in intracranial pressure from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). And secondary empty sella may result from secondary causes like traumatic factors, side effects of radiotherapy and drugs, infections and necrosis, pituitary tumors or even autoimmune-related. Although the term was first coined by Busch in 1951, Schaeffer, in 1924 first observed the sellae in 125 patients and described the radiological variations from dense to a small peripheral rim of the sellar space. In general, the aetiology of empty sell is not clear and many hypotheses have been studied. The cause of empty sella is either primary (idiopathic) and most likely related to congenital defect in diaphragmatic sella or secondary (acquired) due to pituitary surgery, radiation and pituitary apoplexy. The most common clinical presentation of empty sella syndrome is persistent headache and hormonal deficiencies are rare as clinical presentation for that reason in our paper as in others the diagnosis of empty sella is incidental finding during the work up of neurological symptoms. Since hormonal deficiencies are rare and most likely acquired, the growth and the sexual development less likely to be affected.

### Clinical presentation, evaluation and case management of primary empty sella syndrome: a retrospective analysis of 10-year single-center patient data [^112DbCsS]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Once considered a rare disorder, diagnosis of ES has been increasing since it is primarily regarded as an incidental finding on brain imaging scans like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) predominantly, Computed Tomography (CT), or rarely plain X-ray. However, very often the patient may present with various symptoms which are attributed to PES in the absence of any other likely causation. The clinical significance related to the incidental finding is ambiguous and some studies elucidate it to more than a mere incidental finding. Several isolated case reports and case series have been published over the last three decades and statistics collectively from single-centerr or multicenter retrospective studies have reported prevalence as low as 2.3% to as high as 38% in autopsy studies with large predominance in the female gender.

Studies from the Saudi Arabian region are scanty except a report from the western region documenting a brief description of 537 patients with PES without exploring further details on clinical significance, the symptoms and hormonal assessments Moreover, no specific guidelines or recommendations exist in the diagnosis and management of PES, resulting in the majority of the cases being managed without a referral to an endocrinologist. However, experts in the field have advised endocrine assessment of even the asymptomatic cases and a multi-disciplinary approach in the management of PES. The objective of the present study is to report a 10-year retrospective review of primary empty sella from a single-center registry, aiming to determine the epidemiology, clinical presentation and management of PES, and to identify the differences in investigations and diagnosis of PES between endocrinologists and non endocrinologists in a tertiary care setting".

### A young man with secondary adrenal insufficiency due to empty sella syndrome [^111bezNJ]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Empty sella syndrome is characterized by a constellation of symptoms that encompass various systems, and includes endocrine, neurologic, ophthalmologic, and psychiatric presentations. We here report a case of a young man presenting with severe hyponatremia due to empty sella syndrome and focus on changes in electrolytes during corticosteroid supplementation.

Case report

A 36-year-old man presented with general weakness, poor appetite, and dizziness for 4 days. Physical assessment revealed lower limbs nonpitting oedema. Pertinent laboratory data showed severe hyponatremia (sodium 108 mmol/L). Endocrine work-up revealed low cortisol levels at 1.17 µg/dL (reference: 4.82–19.5 µg/dL) and inappropriately normal adrenocorticotropic hormone levels at 12.4 pg/mL (reference: 0.1–46.0 pg/mL), indicating secondary adrenal insufficiency. Brain magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis of empty sella syndrome. He developed delirium and agitation one day after cortisol supplementation with a sodium correction rate of 10 mmol/L/day, while hypokalaemia (potassium 3.4 mmol/L) also developed. The symptoms improved after lowering the serum sodium level. This patient was eventually discharged after 12 days of hospitalization when the serum sodium and potassium levels were 139 mmol/L and 3.5 mmol/L, respectively.

Conclusion

Herein, we address the importance of timely diagnosis of empty sella syndrome in patients with hyponatremia and highlight the close monitoring of the changes in electrolytes during corticosteroid replacement.

### Clinical presentation, evaluation and case management of primary empty sella syndrome: a retrospective analysis of 10-year single-center patient data [^115QR1a7]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The findings of the study denote PES to be more than an incidental finding since high prevalence of co-existing endocrine abnormalities were found. Most of the cases are not properly evaluated by non-endocrinologists due to lack of appropriate loop feedback from the primary gland to the pituitary which is part of normal physiological response to the absence of primary gland function and make it difficult and challenging to non-endocrinologist to recognize the above abnormalities in different axes based on the available normal range values of the hormones. Lack of referral to endocrinologists and gross under-evaluation of hormonal assessment pointed towards poor clinical management and risk of being not replaced for the deficit hormones. This is our main concern with considerable clinical implications.

Clinical implications

Clinical implications of the present study include concerns regarding not referring the suspected cases to the experts in the field of endocrinology for further diagnosis and management. There is a substantial need for formulation of a standard protocol for diagnosis and follow-up by a multi-disciplinary team of experts involving ophthalmologists and neurologists in addition to the endocrinologists advocated for holistic management of PES, hormonal dysfunction and all abnormalities related to it.

### Clinical presentation, evaluation and case management of primary empty sella syndrome: a retrospective analysis of 10-year single-center patient data [^111Bbb3E]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

The findings may point towards poor case referrals to endocrinologists and sub-optimal assessment of hormonal profile. Evidence suggests that PES can mostly be an incidental finding without any symptoms. In our experience, PES was mostly, also, an incidental finding diagnosed during radiological imaging of brain studies and hence not all patients had undergone endocrine evaluation. Gross under-evaluation of hormonal assessment is one of the significant findings of the present research, although almost 42% of the patients were symptomatic and presented with variable clinical features. This, however, precludes the possibility of overlooking PES as an incidental finding and demonstrates the role of endocrinologists being the cornerstone in the assessment and management of hormonal deficiencies.

In addition, the challenges of the diagnoses of central hormonal deficit since the central hormones may either be inappropriately normal, or mildy below the lower normal range may also lead to underdiagnosis of empty sella-related hormonal dysfunctions.

Discussion

The present study analyzed the clinical presentation and management of the PES patients. The clinical picture of patients with PES is quite intricate due to the involvement of the extent of hormones from none to all. Since the causation mechanism is not established, it is not clear if the symptoms are due to PES or coincidental. There is extreme variation in the prevalence of endocrine abnormalities reported with PES ranging from normal pituitary function to certain grades of pituitary dysfunction depending on the pituitary stalk compression by CSF or intracranial hypertension. Except for few comprehensive reviews reporting the clinical diagnosis and management, there are no standard guidelines available for the diagnosis and management of PES, which has resulted in case-handling by non-endocrinologists and under-evaluation of hormones. Primary empty sella syndrome (PES) is considered one of the causes of hypopituitarism. Structural causes of hypopituitarism like pituitary adenoma, pituitary abscess, apoplexy, and traumatic brain injury are associated with sequential pattern of hormonal deficiencies starts with Usually, the development of hypopituitarism occurs in a sequence of loss of function of the somatotrophic axis, subsequently followed by gonadotrophin, thyrotrophic, and finally corticotrophic axis, due to the anatomical location of the somatotropic, gonadotropic, thyrotropic, and corticotropic cells, respectively. Whether this sequence is respected in empty sella or not is uncertain. Usually, low IGF-1 levels are the first sign of hypopituitarism, but normal levels should not exclude the presence of dysfunctions in other axes, particularly in patients with empty sella, for which the patterns of hormonal dysfunctions, if any, remains to be characterized. Hormonal deficiencies in PES can follow similar pattern if underlying causes of PES are related to the mentioned structural pathology before the time of the diagnosis of PES. Hormonal deficiency can be isolated single hormone or multiple hormonal deficiencies affecting all the hypothalamic-pituitary axeses. Symptomatic hyperprolactinemia in PES is rare in general but some patients might present with symptoms related to high prolactin. Hormonal alteration in PES is an area of controversy and it is not clear cut in most of the studies and accurate biochemical diagnosis is advocated. The most important part in hormonal assessment is to do basal hormonal assessment and dynamic testing only if it is indicated.

The results of the assays are entered in the centralized electronic health record system of the hospital that can be accessed by all those physicians and healthworkers who are authenticated to its use. Patients who had deficiencies in hormonal profile were referred to as 'affected. Those who had no evidence of hormonal deficiency despite proven to have PES radiologically were termed as 'not affected'. Only some cases were referred to the endocrinologists for complete hormonal evaluation.

Ethics approval: The study approval was obtained by the Institution's Review Board (IRB), College of Medicine, with a reference number of 19/067/IRB-CM. No disclosure of patient identity was made and the data collected was meant solely for the purpose of research.

Statistical analysis: Data was analyzed using the software - Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 22.0. The hormonal profile was reported as mean and standard deviation. Frequencies and percentages were used to report the prevalence of anomalies and clinical symptoms. The differences were tested by chi-square test of proportions or student t-test whichever appropriate and p -value below 0.05 was considered significant.

### Clinical presentation, evaluation and case management of primary empty sella syndrome: a retrospective analysis of 10-year single-center patient data [^117MUcG9]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Ten-year retrospective data of PES cases was extracted and analysed from the radiology and imaging unit of the tertiary care referral hospital.

Data extraction: The study population comprised of patients who underwent MRI of brain at the radiology unit from 1st July 2007 to 30th June 2017. The keyword 'Primary Empty Sella' was used to extract the data. A total of 26,218 patients had undergone MRI in this period and 765 patients were diagnosed to have PES. The most common indications for MRI of the brain included headache, traumatic brain injury, neurological symptoms like stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack. Diagnosis of PES was made if there was i) enlargement of the sella turcica, ii) filling of the sella turcica with CSF and iii) compression and flattening of the pituitary gland against the sella floor. The medical identification number of the PES patients was retrieved to include further details of clinical presentation, hormone profiles and whether the diagnosis was an incidental finding. Upon an incidental finding, the cases were subjected to confirmation by biochemical investigations.

### Primary empty sella syndrome in a series of 142 patients [^113WUaxD]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Object

The primary empty sella syndrome (ESS) represents a heterogeneous clinical picture characterized by endocrine disturbances and signs of intracranial hypertension. An increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) is proposed to be one of the involved pathogenetic factors.

Methods

The series included 142 patients who were observed during a period of 20 years. All patients underwent an ICP and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics evaluation through the use of a lumbar constant-rate infusion test. Impairment of ICP and CSF dynamics was observed in 109 patients (76.8%). In 35 of the 36 patients affected by severe intracranial hypertension without rhinorrhea, improvement in adverse neurological symptoms was achieved after implanting a CSF shunt. Visual function, already seriously compromised before surgery, remained severely altered in one patient. In the group of 34 patients affected by rhinorrhea, CSF leakage was controlled using different surgical treatments: CSF shunt placement in 16 cases, surgical repair of the sellar floor in three, and both procedures in the remaining 13. Two patients refused any surgical treatment.

Conclusions

The role of increased ICP in the pathogenesis and perpetuation of primary ESS has been confirmed. Adverse neurological signs and a CSF leak are correlated with an actual increase in ICP and are relieved after CSF shunt insertion. Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea is more common than generally thought. Its resolution can be achieved using a careful diagnostic protocol and sometimes may require different surgical procedures.

### The link between empty sella syndrome, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome: the role of increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure [^111jfYoy]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fibromyalgia (FM) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are overlapping pain conditions whose etiopathogenesis is not yet elucidated. Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction is reflected in the hormonal disturbances found in FM and CFS. Several study groups have previously proposed that mild or intermittent forms of intracranial hypertension or cerebrospinal fluid pressure dysregulation may be involved in the etiopathogenesis of FM/CFS. Indeed, idiopathic intracranial hypertension and FM/CFS have several clinical characteristic symptoms in common, such as fatigue, widespread pain and paraesthesia, headaches, cognitive dysfunction, and brain fog.

More severe cases of intracranial hypertension may cause significant compression of the pituitary gland, eventually leading to empty sella (ES) on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). ES involves the herniation of the subarachnoid space within the sella turcica, associated with an elongated pituitary stalk and a flattening of the pituitary gland to less than 2 mm. Partial ES is diagnosed when < 50% of the sella is filled with cerebrospinal fluid, and total ES is diagnosed when > 50% is filled with cerebrospinal fluid.

Primary ES is diagnosed in cases with unknown etiology when all secondary causes of ES are excluded, such as previous surgical, pharmacological or radiotherapy treatment of the pituitary gland.

Primary ES is not just a neuroradiological finding without clinical implications. Indeed, one or more pituitary hormone deficiencies may be present in a significant proportion of patients with total and partial ES. We hypothesize that hormonal disturbances in FM/CFS can be the result of pituitary gland compression owing to intermittently or moderately increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which impedes the blood flow in the pituitary gland and stalk.

The aim of this narrative review was to explore the similarities in clinical characteristics between primary ES and FM/CFS.

### Clinical presentation, evaluation and case management of primary empty sella syndrome: a retrospective analysis of 10-year single-center patient data [^116JVLLy]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

The registry had enrolled 765 patients with PES in the 10-year period since 2007. Higher female preponderance was noted with 607 females and 158 males. The clinical presentation of PES patients is shown in Table 1. The mean age at diagnosis of the study patients was 48.4 ± 14.8 years and the men showed a lower mean age than women. Occurrence of PES was more common in both male and female patients older than 50 years. Younger males aged less than 29 years showed a higher prevalence of PES than females of the same age. Although it did not reach statistical significance, women presented with symptoms more often than men. While 79% of the cases were diagnosed as incidental findings during MRI scans, only 20% were referred to and seen by the endocrinologists. Further analysis showed that almost 42% of the incidental cases were symptomatic. The most common symptoms reported were headache, visual disturbance including diplopia, nystagmus, fatigue, galactorrhea, infertility and menstrual-related problems. Men had significantly higher gonadal disorders like infertility and diminished libido. Other reported non-specific symptoms include tinnitus, nausea, lack of growth, dizziness or vertigo, seizures, weakness/numbness of head and neck or extremities or body sides, acute behavioral changes, ataxia and dysarthria, delusion, memory loss and myalgia.

Table 2 shows the details of evaluation and clinical management of the patients. The general physicians handled 80% of the cases, and of them, more than 90% were not assessed for gonadal, growth and adrenal hormones. Furthermore, the details of those affected by the hormonal deficiencies are also displayed. Although the endocrinologists had only 20% of the total PES cases, hormonal assessment was still markedly under-evaluated. In addition, the affected among those assessed are summarized in decreasing order of prevalence in Fig. 1.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: a pituitary society international consensus guideline statement [^116EtSwT]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma, more specifically with respect to endocrine evaluation, PS 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain pituitary hormone testing in all patients with incidental sellar lesions at initial presentation, regardless of size, as well as in patients with incidentally discovered empty sella. Recognize that the presence or absence of symptoms might not correlate with pituitary dysfunction at initial presentation.

Cluster of abnormalities

Of the total study patients, 19% had some degree of hormonal deficiencies related to hypopituitarism and six patients were diagnosed with panhypopituitarism. It is not uncommon to find other abnormalities in the MRI scans of the pituitary that is not related to PES diagnosis like incidental pituitary adenoma or pituitary aneurysm. However, it is noteworthy to mention that although beyond the scope of the present study, 76 cases of pituitary adenoma were identified on the MRI scans.

Limitations

This study is from single-center and hence may lack generalizability, which may be considered as one of the limitations of the study. However, it may still serve the purpose of documenting literature from the region of Saudi Arabia. By linking similar registries from different regions across Saudi Arabia, a representative national sample may be obtained, enabling a better understanding of the clinical presentation and management of patients with primary empty sella in Saudi Arabia.

### A young man with secondary adrenal insufficiency due to empty sella syndrome [^115VNKSZ]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

We present here a young man with secondary adrenal insufficiency due to empty sella syndrome who developed symptoms of delirium without overcorrection of sodium. Of note, hypokalaemia also developed during cortisol supplementation. Although empty sella syndrome has been well discussed in the literature, changes in electrolytes such as sodium and potassium during corticosteroid supplementation are easily overlooked in clinical practice. Herein, we focus on timely recognition of hyponatremia as an early sign of empty sella syndrome with adrenal insufficiency and the effects of corticosteroids on potassium during management.

Empty sella syndrome is a neuroendocrine disorder and can be divided into primary (also called arachonidocele) and secondary empty sella syndrome. Primary empty sella syndrome may be related to congenital structural abnormalities. Secondary causes could be surgery, radiotherapy, drugs, trauma, or autoimmune disorders. Most patients are asymptomatic, but some patients develop panhypopituitarism. Panhypopituitarism is the most common hormone disorder, while other aspects of pituitary deficiency include secondary adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, and growth hormone deficiency. Secondary adrenal insufficiency is caused by reduced secretion of adrenocorticotrophic hormone, resulting in hypocortisolism. Hyponatraemia is the result of excessive vasopressin secretion due to hypocortisolism that fails to suppress vasopressin. Instead of the usual hyponatremia management of fluid restriction, treatment of empty sella syndrome-associated hyponatremia is encompassed by glucocorticoid supplement and sodium replacement. If patients with empty sella syndrome have concomitant central hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency, clinicians should keep in mind that the restoration of euthyroidism with levothyroxine therapy might precipitate an adrenal crisis in patients with unrecognized central hypoadrenalism, as normalization of thyroid function increases cortisol metabolism in these patients, thereby leading to a greater glucocorticoid requirement. It has also been reported that patients with hyponatremia related to adrenocorticotrophic hormone deficiency may have relative hypoaldosteronism and metabolic acidosis, but our patient did not present with metabolic acidosis initially and had relatively normal aldosterone levels. This could be explained by the relative hypovolemic status due to his poor intake and vomiting.

### Does pituitary compression / empty sella syndrome contribute to MRI-negative Cushing's disease? A single-institution experience [^116KwSmq]. Neurosurgical Focus (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Cushing's disease arises from functioning adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenomas. These tumors can be very small and evade detection by MRI. Empty sella syndrome is a phenomenon by which an arachnoid outpouching of CSF into the sella leads to compression of the pituitary, likely due to intracranial hypertension (a common issue in Cushing's disease), further leading to difficulty in visualizing the pituitary gland that may contribute to difficulty in finding a tumor on MRI, so-called MRI-negative Cushing's disease. The authors sought to examine the association between empty sella syndrome and MRI-negative Cushing's disease.

Methods

A single-institution database of Cushing's disease cases from 2000 to 2017 was reviewed, and 197 cases were included in the analysis. One hundred eighty patients had a tissue diagnosis of Cushing's disease and 17 had remission with surgery, but no definitive tissue diagnosis was obtained. Macroadenomas (tumors > 1 cm) were excluded. The degree of empty sella syndrome was graded on the degree of CSF visualized in the sella on midline sagittal T1-weighted MRI.

Results

Of the 197 cases identified, 40 (20%) presented with MRI-negative disease, and empty sella syndrome was present in 49 cases (25%). MRI-negative disease was found in 18 (37%) of 49 empty sella cases versus 22 (15%) of 148 cases without empty sella syndrome present. Empty sella syndrome was significantly associated with MRI-negative disease (OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.61–6.74, p = 0.0018). Decreased thickness of the pituitary gland was also associated with MRI-negative disease (mean thickness 5.6 vs 6.8 mm, p = 0.0002).

Conclusions

Empty sella syndrome is associated with an increased rate of MRI-negative Cushing's disease. Pituitary compression causing a relative reduction in the volume of the pituitary for imaging is a plausible cause for not detecting the tumor mass with MRI.

### Clinical presentation, evaluation and case management of primary empty sella syndrome: a retrospective analysis of 10-year single-center patient data [^1134oUpP]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary Empty Sella (PES) syndrome is an increasingly common disorder, mostly diagnosed as an incidental finding during brain imaging scans. We intended to review the clinical management and hormonal profile of patients with PES.

Methods

The study included ten-year retrospective analysis of registry containing PES cases in the period 2007 to 2017, from a single tertiary care center. The keyword 'primary empty sella' was used to retrieve patient details from the radiology unit. The clinical and biochemical profile of PES patients was analyzed. Case management of PES patients and their rate of referral to endocrinologists was explored.

Results

The registry had 765 cases with a male: female ratio of 1:3.8 suggesting female predominance by almost four times. Although not significant, the onset of disease was earlier for males [Mean ± standard deviation (SD) (46.7 years ± 17.3 vs 48.8 years ± 14.1), p = 0.110]. Almost 79% of the cases were found as an incidental finding during Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Of the total PES cases, only 20% were referred to the endocrinologists and the rest were handled by general physicians. Only 1–2.5% of the cases were evaluated for gonadal, growth and adrenal hormones by the general physicians. The hormonal evaluation by the endocrinologists was also found to be sub-optimal. Headache and visual disturbances were the most common presenting complaints followed by menstrual abnormalities. Endocrine abnormalities like thyroid dysfunction, hyperprolactinemia, hypogonadism and hypocortisolism were highly prevalent among those assessed.

Conclusion

There is a gross under-evaluation of hormonal assessment and minimal case-referral to Endocrinologists. PES is associated with varying degrees of hormonal dysfunction, and hence early assessment and management is needed. Establishing a standard protocol for diagnosis and case management is essential with the involvement of a multidisciplinary team consisting of endocrinologists, neurologists, primary care phys icians and ophthalmologists.

### The link between empty sella syndrome, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome: the role of increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure [^112vDQiw]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this narrative review, we found several disease characteristics that are similar in primary ES and FM/CFS. Hormone secretion responses to pituitary challenge tests were similar in all three conditions. Primary ES is mainly caused by increased intracranial pressure. According to our hypothesis, similar to primary ES, the hormonal disturbances in FM/CFS may be attributed to compressive effects of the cerebrospinal fluid on the pituitary gland, impeding the blood flow in the pituitary gland and the pituitary stalk.

Furthermore, similar neurological and ophthalmological signs, obesity, headaches, and fatigue are prevalent in primary ES and FM/CFS.

Therefore, these findings provide further support for the hypothesis that moderately or intermittently increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure is involved in the pathogenesis of FM/CFS.

### Clinical presentation, evaluation and case management of primary empty sella syndrome: a retrospective analysis of 10-year single-center patient data [^113wbcqV]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation

In the current study, PES was almost four times more common among women establishing female preponderance, which is widely supported by other studies. Although headache was the most common presenting symptom in our study, yet only 30% reported it in comparison to almost 70–90% of PES patients in other studies. However, headache has not been though directly associated with PES, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) has long been the attributed cause, in addition to other co-existing symptoms like visual disturbances and orbital findings. Saindaine and his colleagues evaluated incidental PES on MRI with IIH and documented headache as non-specific to PES but related IIH to be a significant determinant of headaches. Visual disturbance was the second most common complaint presented in our study. Transient visual disturance, nystagmus, diplopia and blurred vision were some of the commonly reported visual impairment. Around 2.6% were diagnosed to have optic nerve abnormalities like compression, atrophy or neuritis. Most of the visual defects are a result of the involvement of optic nerve, which means that PES is more than just an incidental finding. As identified by Saindaine and his team, visual defects cannot be characteristic of incidental PES, without eliminating the role of IIH. Although other studies have reported a lower prevalence of visual defects, the present finding suggests the importance of an ophthalmic assessment of PES patients with visual field defects.

Menstrual irregularities, galactorrhea and sexual disturbances were highly under-reported. But on the other hand, in contrast to our study, an Italy research reported a higher prevalence of menstrual and sexual dysfunction. Non-assessment of menstrual irregularities is probably the main reason for the low prevalence in the present study. Other causes include the possibility of social stigma, fear, and discomfort feeling in reporting the symptoms. The highly conservative nature of Saudi society may also play an important role in under-reporting these symptoms. Concerning other comorbidities, diabetes and hypertension were the two most frequently reported conditions affecting 11% of the study patients.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: a pituitary society international consensus guideline statement [^112HyemM]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

This Pituitary Society Consensus article presents an evidence-based consensus on the management of pituitary incidentaloma, defined as an unexpected sellar or parasellar finding incidentally discovered on an imaging study that was not performed for a clinically suspected pituitary lesion. Recommendations are offered for when endocrinology, neurosurgery and ophthalmology consultation, dedicated pituitary imaging, pituitary hormone testing and visual assessment are warranted for macroadenomas, microadenomas, cystic lesions and empty sella, as well as when surgical resection is indicated for incidental pituitary adenomas and cystic sellar lesions. Special considerations in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, children and adolescents, older people, and pregnant women are addressed. The Consensus workshop concluded that diagnostic and management approaches should be individualized to the specific clinical context of an incidentally discovered pituitary lesion. Consultation with a multidisciplinary pituitary tumour centre of excellence should be considered in the presence of new or deteriorating lesion-specific signs or symptoms, particularly when surgical or other adjuvant interventions are being considered and when there is uncertainty about the most appropriate subsequent management.

Materials and Methods

PubMed and Web of Science (WOS) databases and the reference lists of the included studies were searched for English language articles published from 1985 until 2022 using the terms empty sella, FM and CFS in combination with the terms pituitary gland, increased cerebral pressure, growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), thyroid hormones, and gonadal hormones. Data regarding symptoms and hormonal levels in patients with primary ES, FM and CFS were compared and evaluated in reference to the hypothesis of a shared mechanism of underlying increased or dysregulated cerebrospinal fluid pressure.

### Sheehan syndrome: a current approach to a dormant disease [^111PbWhD]. Pituitary (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The diagnosis and the treatment of SS is usually delayed for a long time which leads to significant morbidity and decreased quality of life of the patients. Timely diagnosis of SS is very important since the presentation is usually with non-specific manifestations. Despite a decline in its relative incidence compared to other causes of hypopituitarism, Sheehan's syndrome continues to be present. While hypotension, hypovolemia, disturbed blood supply, small sella turcica size, vasospasm, thrombosis, and coagulation disorders play a role in the pathophysiology, autoimmunity worsens pituitary insufficiency in later years. The typical presentation is usually with panhypopituitarism, postpartum history of amenorrhea and agalactia and empty sella appearence on pituitary MRI. Hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, cognitive and psychiatric disorders can be seen at presentation. Despite appropriate replacement therapies cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, bone loss, decreased quality of life and cognitive dysfunction might be seen. This may be attributed to the delayed diagnosis of SS, current available replacement therapies being far from mimicking normal physiology, lack of GH treatment in most of the patients and the neglected effects of hypoprolactinemia and deficient adrenal androgens.

### A young man with secondary adrenal insufficiency due to empty sella syndrome [^111vxdd6]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 36-year-old man presented to the emergency department with general weakness, poor appetite, and dizziness for 4 days. He was noted to have hyponatremia (sodium 116 mmol/L) six years prior. Otherwise, there was no other medical, trauma, surgical, or recent medication history. He had normal growth and sexual development. In the emergency department, he was afebrile with a normal respiratory rate, pulse, and blood pressure. No headache, weight gain, or constipation was reported. Physical assessment revealed nonpitting oedema of the bilateral lower limbs. Pertinent laboratory investigations showed severe hyponatremia (sodium 108 mmol/L) with calculated serum osmolality 223 mOsm/kg H 2 O (reference: 275–295 mOsm/kg H 2 O), urine osmolality 804 mOsm/kg H 2 O (reference: 50–1200 mOsm/kg H 2 O), and urine sodium 130 mmol/L. Blood gas showed pH 7.357 and bicarbonate 24.2 mmol/L (reference: 22–27 mmol/L) with a relatively normal serum aldosterone level of 97.3 pg/ml (reference 12–150 pg/ml). During the initial management, the serum sodium level had a poor response to intravenous normal saline, and intravenous fluids were changed to hypertonic 3% saline two days after admission. Hormone assays revealed a low cortisol level at 1.17 µg/dL (reference range, 4.82–19.5 µg/dL), inappropriately normal adrenocorticotropic hormone at 12.4 pg/mL (reference: 0.1–46.0 pg/mL), low free T4 at 0.79 ng/dL (reference: 0.89–1.7 ng/dL), and inappropriately normal thyroid-stimulating hormone at 2.62 µIU/mL (reference: 0.25–5.00 µIU/mL). Testosterone was low at 0.72 ng/dL (reference: 249–836 ng/dL), along with low insulin-like growth factor-1 less than 15 ng/mL (reference: 57–241 ng/mL). Luteinizing hormone was 2.78 mIU/mL (reference: 1.7–8.6 mIU/mL), and prolactin was 5.6 ng/mL (reference: 4.04–15.2 ng/mL). The tentative diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency was made according to the clinical and laboratory findings. Brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a thin and flat pituitary gland located in the sella floor with prominent cerebral spinal fluid space (Fig. 1), compatible with empty sella syndrome. Intravenous hydrocortisone 100 mg was given once on the 5 th day of admission, followed by cortisone 25 mg twice daily starting on the 6 th day of admission. The serum sodium level rose from 126 to 136 mmol/L one day after cortisone administration (Fig. 2). Hypokalaemia (potassium 3.4 mmol/L) developed on the same day. Due to the concurrent presentation of delirium and agitation, the serum sodium levels were relowered. Symptoms gradually resolved after decreasing the serum sodium level to 133 mmol/L after administration of 5% dextrose solution. Potassium tablets were also prescribed at a dose of 5.08 mEq/day. The patient gradually recovered and returned to baseline health. He was discharged after 12 days of hospitalization. The patient was maintained on 25 mg cortisone daily without any sequelae when followed at the outpatient department.

### The link between empty sella syndrome, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome: the role of increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure [^117JmXb2]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Plain Language Summary

The cause of fibromyalgia (FM) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is not yet elucidated. Disturbances in the interactions between the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and adrenal glands (the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis) in FM and CFS may result in abnormal hormone production. However, a novel hypothesis proposes that moderate increases in cerebral and spinal fluid pressure may underlie both FM and CFS. Increased cerebral pressure may impede blood flow in the pituitary gland, resulting in hormonal disturbances. Indeed, it is well known that severely increased cerebral pressure can cause compression and flattening of the pituitary gland, potentially leading to pituitary hormone deficiency, termed empty sella syndrome. The sella (turcica) is a saddle-shaped notch in the bone at the base of the skull where the pituitary gland is located.

A search of the scientific literature revealed that increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, obesity, female sex, headache and migraine, fatigue, visual disturbances, vertigo, hearing loss, and widespread pain were all more prevalent in empty sella, FM and CFS patients than in healthy individuals. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the injection of substances to stimulate pituitary hormone production resulted in similar responses, including reduced cortisol, growth hormone, luteinizing hormone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone production and increased prolactin production, in all three conditions compared to healthy individuals. The findings of this review provide further support for the hypothesis that moderate or intermittent increases in cerebrospinal fluid pressure are involved in the pathogenesis of FM and CFS and should stimulate further research into the causes of these conditions.

### Intracranial hypertension and empty sella from adrenal adenoma and excessive and prolonged steroid usage: a case report [^111apTKg]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

The patient had been through two stages. Before adrenal adenoma excision, she progressively exhibited a cluster of hallmark symptoms of Cushing's syndrome from hypertension to truncal obesity and fragile fracture. Laboratory examinations showed that her cortisol circadian rhythm was not present, blood ACTH was undetectable, urinary free cortisol was significantly higher than the normal range, and low doses of dexamethasone didn't decrease cortisol secretion. Adrenal CT revealed a left adrenal mass. All of these prove that the patient had cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma. In addition, the patient was also found to have IH and worsening empty sella.

There is only one documented case of IH and empty sella from cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma so far. However, this doesn't mean that IH and empty sella is a rare manifestation of this disorder. As this case shows, the patient's empty sella had existed when her adrenal adenoma was first found, which suggests that despite the lack of symptoms of IH, her intracranial pressure might have risen above the normal level, because prolonged increased intracranial pressure is one of the many reasons of empty sella. When she was diagnosed with unexplained IH, her empty sella was exacerbated. Meanwhile, she presented with a characteristic cluster of symptoms such as truncal obesity and fragile fracture, and many non-specific symptoms such as general fatigue, facial edema and blurred vision. If her blurred vision was ignored and wasn't traced to raised intracranial pressure, her IH wouldn't be found. The disease's progression implies that cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma can lead to IH and empty sella, and elevated intracranial pressure might be a universal presentation of this disorder but just be neglected due to the lack of noticeable symptoms in early stage or be covered up by other symptoms in later stage. However, this conjecture needs to be further confirmed by more patients with cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma.

### Chiasmapexy for secondary empty sella syndrome: diagnostic and therapeutic considerations [^113ZD6Xu]. Pituitary (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Secondary empty sella syndrome (SESS) following pituitary surgery remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The aim of this study was to specify the diagnostic criteria, surgical indications and results of chiasmapexy in the SESS.

Methods

Three cases from two experienced neurosurgical centers were collected and the available literature was reviewed.

Results

The 3 patients were operated for a giant non-functioning pituitary adenoma, a cystic macroprolactinoma, and an arachnoid cyst respectively. Postoperative visual outcome was initially improved, and then worsened progressively. At the time of SESS diagnosis, visual field defect was severe in all cases with optic nerve (ON) atrophy in 2 cases. Patients were operated via an endoscopic endonasal extradural approach. One patient was re-operated because of early fat reabsorption. Visual outcome improved in 1 case and stabilized in 2 cases. Statistical analyses performed on 24 cases from the literature review highlighted that patient age and severity of the preoperative visual defect were respectively significant and nearly significant prognostic factors for visual outcome, unlike the surgical technique.

Conclusion

T2-weighted or CISS/FIESTA sequence MRI is mandatory to visualize adhesions, ON kinking and neurovascular conflict. TS approach is the most commonly used approach. The literature review could not conclude on the need for an intra or extradural approach suggesting case by case adapted strategy. Intrasellar packing with non-absorbable material such as bone should be considered. Severity of the visual loss clearly decreases the visual outcome suggesting early chiasmapexy. In case of severe and long standing symptoms before surgery, benefits and surgical risks should be carefully balanced.

### Hypophysitis, the growing spectrum of a rare pituitary disease [^117G2pCA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

What Are the Radiological Features of Hypophysitis?

Hypophysitis harbors various imaging characteristics. The most frequent MRI finding is a thickened, nondeviated stalk, which can be isolated (infundibulo-neurohypophysitis) in one third of patients or associated with mild to moderate symmetric gland enlargement in > 80% of patients. Contrast uptake is usually intense, homogeneous, and less frequently heterogeneous. An enlarged pituitary resembles a pituitary macroadenoma in approximately half of patients with primary hypophysitis. While the sellar floor may be eroded in pituitary adenomas, it is usually intact in hypophysitis. Other signs of hypophysitis include loss of posterior pituitary bright spot, caused by depletion in vasopressin granules in posterior pituitary hypophysitis. Dural inflammation may cause a dural tail sign, similar to that observed in patients with a meningioma. In late disease stages, the pituitary gland may appear atrophic, and MRI may show sellar arachnoidocele or an empty sella. Although there are no definite MRI features that can confirm hypophysitis, imaging can be diagnostic in the right clinical context; for example, stalk thickening in a young woman with recent pregnancy presenting with headache and hypopituitarism is highly suggestive of LHy. Specific radiologic findings in different types of hypophysitis are presented in Figure 1.

### The link between empty sella syndrome, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome: the role of increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure [^1112hxv8]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The etiopathogenesis of fibromyalgia (FM) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is not yet elucidated. Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction is reflected in the hormonal disturbances found in FM and CFS. Some study groups have introduced a novel hypothesis that moderate or intermittent intracranial hypertension may be involved in the etiopathogenesis of FM and CFS. In these conditions, hormonal disturbances may be caused by the mechanical effect of increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which hampers blood flow in the pituitary gland. Severe intracranial pressure may compress the pituitary gland, resulting in primary empty sella (ES), potentially leading to pituitary hormone deficiencies. The aim of this narrative review was to explore whether similar hormonal changes and symptoms exist between primary ES and FM or CFS and to link them to cerebrospinal fluid pressure dysregulation. A thorough search of the PubMed and Web of Science databases and the reference lists of the included studies revealed that several clinical characteristics were more prevalent in primary ES, FM or CFS patients than in controls, including increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, obesity, female sex, headaches and migraine, fatigue, visual disturbances (visual acuity and eye motility abnormalities), vestibulocochlear disturbances (vertigo and neurosensorial hearing loss), and bodily pain (radicular pain and small-fiber neuropathy). Furthermore, challenge tests of the pituitary gland showed similar abnormalities in all three conditions: blunted adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, growth hormone, luteinizing hormone, and thyroid stimulating hormone responses and an increased prolactin response. The findings of this narrative review provide further support for the hypothesis that moderately or intermittently increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure is involved in the pathogenesis of FM and CFS and should stimulate further research into the etiopathogenesis of these conditions.

### Sheehan's syndrome [^115oGgw4]. Pituitary (2003). Low credibility.

Sheehan's syndrome occurs as a result of ischemic pituitary necrosis due to severe postpartum hemorrhage. It may be rarely seen without massive bleeding or after normal delivery. Improvement in obstetric care and availability of rapid blood transfusion coincided with a remarkable reduction in the frequency of Sheehan's syndrome particularly in western society. But it has recently been reported more often from well-developed countries. It is one of the most common causes of hypopituitarism in underdeveloped or developing countries. Enlargement of pituitary gland, small sella size, disseminated intravascular coagulation and autoimmunity have been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of Sheehan's syndrome in women who suffer from severe postpartum hemorrhage. The patients may seek medical advice because of various presentations ranging from non-specific symptoms to coma and the clinical manifestation may change from one patient to another. Failure of postpartum lactation and failure to resume menses after delivery are the most common presenting symptoms. Although a small percentage of patients with Sheehan's syndrome may cause abrupt onset severe hypopituitarism immediately after delivery, most patients have a mild disease and go undiagnosed and untreated for a long time. It may result in partial or panhypopituitarism and GH is one of the hormones lost earliest. The great majority of the patients has empty sella on CT or MRI. Lymphocytic hypophysitis should be kept in mind in differential diagnosis. In this review, the old and recent data regarding Sheehan's syndrome are presented.

### Two cases of kallmann syndrome associated with empty sella [^113AeNpf]. Pituitary (2008). Low credibility.

Kallmann syndrome (KS) is a developmental disease characterized by the association of isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia/hyposmia. We report an unusual presentation of two females with KS and empty sella. These females, aged at 20 and 29-year-old, presented primary amenorrhea with prepubertal estradiol and low gonadotropin levels. No other significant clinical signs were observed. Empty sella was observed on MRI in both cases. Sequencing of FGFR1 gene, recently implicated in autosomal form of KS, was performed and one splicing mutation (IVS14 + 1G > A) was identified in one patient.

### Primary pituitary abscess followed by empty sella syndrome in an adolescent girl [^114jXLaw]. Pituitary (2010). Low credibility.

Primary pituitary abscess is a rare pituitary pathology, particularly at a young age and is characterized by atypical clinical features making the diagnosis difficult. Correct diagnosis and therapy are mandatory due to the potentially lethal outcome of pituitary infection. We report the case of an adolescent girl presenting with headache, diabetes insipidus and central thyro-gonadic insufficiency with no history of infection, in whom the intra-operative diagnosis of primary pituitary abscess was made. Bacterial cultures indicated infection with Streptococcus spp. One year after neurosurgery and antibiotic therapy, recovery of diabetes insipidus and pituitary insufficiency was documented except for persistence of subnormal growth hormone secretion. Post-surgery, pituitary magnetic resonance imaging revealed an empty sella syndrome.

Headaches

The predominant symptom in primary ES is headache, which is the main reason for imaging tests. Headache has been reported in between 59% and 88% of patients.,

According to De Simone et al, increased intracranial pressure is likely involved in the progression of migraine in most patients diagnosed with unresponsive chronic migraine. Indeed, in unresponsive migraine patients, lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid withdrawal resulted in sustained remission of chronic migraine pain in 77%.

FM/CFS patients also often suffer headaches and migraines. An observational study in FM patients reported a 29% prevalence of migraine and a 59% prevalence of tension-type headache. An epidemiological study reported a high prevalence of headaches in patients with FM. Chronic headache was reported by 76% of patients, with 84% patients reporting substantial or severe impact from their headaches. Migraine was diagnosed in 63% of FM patients who reported headaches, with probable analgesic overuse headaches in only 8%. In a cross-sectional study in patients with CFS, the prevalence of migraine headaches was 84%, and that of tension-type headaches was 81% compared to 5% and 45% in healthy controls, respectively.

Fatigue

Fatigue is a common symptom in primary ES patients. Additionally, an MRI study in patients with asthenia as the main complaint revealed that 58% of patients had ES. Fatigue may be due to hormonal disturbancesor to increased intracranial pressure.

In FM/CFS patients, fatigue is one of the core symptoms.

### Arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) with partial empty sella: a case report [^114g68n5]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Incidental radiographic findings of an empty sella are prevalent in up to 35% of the general population. While empty sella was initially considered clinically insignificant, a subset of patients exhibits endocrine or neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations which are diagnostic of empty sella syndrome (ESS). Symptoms in this clinical condition can include headache or vision loss associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea, or features of hypopituitarism. Pituitary function disturbances in empty sella syndrome happen with somatotroph, followed by lactotroph, gonadotroph, corticotroph, and thyrotroph abnormalities in that specific order.

There is limited report on the association of central diabetes insipidus with empty sella. Only a few case reports have been described. A case report by Sonika Malik et al. in 2021 reported a 32-year-old woman with isolated posterior pituitary dysfunction who responded to desmopressin treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary gland showed a predominantly empty sella. In another case report, a one-year-old male child with an empty sella turcica was diagnosed with arginine vasopressin deficiency and treated with intranasal desmopressin therapy. In a study by E. Cacciari et al. the hypopituitarism occurred due to empty sella were isolated growth hormone deficiency, combined pituitary hormone deficiency, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, idiopathic delayed puberty, and precocious puberty. No patients with isolated diabetes insipidus had empty sella. Here we report a case of posterior pituitary dysfunction in the form of central diabetes insipidus associated with empty sella syndrome in a young female patient.

### Septal cartilage plug technique in spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea postoperatively diagnosed with partial empty sella syndrome [^114qEMRg]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The otolaryngologist should consider empty sella syndrome for diagnostic guidance when evaluating patients with nontraumatic spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea. The radiographic finding of empty sella is frequently reported in patients with benign intracranial hypertension (BIH). Patients who have a spontaneous CSF leak in the absence of florid symptoms of BIH may have a disrupted pattern of CSF flow, and because they are actively leaking CSF before surgical repair, they may be at risk for developing elevated intracranial pressure and BIH after the CSF leaks have been successfully closed. We describe a patient with CSF rhinorrhea who developed headache, papilledema, and visual disturbance after surgical repair of the CSF leak. The leak was repaired by the placement of a septal cartilage plug with a free mucosal suture graft. This technique provides fundamental biomechanical stability, reduces the complexity of the multilayer packing method, and promotes an effective seal.

### Arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) with partial empty sella: a case report [^112HLeKN]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) is defined as a reduction in the release of arginine vasopressin (AVP) resulting in a variable degree of polyuria. Partial empty sella refers to an enlarged sella turcica that is not completely filled by pituitary gland. It can be either primary or secondary and its manifestation ranges from asymptomatic cases to isolated posterior pituitary, isolated anterior pituitary or both anterior and posterior pituitary dysfunctions. Diabetes insipidus caused by a partially empty sella is rare.

Case Presentation

The patient, an 18-year-old Ethiopian woman who presented with long standing headache, increased urination, increased thirst, absence of menses and weight loss. Urine and serum osmolality was done and suggested diabetes insipidus. On further workup, brain magnetic resonant imaging was done and partially empty sella was diagnosed.

Conclusion

Diabetes insipidus secondary to partially empty sella is uncommon. In patients presenting with headache and anterior or posterior pituitary dysfunction, empty sella should be considered, whether partial or complete.

### A young man with secondary adrenal insufficiency due to empty sella syndrome [^1128FYdF]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

In management of hyponatremia, the sodium correction rate is suggested to be less than 12 mmol/L/day or even more restricted to 8 to 10 mmol/L/day in recent guidelines, and hypokalaemia has been recognized as an important risk factor for developing osmotic demyelination syndrome. Since corticosteroid replacement is the mainstay treatment to manage secondary adrenal insufficiency-associated hyponatremia, it is crucial to be cautious not to correct sodium levels rapidly when combining corticosteroids, as the synergistic effect of corticosteroid replacement along with intravenous sodium administration could result in rapidly downregulated vasopressin. Nevertheless, this patient presented with delirium and agitation without overcorrection of sodium after corticosteroid treatment, and decreased serum potassium was noted. A decrease in Na + ‑K + ‑ATPase activity during hypokalaemia may affect the cell's ability to preserve its volume and predispose the cell to injury by rapid osmotic stress. Once the clinical clues of overcorrection of sodium develop, immediate discontinuation of sodium correction and relowering of serum sodium are necessary. The patient's symptoms were alleviated after immediate relowering of sodium and supplementation with potassium.

Corticosteroids, including fludrocortisone, hydrocortisone, and prednisolone, also have mineralocorticoid effects resulting in sodium and water retention, potassium excretion, and transcellular potassium shift caused by hyperinsulinaemia. A decrease in serum potassium level might also arise from the mineralocorticoid effect, which could be a hint of the risk of rapid sodium correction. Therefore, monitoring serum potassium closely in addition to the sodium correction rate is highly recommended in patients receiving corticosteroid and intravenous sodium supplementation.

In conclusion, electrolyte imbalance, such as severe hyponatremia, could be the sole presenting sign of empty sella syndrome. Clinicians should be aware of the risks of hypokalaemia and sodium overcorrection rate during the management of adrenal insufficiency. Careful monitoring of the changes in electrolytes when combining corticosteroid therapy should be emphasized in patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency caused by empty sella syndrome to avoid any neurological deficit.

### The link between empty sella syndrome, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome: the role of increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure [^113W7RV5]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

A Discussion of the Similarities Between Primary ES and FM/CFS

The similarities between primary ES and FM/CFS are listed in Table 1.

Table 1
Similar Characteristics of Primary ES, FM and CFS

Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure Dysregulation

In patients with intracranial hypertension, insufficient hormone secretion from the pituitary gland is caused by the compression of the pituitary gland against the sella turcica and the compression and eventual stretching of the pituitary stalk by the downward compression of the pituitary gland. Thus, similar to pituitary compression by an adenoma (secondary ES), increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure may hamper hormone production.

Primary ES is almost always secondary to dysregulation of intracranial pressure even when incidentally found in asymptomatic cases. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema is currently severely underestimated or misdiagnosed because the upper limit of the current normal range is set too high and because of a largely unrecognized high prevalence of asymptomatic cases. It has been suggested that the prevalence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema might be up to three times higher than that of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. A possible mechanism that has been proposed is reduced intracranial compliance that precedes the increase in intracranial pressure and that may already be pathologic in cases lacking a detectable increase in intracranial pressure at lumbar puncture. Hence, opening pressure values greater than 25 cm H2O are not required (and potentially misleading) in diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema.

Intracranial hypertension involves a spectrum that begins with milder and intermittent forms that progress into ES and ends with more severe forms of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, presenting with papilledema, severe headache and visual field defects. Indeed, only 8 to 15% of patients with ES progress to develop these severe idiopathic intracranial hypertension symptoms, but in contrast, up to 94% of patients with severe idiopathic intracranial hypertension already show ES.

Using a lumbar constant-rate infusion test, pressure anomalies were revealed in 109 (77%) of 142 primary ES patients: pathological resting intracranial pressure (range 19–35 cm H2O) in 88 patients (62%) and a reduction in the cerebrospinal fluid absorption rate despite normal basal intracranial pressure in 21 patients (15%).

In patients with FM/CFS, moderately high cerebrospinal fluid pressures were found during lumbar puncture. In 30 patients with chronic widespread pain or FM, the mean cerebrospinal opening pressure was 19.7 cm H2O (range 11–32 cm H2O). Sixteen patients (53%) exhibited a pressure ≥ 19 cm H2O. Moreover, spinal fluid evacuation temporarily improved bodily pain in 21 of 30 patients (70%).

### Primary empty sella (PES): a review of 175 cases [^11789ryZ]. Pituitary (2013). Low credibility.

The term primary empty sella (PES) makes reference to the herniation of the subarachnoid space within the sella turcica in patients with no history of pituitary tumor, surgery or radiotherapy. To retrospectively assess clinical features, radiological findings and the biochemical endocrine function from the records of 175 patients with a diagnosis of PES. One hundred seventy-five patients (150 females) were studied. The mean age at diagnosis was 48.2 ± 14 year. Most diagnoses were made by magnetic resonance imaging (n = 172). In most patients, the pituitary function was assessed by basal pituitary hormones measurements. Pituitary scans were ordered for different reasons: headache (33.1%), endocrine disorders (30.6%), neurological symptoms (12.5%), visual disturbances (8.75%), abnormalities on sella turcica radiograph (8.75%) and others (6.25%). Multiple pregnancies were observed in 58.3% of women; headaches, obesity, and hypertension were found in 59.4, 49.5, and 27.3% of the studied population, respectively. Mild hyperprolactinemia (< 50 ng/ml) was present in 11.6% of women and 17.3% of men. Twenty-eight percent of our patients had some degree of hypopituitarism. In the male population, hypopituitarism represented 64% of cases, whereas it accounted for 22% of all females. PES seems to be more commonly found in middle-aged women, with a history of multiple pregnancies. In most patients, PES was discovered as an incidental finding on imaging studies, while in almost a quarter of patients PES was found during the diagnostic evaluation of anterior pituitary deficiency, which was more common in men.

### Intracranial hypertension and empty sella from adrenal adenoma and excessive and prolonged steroid usage: a case report [^11179xSw]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a clinical syndrome characterized by increased intracranial pressure of unclear etiology. Its most common pathological changes are papilledema and empty sella. If untreated or improperly treated, papilledema can lead to progressive and irreversible vision loss as a result of optic atrophy, and empty sella can cause hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction and resultant hormonal alterations. Although the underlying cause of IIH is still unknown, many studies indicate that Cushing disease, chronic steroid administration and acute withdrawal of chronic steroid use are among the largely reported possible causal and associated risk factors. In 1980, Britton et al. reported that there is an association between IIH and cortisol-secreting adrenal adenoma. Since then, however, no other cases associated with cortisol-secreting adrenal adenoma have been reported. It is unknown whether IIH with cortisol-secreting adrenal adenoma has not been given due attention by the academia or it's just an individual and accidental phenomenon.

PTC is a clinical entity of uncertain etiology characterized by intracranial hypertension. The syndrome classically manifests with headaches and visual changes in women with obesity. Traditionally, imaging ruled out secondary causes of elevated CSF pressure but now may reveal findings frequently seen in patients with PTC, including the following: flattening of the globe, an empty sella, an enlarged ONS, protrusion and enhancement of the optic nerve head, and increased tortuosity of the optic nerve. Novel imaging methods, including MR venography, have additionally identified sinovenous stenosis as a potential indicator of PTC.

Table 4 illustrates the distribution of pituitary hormone levels in PES patients, in addition to the assessment statistics of individual hormones. The categorization of values as low, normal and high is based on reference range, where low and high values are referred to as abnormal. Pituitary dysfunction is referred to two to three hormonal deficiencies (multi-hormonal deficiency) or three or more hormonal deficiencies (panhypopituitarism) as presented graphically in Fig. 2. Males showed higher levels of pituitary dysfunction than females. Hypogonadism was the most frequent disorder observed, followed by hypothyroidism and hypocortisolism.

### Arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) with partial empty sella: a case report [^1127CHRA]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

A high incidence of pituitary dysfunction has been documented in patients with primary empty sella syndrome. These included panhypopituitarism, secondary hypogonadism, hyperprolactinemia, isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency, and diabetes insipidus. In our case study, MRI of the brain showed a slightly prominent and CSF-filled sella with a partially flattened and thinned pituitary gland, with the conclusion of a partially empty sella. There is no mass on the MRI that suggests the possible differential diagnosis like craniopharyngioma, germinoma, pinealoma, or a metastasis, lymphomas, Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Lack of involvement of the hypothalamus and normal infundibular stalk makes langerhans cell histiocytosis and sarcoidosis unlikely. No other organ involvement seen in this patient that suggests IgG4 related disorder or IgG hypophysitis. Additional investigations such as beta human chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, serum IgG4 level, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor were also normal. A repeat MRI is planned to see any change of the imaging within six months to a year period.

The patient is currently being followed up at the endocrine clinic. The radiological grade of partial empty sella tends to remain constant over time. However, due to the theoretical risk of progression, a re-evaluation of the endocrine, neuro/ophthalmological, and radiological picture after months is reasonable. If no progression is observed, additional surveillance could be even less frequent and limited to those patients who clinically require it.

Overall hormonal assessment

The pituitary function in PES has been previously considered normal, while many recent studies have been reporting growing evidence of impaired pituitary function. Pituitary insufficiency has enormous variations, ranging from isolated hormone deficiency to complete deficiency like panhypopituitarism. The present study found a gross under-evaluation of the hormonal profile. In the overall sample, only 10% were assessed for LH and FSH, 8% for cortisol, 5% for testosterone, 2% for estradiol and less than 1.3% were assessed for growth hormone. Thyroid and prolactin hormones assessment were slightly higher with 40 and 14%, respectively. Although the latter two being the most prevalent endocrine abnormalities, the case referral and hormonal assessment were still considered sub-optimal. The findings suggest under-evaluation leading to under-reporting the prevalence of pituitary hormones insufficiency that is of significant concern.

Endocrine dysfunction and clinical management of cases

One of the principal finding of the study is the gross difference in the assessment of the hormones and the prevalence of deficiencies among those evalauated by the physicians and the endocrinologists. Differences in prevalence of hormonal deficiencies concerning the gonadal axis and somatotrophic axis were markedly observed followed by adrenal hormones and thyrotrophic axis. These findings reflect on the major consequences of poor refrerral and under-assessment of the cases by the general physicians. Most of the patients diagnosed with primary empty sella syndrome presented with one or multiple hormonal deficiency at the same time as the initial evaluation which made it difficult to follow on the sequences of the deficiency of all the hormones.

Gonadal axis dysfunction

Further analysis of individual parameters showed marked endocrine dysfunction. A high prevalence of hypogonadism was noted in women, while adrenal insufficiency was common in men. The gonadal profile of PES patients in the present study showed marked variations in the assessment. Only 2.5% of the patients were referred for gonadal profile evaluation by the general physicians, while endocrinologists evaluated 52%. Among those assessed, almost 43% were affected by hypogonadismin the patients seen by endocrinologists in stark contrast to 6.6% in the other group. Similar findings were reported in the evaluation of adrenal hormones. The alarmingly high rates of low case referrals for hormone assessment increases the risk of under-diagnosis of associated abnormalities. Therefore, it becomes imperative for the subjective evaluation of these patients for complete hormonal assessment and diagnosis of hormone dysfunction in the PES patients.

### Primary empty sella [^1147CTD6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Context

The term primary empty sella (PES) refers to a number of endocrine and/or neurological disturbances that may be caused by the herniation of subarachnoid space within the sella.

Setting

The records of all patients with a diagnosis of empty sella between 1985 and 2002 seen at the Catholic University of Rome and University of Brescia were examined retrospectively.

Patients

We have observed 171 female and 42 male patients affected by PES (over 4:1 sex ratio). The mean age at diagnosis in our subjects was 51.8 ± 2.1 yr. Mean body mass index was 27.3 ± 3.5 kg/m2.

Main Outcome Measure

All the patients have been analyzed first either with sellar computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging. All patients underwent neurological, ophthalmological, and baseline endocrine evaluation (appropriate stimulation tests were performed when hypopituitarism was suspected).

Results

In the overall population, 40 of 213 patients had documented endocrine abnormalities, specifically 31 females and nine males. Twenty-two patients (10.3% of total patients; 18 women, 10.5% of all women, with a mean age of 38.6 ± 1.1 yr and four males, with a mean age 46.5 ± 3.52 yr) presented with hyperprolactinemia. Global anterior hypopituitarism was confirmed in nine patients. Eight patients presented an isolated GH deficiency. One hundred thirty-eight of our patients presented a so-called partial empty sella at computed tomography scan/magnetic resonance imaging, and 75 had total PES.

Conclusions

PES may be associated with variable clinical conditions ranging from mild endocrine disturbances to severe intracranial hypertension and rhinorrhea. The need for treatment of hyperprolactinemia as well as for replacement hormone therapy must be assessed in PES. Symptomatic intracranial hypertension makes cerebrospinal fluid shunting procedures necessary.

### The link between empty sella syndrome, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome: the role of increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure [^1117ydz3]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Bodily Pain

Whereas bodily pain is a core symptom in FM/CFS, it is less well known that idiopathic intracranial hypertension is associated with bodily pain. Allodynia, defined as the perception of pain or discomfort induced by non noxious stimuli, has been reported in 50% of patients with intracranial hypertension. Additionally, neck pain, backpain, and radicular pain due to the forced filling of the nerve root sheaths with cerebrospinal fluid have been reported in patients with intracranial hypertension.

Bodily pain in FM/CFS has been attributed to the mechanism of central nervous sensitization. However, in FM, electrodiagnostic assessments have detected radicular abnormalities in the majority of patients. Additionally, a meta-analysis of 20 biopsy studies including 903 FM patients revealed small-fiber neuropathy in up to 49% of FM patients. Small-fiber neuropathy is the consequence of damage to the fibers that are responsible for nociceptive processing and may produce debilitating pain.

According to our hypothesis, in the same way that the thinning of the optic nerve fiber layer in primary ES is due to ischemic and mechanic mechanisms, small or large nerve fibers or neurons may be damaged in the dorsal root ganglion due to ischemia and mechanical stress from increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure.

Pain is also a common complaint in patients with CFS. The 2011 International Consensus Criteria on CFS describe pain with neuropathic characteristics (sharp, shooting, burning) as a common symptom in CFS. Skin biopsy studies or electrodiagnostic tests have not been reported in CFS. One study in CFS patients with low cardiac filling pressures during exercise indirectly suggested small-fiber neuropathy in 31% of patients.

### Association of Bartter's syndrome and empty sella [^116BtzFW]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Bartter's syndrome is characterized by hypochloremia, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis associated with renal potassium leakage, and normal blood pressure despite increased plasma renin activity. Although association of empty sella with Gitelman syndrome has been reported, no association has been reported with Bartter's syndrome. Here we report a patient with Bartter's syndrome and empty sella. A 12 month-old male patient presented with a history of nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, constipation, and edema in the lower extremities that had begun in the early postnatal period. The patient was born at 32 weeks gestation by operative delivery for polyhydramnios. Blood pressure was normal. Serum sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphate, chloride, albumin and alkaline phosphatase levels were 129 mEq/l, 2.5 mEq/l, 9 mg/dl, 3.8 mg/dl, 72 mg/dl, 4.2 g/dl and 1285 IU/l, respectively. Serum magnesium level was normal. Arterial blood gas levels revealed pH 7.55 (normal, 7.35–7.45), PCO2 33.6 mm/Hg (36–46), base excess +7.1 (± 2.3), and total CO2 33.6 mmol/l (23–27). Renin and aldosterone levels were elevated. Urine had pH 8.0 and specific gravity 1.010. Urinary calcium excretion was 22.8 kg/day (urine calcium/creatinine ratio 0.46). Urinary potassium and chloride levels were elevated. MRI of the brain was normal except for partially empty sella. We present the first pediatric patient with the association of Bartter's syndrome and empty sella.

### Effect of primary empty sella syndrome on pituitary surgery for Cushing's disease [^11194VgG]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

Object

Primary empty sella syndrome (ESS) results from herniation of arachnoid mater into the pituitary fossa. It has been suggested to have a negative effect on pituitary surgery; however, outcomes in this cohort have not been defined. This study was performed to determine the effect of ESS on immediate and long-term biochemical outcome after pituitary surgery for Cushing's disease (CD).

Methods

Using a matched cohort study design, the authors followed patients treated with pituitary surgery for CD with and without ESS. Complete ESS was defined as pituitary gland height ≤ 2 mm, whereas partial ESS was defined as pituitary gland height > 2 mm but less than three-quarters of the total sellar depth. The primary end points were immediate and long-term biochemical outcome. Cerebrospinal fluid leaks were recorded as a secondary end point.

Results

Seventy-eight patients with CD and primary ESS were identified and matched with 78 patients with CD without ESS. After surgical management, immediate biochemical remission was achieved in 69 patients (88%) with ESS and 75 controls (96%, p = 0.10). Long-term remission was achieved in most patients in both groups (5-year cure: 85% vs 92%, p = 0.10). Among patients with ESS, the presence of complete ESS predicted a worse long-term outcome (p = 0.04). Intraoperative CSF leaks were significantly more frequent with ESS (54% vs 24%, p < 0.001), and despite sellar floor repair, the rate of postoperative CSF leaks was also increased (6% vs 3%, p = 0.27).

Conclusions

Biochemical outcome after pituitary surgery for CD was worse in patients with complete ESS, and the risk of a CSF leak was increased with both partial and complete ESS. However, as outcome remains superior to those following alternative therapies and the biology of these tumors is unchanged in the setting of ESS, pituitary surgery should remain the initial treatment of choice.

### The association of Cushing's disease and primary empty sella turcica [^113p35Dy]. Pituitary (2001). Low credibility.

The empty sella turcica is defined as the extension of the subarachnoid space toward the intrasellar region with displacement of the pituitary towards the posteroinferior wall. By autopsy studies, the incidence in the general population is around 20%. The association of Cushing's disease (CD) and empty sella has been infrequently reported. In our group, from a total of 68 patients with CD studied by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we found the presence of a primary empty sella syndrome (ESS) in 11 (16%). Of these, 9 had partial and 2 total ESS, and in four of them a microadenoma could be identified. Remission, ascertained by subnormal postoperative cortisol levels in blood and/or urine was obtained in 5 of 6 patients operated on by the transphenoidal route. Following surgery, 2 patients presented cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage, 2 diabetes insipidus, and 2 some form of hypopituitarism, figures apparently higher than in non-ESS patients with CD. Ketoconazole was indicated as second line treatment in 2 patients and as primary therapy in 4, resulting in normal urinary free cortisol (UFC) values, with no complications. The relationship of ESS and CD is probably fortuitous given that the frequency of ESS in the general population is similar. Although in empty sella both surgery and radiotherapy seem to have greater risk of complications, surgery remains the first line treatment. Nevertheless, chronic treatment with ketoconazole could be a useful first choice, particularly when no adenoma is seen, or in those who have contraindications for surgery.

### Spontaneous CSF leaks [^112rErSH]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea represents a distinct clinic entity that is likely a variant of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Patients with spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks are generally middle-aged obese women with radiographic evidence of skull base defects, associated meningoencephaloceles, and empty sella syndrome, a common sign of increased intracranial pressure. Significant overlap exists in the characteristics of patients with spontaneous CSF leak and IIH. Endoscopic repair of the CSF fistula is the gold standard treatment for this condition, but emerging evidence supports the reduction of CSF pressure as an important adjuvant treatment in this patient population.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for idiopathic intracranial hypertension, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ABN/BASH/RCOphth/SBNS 2018 guidelines recommend to recognize that the following characteristics of raised ICP may be seen on neuroimaging but are not pathognomonic of idiopathic intracranial hypertension:

- empty sella

- partially empty sella/decreased pituitary height

- increased tortuosity of optic nerve

- enlarged optic nerve sheath (perioptic subarachnoid space)

- flattened posterior globe/sclera

- intraocular protrusion of optic nerve head

- attenuation of the cerebrovenous sinuses including bilateral transverse sinus stenosis or stenosis of a dominant transverse sinus.

### A rare case of pituitary infarction leading to spontaneous tumour resolution and CSF-sella syndrome in an 11-year-old girl and a review of the paediatric literature [^113Y2akg]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Pituitary infarction or apoplexy with spontaneous cure of the underlying pituitary adenoma is rare. In the paediatric population, we found only a few reported cases. We report a rare case of pituitary infarction progressing to CSF-sella syndrome (or empty sella) in an 11-year-old girl. She presented with sudden onset vomiting, moderate headaches, lethargy, weight loss, and tall stature above her mid-parental height. She did not have any severe symptoms of apoplexy. Her clinical and radiological findings suggested infarction of a pituitary lesion, such as a pituitary adenoma or infarction of a cystic lesion, such as a Rathke's cleft cyst. In this report, we discuss her case of probable infarction of a growth hormone secreting adenoma with a phase of accelerated growth ending up with total anterior pituitary insufficiency. The differential diagnosis and review of the rare cases of paediatric pituitary infarction in the literature will be discussed.

Radiological pituitary abnormalities

Of the 376 patients in whom dedicated pituitary MRI had been performed, 35 (9.3%) had a pituitary abnormality. Details regarding the pituitary abnormalities found are presented in Table 3. Of the 35 pituitary abnormalities, 17 were diagnosed with adenomas. Non-functioning microadenoma (n = 14) were the most common abnormality, followed by empty sella syndrome (n = 8), Rathke's cleft cyst (n = 5), other cystic formations (n = 4), functioning microadenoma (n = 1), functioning macroadenoma (n = 1) and spontaneous pituitary haemorrhage (n = 1). One patient had a microadenoma, but it had not been ascertained whether it was functioning or non-functioning.

The two functioning adenomas were prolactinomas. The patient with macroprolactinoma presented with a 3-year history of CH but no pituitary symptoms. The other patient had galactorrhoea secondary to a microprolactinoma, which has been diagnosed 23 years after the first CH attack. In terms of treatment, the two prolactinomas were treated with dopamine agonists but did not require surgery. Treatment led to a partial improvement of the CH attacks in the patient with a macroprolactinoma but had no impact in the patient with the microprolactinoma.

Two patients had pituitary symptoms. Besides the patient who presented with galactorrhoea secondary to a microprolactinoma that was diagnosed 23 years after the first CH attack, another patient had menstruation changes and hirsutism with a pituitary microadenoma, in whom pituitary blood profile was not available and who was lost to follow-up despite several attempts to contact her.

Of note, one patient with a microadenoma showed a slightly elevated IGF-1 level but with normal GH level and no signs of acromegaly; on prolonged follow up of 9 years, the microadenoma remained unchanged on serial MRI scans and the IGF-1 level fluctuated between being slightly elevated or normal with normal GH levels. This patient was deemed to have non-functioning microadenoma.

Notably, in the 203 patients who had a routine MRI followed by a subsequent pituitary MRI, 10 additional pituitary lesions were detected, including five pituitary microadenomas, but none required any specific treatment.

### Significance of empty sella in cerebrospinal fluid leaks [^117XCXft]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The role of elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressures in the pathophysiology of various CSF leaks is not clear. Empty sella syndrome (ESS) is a radiographic finding that can be associated with elevated CSF pressures and may represent a radiographic indicator of intracranial hypertension. We present our experience with CSF leaks of various causes, the prevalence of ESS in the spontaneous and nonspontaneous categories, and the potential pathophysiology and unique management issues of the spontaneous CSF leak group.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of medical records, imaging studies, and surgical treatment of CSF leaks in patients treated by the senior author.

Results

Sixteen patients with spontaneous CSF leaks and 12 patients with nonspontaneous CSF leaks were surgically treated from 1996 through 2002. In the spontaneous group, 15 patients had complete imaging of the sella turcica. Ten had completely empty sellae and 5 had partially empty sellae, for a total of 100% (15 of 15). In the nonspontaneous group, 9 patients had complete imaging of the sella. Only 11% (1 of 9) had a partially empty sella and that was a congenital leak. Comparison of proportions between these 2 groups was significant (P = 0.01). The spontaneous group consisted primarily of obese, middle-aged females (13 of 16 patients).

Conclusion

Empty sella probably represents a sign of elevated intracranial pressure that leads to idiopathic, spontaneous CSF leaks. Spontaneous CSF leaks are strongly associated with the radiographic finding of an empty sella and are more common in obese females, similar to benign intracranial hypertension. This unique population may require more aggressive surgical and medical treatment to prevent recurrent or multiple leaks.

### Adult spontaneous CSF otorrhea: correlation with radiographic empty sella [^115eRZY7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the prevalence of radiographic empty sella in patients with spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) otorrhea.

Study Design and Setting

Retrospective case series of adult patients with CSF otorhinorrhea at an academic tertiary medical center. Patients with history of skull base surgery, trauma, tumor, or chronic ear disease were excluded. Available imaging studies were reviewed with attention to the sella turcica.

Results

Eight patients were diagnosed with spontaneous CSF otorrhea. Five of seven patients with adequate imaging studies (71%) had a radiographic empty sella. Seven of eight patients were clinically obese, with a body mass index BMI > 30 kg/m2.

Conclusions

Empty sella is a common radiologic finding in patients with spontaneous CSF otorrhea. This supports the theory that increased intracranial pressure contributes to development of spontaneous CSF otorrhea.

Significance

Radiographic empty sella predicts elevated intracranial pressure, which may require further evaluation and treatment in patients with spontaneous CSF otorrhea.

### Etiology and management of amenorrhea in adolescent and young adult women [^117N9tHe]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2022). Medium credibility.

In this article, we will review the etiology and management of amenorrhea in adolescent and young adult women, beginning with the diagnostic work-up and followed by etiologies organized by system. Most cases of amenorrhea are caused by dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis, which is the major regulator of the female reproductive hormones: estrogen and progesterone. We begin by reviewing hypothalamic etiologies, including eating disorders and relative energy deficiency in sport. Then, pituitary causes of amenorrhea are reviewed, including hyperprolactinemia, empty sella syndrome, Sheehan's syndrome and Cushing's syndrome. Next, ovarian causes of amenorrhea are reviewed, including polycystic ovarian syndrome and primary ovarian insufficiency. Finally, other etiologies of amenorrhea are discussed, including thyroid disease, adrenal disease and reproductive tract anomalies. In conclusion, there is a wide and diverse range of causes of amenorrhea in adolescents that originate from any level of the HPO axis, as well as anatomic and chromosomal etiologies. Treatment should be focused on the underlying cause. Preservation of bone density and risk of fractures should be discussed with amenorrheic patients since many causes of amenorrhea can result in decreased bone density and may be irreversible.

### Petrous apex cephalocele and empty sella: is there any relation? [^115dUFye]. European Journal of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To document the presence of incidental petrous apex cephalocele (PAC) in association with empty sella in a group of patients and propose an etiologic/pathologic relation between the two lesions.

Materials and Methods

Retrospective review of our imaging archive for the period from October 2001 to October 2006 revealed five patients with PAC (four females and one male; age range, 25–60 years; mean, 47 years). All patients underwent enhanced MR examination of the skull base and four of them underwent CT examination. Lesions were evaluated for size, content, signal intensity, enhancement, and relation to Meckel's cave and petrous apex. Images were also evaluated for the presence of empty sella.

Results

The presenting symptoms in all patients were not attributable to PAC. None of the patients had symptoms related to the trigeminal nerve or history of CSF leak. Four patients had bilateral PAC and one had left PAC (total nine lesions). The lesions ranged from 6 mm to 15 mm (mean 9 mm) in the maximum diameter. All lesions were centered posterolateral to Meckel's cave and had low attenuation on CT with sharply demarcated margins. No lesion reached the inner ear structures, internal auditory canal, or mastoid air cells. On MR imaging, all lesions demonstrated CSF signal intensity that is continuous with that of the Meckel's cave. Only the periphery of the lesions demonstrated mild enhancement. All patients had empty sella. One patient had small arachnoid cysts in the middle cranial fossa, bilaterally.

Conclusion

PAC and empty sella are similar mechanically in terms of CSF extension and erosion into petrous apex and sella, respectively. Both conditions are seen predominantly in females and have been reported in association with CSF leak, which raises a possibility of etiologic/pathologic relation between the two.

### Arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) with partial empty sella: a case report [^112xRkMD]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

About 29.6% of patients had arginine vasopressin deficiency in a series of patients with Sheehan's syndrome, all of these patients had an increased thirst threshold. Our patient has no history of pregnancy and doesn't have Sheehan's syndrome. The presentation of central diabetes insipidus in this patient is due to a primary partial empty sella. The prevalence of migraine headache is higher in women with a ratio of 3 to 1. This may have contributed to the higher prevalence of incidental partial empty sella in this particular population, as they may be exposed to neuroimaging modalities that help to diagnose and detect asymptomatic (and clinically silent) partial empty sella. In our case, the patient is a female with a four-year history of intermittent severe headaches that have worsened in the last two years, which is similar to other studies and case reports.

This patient had a classic presentation of central diabetes insipidus and amenorrhoea of four years' duration, possibly caused by her significant weight loss. Hormonal analysis showed normal levels of cortisol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing-hormone, thyroid function test and prolactin. Her initial urine specific gravity was low (1.005), which corresponded to a diluted urine with an osmolarity of 150 mosmol/L. Only urine osmolality above 700 mOsm/kg excludes diabetes insipidus. Her serum sodium concentration is also in the higher part of the reference range which is more suggestive of diabetes insipidus. After overnight water deprivation test, the serum osmolality increased to 298 mOsm/kg and the urine osmolality was still low (210 mOsm/kg) which helps us to exclude primary polydipsia for sure. In normal conditions urine osmolality should have to rise usually to over 750 mOsm/kg. Further IV desmopressin test was not done due to local unavailability. However, the patient was started on desmopressin 60 µg po once at bedtime and her total urine output decreased significantly to 5 L/day. After adjustment to desmopressin 60 µg in the morning and 120 µg po at night, her fluid intake urine output normalized and urine specific gravity normalized. This confirms the diagnosis of arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) with partial empty sella.

### The link between empty sella syndrome, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome: the role of increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure [^117BGbdd]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Vestibulocochlear Disturbances

In primary ES patients, dizziness, syncope, cranial nerve disorders, convulsions, and depression have been reported in approximately 40% of patients. In a case‒control study, the prevalence of partial or total ES in patients with Menière's disease was 46%. There was also a high prevalence of radiographic signs of intracranial hypertension in patients with Menière's disease. The neurological signs in patients with primary ES syndrome are predominantly due to the presence of increased intracranial pressure: values from 19 to 33 cm H2O were found to be insufficient to provoke a clear case of intracranial hypertension but sufficient to maintain the neurological symptoms of primary ES syndrome, such as headache and visual disturbances. Up to 89% of patients with primary ES are diagnosed with hearing loss, most frequently sensorineural hearing loss (78%).

In FM patients, a Dix-Halpike maneuver elicited positional rotary vertigo in 21%. Additionally, 30% to 84% of FM patients report vertigo.FM patients have a higher likelihood of reporting hearing loss than controls (OR 4.6). In a nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study in patients with FM, the overall hearing loss risk was found to be 1.5-fold higher than that in a non-FM group after adjustment for sex, age, and comorbidities. Specifically, similar to primary ES, significantly greater sensorineural hearing loss was detected in patients with FM than in those without FM. Other studies in FM patients versus controls found worse audiological test results in FM patients versus controls.

Vestibular function testing in CFS patients revealed that patients performed below average in dynamic posturography testing, especially in tests requiring individuals to depend heavily on the vestibular system. To our knowledge, there are no studies on hearing loss in patients with CFS.

In intracranial hypertension, hearing loss and vertigo may result from the forced filling of the middle and inner ear with cerebrospinal fluid via the cochlear aqueduct. When a lumbar puncture was performed in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, vertigo, dizziness, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness improved.

### Recurrent hypoglycaemia: a delayed presentation of sheehan syndrome [^116vrZtf]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Sheehan syndrome is a rare but potentially serious complication of postpartum haemorrhage. The diagnosis can often be delayed by many years as symptoms may be subtle. We report the case of a 45-year-old woman who presented to the medical emergency unit with acute onset altered sensorium. On further evaluation she was found to have severe hypoglycaemia which was corrected by giving intravenous dextrose. On detailed clinical evaluation, she had a history of agalactia and amenorrhoea following her last pregnancy which was 15years ago. She had a history of excessive postpartum bleeding during her last delivery. MRI of the brain showed empty sella and hormonal evaluation revealed adenohypophyseal insufficiency as evident from decreased levels of cortisol, thyroid-stimulating hormone, triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinising hormone and prolactin. Based on clinical, radiological and laboratory parameters her final diagnosis was Sheehan syndrome with hypoglycaemia.

### Pituitary enlargement in patients with cerebrospinal fluid drainage due to ventricular shunt insertion: know the condition and do not mistake for adenoma [^1131JbfL]. Pituitary (2023). Medium credibility.

In another case study, highlighting the potential effects of chronic CSF overdrainage on skull base structures, the authors postulated that their patient's pituitary was not truly enlarged, but that such an impression was given as the consequence of overdrainage-induced shrinkage of the sella turcica and subsequent upward extrusion of the pituitary gland. Yet our results show, that a true and significant increase of pituitary size and volume occurs after v.-p. shunt insertion, while acknowledging from own unpublished observations that bony changes of the sella may additionally occur in patients with long-standing shunt overdrainage (for examples confer to Figs. 1 and 2).

In adults, pituitary hyperplasia has frequently been described in spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH), a condition characterized by a loss of CSF due to leakage through the dural membrane, i.e. at the level of the cervicothoracic spine, and classically accompanied by severe orthostatic headache. According to a recent study, this phenomenon of pituitary enlargement constitutes the most frequent early radiological sign of SIH, present in 97.6% of 42 investigated patients 1–6 days after symptom onset. On the other end of the spectrum, a flattened pituitary (empty sella or partial empty sella) is recognized as one diagnostic marker in patients with benign intracranial hypertension, a condition of increased CSF production and consecutively elevated ICP, which can lead to chronic headaches and visual loss.

### The link between empty sella syndrome, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome: the role of increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure [^1124p8qZ]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Ophthalmological Abnormalities

A comprehensive review on ES syndrome revealed that ophthalmological disturbances included visual acuity worsening (13–37%), blurred vision (29%), diplopia (2%), and defects in the oculomotor nerve (1%). The ophthalmological signs in primary ES syndrome were mainly due to the presence of increased intracranial pressure. Additionally, an analysis using optical coherence tomography revealed that the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness of asymptomatic ES patients was thinner than that of controls. The authors assumed that ischemic and mechanical mechanisms rather than a mass effect on the optical nerve may be the cause of these abnormalities.

In FM, retinal nerve fiber thinning, decreased optic disc perfusion, blurred vision (in 46%), and visual field defectshave been detected. According to our hypothesis, similar to primary ES, these abnormalities may be due to perfusion changes in the optic nerve due to the mechanic and ischemic effects of moderately or intermittently increased intracranial pressure.

Additionally, diplopia (eye motility dysfunction) has been reported in FM, and CFS. According to our hypothesis, eye motility dysfunction in FM may be caused by the forced filling of the third, fourth or sixth cranial nerve with cerebrospinal fluid due to increased intracranial pressure.

### Is pituitary MRI screening necessary in cluster headache? [^115Att5w]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Neuroimaging and pituitary assessment

All routine MRI brain or MRI with dedicated pituitary views were performed on either a 1.5 (Siemens Avanto, Ernlagen) or 3 Tesla (Siemens Trio, Ernlagen) scanner. The pituitary MRI protocol included 3 mm thick T1- and T2-weighted coronal and sagittal sections centred on the sellar region. If a pituitary lesion was clearly observed on the pre-contrast imaging, additional coronal and sagittal high-resolution 3 mm sequences were then performed. Microadenoma (< 10 mm) or macroadenoma (> 10 mm) were classified according to the maximal tumour diameter. A primary empty sella or arachnoidocele was defined as the herniation of the subarachnoid space within the sella turcica. Empty sella was classified as partial when less than 50% of the sella was filled with cerebrospinal fluid. Regarding cystic formations, they were categorised as Rathke's cleft cyst, pars intermedia cyst or as anterior pituitary cyst.

Routine pituitary function tests were assessed in line with the standard practice in most headache centres in the UK. The blood tests performed included prolactin, growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor type 1, random cortisol, thyroxine (T4), thyroid stimulating hormone, random cortisol, testosterone, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinising hormone, oestrogen and progesterone.

In order to accurately assess the prevalence of pituitary adenomas, we only included patients who underwent MRI with dedicated pituitary views. To identify the clinical predictors of pituitary adenomas, we divided the cohort into two groups, those with or without a pituitary adenoma.

### Bilateral petrous apex cephalocele associated with a wide sella [^111yRQpt]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Petrous apex cephalocele (PAC) is a rare type of cephalocele. It is usually asymptomatic. It can be unilateral or bilateral. Bilateral cases are less common. They are etiologically and clinically different entities from unilateral ones. A 56-year-old female patient presented to the hospital with the complaint of a severe nonspecific headache. She has been examined in ear nose throat, ophthalmology, and finally neurology clinics. Bilateral PAC was incidentally found in magnetic resonance imaging (MRi) examination. Headache was associated with PAC because no additional pathology could explain the clinical symptomatology. There is a proven relationship between empty sella and PAC. Regarding PAC less than 50 cases are known. Our paper aims to contribute to the literature by exhibiting etiologic and clinic differences between unilateral and bilateral PAC. It highlights the relationship between PAC and broad sella that is a different entity from empty sella and shows this remarkable radiological appearance. The authors presented our case accompanied by clinical and MRi findings.

### More than just a' runny nose': a rare diagnosis of spontaneous CSF rhinorrhoea for a common symptom [^113Wy2KD]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Primary spontaneous cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhoea is a rare disease associated with female gender, obesity and empty sella syndrome. The authors describe the case of a 59-year-old woman who presented to her primary care physician with a 2-week history of drainage of a clear fluid from her right nostril that was initially treated as allergic rhinitis. A non-contrast CT scan revealed mucosal thickening in the right sphenoid sinus and a possible defect in the adjacent skull base. The patient initially declined a CT cisternogram, which provides greater sensitivity in assessing for a CSF leak. Nasal secretions tested positive for β-2-transferrin, which is highly sensitive and specific for CSF. After conservative interventions failed, a pedicled septal mucoperichondrial flap was used to patch the skeletal defect. At her 5-month follow-up, the patient remains asymptomatic.

### Worster-drought syndrome (congenital bilateral perisylvian syndrome) with posterior pituitary ectopia, pituitary hypoplasia, empty sella and panhypopituitarism: a patient report [^116Sohso]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Worster-Drought syndrome (WDS) (congenital bilateral perisylvian syndrome, congenital pseudobulbar paresia) is characterized by neuronal migration defect, pseudobulbar paralysis, epilepsy, neuromotor retardation and perisylvian dysplasia. We report a patient with WDS associated with posterior pituitary ectopia, pituitary hypoplasia, partial empty sella and panhypopituitarism, not previously reported in the literature. The 16.4 year-old female patient had severe growth retardation with height SDS -4.5, delayed puberty, microcephaly, pes equinovarus deformity, developmental delay, speech disorder and epilepsy. Laboratory findings, which revealed abnormal electroencephalography and bilateral perisylvian cortical dysplasia on cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were consistent with WDS. Endocrinological evaluation revealed secondary hypothyroidism and combined deficiency of adrenocorticotropin, gonadotropin and growth hormone (GH). Sella MRI showed congenital empty sella, anterior pituitary hypoplasia, ectopic neurohypophysis, and stalk agenesis. Appropriate replacement therapy was started. GH treatment resulted in a final height of 150.3 cm, appropriate for her target height. This is the first reported patient with WDS associated with congenital structural hypothalamic-pituitary abnormalities, including empty sella, pituitary hypoplasia, posterior pituitary ectopia, stalk agenesis and panhypopituitarism. GH has been successful in the treatment of her short stature.

### Diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with acromegaly in a clinical practice setting in Spain: the ACROPRAXIS program Delphi survey [^116YmkxP]. Pituitary (2020). Medium credibility.

There was consensus to assess the ectopic production of GH–releasing hormone (GHRH) in case of biochemical diagnosis of acromegaly and an image of empty sella (S12). Primary empty sella syndrome is frequently associated to GH deficiency; thus, the coexistence of this image with acromegaly might be explained by the existence of GH-secreting pituitary microadenomas or an ectopic pituitary adenoma, or more likely, by an ectopic secretion of GHRH, usually by a bronchial carcinoid tumor. Both of these explanations might apply in the case of a biochemical diagnosis of acromegaly and no tumor image in the pituitary gland MRI.

In addition to agreement for requesting a genetic study in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (S13), to rule out multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), there was also consensus to request a genetic study in patients with macroprolactinoma in a first-degree relative, in patients younger than 20 years, and in patients with evidence of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (S14, 15 and 16), which are practices not mentioned in guidelines. Acromegaly can be part of familial diseases other than MEN1. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene and mutations in the G-protein coupled receptor 101 (GPR101) gene predispose the appearance of young-onset pituitary adenomas. In addition, although the coexistence of acromegaly with paragangliomas or phaeochromocytomas might be coincidental, it could also have common genetic basis, as the recently named "3PAs" syndrome (paragangliomas, phaeochromocytomas and pituitary adenomas).

### Arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) with partial empty sella: a case report [^114Jigy6]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Diabetes insipidus is a rare presentation in patients with partial empty sella, despite the association of an empty sella with other pituitary hormone abnormalities. The neurohypophysis is protected from excessive injury compared to the anterior pituitary due to the specific anatomical difference between the anterior and posterior pituitary. In particular, the vascular supply in the neurohypophysis has an anastomotic ring along the infundibular process from the medial and lateral arteries of the inferior hypophyseal arteries. This may be the reason why posterior pituitary involvement is less common than anterior pituitary involvement.

There is limited literature on arginine vasopressin deficiency associated with empty sella. The first of these was published in 1973 and described a 43-year-old woman with diabetes insipidus and postpartum galactorrhoea. Marano et al. described a posterior empty sella in two children with central diabetes insipidus. In our patient, the patient's anterior pituitary hormone function tests were all normal. She presented as a case of posterior pituitary deficiency and empty sella. The association could be coincidental.

Lambert et al. have also described a similar case but with both anterior and posterior pituitary dysfunction. They hypothesized that an empty sella may be due to necrosis of a previous pituitary adenoma, most commonly a prolactinoma, but again in our patient, we did not suspect this from the clinical presentation as the prolactin level was normal and the involvement was exclusively posterior pituitary. The prevalence of empty sella ranges from 8 to 35%, with an increasing incidence due to the advancement and accessibility of various neuroimaging modalities. Our patient didn't have any clinical features that can suggest growth hormone deficiency, unlike other studies that have shown prominent growth hormone deficiency. Contrary to other studies, our patient presented with diabetes insipidus, which is a rare manifestation of empty sella (1.5%).

### Sheehan's syndrome presenting with panhypopituitarism and central diabetes insipidus: a case report [^1173ZMbL]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

The possible mechanism by which glucocorticoid replacement exacerbates DI is that glucocorticoids inhibit the synthesis of AVP in the hypothalamus through negative feedback. In return, hypocortisolism can result in elevated AVP levels and increased sensitivity to AVP. Therefore, in our case, hypocortisolism might have initially masked the clinical manifestations of AVP deficiency; however, once steroid replacement therapy was initiated, the deficiency in AVP became symptomatic.

As for the pathogenesis of neurohypophyseal damage, it is difficult to determine. During pregnancy, the pituitary gland is enlarged physiologically. Pituitary enlargement causes compression of the anterior hypophyseal artery, resulting in mild pituitary ischemia. Severe postpartum hemorrhage may lead to necrosis of the enlarged pituitary glands. Typically, Sheehan's syndrome presents initially as anterior pituitary hormonal dysfunction. Although most patients with Sheehan's syndrome had atrophy of the posterior pituitary lobe and hypothalamic nuclei, AVP deficiency manifested as DI is very rare and occurs when a large portion of the neurohypophysis is destroyed. However, it is still unclear whether DI is due to the posterior pituitary lobe damage or the insufficient hormone secretion by the hypothalamus.

Imaging study may offer an insight into such an issue. MRI imaging in our patient at the time of diagnosis revealed hemorrhage and necrosis of the pituitary gland, a distinct feature from previously reported ones. Originally, Sheehan's syndrome was described as ischemic necrosis pathologically in the anterior pituitary following postpartum shock or hemorrhage without any image characteristics mentioned. However, depending on the time interval of event and image taking, non-hemorrhagic pituitary apoplexy or empty sella have been the most common image finding in Sheehan's syndrome. There were only few reports like ours on early image findings after postpartum hemorrhage in Sheehan's syndrome. In a study measuring sella size and content in Sheehan's syndrome by high resolution computerized tomography with time interval from postpartum hemorrhage to scan varied from 0.5 to 22 years (mean 11 years), an empty sella of a relatively small size was reported to be a common radiological finding, and the content varies from pituitary stalk only (26/57), stalk and other pituitary tissues (20/57), and a sella of pure CSF density (11/57). The hemorrhage of pituitary gland initially in our case might be due to hemorrhagic infarction or bleeding tendency because of complicated DIC course.

### Cabergoline [^112m254x]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The prolactin-lowering efficacy of CABERGOLINE was demonstrated in 647 females with hyperprolactinemic disorders (including 55% microprolactinomas, 7% macroprolactinomas, 3% empty sella syndromes, and 3% idiopathic) in two randomized, double-blind, studies: one 4-week placebo-controlled dose-response study with an 12-month open-label extension (Study 1) and one 8-week active comparator study comparing CABERGOLINE and bromocriptine with 16-week open extension (Study 2).

Study 1: 4-Week Placebo-Controlled Dose-Response Study

Study 1 enrolled 188 non-pregnant, hyperprolactinemic females (these patients had a prolactin level > 20 ng/ml (the upper normal reference limit)) with the following hyperprolactinemic etiologies: macroprolactinoma (60%, n = 113), idiopathic (36%, n = 67) and another etiology (4%, n = 8). Patients had a mean age of 32 years (range, 16–46 years of age), 99% were White (n = 186), 0.5% were Asian (n = 1) and 0.5% were another race (n = 1). Patients were randomized one of the following five oral treatments given twice weekly for four weeks (for the CABERGOLINE groups, the first week the CABERGOLINE dosage was lower to reduce the risk of hypotensive reactions):

### Clinical characteristics of acromegalic patients with empty sella and their outcomes following transsphenoidal surgery [^114rCbwm]. Pituitary (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To analyze the clinical characteristics of acromegalic patients with empty sella (ES, herniation of the subarachnoid space within the sella turcica) and the impact of ES on transsphenoidal surgery in such patients.

Methods

Seventy-eight patients, newly diagnosed with acromegaly who underwent transsphenoidal surgery were included. ES was defined as the pituitary gland and adenoma occupying less than 50% of the sella turcica on midsagittal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.

Results

Twelve patients (15.4%), predominantly female (10 women, p = .047), had ES in preoperative MR imaging. ES patients had smaller mean tumor diameter (6.3 mm) than non-ES patients (11.2 mm, p = .001). In preoperative MR imaging, occult adenoma was found in three (25%) ES and three (4.5%) non-ES patients (p = .044). Intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage was more frequent in the ES patients than in the non-ES patients (58.3 vs. 25.8%, p = .024). This led to an increased rate of sellar floor reconstruction using abdominal fat and/or postoperative lumber drainage in the ES patients (ES: 41.7 vs. non-ES: 16.7%, p = .063). Endocrinological remission after surgery was more frequent in the non-ES patients (72.7%) than in the ES patients (58.3%) (p = .248).

Conclusions

Co-existence of acromegaly with ES is not rare, and is associated with occult adenoma, intra/postoperative CSF leakage, and a worse endocrinological outcome after transsphenoidal surgery; although, the underlying mechanism remains unclear.

### Symptomatic primary tethered optic chiasm: technical case report [^111A6qDK]. Operative Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Importance

Symptomatic tethering of the optic nerves and chiasm is a rare occurrence and has been reported following both surgical and medical treatment of pituitary adenoma. Here we present a case of primary optic chiasm tethering in a patient with empty sella syndrome.

Clinical Presentation

The patient was a 61-yr-old female who presented with progressively worsening bitemporal hemianopsia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain revealed an empty sella with herniation of the optic chiasm into the sella. The patient underwent an endoscopic, endonasal/trans-sphenoidal approach to the sella, where the optic chiasm was then detethered via lysis of arachnoid adhesions and ultimately buttressed with an abdominal fat graft. Postoperatively, the patient did well with subjective and objective improvements in her visual fields.

Conclusion

We report a rare case of primary tethered optic chiasm, which was successfully treated via an endoscopic, endonasal approach with abdominal fat graft harvest.

Surgical debulking is usually indicated in cases with confirmed compressive chiasmopathy and vision loss, cavernous sinus involvement, and pituitary apoplexy, as well as patients that are unable to tolerate or demonstrate no response to medical therapy. In addition, prolactinomas with significant cystic features accounting for more than 80% of tumour volume on MRI T2 sequences are unlikely to respond sufficiently to medical therapy alone, and are therefore directly treated by surgical resection. Previous studies have demonstrated that visual field improvement occurs in 79–95% of patients following pituitary adenoma resection, and visual acuity improvement occurs in 45–86% of cases. An earlier meta-analysis of 17,509 patients showed that 5-year post-operative recurrence rates ranged from 4% in somatotroph adenomas, 11% in corticotroph adenomas, 12% in non-functioning pituitary adenomas, and 18% in prolactinomas. Radiation therapy is usually administered for smaller tumours distant from the optic chiasm, or as adjunctive treatment in patients with incompletely resected tumours or post-operative recurrence.

Neuro-ophthalmic surveillance

Long-term neuro-ophthalmic surveillance for pituitary and parasellar lesions is desirable for detecting delayed visual loss, which may be the first sign of tumour recurrence. Visual acuity and colour vision testing, and automated static perimetry should ideally be performed within 2–3 months of surgical resection or radiotherapy. Long-term neuro-ophthalmic monitoring thereafter should ideally occur routinely at 3–12 monthly intervals, or sooner should subjective complaints of visual change be reported by the patient. Periodic neuroimaging studies are also warranted, although the timing might be dependent on the outcome of surgical debulking or radiotherapy response, and should be determined in consultation with the neurosurgeon and neuroradiologist.

Delayed vision loss following primary treatment can occur due to a variety of reasons. Chiasmal compression secondary to tumour recurrence or the expansion of fat packed within the sella turcica intra-operatively, and delayed radionecrosis may be detected on serial perimetry assessment. Traction of the chiasm due to adhesions, or descent and herniation in secondary empty sella syndrome can also lead to post-operative vision loss. MRI neuroimaging is required to differentiate between the possible causes of delayed vision loss and inform ongoing treatment decisions.

### Cushing syndrome due to ectopic ACTH secreting pheochromocytoma [^116hPT9P]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

In this case report, we present a case of a woman in her late 30s who presented with bilateral motor weakness, headache, hyperglycaemia and hypertension. Investigations revealed very high 24-hour urine cortisol of 90 524, ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone secreting pheochromocytoma, normal metanephrine levels and empty sella, which has never been reported. CT chest and abdomen revealed enlarged left adrenal gland with large necrotic mass 4.7×4.0cm most likely neoplastic lesion. The patient was cured after surgical removal of the left adrenal mass. Histological examination revealed 3.5×2.5×2cm mass consistent with pheochromocytoma. After surgery and a short stay in the intensive care unit, the patient started improving and both antihypertensive treatment and insulin injections were withdrawn.

### Treatment of empty sella associated with visual impairment: a systematic review of chiasmapexy techniques [^116Ahbt2]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Chiasmapexy is a poorly described surgical procedure adopted to correct the downward displacement of suprasellar visual system (SVS) into an empty sella (ES) causing visual worsening. The aim of our study is to define the indications for extradural and intradural chiasmapexy.

Methods

A systematic literature review has been performed on MEDLINE database (US National Library of Medicine), including only articles that depicted cases of surgically treated patients affected by ES and progressive delayed visual worsening. Moreover, we have reported three cases of secondary ES syndrome (SESS) with visual worsening treated in our Department with transsphenoidal (TS) microsurgical intradural approach. Finally, we have compared the results of extradural and intradural chiasmapexy described in literature.

Results

The etiology of visual impairment is different in primary and secondary ESS. In primary ESS (PESS) the only predisposing factor is a dehiscence of diaphragma sellae, and the anatomical distortion caused by displacement of optic chiasm or traction of pituitary stalk and infundibulum may determine a direct injury of neural fibers and ischemic damage of SVS. In PESS the mechanical elevation of SVS performed through extradural approach is sufficient to resolve the main pathologic mechanism. In SESS, arachnoidal adhesions play an important role in addition to downward herniation of SVS. Consequently, the surgical technique should provide elevation of SVS combined to intradural release of scar tissue and arachnoidal adhesions. In treatment of SESS, the intradural approaches result to be more effective, guaranteeing the best visual outcomes with the lowest complications rates.

Conclusions

The intradural chiasmapexy is indicated in treatment of SESS, instead the extradural approaches are suggested for surgical management of PESS.

### Diagnostic predicament of secondary adrenal insufficiency [^111dPRCw]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To propose an approach for the diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency (AI) by presentation of 2 clinical cases and review of the literature.

Methods

We describe 2 patients who were considered to have a normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis on the basis of an appropriate response to the high-dose (250 microg) cosyntropin stimulation test (HST), with use of a cutoff value of 20 microg/dL. Our first patient had undergone resection of a 4-cm pituitary tumor a few months previously, and the second patient had hyponatremia with empty sella syndrome. Both patients, however, had strong clinical evidence suggestive of secondary AI. On testing by the insulin tolerance test (ITT) in the first patient and the overnight metyrapone test (OMT) in the second patient, secondary AI was diagnosed. We reviewed the literature to compare the utility of the different tests for the diagnosis of secondary AI.

Results

An 8 AM serum cortisol value less than 5 microg/dL or above 13 microg/dL and a stimulated cortisol level less than 16 microg/dL on both the low-dose cosyntropin stimulation test (LST) and the HST as well as above 22 microg/dL on the LST and above 30 microg/dL on the HST can reliably predict the functional status of the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis in chronic secondary AI. Values between these cutoff points may necessitate further assessment with the OMT or ITT based on clinical suspicion.

Conclusion

We recommend a 3-step diagnostic approach, with the first 2 steps performed together-starting with the 8 AM basal cortisol determination in conjunction with either the LST (preferably) or the HST. In cases of an indeterminate response coupled with a strong clinical suspicion, the final step should be definitive testing with the OMT or ITT.

### Utility of neuroimaging in the management of chronic and acute headache [^116MYMmX]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Imaging plays an important role in identifying the cause of the much less common secondary headaches. Such headaches may be caused by a variety of pathologic conditions which can be categorized as intracranial and extracranial. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension imaging findings include "empty sella", orbital changes, and dural venous sinus narrowing. Intracranial hypotension (ICH) is frequently caused by CSF leaks. Imaging findings include loss of the CSF spaces, downward displacement of the brain, as well as dural thickening and enhancement. Severe cases of ICH may result in subdural hematomas. A variety of intracranial and skull base tumors may cause headaches due to dural involvement. Extracranial tumors and lesions that frequently present with headaches include a variety of sinonasal tumors as well as mucoceles. Neurovascular compression disorders causing headaches include trigeminal and glossopharyngeal neuralgia. Imaging findings include displacement and atrophy of the cranial nerve caused by an adjacent arterial or venous structure.

Lipoma (Fig. 17)

Fig. 17
Lipoma. Sagittal T1WI (a) shows a lipoma with high signal along the inferior surface of the hypothalamus. The signal on the lipoma is nulled on coronal fat-suppressed T2WI (b)

Benign fatty lesions resulting from a congenital malformation, often located at or near the midline. In the sellar region, they occur along the surface of the infundibulum, floor of the third ventricle, or adjacent to cranial nerves, and are usually discovered incidentally, unless they cause a mass effect. They may contain calcifications and/or traverse blood vessels. MRI signal is isointense to subcutaneous fat on all sequences, with fat suppressed images useful in distinguishing from haemorrhagic or proteinaceous lesions.

Empty sella (Fig. 18)

Fig. 18
Empty sella. Sagittal post-contrast T1WI with fat-suppression show an enlarged sella mostly filled with CSF. The enhancing flattened pituitary tissue is located along the floor of the sella

Common incidental finding involving the pituitary gland and sella, which can result from a weakened or fenestrated diaphragma sella allowing CSF pulsations to flatten the pituitary gland. They are associated with elevated intracranial pressure, a posteriorly placed optic chiasm, and are considered a normal variant or termed "primary empty sella turcica" in the absence of surgery, radiation therapy or medically treated intrasellar tumour. In children, the incidence of an empty sella is seen more often in boys and is more likely to be associated with clinical symptoms and endocrinopathies, particularly growth hormone or multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies. MRI findings include a thinned/flattened pituitary gland along the floor of the sella, with the infundibulum in its normal midline position. The flattened pituitary gland has normal MRI signal characteristics and contrast enhancement.

### Quantification of specific growth patterns and frequency of the empty sella phenomenon in growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas [^113M5orD]. European Journal of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess and quantify the prevalence and co-occurence of a sellar floor lowering and empty sella phenomenon in patients with GH (growth hormone)-secreting pituitary adenoma.

Methods

A total number of 159 acromegalic patients were included in this study, as well as two control groups (150 patients with non-GH-secreting adenomas and 50 patients without pituitary adenomas). Magnetic resonance images of all patients were evaluated for presence of an empty sella, downward and lateral tumor extension, and maximum superoinferior diameter of the mass. Additionally, these values were correlated with growth hormone and IGF-1 levels.

Results

The empty sella phenomenon was detected significantly more often in patients with a GH-secreting adenoma with a prevalence of 22% vs. 5.3% in non-GH-secreting adenomas (p < 0.001) or 8% in the healthy control group (p = .036). Moreover, GH-secreting adenomas presented with a significant rate of downward tumor extension (74.8% vs. 35.5%; p < 0.001), whose extent correlated inversely but weakly with the GH hormone level (r = - 0.17; p = .036). It was also found that a decreased superoinferior diameter and higher ratio of intrasellar to suprasellar extension are predictive quantitative values for the presence of a GH-secreting adenoma (area under curve, 0.712).

Conclusions

GH-secreting pituitary adenomas are frequently associated with an empty sella phenomenon. Moreover, GH-secreting adenomas are frequently accompanied by an enhanced, quantitatively measurable impression of the sellar floor. Hypothetically, this is caused by tumor-induced local bone remodeling processes.

### Hyponatremia due to adrenal insufficiency after a mamushi bite: a case report [^111airJq]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

In this case, the patient's condition was accompanied by primary empty sella, but there was no history of trauma, intracranial surgery, or radiotherapy, and the condition was judged to be primary empty sella. We concluded that the empty sella was present prior to the Mamushi bite. The etiology of a primary empty sella is not clearly understood, and various hypotheses have been proposed. The causes include a defect in the sellar diaphragm, increased intracranial pressure, and changes in the pituitary gland volume. Increased intracranial pressure is reportedly involved in the development of empty sella, and a mechanism in which the subarachnoid space fits into the sella turcica due to increased intracranial pressure against the background of a defective or hypoplastic sellar diaphragm has been postulated. In the present case, there were no signs of hypotension, hemorrhage, or DIC; however, the swelling of the pituitary gland and the increased intracranial pressure caused by the snake venom may have further increased the pressure on the pituitary gland, which was already pressurized within the sella turcica, leading to hypopituitarism. The pituitary gland is one of the most vascularized tissues in the human body, and as part of the mechanism of Sheehan's syndrome, which also causes hypopituitarism, a mechanism in which the pituitary gland, enlarged by pregnancy, presses on the superior pituitary artery has been postulated. Based on the above considerations, we hypothesize that the patient with empty sella was originally vulnerable to compression and ischemia.

### Role of pituitary dysfunction on cardiovascular risk in primary empty sella patients [^113FP9tf]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Primary empty sella (PES) is a frequent anatomical condition rarely causing pituitary dysfunction. We assessed cardiovascular risk in a cohort of PES patients referred to Endocrine Units.

Design

The study was performed in three Italian tertiary referral centres. We evaluated pituitary function and cardiovascular risk, on the basis of lipid and glucose metabolism parameters and of Framingham score (FS), in 94 consecutive patients with PES diagnosis and in 94 gender, age and BMI matched controls.

Patients

Pituitary function was normal in 30 patients (group A), whereas a single or multiple pituitary hormone deficiency was demonstrated in 64 (group B). Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) was diagnosed in 56, central hypothyroidism in 35, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in 32 and central hypoadrenalism in 24 cases.

Results

Framingham score was higher and glucose and lipid profile were worse in PES patients than in controls. Cardiovascular risk parameters were not different between group A and B. In group B, increased cardiovascular risk was associated with hypothyroidism and hypogonadism, but not with GHD. In group A, cardiovascular risk was higher and FT3 and FT4 levels were lower than in controls. Moreover, PES patients stratified for BMI showed a worse glucose and lipid profile and (in the overweight subgroup) higher FS than matched controls.

Conclusions

Primary empty sella patients show increased cardiovascular risk, regardless of BMI. A worse lipid and glucose profile and higher FS were associated with secondary hypothyroidism, even subclinical, as well as hypogonadism.

### Rapid spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak detected in the gastrointestinal tract [^1111RhAJ]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

There are many causes of cerebrospinal (CSF) leaks. Most cases are secondary to blunt trauma and iatrogenic trauma caused by postoperative sequelae. Occasionally, CSF leakage may occur from nontraumatic or "spontaneous" causes, such as benign intracranial hypertension and "empty sella syndrome". Mass effect due to an encephalocele or meningocele may also be seen. Radionuclide cisternography is a sensitive method of determining CSF leak when combined with intranasal cotton pledget placement and analysis. We present a spontaneous CSF fluid leak that was detected when scintigraphic activity appeared first in the gastrointestinal tract.

### CSF rhinorrhea associated with the empty-sella syndrome… [^115tsBkM]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The empty-sella syndrome consists of the abnormal extension into the sella turcica of an arachnoid diverticulum filled with CSF, which displaces and compresses the pituitary gland. Such a diverticulum can erode through the sellar floor and lead to CSF rhinorrhea through the sphenoidal sinus. Empty-sella syndrome should be considered a diagnostic possibility in patients with nontraumatic CSF rhinorrhea. Diagnosis and treatment are best accomplished with a team approach involving the otolaryngologist, neurosurgeon, neuroradiologist, and neuroendocrinologist. Definitive diagnosis requires pneumoencephalography and thin-section polytomography. Attention should be directed to the possibility of a coexisting pituitary adenoma. Treatment can be accomplished by a transseptal, transsphenoidal approach with localization and repair of the leak. Gray WC, Salcman M, Rao K, Leveque H. CSF Rhinorrhea Associated With the Empty-Sella Syndrome. Arch Otolaryngol.

### Empty sella syndrome… [^111wRj9f]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The usual course of untreated acromegaly is a gradual but progressive worsening of acral enlargement, arthritis, and cardiovascular disease that ultimately results in early death. 1 However, occasionally individuals with acromegaly will report the spontaneous remission of symptoms without therapy. 2, 3 Prior to the development of specific and sensitive radioimmunoassays for growth hormone, this clinical syndrome of "burned out acromegaly" was thought to reflect the spontaneous cessation of growth hormone secretion by a previously functioning tumor. However, with the advent of suitable hormone assays, it became apparent that such patients frequently continued to secrete large amounts of growth hormone, even though the clinical signs and symptoms of acromegaly had apparently diminished.

True spontaneous remission of the metabolic features of acromegaly, verified by appropriate measurements of growth hormone, has been reported in only six cases3–8 and the mechanisms involved are incompletely understood. For these reasons, it appeared pertinent to describe. Login I, Santen RJ. Empty Sella Syndrome: Sequela of the Spontaneous Remission of Acromegaly.

### Empty sella resulting from the spontaneous resolution of a pituitary macroadenoma… [^116gP1Kd]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Recent studies suggest that the infarction of a pituitary adenoma may be a frequent cause of an empty sella turcica. However, to date, evidence of such progression has been largely speculative. We present the case of a patient with a pituitary macroadenoma that underwent spontaneous involution resulting in an empty sella, as documented by serial magnetic resonance imaging scans. A brief review of the proposed causes of primary empty sella, with emphasis on pituitary necrosis, is provided. Robinson DB, Michaels RD.

### Visual loss in a patient with primary empty sella… [^116CBPkL]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — The empty sella is an acquired anatomic condition in which the subarachnoid space protrudes into the cavity of the sella turcica and the pituitary gland is flattened against the sellar floor or walls. Cases not associated with prior pituitary irradiation or surgery are termed primary. Although most patients with primary empty sella have normal vision, a sizable minority show some degree of visual compromise. We describe herein a case of primary empty sella associated with visual loss in which the clinical and radiographic findings suggest the mechanism responsible for damage to the visual pathways. Report of a Case. — A 38-year-old obese black woman stated that she experienced visual loss in both eyes two years previously. No further change in vision had been noted since then. On examination, her visual acuity was 20/30 OD and 20/40 OS. Both optic discs were pale. Visual fields showed a superotemporal defect. Pollock SC, Bromberg BS.

### Coexistent primary empty sella syndrome and hyperprolactinemia… [^115AENvv]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The series involved 11 women with concurrent hyperprolactinemia and primary empty sella syndrome. Eight had amenorrhea and six had galactorrhea. All 11 patients had intact hypothalamic-pituitary function, except for having elevated prolactin levels that ranged from 33 to 498 ng/mL. One patient had primary hypothyroidism. Radiologic investigations included sellar polytomography in eight cases, computed tomography of the head in eight cases, bilateral carotid angiography in six cases, and pneumoencephalography in three cases. Of eight patients undergoing transsphenoidal exploratory surgery, one had a pituitary microadenoma and an empty sella while seven had only an empty sella with a flattened pituitary gland. Conventional histologic methods and immunocytologic studies of the pituitary gland showed no abnormalities. The cause of this syndrome is unknown.

It should be recognized that hyperprolactinemia, with or without galactorrhea-amenorrhea, may occur in association with an empty sella in the absence of an associated pituitary tumor.
