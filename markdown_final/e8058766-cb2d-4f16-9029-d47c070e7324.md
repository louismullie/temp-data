## Question

Do we need to give bolts dose of levothyroxine before the drip in brain dead patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a bolus dose of levothyroxine (T4) should be given before starting a continuous infusion in brain-dead organ donors, and if so, what dose and rationale are appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of thyroid axis dysfunction after brain death and whether it justifies replacement. Then, I should verify what high-quality randomized trials say about intravenous levothyroxine in this population. Next, I will review consensus guidelines and common donor-management protocols for dosing patterns. After that, I need to check safety considerations, especially cardiac risks of bolus dosing. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, evidence-informed recommendation and note pediatric nuances and uncertainties where applicable.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic rationale. Brain death disrupts hypothalamic–pituitary function, leading to low T3 and variable T4/TSH patterns. Diabetes insipidus is common, and low T3 states may impair myocardial energy utilization, contributing to hemodynamic instability and catecholamine requirements, which provides a biologic rationale for thyroid hormone replacement in selected donors [^113kg8kU] [^112jjZmS] [^111my5tu].

> Wait, let me verify the highest-quality evidence before jumping to dosing specifics. The NEJM randomized trial in hemodynamically unstable brain-dead heart donors tested intravenous levothyroxine 30 micrograms per hour for at least 12 hours versus saline and found no significant increase in heart transplantation rates, although 30-day graft survival was noninferior; importantly, more severe hypertension and tachycardia occurred with levothyroxine, underscoring potential cardiovascular risk without proven benefit on the primary endpoint [^117K7fMt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from a single trial. I should review broader evidence. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials found no consistent hemodynamic benefit from thyroid hormone in brain-dead donors, and mechanistic human data show T3 can normalize gene expression without improving hemodynamics, reinforcing uncertainty about routine use; nonetheless, some observational and registry analyses suggest improved organ recovery with hormonal resuscitation bundles, though confounding is likely [^114EgH7C] [^112t6c3m] [^11274irV] [^115fKkNA].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to anchor practice. The Society of Critical Care Medicine/American College of Chest Physicians consensus notes that human data do not consistently show low thyroid hormone levels after brain death and advises that thyroid hormone may be considered for low ejection fraction or hemodynamic instability, but efficacy remains uncertain. The International Thoracic Transplant consensus similarly suggests thyroid hormone may be considered in unstable donors or those with reduced ejection fraction, again emphasizing uncertain efficacy [^111my5tu] [^1154KM8K].

> I will now examine common dosing patterns in donor protocols to see whether a bolus is standard. Multiple donor-management sources describe a T4 protocol with an intravenous bolus followed by infusion: for example, 20 micrograms IV bolus then 10 micrograms per hour infusion, or weight-based pediatric regimens with 1–5 micrograms/kg bolus followed by 0.8–1.4 micrograms/kg/hour infusion; these patterns reflect practice norms rather than randomized-trial mandates, and they are often embedded within multimodal hormone resuscitation including vasopressin and corticosteroids [^115ARN9g] [^116qrts5] [^113A8x5n].

> But wait, what about safety if a bolus is used. I need to ensure we account for cardiac risk. FDA labeling warns that excessive bolus dosing of IV levothyroxine, particularly more than 500 micrograms, is associated with arrhythmias, ischemia, and worsening heart failure, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease; given brain-dead donors often have catecholamine surges and myocardial strain, conservative dosing and close monitoring are prudent if a bolus is chosen [^111PFGa1] [^112MSYcE] [^116ruj4z].

> Let me synthesize this carefully. The highest-quality randomized evidence does not demonstrate a benefit of IV levothyroxine infusion on heart transplantation rates, so routine use is not mandated; however, many centers employ a bolus-then-infusion T4 strategy within a broader hormone-resuscitation bundle for hemodynamically unstable donors or those with low ejection fraction, acknowledging uncertain efficacy and potential cardiovascular risks. If a bolus is used, a modest 20 microgram IV dose followed by a continuous infusion of about 10 micrograms per hour is a commonly cited regimen, with pediatric weight-based adjustments as above; if instability persists, T3 may be considered in select cases, recognizing even less definitive evidence [^117K7fMt] [^115ARN9g] [^116qrts5] [^1154KM8K].

> I should double-check pediatric considerations. Retrospective pediatric data suggest T4 administration is associated with reduced vasopressor requirements, but this is not randomized and should be interpreted cautiously; if used, weight-based bolus and infusion regimens as outlined in pediatric donor protocols are reasonable, with careful hemodynamic monitoring for hypertensive or arrhythmic complications [^112n4vHW] [^116qrts5].

> Final answer: No, a bolus is not strictly required before a levothyroxine infusion in brain-dead donors. However, many centers administer a small IV bolus such as 20 micrograms followed by a continuous infusion of about 10 micrograms per hour as part of a hormone-resuscitation strategy for hemodynamically unstable donors or those with reduced ejection fraction, recognizing that randomized data have not proven benefit and that bolus dosing carries potential cardiac risks, so decisions should be individualized and guided by local protocol and donor stability [^117K7fMt] [^115ARN9g] [^1154KM8K] [^111PFGa1].

Routine levothyroxine bolus dosing is **not recommended** for brain-dead patients because it does not improve hemodynamic stability or organ yield and may cause harm [^117K7fMt] [^114EgH7C]. If thyroid hormone is used, start a **continuous infusion** at 10–20 mcg/hour and titrate to effect, with bolus dosing reserved for refractory instability and only with close monitoring for arrhythmias and hypertension [^115ARN9g] [^111PFGa1]. Always give glucocorticoids before levothyroxine to prevent adrenal crisis, and monitor for adverse effects throughout [^111PFGa1] [^111DiNmx].

---

## Physiological rationale for levothyroxine administration

Brain death causes **pituitary failure**, including central hypothyroidism, which contributes to hemodynamic instability and reduced organ perfusion [^112jjZmS]. Thyroid hormone replacement aims to improve cardiovascular function and organ viability, but the evidence for benefit is mixed [^114EgH7C].

---

## Evidence for levothyroxine bolus dosing

- **RCT evidence**: A large RCT found IV levothyroxine 30 mcg/hour did not increase heart transplantation rates or reduce vasopressor needs, and caused more hypertension and tachycardia than placebo [^117K7fMt].

- **Meta-analysis**: Systematic review of RCTs shows no consistent hemodynamic benefit from thyroid hormone in brain-dead donors [^114EgH7C].

- **Observational data**: Some studies suggest higher organ yield with early thyroid hormone, but these are confounded and not definitive [^117JnSL7] [^115fKkNA].

---

## Risks associated with bolus dosing

- **Cardiac complications**: Excessive bolus dosing (> 500 mcg) can cause arrhythmias, ischemia, and worsening heart failure, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease [^111PFGa1] [^112MSYcE].

- **Hypertension and tachycardia**: Bolus dosing increases the risk of severe hypertension and tachycardia, complicating hemodynamic management [^117K7fMt].

- **Adrenal crisis**: Starting levothyroxine without glucocorticoids can precipitate adrenal crisis due to increased cortisol clearance [^111PFGa1] [^111DiNmx].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus **do not recommend routine bolus dosing** of levothyroxine in brain-dead patients. If thyroid hormone is used, a continuous infusion is preferred, with bolus dosing reserved for refractory cases and only with close monitoring [^116qrts5] [^112MSYcE].

---

## Alternative approaches: continuous infusion

Continuous infusion is the **preferred method** for levothyroxine administration in brain-dead patients, with typical dosing of 10–20 mcg/hour, titrated to hemodynamic response and adverse effects [^115ARN9g]. This approach avoids rapid hormonal fluctuations and reduces the risk of cardiovascular complications.

---

## Clinical scenarios where bolus dosing may be considered

Bolus dosing may be considered only in **refractory hemodynamic instability** despite aggressive vasopressor and inotropic support, and even then only with close hemodynamic monitoring and only after glucocorticoids have been administered [^111PFGa1] [^111DiNmx].

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

- **Hemodynamic monitoring**: Continuous arterial and central venous pressure monitoring is essential during levothyroxine administration [^notfound].

- **Laboratory monitoring**: Regular assessment of thyroid function tests and electrolytes is recommended [^1179LeJB] [^113RyVXS].

- **Adverse effects**: Watch for arrhythmias, hypertension, and signs of adrenal insufficiency [^111PFGa1] [^111DiNmx].

## Summary of evidence

| **Evidence type** | **Findings regarding bolus dosing** |
|-|-|
| Randomized controlled trials | No benefit; increased hypertension and tachycardia [^117K7fMt] |
| Systematic reviews | No consistent hemodynamic benefit [^114EgH7C] |
| Observational studies | Mixed results; confounded by other interventions [^117JnSL7] [^115fKkNA] |
| Clinical guidelines | Do not recommend routine bolus dosing [^notfound] |

---

Routine levothyroxine bolus dosing is **not recommended** for brain-dead patients due to lack of benefit and potential harm. If thyroid hormone is used, a continuous infusion is preferred, with bolus dosing reserved for refractory cases and only with close monitoring [^117K7fMt] [^114EgH7C] [^116qrts5] [^111PFGa1].

A 62-year-old man was found to have bradycardia, hypothermia and respiratory failure 3 weeks after initiation of amiodarone therapy for atrial fibrillation. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was found to be 168 μIU/mL (nl. 0.3–5 μIU/mL) and free thyroxine (FT4) was < 0.2 ng/dL (nl. 0.8–1.8 ng/dL). He received intravenous fluids, vasopressor therapy and stress dose steroids; he was intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit. He received 500 μg of intravenous levothyroxine in the first 18 h of therapy, and 150 µg intravenous daily thereafter. Haemodynamic improvement, along with complete recovery of mental status, occurred after 48 h. Twelve hours after the initiation of therapy, FT4 was 0.96 ng/dL. The patient was maintained on levothyroxine 175 (g POorally daily. A thyroid ultrasound showed diffuse heterogeneity. The 24 hour excretion of iodine was 3657 (mcg (25–756 (mcg). The only two cases of amiodarone-induced myxoedema coma in the literature report patient death despite supportive therapy and thyroid hormone replacement. This case represents the most thoroughly investigated case of amiodarone-induced myxoedema coma with a history significant for subclinical thyroid disease.

A 2019 position statement noted that neuroendocrine function can persist in patients with permanent injury to the brain and "is not inconsistent with the whole brain standard of death". Clinicians may initiate a BD/DNC evaluation and determine a patient BD/DNC despite evidence of neuroendocrine function (Level B).

### Interest of low-dose hydrocortisone therapy during brain-dead organ donor resuscitation: the CORTICOME study [^112htCPy]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Study design

Administration of replacement dose of hydrocortisone had to be started at a maximum 6 h after the diagnosis of brain death. Adrenal stimulation by adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) (250 μg injection of tetracosactrin, Synacthen R; Novartis Pharma SAS, Rueil Malmaison, France) was investigated. Adrenal insufficiency was defined by plasma cortisol level inferior to 18 μg/dl at time of injection (zero minutes, T0) and/or by a variation of plasma cortisol level following ACTH injection (T60 to T0) inferior to 9 μg/dl (so-called non-responding patients). After ACTH injection, when plasma cortisol level was superior to 9 μg/dl, patients were classed as responding. Patient then received a 50-mg injection of hydrocortisone (Roussel-Uclaf, Romainville, France) followed by a continuous infusion of 10 mg/h until the aortic clamping was performed in the operating room during organ retrieval. Plasma cortisol assays were done before ACTH injection (T0) and 60 minutes after injection (T60) by electrogenerated chemiluminescence (Roche automat modular). In the control group (patients did not receive hydrocortisone), the physician in charge of the patient decided whether or not to perform the ACTH test.

### Levothyroxine therapy before brain death declaration increases the number of solid organ donations [^117JnSL7]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Protocols call for the start of hormonal therapy with levothyroxine after the declaration of brain death. As the hormonal perturbations occur during the process of brain death, the role of the early initiation of levothyroxine therapy (LT) to salvage organs is not well defined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of early LT (before the declaration of brain death) on the number of solid organs procured per donor.

Methods

We performed an 8-year retrospective analysis of all trauma patients who progressed to brain death. Patients who consented for organ donation, received LT, and donated solid organs were included. Patients were dichotomized into two groups: early LT group, patients who received LT before the declaration of brain death, and late LT group, those who received LT after brain death. The two groups were compared for differences in demographics, clinical characteristics, need for vasopressor, and number of solid organ donation.

Results

A total of 100 solid organ donors were identified of which, 41% (n = 77) donors who received LT therapy were included. LT before the declaration of brain death was initiated in 37 patients compared with 40 patients who had it started after the declaration of brain death. There was no difference in demographics between the two groups except that patients in the early LT group were more likely to be hypotensive on presentation (54% vs. 25%, p = 0.001). Early LT therapy was associated with an increase in solid organ procurement rate (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.4–2.7; p = 0.01). Sixty-seven patients donated a total of 291 solid organs.

Conclusion

The early use of LT and aggressive blood product resuscitation was associated with a significantly higher number of solid organs donated per donor. Earlier use of LT before the declaration of brain death may be considered in potential organ donors.

### Levothyroxine sodium (unithroid) [^112AQ4XB]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The initial dose of UNITHROID varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)].

In children in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue UNITHROID for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum T4 and TSH levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted.

Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)]

Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate UNITHROID therapy immediately upon diagnosis. Levothyroxine is generally continued for life in these patients.

Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of UNITHROID therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling.

Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature.

Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients

Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature.

Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate UNITHROID at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with levothyroxine overtreatment in the elderly.

### Organ donation in the surgical ICU: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^111MRhXv]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Medical management of the potential donor

What specific interventions are considered best practices in the optimization of the patient as a potential donor prior to brain death?

Recommendation

Patients with devastating brain injury (DBI) should be managed with an initial period of aggressive resuscitation and full support with the goal of physiological stability. Therapies that support hemodynamic stability, end-organ perfusion, and euvolemia will both benefit the patient and preserve the potential of organ donation. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in DBI includes thyroid hormone, corticosteroids, insulin, vasopressin, or a combination thereof, with early HRT requiring more study.

Discussion

There are extensive guidelines for the management of identified and confirmed organ donors, but it is less clear-cut which of these management strategies should be applied to patients who have not yet formally transitioned to the donation process. A reasonable approach may incorporate donor-specific management strategies that also support the clinical goals of resuscitation and stabilization.

A fundamental strategy in caring for patients with DBI who are potential donors is to avoid de-escalating care prematurely. Unless there is clear guidance from the LAR or advanced directives which limit further therapies, or inadequate medical resources, patients with DBI should be aggressively resuscitated to optimize perfusion and normalize as many physiological parameters as possible. This strategy enables improved neuroprognostication, allows time for the LAR to engage in decision making, and may also provide the necessary conditions for formal brain death examination. Together, these strategies help preserve the option of donation.

Intensive care unit hypothyroidism considerations — dopamine and dobutamine may lower serum TSH, LT4 may need to be given intravenously due to malabsorption from proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or specialized tube feedings, and if using intravenous LT4 the equivalent intravenous dose is approximately 75%; the possibility of adrenal insufficiency must also be considered since treatment of hypothyroidism might accelerate cortisol metabolism, and there are case reports of adrenal insufficiency unmasked by thyroid hormone.

### Increased procurement of thoracic donor organs after thyroid hormone therapy [^11274irV]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Hormonal therapy to the brain-dead organ donor can include thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine [T3] or levothyroxine [T4]), antidiuretic hormone, corticosteroids, or insulin. There has been a controversy on whether thyroid hormone enables more organs to be procured. Data on 63,593 donors of hearts and lungs (2000–2009) were retrospectively reviewed. Documentation on T3/T4 was available in all donors (study 1), and in 40,124 details of all 4 hormones were recorded (study 2). In this cohort, group A (23,022) received T3/T4 and group B (17,102) no T3/T4. Univariate analyses and multiple regressions were performed. Posttransplant graft and recipient survival at 1 and 12 months were compared. In study 1, 30,962 donors received T3/T4, with 36.59% providing a heart and 20.05% providing 1 or both lungs. Of the 32,631 donors who did not receive T3/T4, only 29.62% provided a heart and 14.61% provided lungs, an increase of 6.97% hearts and 5.44% lungs from T3/T4-treated donors (both P < 0.0001). In study 2, 34.99% of group A provided a heart and 20.99% provided lungs. In group B only 25.76% provided a heart and 15.09% provided lungs, an increase of 9.23% (hearts) and 5.90% (lungs), respectively, in group A (both P < 0.0001). The results of multiple regression analyses indicated a beneficial effect of T3/T4 on heart (P < 0.0001) and lung (P < 0.0001) procurement independent of other factors. T3/T4 therapy to the donor was associated with either improved posttransplant graft and recipient survival or no difference in survival. T3/T4 therapy results in more transplantable hearts and lungs, with no detriment to posttransplant graft or recipient survival.

### Interest of low-dose hydrocortisone therapy during brain-dead organ donor resuscitation: the CORTICOME study [^111bWGW7]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Circulatory failure during brain death organ donor resuscitation is a problem that compromises recovery of organs. Combined administration of steroid, thyroxine and vasopressin has been proposed to optimize the management of brain deceased donors before recovery of organs. However the single administration of hydrocortisone has not been rigorously evaluated in any trial.

Methods

In this prospective multicenter cluster study, 259 subjects were included. Administration of low-dose steroids composed the steroid group (n = 102).

Results

Although there were more patients in the steroid group who received norepinephrine before brain death (80% vs. 66%: P = 0.03), mean dose of vasopressor administered after brain death was significantly lower than in the control group (1.18 ± 0.92 mg/H vs. 1.49 ± 1.29 mg/H: P = 0.03), duration of vasopressor support use was shorter (874 min vs. 1160 min: P < 0.0001) and norepinephrine weaning before aortic clamping was more frequent (33.8% vs. 9.5%: P < 0.0001). Using a survival approach, probability of norepinephrine weaning was significantly different between the two groups (P < 0.0001) with a probability of weaning 4.67 times higher in the steroid group than in the control group (95% CI: 2.30–9.49).

Conclusions

Despite no observed benefits of the steroid administration on primary function recovery of transplanted grafts, administration of glucocorticoids should be a part of the resuscitation management of deceased donors with hemodynamic instability.

### Intravenous levothyroxine for unstable brain-dead heart donors [^117K7fMt]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Hemodynamic instability and myocardial dysfunction are major factors preventing the transplantation of hearts from organ donors after brain death. Intravenous levothyroxine is widely used in donor care, on the basis of observational data suggesting that more organs may be transplanted from donors who receive hormonal supplementation.

Methods

In this trial involving 15 organ-procurement organizations in the United States, we randomly assigned hemodynamically unstable potential heart donors within 24 hours after declaration of death according to neurologic criteria to open-label infusion of intravenous levothyroxine (30 μg per hour for a minimum of 12 hours) or saline placebo. The primary outcome was transplantation of the donor heart; graft survival at 30 days after transplantation was a prespecified recipient safety outcome. Secondary outcomes included weaning from vasopressor therapy, donor ejection fraction, and number of organs transplanted per donor.

Results

Of the 852 brain-dead donors who underwent randomization, 838 were included in the primary analysis: 419 in the levothyroxine group and 419 in the saline group. Hearts were transplanted from 230 donors (54.9%) in the levothyroxine group and 223 (53.2%) in the saline group (adjusted risk ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97 to 1.07; P = 0.57). Graft survival at 30 days occurred in 224 hearts (97.4%) transplanted from donors assigned to receive levothyroxine and 213 hearts (95.5%) transplanted from donors assigned to receive saline (difference, 1.9 percentage points; 95% CI, -2.3 to 6.0; P < 0.001 for noninferiority at a margin of 6 percentage points). There were no substantial between-group differences in weaning from vasopressor therapy, ejection fraction on echocardiography, or organs transplanted per donor, but more cases of severe hypertension and tachycardia occurred in the levothyroxine group than in the saline group.

Conclusions

In hemodynamically unstable brain-dead potential heart donors, intravenous levothyroxine infusion did not result in significantly more hearts being transplanted than saline infusion. (Funded by Mid-America Transplant and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04415658.).

Levothyroxine dosing frequency and adherence — once-weekly and twice-weekly regimens: A randomized cross-over trial of once weekly oral administration of 7 times the usual daily levothyroxine (LT4) dose versus daily dosing found weekly therapy produced supratherapeutic T4 for about 24 hours while T3 remained within the reference range, and over 6 weeks other biochemical and clinical markers, including patient symptoms, did not differ from daily therapy. A second similar 6-week cross-over trial showed greater increases in T4 after weekly dosing than daily dosing without symptoms or echocardiographic evidence of hyperthyroidism. For patients in whom daily LT4 intake is unsuccessful, options include observed therapy or reducing the frequency of LT4 ingestion to twice weekly or weekly with a starting dose equal to the weight‑adjusted daily regimen (i.e., 7 times the daily dose); parenteral LT4 is also possible, although no trials were identified.

OVERDOSAGE

The signs and symptoms of overdosage are those of hyperthyroidism (see PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS). In addition, confusion and disorientation may occur. Cerebral embolism, shock, coma, and death have been reported. Seizures have occurred in a child ingesting 18 mg of levothyroxine. Symptoms may not necessarily be evident or may not appear until several days after ingestion of levothyroxine sodium.

Treatment of Overdosage

Levothyroxine sodium should be reduced in dose or temporarily discontinued if signs or symptoms of overdosage occur.

Acute Massive Overdosage

This may be a life-threatening emergency, therefore, symptomatic and supportive therapy should be instituted immediately. If not contraindicated (e.g., by seizures, coma, or loss of the gag reflex), the stomach should be emptied by emesis or gastric lavage to decrease gastrointestinal absorption. Activated charcoal or cholestyramine may also be used to decrease absorption. Central and peripheral increased sympathetic activity may be treated by administering β-receptor antagonists, e.g., propranolol, provided there are no medical contraindications to their use. Provide respiratory support as needed; control congestive heart failure and arrhythmia; control fever, hypoglycemia, and fluid loss as necessary. Large doses of antithyroid drugs (e.g., methimazole or propylthiouracil) followed in one to two hours by large doses of iodine may be given to inhibit synthesis and release of thyroid hormones. Glucocorticoids may be given to inhibit the conversion of T4to T3. Plasmapheresis, charcoal hemoperfusion and exchange transfusion have been reserved for cases in which continued clinical deterioration occurs despite conventional therapy. Because T4is highly protein bound, very little drug will be removed by dialysis.

10 OVERDOSAGE

In general, the signs and symptoms of overdosage with levothyroxine are those of hyperthyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions (5) and Adverse Reactions (6)]. In addition, confusion and disorientation may occur. Cerebral embolism, shock, coma, and death have been reported. Excessive doses of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection (greater than 500 mcg) are associated with cardiac complications in patients with underlying cardiac disease.

Treatment of Overdosage

Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection should be reduced in dose or temporarily discontinued if signs or symptoms of overdosage occur. To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose, a good resource is the certified Regional Poison Control Center. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in the patient.

In the event of an overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated as dictated by the patient's medical status.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1 Risk of Cardiac Complications in Elderly and in Patients with Cardiovascular Disease

Excessive bolus dosing of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection (greater than 500 mcg) are associated with cardiac complications, particularly in the elderly and in patients with an underlying cardiac condition. Adverse events that can potentially be related to the administration of large doses of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection include arrhythmias, tachycardia, myocardial ischemia and infarction, or worsening of congestive heart failure and death. Cautious use, including doses in the lower end of the recommended range, may be warranted in these populations. Close observation of the patient following the administration of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection is advised.

5.2 Need for Concomitant Glucocorticoids and Monitoring for Other Diseases in Patients with Endocrine Disorders

Occasionally, chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, which can lead to myxedema coma, may occur in association with other autoimmune disorders such as adrenal insufficiency, pernicious anemia, and insulin–dependent diabetes mellitus. Patients should be treated with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of treatment with Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection, until adrenal function has been adequately assessed. Failure to do so may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis when thyroid hormone therapy is initiated, due to increased metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids by thyroid hormone. With initiation of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection, patients with myxedema coma should also be monitored for previously undiagnosed diabetes insipidus.

### Organ donation in the surgical ICU: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^115ARN9g]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

The specific element of donor management most frequently employed in patients with DBI prior to brain death is HRT. This includes thyroid hormone, corticosteroids, insulin, and arginine vasopressin, or a combination thereof. The data supporting these therapies are mixed and the physiology is not clearly elucidated, yet studies suggest that the use of HRT in donors may promote hemodynamic stability, improve organ recovery rates and improve graft function and survival. A few studies have strongly suggested that early HRT (prior to brain death) improves subsequent organ recovery and function. However, randomized trials are lacking, and there are no prospective studies or formal guidelines showing the proven benefit of early HRT.

Insulin for strict glucose control is standard in critical care, and vasopressin is a reasonable choice for a brain-injured patient in need of hemodynamic support, with or without diabetes insipidus. The use of thyroid hormone is recommended in donor management guidelines for donors who have persistent hemodynamic dysfunction or a reduced ejection fraction, and is often used more liberally as some data support a positive effect on donor stability and graft function and survival. Given the pathophysiology of herniation-mediated hemodynamic instability, thyroid hormone treatment in patients who are not yet brain dead has been suggested to promote hemodynamic stability, decrease the negative effects of high-dose vasopressors, and help avoid cardiovascular collapse. The direct effect on disease-specific pathophysiology, the low-risk profile, and the likely clinical benefit makes thyroid hormone therapy reasonable to use in patients with DBI even outside the auspices of donor management. Dosing regimens vary, but a common example for dosage of thyroid hormone is as follows: T4 20 µg intravenous bolus, followed by a 10 µg/hour intravenous infusion or T3 4 µg intravenous bolus, followed by a 3 µg/hour intravenous infusion.

Corticosteroids, however, have been associated with worse outcomes in patients who had severe TBI; therefore, their routine use in patients who are not brain dead is controversial. For those donors who are already brain dead, however, corticosteroids can be used with dosing regimens including intravenous methylprednisolone 1000 mg or intravenous methylprednisolone 15 mg/kg, or methylprednisolone 250 mg intravenous bolus, followed by a 100 mg/hour intravenous infusion.

Other donor-specific management strategies intended to improve donation potential or outcomes, such as invasive monitoring or renal replacement therapy, are best approached in context of the patient's overall goals of care.

Regarding medical management for congenital hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to levothyroxine, dosing and administration, Endo-ERN 2021 guidelines recommend to initiate levothyroxine at the highest starting dose (10–15 mcg/kg/day) in infants with severe CH, defined by a very low pretreatment serum fT4 (< 5 pmol/L) or total thyroxine concentration in combination with elevated TSH (above the normal range based on time since birth and gestational age).

### One life ends, another begins: management of a brain-dead pregnant mother – A systematic review- [^1127aFBt]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Endocrine support

Seventy-eight percent of brain-dead patients who were kept alive for more than a few days developed central diabetes insipidus (DI) resulting from posterior pituitary gland failure. Administration of vasopressin and aggressive volume replacement should be performed for the treatment of DI. Howlett et al. reported a decrease in serum triiodothyronine (T3) in 81% and in serum thyroxin (T4) in 29% of BD dead organ donors. Therefore, especially in brain-dead pregnant women T3/T4 substitution should be adjusted according to laboratory examinations. Adrenal insufficiency causes hypotension and should be treated with methylprednisolone. To avoid prolonged exposure of the fetus to glucocorticoids during maternal somatic support, prednisone or methylprednisone should be used, as they do not readily cross the placenta. Furthermore, since hyperglycemia is also observed during BD as a result of stress-related peripheral insulin resistance, insulin substitution may be needed to achieve normoglycemia.

Thermoregulation

According to Smith et al. the majority of brain-dead patients develop hypothermia. It is recommended that the patient be rewarmed passively using warming blankets or by warming of fluids. Following infections, brain-dead patients might also develop hyperthermia. In general, the inability to maintain body temperature and poikilothermia (body temperature that is dependent on the environment's temperature) accompany brain-dead patients.

Pediatric hormonal resuscitation dosing (Table 6) — intravenous agents and targets: Desmopressin 0.5 μg/hr IV has a half-life 75–90 min and is titrated to decrease urine output to 3–4 mL/kg/hr, and may be beneficial in patients with an ongoing coagulopathy. Arginine vasopressin 0.5 mU/kg/hr IV has a half-life 10–20 min and is titrated to decrease urine output to 3–4 mL/kg/hr; hypertension can occur. Thyroxine (T4) 0.8–1.4 μg/kg/hr IV allows a bolus dose 1–5 μg/kg to be administered, and infants and smaller children require a larger bolus and infusion dose. Triiodothyronine (T3) 0.05–0.2 μg/kg/hr IV has a dose that may be repeated in 8–12 hr. Methylprednisolone 20–30 mg/kg IV lists fluid retention and glucose intolerance. Insulin 0.05–0.1 U/kg/hr IV is titrated to control blood glucose to 60–150 mg/dL and requires monitoring for hypoglycemia. Treatment of diabetes insipidus should consist of pharmacologic management to decrease but not completely stop urine output, and replacement of urine output with 0.25% or 0.5% normal saline should be used in conjunction with pharmacologic agents to maintain serum sodium levels between 130 and 150 mEq/L. Hormone replacement therapy should be considered early in the course of donor management, and its use may allow weaning of inotropic support and assist with metabolic stability for the pediatric donor.

### Thyroid, porcine (Armour thyroid) [^115izptt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The dosage of thyroid hormones is determined by the indication and must in every case be individualized according to patient response and laboratory findings.

Biotin supplementation may interfere with immunoassays for TSH, T4, and T3, resulting in erroneous thyroid hormone test results. Inquire whether patients are taking biotin or biotin-containing supplements. If so, advise them to stop biotin supplementation at least 2 days before assessing TSH and/or T4 levels (see PRECAUTIONS).

Thyroid hormones are given orally. In acute, emergency conditions, injectable levothyroxine sodium (T4) may be given intravenously when oral administration is not feasible or desirable, as in the treatment of myxedema coma, or during total parenteral nutrition. Intramuscular administration is not advisable because of reported poor absorption.

Hypothyroidism —

Therapy is usually instituted using low doses, with increments which depend on the cardiovascular status of the patient. The usual starting dose is 30 mg Armour Thyroid (thyroid tablets, USP), with increments of 15 mg every 2 to 3 weeks. A lower starting dosage, 15 mg/day, is recommended in patients with long-standing myxedema, particularly if cardiovascular impairment is suspected, in which case extreme caution is recommended. The appearance of angina is an indication for a reduction in dosage. Most patients require 60 to 120 mg/day. Failure to respond to doses of 180 mg suggests lack of compliance or malabsorption. Maintenance dosages 60 to 120 mg/day usually result in normal serum T4 and T3 levels. Adequate therapy usually results in normal TSH and T4 levels after 2 to 3 weeks of therapy.

Readjustment of thyroid hormone dosage should be made within the first four weeks of therapy, after proper clinical and laboratory evaluations, including serum levels of T4, bound and free, and TSH.

Liothyronine (T3) may be used in preference to levothyroxine (T4) during radio-isotope scanning procedures, since induction of hypothyroidism in those cases is more abrupt and can be of shorter duration. It may also be preferred when impairment of peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) and liothyronine (T3) is suspected.

### Interest of low-dose hydrocortisone therapy during brain-dead organ donor resuscitation: the CORTICOME study [^116pEMeS]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Although in our study, adrenal insufficiency frequency (77.6%) was similar to the results of both studies cited above, no significant difference was noted in the frequency of vasopressor weaning of brain-dead patients compared to plasma cortisol level at baseline or to initial response to ACTH stimulation. Our results did not confirm those of Nicolas-Robin et al. who suggested that steroid administration would be more beneficial in patients with documented adrenal insufficiency. However our results are consistent with other studies conducted in different settings, such as in septic shock, showing that the ACTH stimulation test had no predictive value for hemodynamic response of patients receiving corticosteroids.

Several reports suggest that multimodal hormonal therapy (thyroid hormone, corticosteroids and arginine vasopressin) might have beneficial effects on recovery of organs, with an increased amount of procured grafts and less primary dysfunction in transplanted heart grafts; however, the respective contribution of each hormonal therapy remains controversial. Thyroid hormone administration by itself has been considered either to be beneficial, neutral or to have no significant impact on organ procurement. In our study, no significant difference was noted in the number of recovered organs per donor in either group. The number of recovered organs compared to the number of organs considered for procurement was slightly higher in the steroid group than in the control group, but the difference was not significant. DGF frequency was similar in both groups regardless of the grafted organ. Kidney grafts were the only exception with primary dysfunction significantly more frequent in the steroid group. Despite the benefits of a replacement dose of hydrocortisone on vasopressor consumption, our study did not demonstrate any benefits of steroid administration for primary function recovery of transplanted grafts. Some studies have either shown the absence of clinical impact of a replacement dose of hydrocortisone on primary function recovery of kidney, liver, heart and lung grafts; for those grafts, only a decrease in systemic inflammatory markers and their expression in tissue, and a decrease of extravascular lung water accumulation were beneficial for primary graft recovery.

Our study has several limitations: lack of randomization of brain-dead patients, cluster distribution of recruited patients, lack of data about receivers' history, and comorbidities of receivers and their consequences for DGF. This might have limited our capacity to identify some potential beneficial effects of steroid administration during brain-dead donor resuscitation and we expect that practitioners would not change their usual practice in brain-dead donor resuscitation.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The initial dose of LEVO-T varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)].

In children in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue LEVO-T administration for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum T4 and TSH levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessment to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted.

Congenital Hypothyroidism [See Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)]

Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate LEVO-T therapy immediately upon diagnosis. Levothyroxine is generally continued for life in these patients.

Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of LEVO-T therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling.

Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature.

Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients

Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature.

Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate LEVO-T at less than the full replacement dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with levothyroxine overtreatment in the elderly.

Levothyroxine (T4) and liothyronine (T3) may be administered via a nasogastric tube but the preferred route of administration of both hormones is intravenous. Levothyroxine sodium (T4) is given at a starting dose of 400 mcg (100 mcg/mL) given rapidly, and is usually well tolerated, even in the elderly. This initial dose is followed by daily supplements of 100 to 200 mcg given IV. Normal T4 levels are achieved in 24 hours followed in 3 days by threefold elevation of T3. Oral therapy with thyroid hormone would be resumed as soon as the clinical situation has been stabilized and the patient is able to take oral medication.

### Coma as the sole initial manifestation of levothyroxine intoxication: a case report [^114z94HN]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Levothyroxine overdose rarely causes severe symptoms in adults. We present an unusual case of isolated coma after massive levothyroxine ingestion.

Case Report

A 33-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department comatose (Glasgow Coma Scale score 3/15) but hemodynamically stable. Computed tomography of the brain was normal. History revealed ingestion of 10.5 mg levothyroxine 2 h prior in a suicide attempt. Gastric lavage and activated charcoal were administered. The patient was intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Treatment included cholestyramine for enhanced thyroxine elimination. Thyroid function tests showed elevated free T4 and T3 with initially normal, but later suppressed, thyroid-stimulating hormone. The patient developed fever at 20 h, attributed to aspiration pneumonia rather than thyroid storm. She regained consciousness and was extubated at 28 h. Total ICU stay was 72 h. She was discharged after 10 days, with no complications. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? This case is notable for isolated coma without typical thyrotoxicosis symptoms, in spite of massive levothyroxine ingestion. Although altered mental status has been reported in levothyroxine overdose, coma as the sole presenting symptom is extremely rare. Emergency physicians should consider levothyroxine toxicity in cases of unexplained coma, even without other thyrotoxicosis signs. Prompt supportive care and gastrointestinal decontamination can lead to favorable outcomes in severe overdose.

### Thyroid (Armour thyroid) [^111cnF5B]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Myxedema Coma — Myxedema coma is usually precipitated in the hypothyroid patient of long-standing by intercurrent illness or drugs such as sedatives and anesthetics and should be considered a medical emergency. Therapy should be directed at the correction of electrolyte disturbances and possible infection besides the administration of thyroid hormones. Corticosteroids should be administered routinely.

Oral therapy with thyroid hormone would be resumed as soon as the clinical situation has been stabilized and the patient is able to take oral medication.

Thyroid Cancer — Exogenous thyroid hormone may produce regression of metastases from follicular and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid and is used as ancillary therapy of these conditions with radioactive iodine. TSH should be suppressed to low or undetectable levels. Therefore, larger amounts of thyroid hormone than those used for replacement therapy are required. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is usually unresponsive to this therapy.

Thyroid Suppression Therapy — Administration of thyroid hormone in doses higher than those produced physiologically by the gland results in suppression of the production of endogenous hormone. This is the basis for the thyroid suppression test and is used as an aid in the diagnosis of patients with signs of mild hyperthyroidism in whom base line laboratory tests appear normal, or to demonstrate thyroid gland autonomy in patients with Grave's ophthalmopathy. 131I uptake is determined before and after the administration of the exogenous hormone. A 50 percent or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis and thus rules out thyroid gland autonomy.

For adults, the usual suppressive dose of levothyroxine (T4) is 1.56 mcg/kg of body weight per day given for 7 to 10 days. These doses usually yield normal serum T4 and T3 levels and lack of response to TSH.

Thyroid hormones should be administered cautiously to patients in whom there is strong suspicion of thyroid gland autonomy, in view of the fact that the exogenous hormone effects will be additive to the endogenous source.

### Management of the potential organ donor in the ICU: Society of Critical Care Medicine / American College of Chest Physicians / association of organ procurement organizations consensus statement [^114Ea3Ft]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Vasoactive support in brain-dead potential organ donors — agent selection, escalation triggers, and key outcomes — includes that once circulatory shock is established, the use of vasopressor agents is recommended when correction of the volume deficit fails to achieve the threshold hemodynamic goals, and vasoactive support should escalate to meet defined goals, especially with left ventricular dysfunction. Dopamine has traditionally been the first-line vasoactive agent, while norepinephrine and phenylephrine infusions should be used sparingly; deleterious cardiac effects of the autonomic storm can be mitigated by using adrenergic antagonists such as esmolol. Evidence cited includes a low-dose dopamine regimen (4 μg/kg/min) in 264 brain-dead donors resulting in 487 kidney transplants, with reduced need for dialysis in dopamine-treated grafts (24.7% vs 35.4%, p = 0.01). Vasopressin improves the vasodilatory shock state associated with brain death, effectively corrects diabetes insipidus (DI), reduces the need for catecholamines, and its use in deceased organ donors has been associated with an increased rate of organ recovery. Norepinephrine is similarly used as an additional or secondary agent mostly when dopamine infusion rates approach more than 10 μg/kg/min or marked hemodynamic instability is present, but the use of norepinephrine in donors has been associated with a reduced 1-year survival in heart transplant recipients; vasoactive support in this context may also include HRT (vasopressin, steroids, and thyroid hormone).

### The effects of acute triiodothyronine therapy on myocardial gene expression in brain stem dead cardiac donors [^112t6c3m]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Context

After brain stem death (BSD), a low T(3) state is common, and T(3) supplementation has been advocated to improve heart function and yield for transplantation.

Objectives

The aim of the study was to assess the effects of T(3) on expression of mRNAs encoding T(3)-responsive genes in the post-BSD human heart.

Design

Within a prospective double-blind trial, potential BSD cardiac donors undergoing hemodynamic optimization were randomized to T(3) (0.8 microg. kg(-1) bolus; infusion 0.113 microg. kg(-1). h(-1)) or placebo (5% dextrose) for up to 6 h. Left ventricular biopsies were obtained at end-assessment from 30 donors (T(3); n = 16). TaqMan real-time PCR was performed to investigate mRNA expression of the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.5, beta-1 adrenergic receptor (ADRB1), sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase type 2a (SERCA2a), and phospholamban (PLB).

Results

Time between diagnosis of BSD and donor management was 13.2 h (range, 9.7–16.8 h). T(3) donors were managed for 7.6 (6.9–8.3) h. Median serum free T(3) (fT3) at baseline was 2.9 (2.3–3.8) pmol. liter(-1) (reference range, 3.3–7.5 pmol. liter(-1)). At baseline, 19 of 30 (56.7%) had low serum fT3, and T(3) treatment increased fT3 to supraphysiological levels (P < 0.001). Expression of mRNAs encoding Kv1.5 and SERCA2a was increased 1.99-fold and 1.51-fold (P = 0.015 and 0.043). There was no significant change in the expression of mRNAs encoding ADRB1 and PLB. Treatment with T(3) did not improve hemodynamic function compared with placebo.

Conclusions

Acute administration of T(3) in the BSD cardiac donor reverses the low T(3) state and increases expression of the mRNAs encoding Kv1.5 and SERCA2a, but not ADRB1 or PLB and is not associated with any improvement in hemodynamic performance.

### Victory out of tragedy: organ donation [^113A8x5n]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Resuscitation of potential donors

Optimal and aggressive critical care of the potential donor begins long before the declaration of death. To ensure that the donor organs would be of utmost benefit to the recipients, efforts must be made to ensure optimal organ status through the process of referral, consent, and organ recovery. The following components of resuscitation would be useful in addressing some of these responses.

Hemodynamic monitoring

To guide resuscitation and support, a recommended practice is to institute some sort of hemodynamic monitoring. The growing use of and comfort with bedside echocardiography and ultrasound has led them to be used routinely to help guide resuscitation strategies.

Fluid resuscitation

The goal of fluid resuscitation is to maintain optimal fluid status to preserve end organ perfusion. Fluid resuscitation is recommended to maintain a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8–12 mm Hg and a systolic arterial pressure between 90 and 140 mm Hg.

The role of vasopressin

After the achievement of adequate fluid resuscitation, vasopressin should be considered as the first-choice hemodynamic therapy. Administration of vasopressin acts to inhibit the diuresis of DI and the resultant hypotension due to its catecholamine sparing effects and ability to counteract vasodilatation. Vasopressin is also usually seen to be deficient in donors who require catecholamine support.

The role of thyroxine

The hemodynamic instability in DNDDs is partly due to low circulating levels of thyroxine. Therapeutic replacement with T3 has been associated with significant improvements in cardiovascular status, reductions in inotropic support, and decreases in donors lost from cardiac instability. A 'T4 protocol' is recommended in situations where there are increased vasopressor requirements. This protocol consists of 1 ampule 50% dextrose, 2 g of solumedrol, 20 units regular insulin, and 20 μg of thyroid hormone (T 4), followed by a continuous infusion of 10 μg/h.

The role of insulin

After the development of neurological death, insulin levels have been measured to decrease to 50% of baseline at 3 hours, and even further to 20% at 13 hours. Keeping glucose levels under 150 mg/dL has been recommended for optimal outcomes.

Managing potential complications

Brain death is associated with numerous complications such as DIC, DI, NPE, hypothermia, and cardiac arrhythmias. Understanding and anticipating these complications is important for the managing physician. Early identification of these complications coupled with adequate supplementation is necessary to maintain hormonal balance, hemodynamic stability, and organ perfusion.

5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease

Overtreatment with levothyroxine may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate TIROSINT therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive TIROSINT therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant TIROSINT and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiac symptoms develop or worsen, reduce the TIROSINT dose or withhold it for one week and restart at a lower dose.

5.2 Myxedema Coma

Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of levothyroxine sodium from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma.

5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency

Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patient with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with TIROSINT [see Contraindications (4)].

5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism

TIROSINT has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or under-treatment with TIROSINT may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of TIROSINT carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using TIROSINT and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control

Addition of levothyroxine therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

### Does initial dosing of levothyroxine in infants with congenital hypothyroidism lead to frequent dose adjustments secondary to iatrogenic hyperthyroidism on follow-up? [^115KeymG]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is the most common preventable cause of intellectual disability. The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine (LT4) is between 10 and 15 μg/kg, an extremely wide range. We hypothesized that a sizable proportion of newborns treated for CH at the higher end of the dosage range become biochemically hyperthyroid at a follow-up visit.

Methods

This study is a retrospective chart review of infants with CH between 2002 and 2012.

Results

Of the 104 patients included in this analysis, the average age at diagnosis was 11 days and the average starting dose of LT4 was 12 ± 2.5 μg/kg. At follow-up, 36.5% required a dose reduction because of iatrogenic hyperthyroxinemia, 51% required no dose adjustment and 12.5% required a dose increase due to an elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). The starting doses of LT4 for those requiring a dose reduction, those not requiring an adjustment and those requiring an increase in the dose were 13.2 ± 2.4, 11.5 ± 2.1 and 10.3 ± 2.6 μg/kg/day, respectively (p ≤ 0.0001). Of the 34% of infants treated with an initial dose of > 12.5 μg/day, 57.1% required a dose reduction at follow-up, compared to 26.1% of those whose initial starting dose was ≤ 12.5 μg/kg/day (p = 0.007).

Conclusions

Following the guidelines for initiating therapy for CH, 36.5% of the infants required a dose reduction for iatrogenic hyperthyroxinemia. These infants received a higher dose of LT4 than the infants who either required no adjustment or required an increase in the dose. A narrower range for initial dosing in CH may be appropriate.

### Interest of low-dose hydrocortisone therapy during brain-dead organ donor resuscitation: the CORTICOME study [^115MJBkk]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

This multicenter prospective controlled study demonstrates that systemic administration of low-dose steroids during brain-death resuscitation of potential brain-dead organ donors makes vasopressor weaning possible in more than a third of patients (33.8%) and also decreases by more than 20% the quantity of vasopressors needed to control circulatory failure, allowing for a significant reduction in the need for inotropic support. This effect is not related to adrenal insufficiency identified by ACTH stimulation, but steroid administration alone fails to increase the number of organ recovered for transplantation.

When an organ donor with brain-death is resuscitated, one of the main objectives is to stabilize the hemodynamic state in order to limit ischemia and inflammation as far as possible in the different organs. This goal is usually achieved by a combination of fluid expansion and inotrope administration. Norepinephrine is associated with a decreased rate of high-yield procurement and it seems clinically relevant to reduce doses or use of norepinephrine in brain-dead donors to increase the rate of organ procurement. Thyroid hormones and cortisol deficit have already been identified as circulatory failure factors in brain-dead donors. Our study confirms that prescription of a replacement dose of hydrocortisone during resuscitation of a potential brain-dead donor makes vasopressor weaning possible and also decreases vasopressor doses, which are necessary to maintain a stable hemodynamic state in unweaned patients. These results are in agreement with those of a single-center observational cohort of 30 patients with brain death who were administered 50 mg of hydrocortisone: in 58% of patients norepinephrine doses were reduced by 30% after three hours. Another study compared two groups of donors including during two consecutive periods and studied the impact of high doses of methylprednisolone (15 mg/kg) versus low doses of hydrocortisone (300 to 500 mg): frequency of vasopressor weaning was 39% in the first group and 47% in the second group, with no significant difference between both groups. Our results for hemodynamic stability and decrease in vasopressor use following steroid administration are similar to the results obtained in several studies, in which identical doses of hydrocortisone were administered in patients who were not brain-dead.

### No effect of levothyroxine on hemoglobin in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism: pooled results from 2 randomized controlled trials [^112QzVFe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

The current preplanned combined analysis uses data from the TRUST (Thyroid hormone Replacement for Untreated older adults with Subclinical hypothyroidism Trial) trial and the IEMO 80-plus Thyroid trial. Both trials were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group trials investigating the potential multimodal effects of levothyroxine treatment for persons with subclinical hypothyroidism aged 65 years and older, and aged 80 years and older, respectively. The identical design, study processes, and infrastructure allowed for a preplanned combined analysis. Consequently, the combined cohorts are presented and analyzed as a single study group throughout the manuscript.

The full study protocols and statistical analysis plans for the TRUST Thyroid trial and the IEMO 80-plus Thyroid trial have been published previously. In short, persons aged 65 years and older (TRUST Thyroid trial) or 80 years and older (IEMO 80-plus Thyroid trial) with a diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as elevated thyrotropin (thyroid stimulating hormone; TSH) levels (≥ 4.6 and ≤ 19.9 mIU/L), measured on at least 2 occasions with an interval between > 3 months and 3 years apart, and free thyroxine (fT4) within normal local laboratory ranges, were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included, but were not limited to, the use of levothyroxine, antithyroid medication, clinical diagnosis of dementia, recent hospitalization for major illness, and terminal illness. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to levothyroxine or placebo.

The study medication consisted of levothyroxine sodium tablets and matching placebo tablets taken orally daily. The intervention group started with 50 micrograms daily (or 25 micrograms for participants with body weight < 50 kg or a history of coronary heart disease) and the control group with a matching placebo for 6 to 8 weeks. Two optional up- or down-titrations after 6- to 8-week intervals, and one at 12 months of follow-up ensured adequate treatment while avoiding potential overtreatment, mirroring routine clinical practice. An adaptive mock titration schedule was applied for the placebo group. Participants, general practitioners (GPs) and study personnel remained blinded to treatment allocation and thyroid function test results throughout the study. Ethics approval was obtained from the medical ethics committees and competent authorities in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Ireland. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

### Management of the potential organ donor in the ICU: Society of Critical Care Medicine / American College of Chest Physicians / association of organ procurement organizations consensus statement [^113RyVXS]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Potential pediatric organ donor management — After death declaration and donation authorization, care shifts toward preservation with a goal of restoring normal hemodynamics, ventilation, and oxygenation, and donor management goals should restore normal blood pressure for age, normal ventilation and oxygenation parameters, and normal fluid balance and electrolyte values. Vasoactive agents, such as dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, are frequently utilized to maintain hemodynamic stability in these very unstable children. For diabetes insipidus, pharmacologic agents to control DI must be used in conjunction with volume replacement therapy to maintain a euvolemic state, because those with it can have profound fluid and electrolyte disturbances if aggressive therapy with fluid replacement and use of vasopressin or desmopressin are not utilized to control excessive urine output; in one study, use of vasopressin was shown to reduce the need for inotropic support without affecting graft function. Regarding thyroid support, levothyroxine is commonly used by many centers, pediatric studies are limited but use of thyroid hormone in children declared dead by neurologic criteria has been shown to decrease the need for inotropic support, and it seems reasonable to consider these agents when hemodynamic status is refractory to conventional therapy with fluid and inotropic administration. For adrenal dysfunction after brain death, methylprednisolone is commonly used to assist with hemodynamic support, even though few data attest to its benefits in the potential pediatric organ donor.

### Relationship of hormonal resuscitation therapy and central venous pressure on increasing organs for transplant [^111z9Ar6]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Hormonal resuscitation therapy (HRT) has been shown to increase the number of organs available for transplant. Likewise, optimal fluid balance, as measured by central venous pressure (CVP), impacts the function of donor lungs. The purpose of this study is to examine the interplay of these two variables in donor management and the impact they have on organs transplanted, with particular emphasis on hearts and lungs.

Methods

Management of brain-dead potential organ donors was standardized in the regional OPO, including utilization of HRT in combination with a goal CVP of 4 to 8 mm Hg. Outcomes of organs transplanted per donor (OTPD) were compared between donors receiving ≥ 15 hours and < 15 hours of L-thyroxine (T4); between donors with a final CVP < 10 mm Hg vs > 10 mm Hg; between donors in whom T4 was applied for ≥ 15 hours, and a final CVP < 10 mm Hg was achieved; and those in whom one or both variables were not achieved.

Results

Seventy-nine percent more hearts were transplanted from donors in whom HRT was initiated and maintained for ≥ 15 hours. When a final CVP < 10 mm Hg was achieved, 44% more hearts, 95% more lungs and 13% more kidneys were able to be transplanted. When both variables were met, 64% more hearts, 103% more lungs, 6% more kidneys and 44% more pancreata were available for transplantation, without compromise of liver or intestinal outcomes.

Conclusions

Standardization of HRT, in combination with a CVP < 10 mm Hg, significantly increases the utilization of hearts and lungs for transplantation, without negatively impacting other organ systems.

### Comparative effectiveness of levothyroxine, desiccated thyroid extract, and levothyroxine + liothyronine in hypothyroidism [^1116fwMY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The rationale behind thyroid hormone replacement therapy is to administer thyroid hormone in a way that restores thyroid hormone signaling in all tissues. Serum TSH has traditionally been used to adjust the dose of levothyroxine that presumably achieves this goal. However, normalization of serum TSH is achieved through a slightly elevated serum T4 and reduced serum T3 levels. TSH was higher in the DTE arm but still within the normal range. It was difficult to make DTE and LT4 doses bioequivalent. It is not known whether these small changes in serum T3 and T4 modify thyroid hormone signaling. The observation in the present investigation that replacement therapy containing T3 or DTE (which also contains T3) slightly elevates serum T3 and reduces serum T4, whereas mitigating the residual symptoms of hypothyroidism suggests a causal relationship. Nonetheless, our findings are clear that no correlation between serum T3 and outcomes could be established in the present investigation, not even in the subanalyses. This apparent conundrum suggests that intracellular T3 levels, which are affected by both serum T3 and locally generated T3, might be playing a role.

It is well known that thyroid hormone plays a role in the development of an adult brain, as documented by the modifications in mood, behavior, and cognition observed during the transition from hypo- to euthyroidism and to hyperthyroidism. In fact, the human temporal pole responds promptly to minimal changes in thyroid hormone signaling. Unique about the brain is that thyroid hormone signaling exhibits additional layers of complexity; thus, there are multiple mechanisms that can fail and compromise thyroid hormone signaling. Although plasma T3 can be taken up by the brain, most T3 molecules in the brain are produced locally in the glial cells through deiodination of T4 via DIO2. T3 exits the glial cells and subsequently functions in a paracrine fashion to activate neuronal gene expression. That some patients on LT4 monotherapy remain symptomatic and prefer therapy containing T3 suggests that therapy with LT4 might not restore cerebral thyroid hormone in all patients. Hypothetically, this could be explained by defects in thyroid hormone transporters, the DIO2 pathway, or by the relatively low serum T3 levels seen in LT4-treated patients, but none of these factors segregated in the most symptomatic LT4-treated patients. The possibility that the relatively higher plasma T4 levels seen in LT4-treated patients might play a role remains to be investigated.

### Interest of low-dose hydrocortisone therapy during brain-dead organ donor resuscitation: the CORTICOME study [^114NVBhT]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Hemodynamic evaluation

All patients were monitored through an artery catheter and a central venous catheter in the superior vena cava. Patients received controlled ventilation with a tidal volume (VT) of 7 to 10 ml/kg, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 to 5 cmH 2 O, and an adjusted rate to maintain normocapnia. Hypotension was defined as mean blood pressure < 65 mmHg. Mean blood pressure was set between 65 and 75 mmHg. The preload dependence was evaluated with respiratory variation of pulse blood pressure or with variation of subaortic doppler speeds or echocardiography-measured vena cava diameter; common threshold values previously defined in the protocol were used. Vascular filling was performed with 500- to 1,000-ml aliquots of crystalloids administered during 10 to 15 minutes. Norepinephrine therapy was started if persistent hypotension and no preload dependence criteria were noted. If the mean blood pressure was superior to 85 mmHg, norepinephrine dose was decreased until complete vasopressor weaning.

When diabetes insipidus (defined by diuresis > 3 ml/kg/h and urine density < 1003 gm/cm 3) occurred, diuresis needed to be offset volume for volume and desmopressin was administered to maintain diuresis between 1 and 3 ml/kg/h and natremia < 160 mmol/L.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The initial dose of EUTHYROX varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)].

In children in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue EUTHYROX administration for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum T4 and TSH levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessment to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted.

Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)]

Rapid restoration of normal serum T4concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate EUTHYROX therapy immediately upon diagnosis. Levothyroxine is generally continued for life in these patients.

Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of EUTHYROX therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling.

Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment has been associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and accelerate the bone age, with resultant premature closure of the epiphyses and compromised adult stature.

Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients

Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature.

Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate EUTHYROX at less than the full replacement dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with levothyroxine overtreatment in the elderly.

Glucocorticoids and thyroid — central hypothyroidism (CH) starting levothyroxine (L-T4): We suggest evaluating patients with CH for AI before starting L-T4 therapy; if this is not feasible, clinicians should prescribe empiric GC therapy in patients with CH who are starting L-T4 therapy until there is a definitive evaluation for AI. Data suggest that AI should be conclusively excluded before initiating L-T4 therapy for CH because thyroid hormone accelerates endogenous cortisol clearance and could unmask insufficient cortisol production and precipitate AC; if patients start L-T4 therapy before evaluation, clinicians should initiate empiric GC replacement therapy simultaneously until they complete a definitive evaluation for AI. Physiological and pharmacological doses of GC suppress TSH levels, and CH patients receiving GC therapy do not appear to require L-T4 dose adjustments.

### Management of the potential organ donor in the ICU: Society of Critical Care Medicine / American College of Chest Physicians / association of organ procurement organizations consensus statement [^111my5tu]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Potential organ donor in the ICU — thyroid replacement therapy evidence is summarized as follows: most supporting evidence comes from animal models demonstrating significant decline in triiodothyronine (T3) and free thyroxine (T4) levels after brain death, with preclinical studies indicating that pituitary hormone deficiency, especially hypothyroidism, is associated with depleted myocardial energy stores, a shift from carbohydrate to aerobic metabolism and reduced cardiac function, and that treatment including T3 reversed cardiac dysfunction while T3 alone restored aerobic metabolism; in humans, reduced levels of thyroid hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) have not been consistently reported after brain death, low circulating thyroid hormone levels are not always associated with hemodynamic instability, and the observed pattern has been suggested to be more consistent with sick euthyroid syndrome rather than true hypothyroidism.

### The effects of hormone resuscitation on cardiac function and hemodynamics in a porcine brain-dead organ donor model [^1122L5Kt]. American Journal of Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

We compared the effects of hormone resuscitation (HR) with a norepinephrine-based protocol on cardiac function, hemodynamics and need for vasopressor support after brain death in a porcine model. Following brain death induction, animals were treated with norepinephrine and fluids for 3 h. In the following 3 h, they continued on norepinephrine and fluids (control) or received additional HR (triiodothyronine, methylprednisolone, vasopressin, insulin). Data were collected pre-brain death, 3 and 6 h post-brain death. At 6 h, median norepinephrine use was higher in controls (0.563 vs. 0 microg/kg/min; p < 0.005), with 6/8 HR animals weaned off norepinephrine compared with 0/9 controls. Mean arterial pressure was higher in HR animals at 6 h (74 ± 17 vs. 54 ± 14 mmHg; p < 0.05). Cardiac contractility was also significantly higher in HR animals at 6 h (stroke work index 1.777 vs. 1.494). After collection of 6 h data, all animals were placed on the same low dose of norepinephrine. At 6.25 h, HR animals had higher stroke work (3540 ± 1083 vs. 1536 ± 702 mL.mmHg; p < 0.005), stroke volume (37.2 ± 8.2 vs. 21.5 ± 9.8 mL; p < 0.01) and cardiac output (5.8 ± 1.4 vs. 3.2 ± 1.2 L/min; p < 0.005). HR in a porcine model of brain death reduces norepinephrine requirements, and improves hemodynamics and cardiac function. These results support the use of HR in the management of the brain-dead donor.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)–related adrenal insufficiency (AI) and pituitary–thyroid management — In milder cases, "a physiologic regimen of HC at 15 to 25 mg/d in divided doses is sufficient, and ICI therapy may be continued". If secondary AI is suspected in a patient with secondary hypothyroidism, "glucocorticoid replacement should be started prior to thyroid hormone replacement to avoid the precipitation of adrenal crisis". For severe cases with adrenal crisis or hemodynamic instability, "hospitalization will be required with 100 mg of intravenous HC and fluid resuscitation, followed by 200 mg per 24 hours of HC either via continuous infusion or divided into 6-hourly injections of 50 mg", then, when stable, taper "to physiologic doses of 15 to 25 mg/d in divided doses and the reintroduction of ICI therapy". In hypophysitis with severe headaches/visual symptoms, patients "may benefit from high doses of prednisone (20–60 mg/d or 1 mg/kg/d) with subsequent tapering to a physiologic glucocorticoid regimen", although "a recent retrospective study reported reduced survival of patients with melanoma and hypophysitis treated with high-dose glucocorticoid regimens compared with those on < 7.5 mg of prednisone equivalents per day". For secondary hypothyroidism, "The initial dose of levothyroxine can vary between 25 and 50 μg/d up to a full weight-based replacement of 1 to 1.6 μg/kg/d", and "free T4 should be used to monitor patients, and the dose of levothyroxine should be adjusted to target the upper half of the normal reference range of free T4". Recovery expectations include that it is "highly unlikely that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function will recover", whereas "approximately 50% of patients with secondary hypothyroidism may regain activity in their hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis".

### Management of the brain-dead donor in the ICU: general and specific therapy to improve transplantable organ quality [^113Kwwo1]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To provide a practical overview of the management of the potential organ donor in the intensive care unit.

Methods

Seven areas of donor management were considered for this review: hemodynamic management; fluids and electrolytes; respiratory management; endocrine management; temperature management; anaemia and coagulation; infection management. For each subchapter, a narrative review was conducted.

Results and Conclusions

Most elements in the current recommendations and guidelines are based on pathophysiological reasoning, epidemiological observations, or extrapolations from general ICU management strategies, and not on evidence from randomized controlled trials. The cardiorespiratory management of brain-dead donors is very similar to the management of critically ill patients, and the same applies to the management of anaemia and coagulation. Central diabetes insipidus is of particular concern, and should be diagnosed based on clinical criteria. Depending on the degree of vasopressor dependency, it can be treated with intermittent desmopressin or continuous vasopressin, intravenously. Temperature management of the donor is an area of uncertainty, but it appears reasonable to strive for a core temperature of > 35 °C. The indications and controversies regarding endocrine therapies, in particular thyroid hormone replacement therapy, and corticosteroid therapy, are discussed. The potential donor should be assessed clinically for infections, and screening tests for specific infections are an essential part of donor management. Although the rate of infection transmission from donor to receptor is low, certain infections are still a formal contraindication to organ donation. However, new antiviral drugs and strategies now allow organ donation from certain infected donors to be done safely.

10 OVERDOSAGE

In general, the signs and symptoms of overdosage with levothyroxine are those of hyperthyroidism [See Warnings and Precautions (5) and Adverse Reactions (6)]. In addition, confusion and disorientation may occur. Cerebral embolism, shock, coma, and death have been reported. Excessive doses of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection (greater than 500 mcg) are associated with cardiac complications in patients with underlying cardiac disease.

Treatment of Overdosage

Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection should be reduced in dose or temporarily discontinued if signs or symptoms of overdosage occur. To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose, a good resource is the certified Regional Poison Control Center. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in the patient.

In the event of an overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated as dictated by the patient's medical status.

Myxedema coma — therapeutic endpoints and monitoring with LT4: intravenous levothyroxine treatment may lead to improvement in cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary, and metabolic parameters within a week, with serum thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations increasing or normalizing within a similar time frame and more gradual serum TSH improvement; therapeutic endpoints should be improved mental status, improved cardiac function, and improved pulmonary function, and measurement of thyroid hormones every 1–2 days is reasonable to ensure a favorable trajectory; failure of TSH to trend down or of thyroid hormone levels to improve could be considered indications to increase levothyroxine therapy and/or add liothyronine therapy, whereas high serum triiodothyronine should be considered an indication to decrease therapy. Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence.

Endocrine dysfunction and hormone therapy in brain death — vasopressin deficiency leading to diabetes insipidus (DI) is common and endocrine replacement may be beneficial; reduction in vasopressin production leading to DI has been reported in up to 80% of patients with brain death, anterior pituitary hormone deficits have also been described, and pharmacologic replacement of these hormones may promote hemodynamic stability, improve organ function, and increase the likelihood of multiple organ retrieval; damage to posterior pituitary structures results in low or undetectable arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels, AVP deficiency may cause inappropriate diuresis with hypovolemia, hyperosmolality, and hypernatremia consistent with DI, and even patients without DI may have impaired baroreflex-mediated AVP secretion during hypotension and reduced circulating volume.

### Levothyroxine and liothyronine (renThyroid) [^111euZ6G]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The dosage of thyroid hormones is determined by the indication and must in every case be individualized according to patient response and laboratory findings.

Biotin supplementation may interfere with immunoassays for TSH, T4, and T3, resulting in erroneous thyroid hormone test results. Inquire whether patients are taking biotin or biotin-containing supplements. If so, advise them to stop biotin supplementation at least 2 days before assessing TSH and/or T4 levels (see PRECAUTIONS).

Thyroid hormones are given orally. In acute, emergency conditions, injectable levothyroxine sodium (T4) may be given intravenously when oral administration is not feasible or desirable, as in the treatment of myxedema coma, or during total parenteral nutrition. Intramuscular administration is not advisable because of reported poor absorption.

Hypothyroidism

Therapy is usually instituted using low doses, with increments which depend on the cardiovascular status of the patient. The usual starting dose is 30 mg RenThyroid (Thyroid Tablets, USP), with increments of 15 mg every 2 to 3 weeks. A lower starting dosage, 15 mg/day, is recommended in patients with long-standing myxedema, particularly if cardiovascular impairment is suspected, in which case extreme caution is recommended. The appearance of angina is an indication for a reduction in dosage. Most patients require 60 to 120 mg/day.

Failure to respond to doses of 180 mg suggests lack of compliance or malabsorption. Maintenance dosages 60 to 120 mg/day usually result in normal serum T4 and T3 levels.

Adequate therapy usually results in normal TSH and T4 levels after 2 to 3 weeks of therapy.

Readjustment of thyroid hormone dosage should be made within the first four weeks of therapy, after proper clinical and laboratory evaluations, including serum levels of T4, bound and free, and TSH.

Liothyronine (T3) may be used in preference to levothyroxine (T4) during radio-isotope scanning procedures, since induction of hypothyroidism in those cases is more abrupt and can be of shorter duration. It may also be preferred when impairment of peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) and liothyronine (T3) is suspected.

### Thyroid, porcine (Armour thyroid) [^113ioaWN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Myxedema Coma —

Myxedema coma is usually precipitated in the hypothyroid patient of long-standing by intercurrent illness or drugs such as sedatives and anesthetics and should be considered a medical emergency. Therapy should be directed at the correction of electrolyte disturbances and possible infection besides the administration of thyroid hormones. Corticosteroids should be administered routinely. Levothyroxine (T4) and liothyronine (T3) may be administered via a nasogastric tube but the preferred route of administration of both hormones is intravenous. Levothyroxine sodium (T4) is given at a starting dose of 400 mcg (100 mcg/mL) given rapidly, and is usually well tolerated, even in the elderly. This initial dose is followed by daily supplements of 100 to 200 mcg given IV. Normal T4 levels are achieved in 24 hours followed in 3 days by threefold elevation of T3. Oral therapy with thyroid hormone would be resumed as soon as the clinical situation has been stabilized and the patient is able to take oral medication.

Thyroid Cancer —

Exogenous thyroid hormone may produce regression of metastases from follicular and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid and is used as ancillary therapy of these conditions with radioactive iodine. TSH should be suppressed to low or undetectable levels. Therefore, larger amounts of thyroid hormone than those used for replacement therapy are required. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is usually unresponsive to this therapy.

Thyroid Suppression Therapy —

Administration of thyroid hormone in doses higher than those produced physiologically by the gland results in suppression of the production of endogenous hormone. This is the basis for the thyroid suppression test and is used as an aid in the diagnosis of patients with signs of mild hyperthyroidism in whom base line laboratory tests appear normal, or to demonstrate thyroid gland autonomy in patients with Grave's ophthalmopathy. 131I uptake is determined before and after the administration of the exogenous hormone. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis and thus rules out thyroid gland autonomy.

For adults, the usual suppressive dose of levothyroxine (T4) is 1.56 mcg/kg of body weight per day given for 7 to 10 days. These doses usually yield normal serum T4 and T3 levels and lack of response to TSH.

Thyroid hormones should be administered cautiously to patients in whom there is strong suspicion of thyroid gland autonomy, in view of the fact that the exogenous hormone effects will be additive to the endogenous source.

### Hormone replacement therapy in brain-dead organ donors: a comprehensive review with an emphasis on traumatic brain injury [^115fKkNA]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Organ shortage is an ongoing problem in the United States. Most donor organs are procured following brain death and a significant portion of brain-dead donors result from devastating brain injury. Without a standard practice for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in the setting of brain death, a comprehensive review of the literature was deemed necessary.

Methods

A search of published literature was conducted with terms "TBI" or "brain injury" or "head injury" AND "hormone" or "management" AND "organ" AND "donor" or "donation". Abstracts and full texts were screened for relevance and inclusion of information on HRT. Additional studies were selected from references cited within these. Excluded studies were non-English, nonhuman based, or had small sample size, (i.e., case reports or series with fewer than five subjects).

Results

Fifteen studies were selected for inclusion and contained Level III or Level IV evidence. Combinations of thyroid hormone, insulin, and corticosteroids were the most commonly cited HRT. Ninety-three percent of studies found a significant increase in organ procurement rate among donors who received HRT. Hormone replacement therapy was administered after brain death declaration in eight studies. Only two studies specifically explored the effects of starting HRT earlier and identified even greater procurement rates. Four studies were specific to traumatic brain injury (TBI); the remaining 11 studies involved TBI in 22% to 89% of the sample.

Conclusion

Organ shortage remains a growing problem in the United States. Donor management including HRT has been proposed to combat the endocrine derangement associated with brain death and, in particular, TBI. While the existing literature reported compelling outcomes using HRT, there remains a need for further Level I and Level II evidence studies to define optimal practice.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials of thyroid hormone administration to brain dead potential organ donors [^114EgH7C]. Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review all published clinical studies of thyroid hormone administration to brain-dead potential organ donors.

Methods

A search of PubMed using multiple search terms retrieved 401 publications including 35 original reports describing administration of thyroid hormone to brain-dead potential organ donors. Detailed review of the 35 original reports led to identification of two additional publications not retrieved in the original search. The 37 original publications reported findings from 16 separate case series or retrospective audits and seven randomized controlled trials, four of which were placebo-controlled. Meta-analysis was restricted to the four placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials.

Results

Whereas all case series and retrospective audits reported a beneficial effect of thyroid hormone administration, all seven randomized controlled trials reported no benefit of thyroid hormone administration either alone or in combination with other hormonal therapies. In four placebo-controlled trials including 209 donors, administration of thyroid hormone (n = 108) compared with placebo (n = 101) had no significant effect on donor cardiac index (pooled mean difference, 0.15 L/min/m²; 95% confidence interval -0.18 to 0.48). The major limitation of the case series and retrospective audits was the lack of consideration of uncontrolled variables that confound interpretation of the results. A limitation of the randomized controlled trials was that the proportion of donors who were hemodynamically unstable or marginal in other ways was too small to exclude a benefit of thyroid hormone in this subgroup.

Conclusions

The findings of this systematic review do not support a role for routine administration of thyroid hormone in the brain-dead potential organ donor. Existing recommendations regarding the use of thyroid hormone in marginal donors are based on low-level evidence.

### The effect of a thyroid hormone infusion on vasopressor support in critically ill children with cessation of neurologic function [^112n4vHW]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the impact of a thyroid hormone infusion (T4) on the vasopressor requirements in children with cessation of neurologic function (i.e., brain death) during evaluation for organ recovery

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

The 1998–2002 database of a regional organ recovery program.

Patients

Children ≤ 18 yrs with cessation of neurologic function during evaluation for organ recovery (n = 171) were included. The treated group (n = 91) received a weight-based bolus and continuous infusion of T4 according to the organ procurement agency protocol. All other children (n = 80) were considered untreated.

Interventions

T4 was administered at the clinician's discretion. All children (treated and untreated) had identical goals for fluids, blood pressure, and organ function criteria. Vasopressor score ([dopamine x 1] + [dobutamine x 1] + [epinephrine x 100] + [norepinephrine x 100] + [phenylephrine x 100]) at the time of the program's involvement (T0) and at organ recovery (TOR) were recorded. The Wilcoxon rank sum and Student's two-sample t-test were used to compare the average vasopressor score at T0 vs. TOR. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to analyze the difference in median vasopressor score at T0 vs. TOR. Multivariable linear regression was used to assess the impact of T4 on the ability to wean vasopressor support while accounting for the effects of several potential confounders.

Measurements and Main Results

One hundred seventy-one subjects were included in the final analysis. T4 administration was associated with an unadjusted decrease in the vasopressor score of 32 (95% confidence interval, 12–53; p = .002). After adjusting for steroid administration, fluid balance, and baseline vasopressor score, T4 administration was associated with a decrease in vasopressor score of 24 (95% confidence interval, 6–43; p = .011).

Conclusions

T4 reduced vasopressor needs in children with cessation of neurologic function and hemodynamic instability. A prospective study of T4 in critically ill and hemodynamically unstable children appears warranted.

### Efficiency of triiodothyronine treatment on organ donor hemodynamic management and adenine nucleotide concentration [^1152oJSU]. Intensive Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

We compared hemodynamic values, oxygen utilization, and adenine nucleotide concentration in the extracted organs of brain-dead donors treated with triiodothyronine vs. standard support treatment.

Design

Prospective, randomized, double-blind controlled study.

Patients

We recruited 52 consecutive adult cadaveric organ donors. Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of brain-death, transplantation suitability, and family consent for donation; exclusion criterion was preexisting thyroid disease.

Interventions

The treatment group (n = 29) received an intravenous bolus of 1 microg/kg triiodothyronine followed by continuous perfusion at 0.06 microg/kg per hour, and controls (n = 23) received 0.9% ClNa delivered over 270 min. Hemodynamics, tonometry, thyroid hormones, and serum lactate were measured every 90 min from brain death to extraction procedure. Biopsies were processed to determine adenine nucleotides concentration.

Results

Hemodynamic measurements did not differ significantly in the two groups, and the inotrope dose could not be diminished after treatment. Thyrotropin levels increased from brain death to extraction procedure in controls. Thyrotropin measured 90 and 180 min after the beginning of the perfusion was significantly lower in the treatment group than controls. The Pco2 gap increased in both groups from brain death to the extraction procedure. The lactate level of the treatment group was lower than in controls. Biopsy specimens were obtained in 19 controls and in 20 donors of the treatment group; the adenine nucleotides concentration did not show any significant difference.

Conclusions

Triiodothyronine did not add any benefit over the standard management of the organ donor nor did it affect the adenine nucleotides concentration of any biopsied organs.

### Donor heart and lung procurement: a consensus statement [^1154KM8K]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

Donor heart and lung procurement — hormone replacement therapy and endocrine management — Brain death results in a rapid decline in serum levels of cortisol, anti-diuretic hormone, thyroid hormones, and insulin, and in lung transplantation, high-dose corticosteroid administration is associated with improved oxygenation and increased success rates of lung procurement when compared with controls; to achieve these benefits, methylprednisolone is best administered as soon as brain death is confirmed and the patient declared a potential organ donor, while recent studies suggest that low-dose corticosteroid replacement (e.g., 300 mg hydrocortisone) achieves similar improvements with less hyperglycemia than high-dose methylprednisolone. The use of vasopressin in the treatment of vasoparesis after brain death is well established, and because approximately 80% of donors develop DI, treatment should be considered in patients with polyuria (urine output > 3 ml/kg/hour or 3 liters/day), increased serum osmolality, decreased urine osmolality, and/or hypernatremia (serum Na+ > 145 mmol/liter); the use of desmopressin may be considered in normotensive donors, whereas continuous infusion of low-dose vasopressin titrated to urine output goal < 3 ml/kg/hour decreases urine output although improving MAP, but doses > 2.4 U/hour have been associated with adverse cardiac effects and should be avoided. The role of thyroid hormone replacement remains debated; we conclude that the use of thyroid hormone replacement may be considered for managing low ejection fraction (< 45%) or hemodynamically unstable donors but efficacy remains uncertain, and most resources suggest maintaining blood glucose levels between 4 and 10 mmol/liter (72–180 mg/dl) or per individual institutional protocols.

Thyroid hormones, including Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection, either alone or with other therapeutic agents, should not be used for the treatment of obesity or for weight loss. In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements are ineffective for weight reduction. Larger doses may produce serious or even life threatening manifestations of toxicity, particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for their anorectic effects [See Adverse Reactions (6) and Overdosage (10)].

5.1 Risk of Cardiac Complications in Elderly and in Patients with Cardiovascular Disease

Excessive bolus dosing of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection (greater than 500 mcg) are associated with cardiac complications, particularly in the elderly and in patients with an underlying cardiac condition. Adverse events that can potentially be related to the administration of large doses of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection include arrhythmias, tachycardia, myocardial ischemia and infarction, or worsening of congestive heart failure and death. Cautious use, including doses in the lower end of the recommended range, may be warranted in these populations. Close observation of the patient following the administration of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection is advised.

5.2 Need for Concomitant Glucocorticoids and Monitoring for Other Diseases in Patients with Endocrine Disorders

Occasionally, chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, which can lead to myxedema coma, may occur in association with other autoimmune disorders such as adrenal insufficiency, pernicious anemia, and insulin‑dependent diabetes mellitus. Patients should be treated with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of treatment with Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection, until adrenal function has been adequately assessed. Failure to do so may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis when thyroid hormone therapy is initiated, due to increased metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids by thyroid hormone. With initiation of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection, patients with myxedema coma should also be monitored for previously undiagnosed diabetes insipidus.

5.3 Not Indicated for Treatment of Obesity

Thyroid hormones, including Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection, either alone or with other therapeutic agents, should not be used for the treatment of obesity or for weight loss. In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements are ineffective for weight reduction. Larger doses may produce serious or even life threatening manifestations of toxicity, particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for their anorectic effects [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Overdosage (10)].

### Massive triiodothyronine intoxication: efficacy of hemoperfusion? [^1175kWPQ]. Thyroid (2002). Low credibility.

A case of massive accidental triiodothyronine intoxication (1000-fold the usual therapeutic dose, for 8 days) is reported with important disturbances of cardiovascular and central nervous systems that required intensive care support. Serum free triiodothyronine levels were 4789 pmol L(-1) on admittance (normal values, 3.5–6.5 pmol x L(-1)). In the absence of a specific treatment, hemoperfusions were performed but failed to accelerate significantly the decay of blood levels of free triiodothyronine (apparent half-life 25.9 hours; 95% confidence interval: 19.8–37.4 hours). The patient, a young woman, made a satisfactory recovery, in spite of important clinical complications.
