## Question

Frontotemporal dementia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a synthesis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and epidemiology to anchor the syndrome. Then, I should classify the clinical phenotypes and their diagnostic criteria. Next, I will examine neuropathology and genetics, followed by the diagnostic approach including imaging and biomarkers. After that, I need to differentiate FTD from mimics, especially Alzheimer's disease and primary psychiatric disorders. Finally, I will review management, prognosis, and emerging directions, making sure to double-check key claims and cite appropriately throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition and epidemiology so I don't gloss over fundamentals. FTD is an umbrella term for neurodegenerative diseases characterized by progressive deficits in behavior, executive function, or language due to selective frontal and temporal lobe degeneration; it is a leading cause of young-onset dementia, with onset typically in the sixth decade but ranging from the third to ninth decades, and prevalence estimates vary from roughly 4–15 per 100,000 before age 65 in European and US cohorts, with a lifetime risk around 1 in 742 in some studies [^112eJYFp] [^111ptxid].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical subtypes; I should verify the accepted phenotypes. The three principal syndromes are behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), and the language syndromes semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) and nonfluent/agrammatic variant PPA (nfvPPA), with bvFTD comprising about half of cases; motor neuron disease and atypical parkinsonism (PSP, CBS) frequently overlap with FTD, reflecting shared FTLD pathologies [^116HVXvb].

> I need to check the diagnostic criteria for bvFTD to ensure I'm precise. Revised international criteria define possible, probable, and definite bvFTD: possible requires progressive emergence of at least three of six core features (disinhibition, apathy/inertia, loss of empathy, compulsive behaviors, hyperorality, dysexecutive profile with relatively spared memory/visuospatial function); probable adds functional decline plus characteristic neuroimaging; definite requires histopathology or a pathogenic mutation; validation shows improved sensitivity versus older criteria, though limitations remain in operationalization and cultural applicability [^116cNnWb] [^113TARxn] [^111XiiYR].

> Next, I should review the language variants to avoid conflating them. svPPA presents with profound loss of semantic knowledge and word meaning with relatively preserved fluency, typically linked to anterior temporal lobe degeneration and TDP-43 type C pathology, whereas nfvPPA shows effortful, agrammatic speech with spared single-word comprehension and is more often tau-associated; both can evolve toward mixed behavioral-language phenotypes over time [^116QvarK] [^113RFUkY].

> Let me consider the underlying neuropathology carefully. FTD reflects frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) proteinopathies: tau in about 40%, TDP-43 in about 50%, and FUS in a minority; clinicopathologic correlations are imperfect, but svPPA aligns with TDP-43 type C, PSP/CBS with tau, and bvFTD spans tau, TDP-43, and FUS, with emerging data that neuropsychiatric features like hallucinations and perseverative behaviors may hint at TDP-43, while hyperorality supports FTLD over non-FTLD mimics [^113RFUkY] [^113GjbZv] [^117LBk2m].

> I should confirm the genetic architecture before overgeneralizing. Approximately 10–30% of FTD is familial, with autosomal dominant mutations in C9orf72, GRN, and MAPT explaining most genetic cases; C9orf72 expansions are enriched in FTD-ALS and can present with psychiatric features, while MAPT and GRN show distinct imaging signatures and phenotypic variability across families [^112DjVUX] [^111wyvRk] [^116QvarK].

> Now, I will examine the diagnostic approach, starting with clinical assessment. Early behavioral change with loss of insight, social disinhibition, apathy, compulsions, and hyperorality, in the setting of relatively preserved memory and visuospatial skills, should raise suspicion; collateral history is essential because patients often lack insight, and structured tools plus social cognition testing improve diagnostic accuracy and help distinguish bvFTD from psychiatric disorders [^116HVXvb] [^112DjVUX] [^116VpSWf].

> Wait, let me verify the role of neuropsychology beyond screening. Executive dysfunction and social cognition deficits are typical, but episodic memory can be impaired in a subset, so qualitative error analysis and domain-specific batteries help differentiate FTD from Alzheimer's disease and refine syndrome classification; emerging modules like FTLD-MOD enhance diagnostic specificity across the spectrum [^115jyx1m] [^114kKmpu] [^1132mDka].

> Next, I should review imaging, and I need to ensure I don't overstate any modality. Structural MRI is mandatory to exclude mimics and to identify characteristic atrophy: anterior cingulate–frontoinsular and dorsolateral prefrontal atrophy in bvFTD, anterior temporal pole atrophy in svPPA, and left inferior frontal/insula involvement in nfvPPA; FDG-PET shows corresponding hypometabolism and can aid early detection, while SPECT can show frontal/temporal hypoperfusion but evidence is heterogeneous and not recommended for routine use; advanced MRI analytics and machine learning approaches are promising for early and differential diagnosis [^116HVXvb] [^115YAuJG] [^111yHCcp] [^114PL2FB].

> I should double-check fluid and other biomarkers. CSF Aβ42/total tau can help exclude Alzheimer's disease when the ratio is high, though overlap exists; neurofilament light chain in CSF or plasma is elevated in FTD and may help distinguish bvFTD from psychiatric disorders; genetic testing should be offered in familial or early-onset cases, with C9orf72, GRN, and MAPT prioritized, and C9orf72 screening considered broadly in possible/probable bvFTD or cases with psychiatric features [^112DjVUX] [^113PvjAd].

> But wait, what if the presentation is actually Alzheimer's disease or a psychiatric disorder? I need to ensure the differential is explicit. Early prominent behavioral change with relatively preserved episodic memory favors bvFTD over typical AD, whereas logopenic PPA is usually due to AD pathology; misdiagnosis of bvFTD as a primary psychiatric disorder is common, with up to 50% initially mislabeled, so careful collateral history, social cognition testing, and judicious imaging/biomarker use reduce error; emerging prodromal criteria for bvFTD (MBCI-FTD) may further aid early recognition [^113SztiB] [^112DjVUX] [^111wyvRk].

> Let me think about management, and I should confirm there is no disease-modifying therapy yet. Management is multidisciplinary and symptom-targeted: SSRIs can mitigate compulsions, disinhibition, and eating changes; antipsychotics are reserved for severe agitation or psychosis due to safety risks; non-pharmacologic strategies include environmental controls, structured routines, speech therapy for language variants, safety planning for driving and firearms, and intensive caregiver education and support; importantly, cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine are not effective and may worsen behavior in FTD [^11139YdQ] [^115kN9sj] [^115sQfHp].

> I should confirm prognosis and variability. Median survival from symptom onset is approximately 7–9 years but ranges widely across subtypes, with PSP shortest and svPPA longer; age at onset, anatomical pattern of atrophy, and baseline executive/language performance predict functional decline; early-onset and genetic cases may progress differently, and longitudinal studies show that clinical features blur over time, supporting a spectrum model rather than rigid categories [^111p99nD] [^1159KoAF] [^113PvjAd] [^1176r3rc].

> Hold on, I should verify emerging directions so I don't miss what's on the horizon. Biomarker development in plasma and imaging aims for earlier, pathology-specific detection; machine learning is being integrated to improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy; and therapeutic pipelines targeting tau, TDP-43, and progranulin are advancing, with trials increasingly stratified by genetics and biomarkers, though no disease-modifying agent has proven efficacy to date [^116sVR4R] [^114PL2FB] [^115kN9sj].

> In summary, FTD is a clinicopathologically heterogeneous syndrome defined by frontotemporal network degeneration; accurate diagnosis hinges on careful clinical phenotyping supported by MRI, FDG-PET, neuropsychology, and selective biomarkers, with genetics guiding risk and, increasingly, trial eligibility; management remains symptomatic and caregiver-centered while we await disease-modifying therapies, and a transdiagnostic, biomarker-enabled approach is reshaping how we classify and treat this spectrum [^113TeAK9] [^116sVR4R] [^1176r3rc].

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by **progressive behavioral, language, and executive dysfunction** due to frontal and temporal lobe degeneration [^113TeAK9]. It is the **second most common cause of early-onset dementia** [^113PvjAd], with onset typically between 45–65 years [^112L2ZkN]. FTD includes behavioral variant FTD and primary progressive aphasia (semantic and non-fluent) [^116HVXvb], and about 30% of cases are familial, most often due to C9orf72, MAPT, or GRN mutations [^113PvjAd] [^1165CeVG]. Diagnosis relies on clinical features, neuropsychology, and MRI/FDG-PET showing frontotemporal atrophy or hypometabolism [^115YAuJG]; CSF or plasma biomarkers help exclude Alzheimer's disease [^113SztiB]. There is **no disease-modifying therapy** [^116sVR4R]; management is symptomatic and supportive, with SSRIs or antipsychotics for behavior, and speech therapy for language deficits [^115kN9sj]. Prognosis is poor, with median survival 7–10 years [^111p99nD], and early, accurate diagnosis is essential for counseling and care planning [^11139YdQ].

---

## Clinical syndromes and features

FTD presents with **distinct clinical syndromes**, each with characteristic features:

| **Clinical syndrome** | **Core features** | **Additional features** |
|-|-|-|
| Behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) | - Disinhibition <br/> - Apathy <br/> - Loss of empathy <br/> - Compulsive behaviors <br/> - Hyperorality <br/> - Executive dysfunction [^116cNnWb] | - Early behavioral changes <br/> - Relative preservation of memory and visuospatial skills [^116HVXvb] |
| Semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) | - Loss of semantic knowledge <br/> - Word-finding difficulties <br/> - Impaired object naming [^116HVXvb] | - Behavioral changes <br/> - Prosopagnosia [^117WPx4s] |
| Non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA) | - Effortful speech <br/> - Agrammatism <br/> - Apraxia of speech [^116HVXvb] | - Progressive speech production difficulties [^116HVXvb] |

---

FTD can also present with motor neuron disease (FTD-ALS) [^112Tspoa] and atypical parkinsonian syndromes such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS) [^113PvjAd].

---

## Neuropathology

FTD is characterized by **distinct neuropathological subtypes** based on the accumulation of abnormal proteins:

- **Tauopathies**: Associated with microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) mutations and include Pick's disease, PSP, and CBS [^113RFUkY].
- **TDP-43 proteinopathies**: Associated with TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) inclusions, including C9orf72 and progranulin (GRN) mutations [^115JQ5zF].
- **FUS proteinopathies**: Less common, associated with fused in sarcoma (FUS) mutations [^113RFUkY].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and methods

Diagnosis of FTD relies on **clinical assessment, neuropsychological testing, and neuroimaging**:

- **Clinical assessment**: Detailed history from caregivers, behavioral observation, and neurological examination [^112DjVUX].
- **Neuropsychological testing**: Executive dysfunction, social cognition deficits, and language impairment are characteristic [^115jyx1m].
- **Neuroimaging**: MRI shows frontal and/or temporal atrophy; FDG-PET reveals hypometabolism in these regions [^112LGGXb].
- **Biomarkers**: CSF or plasma biomarkers (e.g. neurofilament light chain) help differentiate FTD from Alzheimer's disease [^113SztiB].

---

## Genetic factors

Genetics play a significant role in FTD, with **approximately 30% of cases having a familial history** [^1165CeVG]. The most common mutations include:

- **C9orf72**: Hexanucleotide repeat expansion, associated with FTD-ALS spectrum [^112Tspoa].
- **MAPT**: Microtubule-associated protein tau mutations, associated with tauopathies [^113GjbZv].
- **GRN**: Progranulin mutations, associated with TDP-43 proteinopathies [^115JQ5zF].

---

## Treatment and management

There are **no disease-modifying therapies** for FTD; management focuses on **symptomatic treatment and supportive care**:

- **Pharmacological treatment**: SSRIs for behavioral symptoms, antipsychotics for severe behavioral disturbances, and cautious use of mood stabilizers [^112LGGXb].
- **Non-pharmacological interventions**: Environmental modifications, behavioral strategies, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and caregiver support [^116ttPR8].
- **Genetic counseling**: Essential for families with hereditary FTD [^11139YdQ].

---

## Prognosis and progression

FTD has a **poor prognosis**, with median survival ranging from 7 to 10 years following symptom onset [^111p99nD]. Disease progression varies by subtype, with **behavioral variant FTD** typically progressing more rapidly than language variants [^111p99nD].

---

## Differentiation from other dementias

FTD can be differentiated from other dementias by its **distinct clinical and neuropsychological features**:

- **Alzheimer's disease**: FTD presents with early behavioral or language changes, relatively preserved memory, and frontal/temporal atrophy on imaging [^112XSVq5].
- **Lewy body dementia**: FTD lacks visual hallucinations and parkinsonism [^notfound].
- **Vascular dementia**: FTD lacks clear vascular risk factors and infarcts on imaging [^notfound].

---

Frontotemporal dementia is a **heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder** with distinct clinical syndromes, neuropathological subtypes, and genetic mutations. Early and accurate diagnosis, along with symptomatic management and caregiver support, are essential for improving patient outcomes [^11139YdQ].

### Frontotemporal dementia [^113TeAK9]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia is an umbrella clinical term that encompasses a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterised by progressive deficits in behaviour, executive function, or language. Frontotemporal dementia is a common type of dementia, particularly in patients younger than 65 years. The disease can mimic many psychiatric disorders because of the prominent behavioural features. Various underlying neuropathological entities lead to the frontotemporal dementia clinical phenotype, all of which are characterised by the selective degeneration of the frontal and temporal cortices. Genetics is an important risk factor for frontotemporal dementia. Advances in clinical, imaging, and molecular characterisation have increased the accuracy of frontotemporal dementia diagnosis, thus allowing for the accurate differentiation of these syndromes from psychiatric disorders. As the understanding of the molecular basis for frontotemporal dementia improves, rational therapies are beginning to emerge.

What are the different syndromes of frontotemporal dementia?

There are three main clinical syndromes of FTD, defined on the basis of leading features at presentation. About half of cases present with behavioural change (behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia), and the remainder present with language decline (primary progressive aphasia) characterised either by impaired speech production (progressive non-fluent aphasia) or by impaired word comprehension and semantic memory (that is, memory for meaning) (semantic dementia). There is variable overlap clinically between the syndromes and atypical parkinsonism and motor neurone disease. New consensus diagnostic criteria for FTDand the progressive aphasiashave recently been formulated, but they are likely to be refined as more specific information about disease pathophysiology arises and neuroimaging and other techniques that can capture pathophysiological changes become available.

Methods for bedside assessment of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and the progressive aphasias are presented in the tableand figure 2, respectively. It is particularly important for the non-specialist to have a workable framework for suspecting FTD, as diagnosis, particularly early in the course of the disease, is often challenging. In contrast to Alzheimer's disease (the most common cause of dementia in later life), FTD often presents in middle life, and memory and navigational skills and other aspects of general intellect are often well maintained initially. Behavioural or personality changes may at first suggest a primary psychiatric disorder, particularly if accompanied by psychotic features: clues that such features are harbingers of FTD may include a lack of any prior psychiatric history and emergence of certain specific symptoms such as changes in eating behaviour or social faux pas. Isolated language disturbances may also be misattributed to psychological factors: early features of primary progressive aphasia may include stumbling over longer words, emergence (or re-emergence) of a stutter, grammatical slips or problems using more specialised vocabulary associated with a profession or hobby (for example, a keen gardener may lose the names for flowers). Brain imaging (ideally with magnetic resonance imaging) is mandatory in all suspected cases of FTD to rule out mimic conditions such as brain tumours and to demonstrate signature atrophy patterns that may confirm the diagnosis or identify a non-degenerative "phenocopy".

### Progress and challenges in frontotemporal dementia research: a 20-year review [^11473cMY]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

From this review, it is clear that a great deal has been learned about the phenomenology, clinical characteristics, and the biology of FTD, and its pathology in the past two decades. More importantly, the knowledge base is continuing to expand at a rapid pace. The assessment, diagnostic accuracy, and ability to provide advice on prognosis and outcome have all improved markedly, despite the marked interindividual variability. We now can give much clearer genetic advice and are able to identify the genetic mutation in the majority of familial cases. Families are better informed and supported but the outstanding need remains for disease modifying drugs. In the light of the explosion of research on FTD, we are hopeful that the next decade will finally see meaningful advances in the field of therapeutics which build upon the huge knowledge base that has been accumulating on the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathology in FTD.

### Frontotemporal dementia [^112etDEW]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The syndromes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration are increasingly recognized as an important cause of early-onset dementia. Diagnostic consensus criteria have now been established for almost a decade, and form the framework for its clinical classification. While these criteria remain useful, a growing body of evidence suggests that revisions may be necessary to improve their validity and applicability.

Recent Findings

In each individual syndrome, the core features are not uniformly present, and criteria that are currently used to exclude a condition, such as impaired episodic memory, are often present. Imaging, however, may warrant increased diagnostic prominence, particularly for diagnosis in semantic dementia and prognosis in behavioural syndromes. There is clinical and pathological overlap between the syndromes, but the clinical distinction between progressive nonfluent aphasia and semantic dementia is strengthening. Several series have refined our understanding of the correspondence between clinical syndromes and histopathological subtype: strong for tau-negative, ubiquitin-positive forms and more variable for tau-positive forms, yet prospective studies are still rare. The influence of genetic factors varies substantially across the syndromes.

Summary

Further research should aim to integrate detailed clinical, radiological, pathological and genetic information.

### Advances and controversies in frontotemporal dementia: diagnosis, biomarkers, and therapeutic considerations [^116sVR4R]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia comprises a group of clinical syndromes that are characterised by progressive changes in behaviour, executive function, or language. The term frontotemporal lobar degeneration encompasses the neurodegenerative diseases that give rise to these clinical syndromes and involve proteinopathies associated with frontotemporal network dysfunction. Improvements in clinical, genetic, and molecular characterisation have provided new insights into frontotemporal dementia and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with a much broader range of signs and symptoms at presentation than has been previously considered. Accurate and early diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia is now a possibility due to development of neuropsychological measures with a special focus on social cognition. Advances in plasma and CSF biomarkers, and innovations in structural and functional imaging, will prove useful for future clinical trials in people with frontotemporal dementia.

How is frontotemporal dementia distinguished from other diseases?

FTD syndromes must be distinguished from non-degenerative processes that present with prominent behavioural, executive, and language disturbance (such as primary psychiatric illness, tumours, and cerebrovascular disease) and from other neurodegenerative diseases (notably atypical variants of Alzheimer's disease). Although cerebrovascular changes are common on brain MRI in older patients, primary progressive aphasia can usually be distinguished from vascular aphasic syndromes based on a history of insidious deterioration; the distinction between behavioural variant FTD and cerebrovascular behavioural syndromes is more challenging, but may rest on the relative extent of vascular and regional atrophic changes. Neuropsychological assessment is valuable in substantiating the bedside impression — particularly for detecting "subclinical" involvement of cognitive domains that help to define the phenotype, for quantifying impairment in domains that may be difficult to assess at the bedside (such as semantic memory or sentence comprehension), and for tracking deterioration over time. On MRI, lack of the focal brain atrophy profiles that characterise FTD or prominent white matter change are important clues to an alternative disease.

Because of the wide phenotypic variation within the spectra of Alzheimer's disease and FTD, it can be difficult to differentiate FTD from Alzheimer's disease in an individual case based on clinical and imaging features. Clinical "red flags" that a patient has FTD rather than Alzheimer's disease include early prominent behavioural features, especially if the social façade breaks down or insight is lost and if episodic and topographical memory remain relatively intact. Profiling of neurodegeneration marker proteins in cerebrospinal fluid is increasingly used in clinical diagnosis: a raised ratio of total tau protein to beta amyloid1 42 peptide sensitively predicts Alzheimer's pathology, and incorporation of other amyloid and phosphorylated tau species may further enhance diagnosis. Cerebrospinal fluid profiling is likely in future to be supplemented by molecular neuroimaging (for example, for amyloid) and by more specialised structural MRI analysis tools. One large study found that cerebrospinal fluid profiling and analysis of brain MRI data with a specialised classifier algorithm could distinguish pathologically proven FTD from Alzheimer's disease with around 75% accuracy. However, such techniques remain to be widely translated beyond specialist centres.

### Neuroimaging in frontotemporal dementia: heterogeneity and relationships with underlying neuropathology [^115YAuJG]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia encompasses a group of clinical syndromes defined pathologically by degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes. Historically, these syndromes have been challenging to diagnose, with an average of about three years between the time of symptom onset and the initial evaluation and diagnosis. Research in the field of neuroimaging has revealed numerous biomarkers of the various frontotemporal dementia syndromes, which has provided clinicians with a method of narrowing the differential diagnosis and improving diagnostic accuracy. As such, neuroimaging is considered a core investigative tool in the evaluation of neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, patterns of neurodegeneration correlate with the underlying neuropathological substrates of the frontotemporal dementia syndromes, which can aid clinicians in determining the underlying etiology and improve prognostication. This review explores the advancements in neuroimaging and discusses the phenotypic and pathologic features of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, semantic variant primary progressive aphasia, and nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia, as seen on structural magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography.

### Clinical review. frontotemporal dementia [^112eJYFp]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a clinically and pathologically heterogeneous group of non-Alzheimer dementias characterised collectively by relatively selective, progressive atrophy involving the frontal or temporal lobes, or both. Cases of FTD have been described since the late 19th century, initially most comprehensively by Arnold Pick, who lent his name to the historical designation of the entire FTD spectrum as Pick's disease. Only in the past three decades, however, has the clinical and pathological complexity of these diseases and their unique status as examples of selective brain degeneration been fully appreciated. FTD is substantially less common than Alzheimer's disease, with estimates of population prevalence ranging from four to 15 per 100 000 before age 65 years in European and US epidemiological studies. However, this disease group is of disproportionate importance as a cause of young onset dementia and all the attendant socioeconomic and human costs that entails. Although onset is typically in the sixth decade of life, it may begin as early as the third or as late as the ninth decade, and the prevalence of FTD in older age groups has almost certainly been underestimated.

### Alzheimer's disease or behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia? Review of key points toward an accurate clinical and neuropsychological diagnosis [^114eVqo8]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are the most common neurodegenerative early-onset dementias. Despite the fact that both conditions have a very distinctive clinical pattern, they present with an overlap in their cognitive and behavioral features that may lead to misdiagnosis or delay in diagnosis. The current review intends to summarize briefly the main differences at the clinical, neuropsychological, and behavioral levels, in an attempt to suggest which aspects would facilitate an adequate diagnosis in a clinical setting, especially in Latin American and low- and middle-income countries, where the resources needed for a differential diagnosis (such as MRI or biomarkers) are not always available. A timely diagnosis of AD and FTD have significant implications for the medical management and quality of life of patients and careers.

### Conceptual framework for the definition of preclinical and prodromal frontotemporal dementia [^112FwGda]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2022). Medium credibility.

The presymptomatic stages of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are still poorly defined and encompass a long accrual of progressive biological (preclinical) and then clinical (prodromal) changes, antedating the onset of dementia. The heterogeneity of clinical presentations and the different neuropathological phenotypes have prevented a prior clear description of either preclinical or prodromal FTD. Recent advances in therapeutic approaches, at least in monogenic disease, demand a proper definition of these predementia stages. It has become clear that a consensus lexicon is needed to comprehensively describe the stages that anticipate dementia. The goal of the present work is to review existing literature on the preclinical and prodromal phases of FTD, providing recommendations to address the unmet questions, therefore laying out a strategy for operationalizing and better characterizing these presymptomatic disease stages.

### New approaches to the treatment of frontotemporal dementia [^115kN9sj]. Neurotherapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) comprises a diverse group of clinical neurodegenerative syndromes characterized by progressive changes in behavior, personality, executive function, language, and motor function. Approximately 20% of FTD cases have a known genetic cause. The three most common genetic mutations causing FTD are discussed. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration refers to the heterogeneous group of neuropathology underlying FTD clinical syndromes. While there are no current disease-modifying treatments for FTD, management includes off-label pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological approaches to target symptoms. The utility of several different drug classes is discussed. Medications used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease have no benefit in FTD and can worsen neuropsychiatric symptoms. Non-pharmacological approaches to management include lifestyle modifications, speech-, occupational-, and physical therapy, peer and caregiver support, and safety considerations. Recent developments in the understanding of the genetics, pathophysiology, neuropathology, and neuroimmunology underlying FTD clinical syndromes have expanded possibilities for disease-modifying and symptom-targeted treatments. Different pathogenetic mechanisms are targeted in several active clinical trials, opening up exciting possibilities for breakthrough advances in treatment and management of FTD spectrum disorders.

### Behavioural changes in frontotemporal dementia and their cognitive and neuroanatomical correlates [^116z2awf]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Behavioural changes are a core manifestation of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and have a considerable impact on both patients and their caregivers. They are classically associated with behavioural-variant FTD (bvFTD) and the prefrontal cortical atrophy in this condition, although they have also been linked to other brain areas and changes in connectivity. Behavioural changes are now recognized as common in semantic dementia (SD; encompassing semantic-variant primary progressive aphasia and 'right' semantic dementia or right temporal variant FTD), where pathology is centred on the anterior temporal lobes (ATLs), leading to degraded semantic memory. This study aimed to resolve two key current gaps in clinical knowledge. First, are the behavioural changes in bvFTD and SD largely the same or are there qualitatively distinct behavioural profiles? Identifying discriminative behaviours would improve management and expectations in clinic and improve bvFTD versus SD diagnostic accuracy. Such accuracy is particularly relevant for disease-modifying clinical trial design, because the two disorders are typically associated with different neuropathologies. Second, what are the precise contributions of the prefrontal cortex and the ATL in supporting social behaviour? Revealing the cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms underlying behaviour change in FTD is vital for informing the development of targeted pharmacological and behavioural interventions. To address these clinical conundrums, we explored the range of behavioural changes that are caused by FTD and the similarities and/or differences between FTD subtypes. Participants also completed extensive neuropsychological testing and structural MRI, to investigate the cognitive and neuroanatomical bases of changed behaviours. This calls for a transdiagnostic approach, including not only archetypal cases of bvFTD and SD but also 'mixed' or intermediate cases that express prominent clinical features of both conditions, as part of a continuous clinical spectrum.

### Frontotemporal dementias: main syndromes and underlying brain changes [^112vC9mj]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a rare dementia, that accounts for about 15% of all dementia cases. Despite consensus diagnostic criteria, FTD remains difficult to diagnose in life because of its complex and variable clinical phenomenology and heterogeneous disorders. This review provides an update on the current knowledge of the main FTD syndromes — the behavioural variant, semantic variant, and nonfluent/agrammatic variant — their brain abnormalities and genetic profiles.

Recent Findings

The complexity of the clinical features in FTD has become increasingly apparent, particularly in the domain of behaviour. Such behaviour changes are now also being recognized in the language variants of FTD. Initial interest on emotion processing and social cognition is now complemented by studies on other behavioural disturbance, that spans gambling, antisocial behaviours, repetitive behaviours, and apathy. At a biological level, novel pathological subcategories continue to be identified. From a genetic viewpoint, abnormalities in three genes explain nearly three quarters of familial cases of FTD.

Summary

In the absence of effective drug treatments, novel approaches are needed to target some of the most disabling features of FTD, such as language loss or behaviour disturbance. Recent interventions appear promising but will require confirmation.

### Frontotemporal dementia [^112682mW]. The Lancet: Neurology (2005). Medium credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a focal clinical syndrome characterised by profound changes in personality and social conduct and associated with circumscribed degeneration of the prefrontal and anterior temporal cortex. Onset is typically in the middle years of life and survival is about 8 years. The presence of microtubule-associated-protein-tau-based pathological features in some patients and the discovery, in some familial cases, of mutations in the tau gene links FTD to other forms of tauopathy, such as progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. However, more than half of all patients with FTD, including some with a strong family history, show no apparent abnormality in the tau gene or protein, indicating pathological and aetiological heterogeneity. FTD provides a challenge both for clinical management and for theoretical understanding of its neurobiological substrate.

### Frontotemporal dementia and related disorders: deciphering the enigma [^115MVxJ7]. Annals of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

In the past century, particularly the last decade, there has been enormous progress in our understanding of frontotemporal dementia, a non-Alzheimer's type dementia. Large clinicopathological series have been published that have clearly demonstrated an overlap between the clinical syndromes subsumed under the term frontotemporal dementia and the progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome, corticobasal syndrome, and motor neuron disease. There have also been significant advancements in brain imaging, neuropathology, and molecular genetics that have led to different approaches to classification. Unfortunately, the field is complicated by a barrage of overlapping clinical syndromes and histopathological diagnoses that does not allow one to easily identify relations between individual clinical syndromic presentations and underlying neuropathology. This review deciphers this web of terminology and highlights consistent, and hence important, associations between individual clinical syndromes and neuropathology. These associations could ultimately allow the identification of appropriate patient phenotypes for future targeted treatments.

The landscape of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) has evolved remarkably in recent years and is barely recognizable from two decades ago. Knowledge of the clinical phenomenology, cognition, neuroimaging, genetics, pathology of the different subtypes of FTD, and their relations to other neurodegenerative conditions, has increased rapidly, due in part, to the growing interests into these neurodegenerative brain conditions. This article reviews the major advances in the field of FTD over the past 20 years, focusing primarily on the work of Frontier, the frontotemporal dementia clinical research group, based in Sydney, Australia. Topics covered include clinical presentations (cognition, behavior, neuroimaging), pathology, genetics, and disease progression, as well as interventions and carer directed research. This review demonstrates the improvement in diagnostic accuracy and capacity to provide advice on genetic risks, prognosis, and outcome. The next major challenge will be to capitalize on these research findings to develop effective disease modifying drugs, which are currently lacking.

### The frontotemporal dementias [^111eiBV5]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a heterogeneous group of hereditary and sporadic neurodegenerative disorders affecting frontotemporal areas. FTD, a leading cause of young-onset dementia, is often initially mistaken for primary psychiatric disorders. Based on early and predominant symptoms, different clinical syndromes can be distinguished: the behavioral variant and 2 variants of progressive aphasia; semantic dementia and progressive nonfluent aphasia. Neuropathological classification is based on protein accumulation in the brain. Pathogenic mutations in different genes have been identified. Specific pharmacological treatment is the main research goal. Meanwhile the management must focus on early correct diagnosis, symptom alleviation, caregiver support and educational interventions.

### Key emerging issues in frontotemporal dementia [^111WYaDV]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) encompasses the syndromes of behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD) and primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and refers to those neurodegenerative diseases characterised by predominant pathological involvement of the frontal and temporal lobes. Recent years have witnessed major advances in the clinical characterisation of FTD, reflected in the publication of updated diagnostic criteria for bvFTD and PPA, and the discovery of new pathogenic mutations has added to the understanding of genotype-phenotype interactions and of disease mechanisms. Emerging results from longitudinal studies of familial FTD show that imaging and cognitive changes occur years before symptom onset and such studies may yield biomarkers of early disease that in turn will facilitate earlier diagnosis. The hope and (guarded) expectation is that these advances may together herald the beginning of the end of the chapter in which FTD is considered an inexorably progressive and untreatable condition.

### Fourteen years later: reviewing the diagnostic criteria for behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia [^113TARxn]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis can range in certainty between "possible", "probable", or "definite". A "possible" diagnosis of bvFTD is indicated in the presence of progressive emergence and recurrence of at least three of the core clinical features, in any combination. A diagnosis of "probable" bvFTD is reached in the presence of documented decline in functional ability, as well as evidence of characteristic changes on structural or functional brain neuroimaging. Finally, a diagnosis of "definite" bvFTD is established in the presence of histopathological confirmation or identification of a causative gene mutation. Retrospective analyses of these diagnostic criteria have demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity for both young‐ and late‐onset bvFTD.

Fourteen years since their publication, it has become increasingly apparent that these diagnostic criteria are not without their limitations. For example, the operationalization of these criteria is not provided, nor is the timeframe for what constitutes an "early" change. The threshold for detection of behavioral change from a pre‐disease baseline requires more investigation, particularly across culturally and linguistically diverse groups. Similarly, the cognitive profile of bvFTD is far from uniform. Executive dysfunction is neither uniquely nor exclusively impaired in bvFTD. Additionally, a subset of bvFTD patients present with marked episodic memory deficits in excess of impaired attention or prefrontal retrieval processes. Indeed, accumulating evidence has shown that the presence of marked episodic memory deficits does not exclude a diagnosis of bvFTD and that visuospatial deficits are more common than previously thought at various disease stages.

What are the management options in frontotemporal dementia?

There are no therapies currently shown to alter the evolution of any of the diseases in the FTD spectrum. Management is therefore directed to controlling symptoms and otherwise helping patients and their caregivers cope with the impact of their illness, including engagement of community mental health, social services, day centres, and other support networks. Patients and families need clear and specific advice as they face a future of increasing dependency, often including occupational and financial planning. This is particularly urgent where (as is often the case in FTD) patients lack insight into the true extent of their difficulties. Early, accurate diagnosis and mobilisation of appropriate support services at present offer the best prospect of effective management for patients with FTD.

Non-pharmacological management strategies are based largely on anecdote and clinical experience rather than controlled evidence. Safety and risk management are important considerations that may entail environmental or other modifications affecting diverse aspects of the patient's daily life: depending on the disease stage, these may include occupational and social activities, children or other vulnerable dependents, driving, swallowing, and mobility. Decisions about safety and competence may be particularly challenging earlier in the course of behavioural variant FTD, but the desire to preserve autonomy must be weighed against the potential for occupational, financial, social, or forensic hazards.

Simple interventions (puzzles, music, and other structured activities, controlled access to food and drink) may help govern troublesome behaviours and contribute to a stable routine. Motor and gait symptoms should be anticipated as the disease evolves. Speech and language therapy can provide simple communication aids, as well as assessment of swallowing and advice on dietary modification, and mobility and continence aids often become necessary later in the course. Programmed respite, counselling, and psychological support for caregivers should not be overlooked: in contrast to other neurodegenerative diseases (notably Alzheimer's disease), FTD tends to strike early at the core of personal identity, and the sense of living with a stranger is often a source of profound distress for families and caregivers. Genetic counselling of at-risk family members adds a further challenge and should always be undertaken in collaboration with a clinical genetics service.

### Neuroimaging in frontotemporal dementia: heterogeneity and relationships with underlying neuropathology [^112PJkMt]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a group of clinically and pathologically heterogeneous syndromes that, historically, have been challenging to diagnose. This challenge is partly due to the rarity of these conditions and lack of familiarity by physicians, however, diagnostic accuracy is also complicated by the complexity and wide range of clinical manifestations of the various FTD syndromes. The ability to visualize the brain in vivo has been fundamental to understanding the pathophysiology of FTD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Historically, neuroimaging was used to "rule out" other potential pathologies responsible for or contribute to cognitive impairment. However, our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases and the development of new neuroimaging techniques and more sophisticated analysis methods have expanded dramatically over the past decades, ultimately leading to the identification of neuroimaging signatures associated with specific neurodegenerative diseases. These advancements have led to neuroimaging being considered a core clinical investigative tool in evaluating cognitive disorders.

### Prevalence, characteristics, and survival of frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes [^111ptxid]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To estimate the lifetime risk, prevalence, incidence, and mortality of the principal clinical syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) using revised diagnostic criteria and including intermediate clinical phenotypes.

Methods

Multisource referral over 2 years to identify all diagnosed or suspected cases of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), or corticobasal syndrome (CBS) in 2 UK counties (population 1.69 million). Diagnostic confirmation used current consensus diagnostic criteria after interview and reexamination. Results were adjusted to the 2013 European standard population.

Results

The prevalence of FTD, PSP, and CBS was 10.8/100,000. The incidence and mortality were very similar, at 1.61/100,000 and 1.56/100,000 person-years, respectively. The estimated lifetime risk is 1 in 742. Survival following diagnosis varied widely: from PSP 2.9 years to semantic variant FTD 9.1 years. Age-adjusted prevalence peaked between 65 and 69 years at 42.6/100,000: the age-adjusted prevalence for persons older than 65 years is double the prevalence for those between 40 and 64 years. Fifteen percent of those screened had a relevant genetic mutation.

Conclusions

Key features of this study include the revised diagnostic criteria with improved specificity and sensitivity, an unrestricted age range, and simultaneous assessment of multiple FTLD syndromes. The prevalence of FTD, PSP, and CBS increases beyond 65 years, with frequent genetic causes. The time from onset to diagnosis and from diagnosis to death varies widely among syndromes, emphasizing the challenge and importance of accurate and timely diagnosis. A high index of suspicion for FTLD syndromes is required by clinicians, even for older patients.

### From FUS to fibs: what's new in frontotemporal dementia? [^112k3ryS]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an important cause of non-Alzheimer's dementia and is the second most common cause of young onset dementia. FTD presents with progressive changes in behavior and personality (behavioral variant FTD) or language deficits (also known as primary progressive aphasia), although both commonly coexist. Patients with progressive aphasia are subclassified according to the pattern of language deficits into those with progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia (SD). FTD is pathologically heterogeneous, both macroscopically and on a molecular level, with tau positive, TDP-43 positive, and FUS positive intraneuronal inclusions recognized on immunohistochemical analysis. TDP-43 positive inclusions are also a feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathology, corroborating the observation of overlapping clinical features between the two conditions and reaffirming the FTD-ALS disease spectrum. Most FTD cases are sporadic, but an important minority is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, most commonly due to MAPT or progranulin gene mutations. Familial clusters of FTD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are also recognized but poorly understood. This paper reviews the clinical phenotypes, assessment and treatment of FTD in light of recent pathological and genetic discoveries.

### Redefining the multidimensional clinical phenotypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes [^115jhGXc]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The clinical disorders caused by frontotemporal lobar degeneration pathologies (FTLD) are highly heterogeneous in their pathology and phenotypes. Patients are typically diagnosed as having one of several principal syndromes, including behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), primary progressive aphasia [with the non-fluent (nfvPPA) and semantic (svPPA) subtypes], progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) or corticobasal syndrome (CBS). The clinicopathological correlations of these syndromes are imprecise. For example, bvFTD can be associated with tau, TDP-43, FUS protein inclusions or mixed neuropathology. Some clinical syndromes, such as PSP-Richardson's syndrome, have good correlation with the associated pathology; however, the corresponding pathology may have diverse phenotypic expressions. Recent revisions of diagnostic criteria recognize this heterogeneity, and there may be future improvements in clinicopathological correlations by imaging or fluid-based biomarkers, aiming to optimize patient selection for disease-modifying therapies.

Here we propose that the effort to refine diagnostic segregation of the disorders has fundamental limitations. These are not merely due to the limits of a given test or biomarker but are biologically real constraints that can in turn be informative about the nature of the disorders. We suggest that a better understanding of aetiology and pathophysiology, and more effective therapies, can be gained by examining the phenotypic patterns across the broad spectrum of all FTLD-associated disease. Symptomatic therapies may especially benefit from such a transdiagnostic approach, selecting patients based on the presence of relevant clinical features, whichever their diagnostic label or proteinopathy.

A transdiagnostic approach is increasingly used in psychiatry, epitomized by the Research Domain Criteria methodology. A similar approach is applicable to neurodegenerative diseases with overlapping phenotypes and cognitive deficits after stroke. There are many overlapping symptoms and indistinct phenotypic boundaries between FTLD syndromes. For example, executive dysfunction is a common cognitive impairment across FTLD-associated syndromes and changes in behaviour, social cognition and personality, while characteristic of bvFTD, are also seen in PSP, CBS and the primary progressive aphasias. Neuropsychiatric symptoms, including apathy and impulsivity, occur in multiple FTLD syndromes. The movement disorders typical of PSP and CBS can also develop in patients diagnosed with bvFTD and nfvPPA. Language impairments are seen across all FTLD syndromes, including bvFTD, PSP and CBS.

### Genotype-phenotype links in frontotemporal lobar degeneration [^115JQ5zF]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) represents a group of neurodegenerative brain diseases with highly heterogeneous clinical, neuropathological and genetic characteristics. This high degree of heterogeneity results from the presence of several different underlying molecular disease processes; consequently, it is unlikely that all patients with FTLD will benefit from a single therapy. Therapeutic strategies for FTLD are currently being explored, and tools are urgently needed that enable the selection of patients who are the most likely to benefit from a particular therapy. Definition of the phenotypic characteristics in patients with different FTLD subtypes that share the same underlying disease processes would assist in the stratification of patients into homogeneous groups. The most common subtype of FTLD is characterized by TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology (FTLD-TDP). In this group, pathogenic mutations have been identified in four genes: C9orf72, GRN, TBK1 and VCP. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the phenotypic characteristics of patients with FTLD-TDP, highlighting shared features and differences among groups of patients who have a pathogenic mutation in one of these four genes.

### Machine-learning applications in frontotemporal dementia: challenges, prospects and viable clinical applications [^114PL2FB]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Machine‐learning (ML) models and 'big data' have revolutionised data interpretation in neurodegenerative conditions. We are witnessing a paradigm shift from large descriptive studies describing group‐level phenomena, genotype‐associated traits and phenotype‐specific biomarker signatures to studies meaningfully interpreting data from individual patients and accurately classifying them into relevant diagnostic, phenotypic and prognostic categories. In the era of biomarker‐supported pharmaceutical trials, precision clinical monitoring and validated prognostic indicators, ML models are likely to play a central role in clinical decision making and monitoring for years to come.

Low‐incidence neurodegenerative disorders, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD), are notoriously difficult to diagnose early, soon after symptom onset, and the emphasis initially is on ruling out alternative structural, neuroinflammatory, paraneoplastic or more common neurodegenerative conditions that can mimic FTD. FTD and ALS have overlapping clinical, radiological, molecular and genetic characteristics, and comorbid ALS‐FTD is a well‐recognised entity. FTD spectrum disorders manifest insidiously after a long presymptomatic phase with subtle, but relentlessly progressive symptoms, and develop into distinctive FTD phenotypes with unique neuroimaging signatures. Diagnostic delay in FTD has considerable practical implications, such as the delayed introduction of supportive measures, delayed genetic screening and genetic counselling of family members, and ultimately, protracted recruitment into pharmaceutical trials. With practical clinical objectives in mind, a multitude ML‐based applications has been proposed recently to distinguish FTD from AD radiologically and differentiate various FTD subtypes.

### Proposed research criteria for prodromal behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia [^111wyvRk]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Detecting the earliest clinical features of neurodegenerative diseases is important for appropriate clinical trial enrolment and optimal patient care. Clinical prodromes of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies have been previously defined, with published diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease, and prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies. To date, no formal criteria have been generated for prodromal behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD).

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the fourth most common dementia, and disproportionately affects younger individuals. The median onset is during the sixth decade, though onset may be as early as the third decade. Between 15–30% of all FTD cases follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. The majority of genetic FTD is caused by mutations in the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) or progranulin (GRN) genes, or a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72), though a number of other disease-causing mutations have been decribed. MAPT, GRN and C9orf72 mutations are highly penetrant. Carriers of autosomal dominant pathogenic mutations represent a valuable cohort for characterizing the disease prodrome because disease onset is, to some degree, predictable, allowing the earliest stages of disease to be tracked. Furthermore, neuropathology in genetic mutation carriers can be predicted. Sporadic cases of bvFTD tend to come to the attention of specialists after the prodromal phase, and require autopsy data (neuropathological evaluation) to confirm disease pathology.

### Qualitative neuropsychological performance characteristics in frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease [^115jyx1m]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease are clinically distinct disorders, yet neuropsychological studies have had variable success in distinguishing them. A possible reason is that studies typically rely on overall accuracy scores, which may obscure differences in reasons for failure.

Objectives

To explore the hypothesis that analysis of qualitative performance characteristics and error types, in addition to overall numerical scores, would enhance the neuropsychological distinction between FTD and Alzheimer's disease.

Methods

38 patients with FTD and 73 with Alzheimer's disease underwent assessment of language, visuospatial abilities, memory, and executive function, using a neuropsychological screening instrument and standard neuropsychological tests. In each of these cognitive domains, performance characteristics and error types were documented, in addition to numerical scores on tests.

Results

Whereas comparison of neuropsychological test scores revealed some group differences, these did not occur consistently across tests within cognitive domains. However, analysis of performance characteristics and error types revealed qualitative differences between the two groups. In particular, FTD patients displayed features associated with frontal lobe dysfunction, such as concrete thought, perseveration, confabulation, and poor organisation, which disrupted performance across the range of neuropsychological tests.

Conclusions

Numerical scores on neuropsychological tests alone are of limited value in differentiating FTD and Alzheimer's disease, but performance characteristics and error types enhance the distinction between the two disorders. FTD is associated with a profound behavioural syndrome that affects performance on cognitive assessment, obscuring group differences. Qualitative information should be included in neuropsychological research and clinical assessments.

### A new framework for conceptualizing symptoms in frontotemporal dementia: from animal models to the clinic [^111xwNk5]. Brain (2018). Low credibility.

Behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia is characterized by a number of ostensibly disparate clinical features, which have largely been considered independently. This update proposes an integrated conceptual framework for these symptoms, by bringing together findings from animal studies, functional neuroimaging and behavioural neurology. The combined evidence indicates that many of the clinical symptoms — such as altered eating behaviour; overspending and susceptibility to scams; reduced empathy and socially inappropriate behaviour; apathy and stereotyped/ritualistic behaviour — can be conceptualized as a common underlying deficiency in goal-directed behaviour and the concomitant emergence of habits. This view is supported by similarities between the characteristic patterns of frontostriatal and insular atrophy in behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia and the circuitry of homologous brain regions responsible for goal-directed and habitual behaviour in animals. Appreciating the impact of disturbance in goal-directed behaviour provides a new, integrated understanding of the common mechanisms underpinning prototypical clinical symptoms in behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia. Furthermore, by drawing parallels between animal and clinical research, this translational approach has important implications for the development and evaluation of novel therapeutic treatments, from animal models through to behavioural interventions and clinical trials in humans.10.1093/brain/awy123_video1awy123media15796485557001.

1 INTRODUCTION

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) encompasses a spectrum of focal neurodegenerative diseases with progressive atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes.FTLD‐related disorders are heterogeneous clinical conditions, characterized by social dysfunctions and personality change along with impairment in language, executive, and motor functions. Current clinical diagnostic criteria characterize specific presentations of FTLD, including the behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD)and the primary progressive aphasias, with the agrammatic variant (avPPA) and semantic variant (svPPA) subtypes. Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)corticobasal syndrome (CBS), and FTD with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTD‐ALS) are also usually caused by subtypes of FTLD. There is limited correlation between these clinical syndromes and neuropathological features. The neuropathological signature is associated mainly with either tau or transactive response (TAR)‐DNA‐binding protein‐43 (TDP‐43) protein inclusions. Despite limited clinicopathological correlations, some types of FTLD have a strong genetic background. Up to ≈30% of FTD patients have positive family history, with mutations in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72), progranulin (GRN), or microtubule‐associated protein tau (MAPT) genes each accounting for 5% to 10% of patients.

In the last 10 years, in depth clinical characterization of FTLD‐associated features improved and operationalized clinical diagnostic criteria, and the use of biomarkers aimed at excluding Alzheimer's disease (AD), have prompted a wider recognition of the diseases in clinical settings. This in turn increases the estimated incidence. However, epidemiological studies assessing the FTLD‐related disorders overall incidence and the relative frequency of the different phenotypes in the general population are scarce, with marked variation in results. This variation can be attributed in part to narrow disease‐specific and phenotype based focus of individual studies; restriction to different age‐delimited sections of the population; and use of historical diagnostic criteria (before current consensus guidelines for each FTLD‐related disorder). Data on genetic correlates in different population‐representative cohorts remain sparse.

### Behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia: diagnosis, clinical staging, and management [^116VpSWf]. The Lancet: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

Patients with behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) present with insidious changes in personality and interpersonal conduct that indicate progressive disintegration of the neural circuits involved in social cognition, emotion regulation, motivation, and decision making. The underlying pathological changes are heterogeneous and are characterised by various intraneuronal inclusions. Biomarkers to detect these histopathological changes in life are becoming increasingly important with the development of disease-modifying drugs. Gene mutations have been found that collectively account for around 10–20% of cases. Recently, criteria proposed for bvFTD define three levels of diagnostic certainty: possible, probable, and definite. Detailed history taking from family members to elicit behavioural features underpins the diagnostic process, with support from neuropsychological testing designed to detect impairment in decision making, emotion processing, and social cognition. Brain imaging is important for increasing the level of diagnostic certainty. A recently developed staging instrument shows much promise for monitoring patients and evaluating therapies, which at present are aimed at symptom amelioration. Carer education and support remain of paramount importance.

UNDERSTANDING DISEASE PROGRESSION IN FTD

Together with diagnosis, one of the most common questions patients with dementia and their families ask is regarding prognosis. Disease duration in frontotemporal dementia is approximately 7–9 years on average from onset of clinical symptoms. It is, however, highly variable, and ranging between 18 months and > 20 years. Disease duration also varies across FTD subtypes. It tends to be longer in the language than the behavioral syndromes.

In bvFTD, the disease progression is also variable. Importantly, the current diagnostic criteria for a diagnosis of 'probable' bvFTD offer high clinical certainty. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of individuals meeting the 'probable' criteria at baseline will continue to do so over time, or will move to the 'certain' diagnostic category (either because of postmortem confirmation or because of results from genetic investigations). In other words, while the exact underlying pathology in these individuals may still be unclear, the likelihood of being FTLD is high. The provision of the 'possible' and 'probable' disease certainty classification in the revision of the consensus criteria, has enabled the identification and investigation of 'possible' cases. In these individuals, the initial clinical presentation is unclear, often because of a lack of supporting neuroimaging evidence, or because of a limited constellation of clinical symptoms. Progression of these 'possible' bvFTD cases over time is becoming better understood, whereby half of these individuals will end up meeting the more stringent criteria for 'probable' or even 'definite' bvFTD over time. In these, individuals, the presence of memory deficits on cognitive testing at baseline, together with a positive family history of dementia appear to be the best predictors of a future 'probable' diagnosis.

### Fourteen years later: reviewing the diagnostic criteria for behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia [^112HSkHE]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Another challenge is that many of the core diagnostic features of bvFTD are also present in other neurodegenerative and non‐neurodegenerative conditions. Apathy, disinhibition, and reduced empathy are common features in primary psychiatric disorders (e.g. depression, bipolar disorder). Similarly, language and episodic memory deficits, which are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD), are present with variable severity in bvFTD. Further, given the progressive nature of dementia, clinical features tend to coalesce across disorders, presenting a challenge for clinicians when examining someone in the later stages of the disease.

In light of this evidence, this study aimed to identify the most common clinical features and feature profiles among individuals diagnosed with bvFTD in the FRONTIER cohort in Sydney, Australia, since the publication of the diagnostic criteria, and determine their relations to clinical outcomes. Given the multiple permutations possible among this set of features, it is important to establish whether the presence or absence of certain features is indicative of a particular disease profile, including severity, progression, or survival.

We collated longitudinal data for 110 consecutive patients diagnosed with probable bvFTD at study entry using consistent operational thresholds for the behavioral and cognitive features. Using this approach, we aimed to determine the real‐world frequency of each core criterion and its combinations at presentation to evaluate the clinical applicability of the diagnostic criteria for bvFTD. In addition, based on these data, we suggest potential modifications to the current criteria to aid with early and accurate diagnosis, predict patient trajectories and aid eventual access to clinical trials.

### Age at symptom onset and death and disease duration in genetic frontotemporal dementia: an international retrospective cohort study [^113PvjAd]. The Lancet: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Frontotemporal dementia is a genetically and pathologically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease. The most common clinical subtypes of this disease are behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, presenting with changes in personality and executive dysfunction, and primary progressive aphasia, in which individuals develop impairment of language processing. Three forms of primary progressive aphasia have been described: semantic, non-fluent or agrammatic, and logopenic; however, up to 20% of people do not fit the criteria for any of these variants and are categorised as having primary progressive aphasia not otherwise specified. Both behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and primary progressive aphasia overlap with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and with the atypical parkinsonian syndromes corticobasal syndrome and progressive supranuclear palsy.

About a third of frontotemporal dementia cases are genetic, with mutations in multiple genes shown to be causative of this disease. However, most of the heritability of frontotemporal dementia is accounted for by mutations in three genes: progranulin (GRN), microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), and chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72; also known as C9orf72 -SMCR8 complex subunit). Although much has been learned over the past decade about the clinical features of these genetic forms of frontotemporal dementia, most studies exploring age at symptom onset and disease duration have been small and geographically restricted. – In particular, although individual case series have suggested that such phenotypic characteristics can be quite variable, no studies have systematically investigated these factors across all the different genetic groups and the different mutations found within these groups.

Therefore, in this large international study, we aimed to analyse phenotypic characteristics of the main three forms of genetic frontotemporal dementia, including ages at symptom onset and death and disease duration, as well as examining the effect of mutation type and family membership on these factors.

Can we predict molecular pathologies in frontotemporal dementia?

Despite recent histopathological and genetic advances, accurate prediction of underlying molecular pathologies within the FTD spectrum remains problematic (fig 1). This has important implications for targeting future disease modifying therapies and, more immediately, for counselling of patients and family members. While phenotypic variation and overlap are substantial, certain clinico-anatomical profiles are consistently associated with particular molecular pathologies (see fig 1). These include FTD with motor neurone disease associated with TDP-43 pathology; the semantic dementia syndrome and focal, asymmetric temporal lobe atrophy with TDP-43 type C pathology; behavioural variant FTD of very young onset and prominent caudate atrophy with FUS pathology; and the progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome with a specific tauopathy. Non-fluent speech breakdown and the development of parkinsonism are more commonly associated with tau than non-tau pathologies. The heritability of particular FTD syndromes varies substantially: semantic dementia is generally sporadic, whereas behavioural variant FTD and corticobasal syndrome are highly genetically as well as pathologically heterogeneous. Useful neuroanatomical associations which may help guide genetic testing include relatively symmetric anteromesial temporal lobe atrophy with MAPT mutations and striking asymmetric hemispheric atrophy with GRN mutations (see fig 1).

### Frontotemporal dementia: clinicopathological correlations [^1141GP3s]. Annals of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is characterized by impairments in social, behavioral, and/or language function, but postmortem studies indicate that multiple neuropathological entities lead to FTLD. This study assessed whether specific clinical features predict the underlying pathology.

Methods

A clinicopathological correlation was performed on 90 consecutive patients with a pathological diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia and was compared with an additional 24 cases accrued during the same time period with a clinical diagnosis of FTLD, but with pathology not typically associated with frontotemporal dementia.

Results

Postmortem examination showed multiple pathologies including tauopathies (46%), FTLD with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (29%), and Alzheimer's disease (17%). The pathological groups manifested some distinct demographic, clinical, and neuropsychological features, although these attributes showed only a statistical association with the underlying pathology. FTLD with ubiquitin-positive inclusions was more likely to present with both social and language dysfunction, and motor neuron disease was more likely to emerge in these patients. Tauopathies were more commonly associated with an extrapyramidal disorder. Alzheimer's disease was associated with relatively greater deficits in memory and executive function.

Interpretation

Clinical and neuropsychological features contribute to delineating the spectrum of pathology underlying a patient diagnosed with FTLD, but biomarkers are needed that, together with the clinical phenotype, can predict the underlying neuropathology.

### Sensitivity of revised diagnostic criteria for the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia [^116cNnWb]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

Based on the recent literature and collective experience, an international consortium developed revised guidelines for the diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. The validation process retrospectively reviewed clinical records and compared the sensitivity of proposed and earlier criteria in a multi-site sample of patients with pathologically verified frontotemporal lobar degeneration. According to the revised criteria, 'possible' behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia requires three of six clinically discriminating features (disinhibition, apathy/inertia, loss of sympathy/empathy, perseverative/compulsive behaviours, hyperorality and dysexecutive neuropsychological profile). 'Probable' behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia adds functional disability and characteristic neuroimaging, while behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia 'with definite frontotemporal lobar degeneration' requires histopathological confirmation or a pathogenic mutation. Sixteen brain banks contributed cases meeting histopathological criteria for frontotemporal lobar degeneration and a clinical diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies or vascular dementia at presentation. Cases with predominant primary progressive aphasia or extra-pyramidal syndromes were excluded. In these autopsy-confirmed cases, an experienced neurologist or psychiatrist ascertained clinical features necessary for making a diagnosis according to previous and proposed criteria at presentation. Of 137 cases where features were available for both proposed and previously established criteria, 118 (86%) met 'possible' criteria, and 104 (76%) met criteria for 'probable' behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. In contrast, 72 cases (53%) met previously established criteria for the syndrome (P < 0.001 for comparison with 'possible' and 'probable' criteria). Patients who failed to meet revised criteria were significantly older and most had atypical presentations with marked memory impairment. In conclusion, the revised criteria for behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia improve diagnostic accuracy compared with previously established criteria in a sample with known frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Greater sensitivity of the proposed criteria may reflect the optimized diagnostic features, less restrictive exclusion features and a flexible structure that accommodates different initial clinical presentations. Future studies will be needed to establish the reliability and specificity of these revised diagnostic guidelines.

### Measurement and characterization of distinctive clinical phenotypes using the frontotemporal lobar degeneration module (FTLD-MOD) [^114kKmpu]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2020). Medium credibility.

Findings from this study will be helpful in supporting diagnostic specificity and in clarifying clinicopathologic relationships with granularity and nuance. A central challenge in the field of neurodegenerative disorders concerns the correspondence between phenotypic features of dementia and molecular pathology, and the FTLD-MOD appears well suited to detect the subtle differences in PPA versus bvFTD syndromes. Future studies will focus on investigating the utility of the FTLD-MOD to predict underlying pathologic substrates. As clinicopathologic relationships become more confidently established, disease-specific diagnostic tools and treatments can develop to further serve the FTLD community.

### Clinical phenotypes of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia by age at onset [^116hF3cK]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is known as the most common clinical variant of the frontotemporal dementia (FTD) spectrum, and the second most common cause of young-onset dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD). Characterized by severe changes in behavior and personality, bvFTD knows a large clinical variability and an age range varying from 21 to 85 years of age at onset. This heterogeneity challenges diagnostics, patient management, and trial cohort design. While the prevalence of FTD is generally considered to be highest within the age categories 45–64 years, other population-based studies reported a higher prevalence and incidence of bvFTD in elderly than commonly thought, suggesting bvFTD is relatively underdiagnosed in the elderly population. This poor recognition might be related to a different symptom presentation in late-onset bvFTD. Indeed, late-onset FTD has shown to present more frequently with memory deficits, thus reducing the sensitivity of current diagnostic criteria for bvFTD, as these consider a relatively spared memory as a supportive feature. On the other hand, early-onset FTD has been found to be characterized by predominant behavioral disturbances, and very early-onset bvFTD has been described with a prominent neuropsychiatric presentation (e.g. schizophrenia-like psychosis). In line with this thought, there is evidence for different atrophy patterns depending on age at onset, regarding more frequent and severe hippocampal sclerosis in elderly bvFTD versus frontotemporal atrophy in younger onset bvFTD. Also, several studies report that older age at onset is associated with shorter survival in dementia in general, FTD, and bvFTD, although this may be largely explained by the general notion of decreased life expectancy with aging.

### Extremely early-onset frontotemporal dementia: a case report and literature review [^112L2ZkN]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disease with behavioral and language variants. One clinical feature of FTD is an early onset; most patients experience disease onset between the ages of 45 and 65 years. However, some cases of extremely early onset have been reported in which the initiation of neurodegeneration occurred in patients in their 20 s to 30 s. The youngest onset age reported thus far is 14 years, although this is relatively rare in clinical practice.

The most challenging subtype in young patients is the behavioral variant (bvFTD). Patients with bvFTD present with early personality changes and inappropriate or disruptive behaviors that influence their normal work and daily life, thus causing heavier management burdens for both caregivers and society. In addition, bvFTD can be easily misdiagnosed in young patients thus delaying timely genetic tests and effective treatment; the rate of misdiagnosis is 70%. The potential hazards and diagnostic challenges encountered during the stages of initial presentation highlight the importance of recognizing young patients with FTD as early as possible.

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive clinical, neuroimaging, neuropsychological, genetic, and neuropathological analysis of a 25-year-old patient experiencing the onset of sporadic bvFTD with four years of follow-up. Furthermore, we conducted a literature review of patients with FTD with an onset age of 25 years or younger to summarize their clinical subtype, along with relevant genetic and pathological features.

### Neuropathological background of phenotypical variability in frontotemporal dementia [^113RFUkY]. Acta Neuropathologica (2011). Low credibility.

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the umbrella term encompassing a heterogeneous group of pathological disorders. With recent discoveries, the FTLDs have been show to classify nicely into three main groups based on the major protein deposited in the brain: FTLD-tau, FTLD-TDP and FTLD-FUS. These pathological groups, and their specific pathologies, underlie a number of well-defined clinical syndromes, including three frontotemporal dementia (FTD) variants [behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), progressive non-fluent aphasia, and semantic dementia (SD)], progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome (PSPS) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS). Understanding the neuropathological background of the phenotypic variability in FTD, PSPS and CBS requires large clinicopathological studies. We review current knowledge on the relationship between the FTLD pathologies and clinical syndromes, and pool data from a number of large clinicopathological studies that collectively provide data on 544 cases. Strong relationships were identified as follows: FTD with motor neuron disease and FTLD-TDP; SD and FTLD-TDP; PSPS and FTLD-tau; and CBS and FTLD-tau. However, the relationship between some of these clinical diagnoses and specific pathologies is not so clear cut. In addition, the clinical diagnosis of bvFTD does not have a strong relationship to any FTLD subtype or specific pathology and therefore remains a diagnostic challenge. Some evidence suggests improved clinicopathological association of bvFTD by further refining clinical characteristics. Unlike FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP, FTLD-FUS has been less well characterized, with only 69 cases reported. However, there appears to be some associations between clinical phenotypes and FTLD-FUS pathologies. Clinical diagnosis is therefore promising in predicting molecular pathology.

### Behavioural changes in frontotemporal dementia and their cognitive and neuroanatomical correlates [^112snb1F]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

The inherently shared phenotypic variation in FTD and the highly correlated atrophy across frontotemporal areas means that inter-subgroup comparisons limit the ability to localize precise functions to specific brain regions, and they can also be blind to the patterns of phenotypic variation that occur across the FTD clinical spectrum (including intermediate FTD cases who do not fall neatly into one diagnostic category). Therefore, we also used a data-driven transdiagnostic approach that treats FTD as a spectrum where patients represent phenotypic points along a frontotemporal atrophy continuum, to supplement classical diagnosis-based comparisons with multivariate analytics.

### Frontotemporal degeneration in a child [^117BbDei]. Pediatric Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

There is a predilection for the frontal and temporal lobes in certain cases of dementia in the adult, leading to the syndrome of frontotemporal dementia. However, this syndrome has seemed to elude the developing brain until now.

Methods and Results

We describe an example of apparently selective neurodegeneration of the frontal and temporal regions during development associated with some of the clinical, magnetic resonance imaging, and fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) scan features of canonical frontotemporal dementia in the adult. This patient does not have any of the common frontotemporal dementia-causing mutations or known progressive brain disorders of children.

Conclusion

This patient illustrates that symptomatic, selective, and progressive vulnerability of the frontal and temporal lobes is not restricted to adulthood, expanding the phenotype of frontotemporal degeneration.

### Regional cerebral blood flow single photon emission computed tomography for detection of frontotemporal dementia in people with suspected dementia [^111yHCcp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In the UK, dementia affects 5% of the population aged over 65 years and 25% of those over 85 years. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) represents one subtype and is thought to account for up to 16% of all degenerative dementias. Although the core of the diagnostic process in dementia rests firmly on clinical and cognitive assessments, a wide range of investigations are available to aid diagnosis. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is an established clinical tool that uses an intravenously injected radiolabelled tracer to map blood flow in the brain. In FTD the characteristic pattern seen is hypoperfusion of the frontal and anterior temporal lobes. This pattern of blood flow is different to patterns seen in other subtypes of dementia and so can be used to differentiate FTD. It has been proposed that a diagnosis of FTD, (particularly early stage), should be made not only on the basis of clinical criteria but using a combination of other diagnostic findings, including rCBF SPECT. However, more extensive testing comes at a financial cost, and with a potential risk to patient safety and comfort.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of rCBF SPECT for diagnosing FTD in populations with suspected dementia in secondary/tertiary healthcare settings and in the differential diagnosis of FTD from other dementia subtypes.

Search Methods

Our search strategy used two concepts: (a) the index test and (b) the condition of interest. We searched citation databases, including MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), BIOSIS (Ovid SP), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and LILACS (Bireme), using structured search strategies appropriate for each database. In addition we searched specialised sources of diagnostic test accuracy studies and reviews including: MEDION (Universities of Maastricht and Leuven), DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects) and HTA (Health Technology Assessment) database. We requested a search of the Cochrane Register of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies and used the related articles feature in PubMed to search for additional studies. We tracked key studies in citation databases such as Science Citation Index and Scopus to ascertain any further relevant studies. We identified 'grey' literature, mainly in the form of conference abstracts, through the Web of Science Core Collection, including Conference Proceedings Citation Index and Embase. The most recent search for this review was run on the 1 June 2013. Following title and abstract screening of the search results, full-text papers were obtained for each potentially eligible study. These papers were then independently evaluated for inclusion or exclusion.

Selection Criteria

We included both case-control and cohort (delayed verification of diagnosis) studies. Where studies used a case-control design we included all participants who had a clinical diagnosis of FTD or other dementia subtype using standard clinical diagnostic criteria. For cohort studies, we included studies where all participants with suspected dementia were administered rCBF SPECT at baseline. We excluded studies of participants from selected populations (e.g. post-stroke) and studies of participants with a secondary cause of cognitive impairment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted information on study characteristics and data for the assessment of methodological quality and the investigation of heterogeneity. We assessed the methodological quality of each study using the QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) tool. We produced a narrative summary describing numbers of studies that were found to have high/low/unclear risk of bias as well as concerns regarding applicability. To produce 2 x 2 tables, we dichotomised the rCBF SPECT results (scan positive or negative for FTD) and cross-tabulated them against the results for the reference standard. These tables were then used to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the index test. Meta-analysis was not performed due to the considerable between-study variation in clinical and methodological characteristics.

Main Results

Eleven studies (1117 participants) met our inclusion criteria. These consisted of six case-control studies, two retrospective cohort studies and three prospective cohort studies. Three studies used single-headed camera SPECT while the remaining eight used multiple-headed camera SPECT. Study design and methods varied widely. Overall, participant selection was not well described and the studies were judged as having either high or unclear risk of bias. Often the threshold used to define a positive SPECT result was not predefined and the results were reported with knowledge of the reference standard. Concerns regarding applicability of the studies to the review question were generally low across all three domains (participant selection, index test and reference standard). Sensitivities and specificities for differentiating FTD from non-FTD ranged from 0.73 to 1.00 and from 0.80 to 1.00, respectively, for the three multiple-headed camera studies. Sensitivities were lower for the two single-headed camera studies; one reported a sensitivity and specificity of 0.40 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.85) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.90 to 0.98), respectively, and the other a sensitivity and specificity of 0.36 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.50) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.95), respectively. Eight of the 11 studies which used SPECT to differentiate FTD from Alzheimer's disease used multiple-headed camera SPECT. Of these studies, five used a case-control design and reported sensitivities of between 0.52 and 1.00, and specificities of between 0.41 and 0.86. The remaining three studies used a cohort design and reported sensitivities of between 0.73 and 1.00, and specificities of between 0.94 and 1.00. The three studies that used single-headed camera SPECT reported sensitivities of between 0.40 and 0.80, and specificities of between 0.61 and 0.97.

Authors' Conclusions

At present, we would not recommend the routine use of rCBF SPECT in clinical practice because there is insufficient evidence from the available literature to support this. Further research into the use of rCBF SPECT for differentiating FTD from other dementias is required. In particular, protocols should be standardised, study populations should be well described, the threshold for 'abnormal' scans predefined and clear details given on how scans are analysed. More prospective cohort studies that verify the presence or absence of FTD during a period of follow up should be undertaken.

### Frontotemporal dementia: a review for primary care physicians [^112LGGXb]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is one of the most common forms of dementia in persons younger than 65 years. Variants include behavioral variant FTD, semantic dementia, and progressive nonfluent aphasia. Behavioral and language manifestations are core features of FTD, and patients have relatively preserved memory, which differs from Alzheimer disease. Common behavioral features include loss of insight, social inappropriateness, and emotional blunting. Common language features are loss of comprehension and object knowledge (semantic dementia), and nonfluent and hesitant speech (progressive nonfluent aphasia). Neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging) usually demonstrates focal atrophy in addition to excluding other etiologies. A careful history and physical examination, and judicious use of magnetic resonance imaging, can help distinguish FTD from other common forms of dementia, including Alzheimer disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and vascular dementia. Although no cure for FTD exists, symptom management with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics, and galantamine has been shown to be beneficial. Primary care physicians have a critical role in identifying patients with FTD and assembling an interdisciplinary team to care for patients with FTD, their families, and caregivers.

### Clinical phenotypes of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia by age at onset [^115kdFqD]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

As far as we are aware, this is the first and largest study on age-related phenotypes of bvFTD, with updated clinical criteria and biomarker validation. By excluding possible bvFTD cases lacking confirmation on neuroimaging (frontotemporal atrophy/hypometabolism), as well as cases with positive AD biomarkers, most common misdiagnoses of primary psychiatric disorders and AD were reduced. Other strengths are the examination of bvFTD onset in a wide age range, the use of an extensive cognitive test battery and up-to-date mortality data.

In conclusion, symptom profile is associated with age-at-diagnosis in bvFTD. The subtle yet significant differences in behavior and cognition may influence diagnostics and should be considered in future clinical trial design. Furthermore, our findings suggest that late disease onset and memory deficits are more frequent in bvFTD than generally thought. Future studies are needed to further examine age-related differences in bvFTD. Inclusion of longitudinal behavioral and cognitive assessment, systematic genetic screening, social cognitive evaluation, and imaging/fluid biomarkers may contribute to current findings and provide better understanding of the heterogeneous nature of bvFTD.

### Characterizing the clinical features and atrophy patterns of-related frontotemporal dementia with disease progression modeling [^111TEDaS]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Subtype Prevalence

Among the 25 symptomatic mutation carriers, 0 (0%) were categorized as normal-appearing (i.e. assigned to very early SuStaIn stages at which there is low confidence in the subtype assignment), 20 (80%) were assigned to the temporal subtype, and 5 (20%) were assigned to the frontotemporal subtype. Of the 57 presymptomatic mutation carriers, 48 (84%) were assigned to the normal-appearing group, 3 (5%) were assigned to the temporal subtype, and 6 (11%) were assigned to the frontotemporal subtype. Overall this gave a total of 33 subtypable (i.e. with detectable imaging abnormalities) mutation carriers, with a total of 23 individuals (68%) in the temporal subtype and 11 individuals (32%) in the frontotemporal subtype at baseline.

Subtype Demographics

Table 1 shows the demographics of the normal-appearing group, temporal subtype, and frontotemporal subtype. There were significant differences in age at visit, proportion of symptomatic individuals, and estimated years from onset (EYO) among the 3 groups, but no differences in the proportion of men and women. The normal-appearing group was the youngest (mean age 38.3 ± 11.1 years), contained no symptomatic individuals, and had the longest estimated time until onset (average EYO of −15.0 ± 11.2 years). The temporal group was the oldest (mean age 59.0 ± 8.9 years), had the highest (87%) proportion of symptomatic individuals, and had the least estimated time until onset (average EYO of 4.8 ± 5.8 years, i.e. past onset). The frontotemporal group had a mean age of 47.7 ± 10.6 years, 45% symptomatic individuals, and an average EYO of −1.7 ± 8.7 years. SuStaIn stage was significantly correlated with EYO in the subtypable mutation carriers (r = 0.54, p ≤ 0.001, n = 34), with a similar correlation coefficient when analyzing each subtype individually (temporal: r = 0.49, p = 0.017, n = 23; frontotemporal: r = 0.51, p = 0.110, n = 11).

### Redefining the multidimensional clinical phenotypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes [^1176r3rc]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

The syndromes caused by frontotemporal lobar degeneration have highly heterogeneous and overlapping clinical features. There has been great progress in the refinement of clinical diagnostic criteria in the past decade, but we propose that a better understanding of aetiology, pathophysiology and symptomatic treatments can arise from a transdiagnostic approach to clinical phenotype and brain morphometry. In a cross-sectional epidemiological study, we examined 310 patients with a syndrome likely to be caused by frontotemporal lobar degeneration, including behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, non-fluent, and semantic variants of primary progressive aphasia (PPA), progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal syndrome. We included patients with logopenic PPA and those who met criteria for PPA but not a specific subtype. To date, 49 patients have a neuropathological diagnosis. A principal component analysis identified symptom dimensions that broadly recapitulated the core features of the main clinical syndromes. However, the subject-specific scores on these dimensions showed considerable overlap across the diagnostic groups. Sixty-two per cent of participants had phenotypic features that met the diagnostic criteria for more than one syndrome. Behavioural disturbance was prevalent in all groups. Forty-four per cent of patients with corticobasal syndrome had progressive supranuclear palsy-like features and 30% of patients with progressive supranuclear palsy had corticobasal syndrome-like features. Many patients with progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal syndrome had language impairments consistent with non-fluent variant PPA while patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia often had semantic impairments. Using multivariate source-based morphometry on a subset of patients (n = 133), we identified patterns of covarying brain atrophy that were represented across the diagnostic groups. Canonical correlation analysis of clinical and imaging components found three key brain-behaviour relationships, with a continuous spectrum across the cohort rather than discrete diagnostic entities. In the 46 patients with follow-up (mean 3.6 years) syndromic overlap increased with time. Together, these results show that syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration do not form discrete mutually exclusive categories from their clinical features or structural brain changes, but instead exist in a multidimensional spectrum. Patients often manifest diagnostic features of multiple disorders while deficits in behaviour, movement and language domains are not confined to specific diagnostic groups. It is important to recognize individual differences in clinical phenotype, both for clinical management and to understand pathogenic mechanisms. We suggest that a transdiagnostic approach to the spectrum of frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes provides a useful framework with which to understand disease aetiology, progression, and heterogeneity and to target future treatments to a higher proportion of patients.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^115sQfHp]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorders — scope and treatment evidence indicate limited data and a single small trial signal. The spectrum of frontotemporal lobar degenerative syndromes includes frontotemporal dementia, primary progressive aphasia, semantic dementia, corticobasal ganglionic degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, and hippocampal sclerosis and account for about 5%–10% of patients with dementia. Patients with frontotemporal dementia typically have significant alterations of personality and behavior, and the typical staging schema used for Alzheimer's disease (mild, moderate, severe) does not conform well to the typical natural history of frontotemporal dementia. Overall, there is very limited evidence supporting the use of any particular agent for frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorders. Only one small randomized controlled trial has evaluated the safety and/or efficacy of a treatment for associated cognitive or behavioral features, and this trial demonstrated that trazodone may be beneficial in decreasing problematic behaviors such as irritability, agitation, depressive symptoms, or eating.

### Psychiatric symptoms of frontotemporal dementia and subcortical (co-) pathology burden: new insights [^1159HFs7]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Frontotemporal dementia is an early-onset neurodegenerative disease that is challenging to diagnose due to the heterogeneous clinical presentation and has a high social impact. Frontotemporal dementia encompasses several clinical presentations, including neuropsychiatric (i.e. behavioural and psychiatric), language and motor syndromes, which largely overlap after early disease stages. Behavioural symptoms are the most common and shared features between different clinical presentations of frontotemporal dementia, and psychiatric symptoms have recently been recognized as a central feature of frontotemporal dementia,: up to 50% of patients with the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia are initially misdiagnosed with a primary psychiatric disorder (PPD). Among psychiatric symptoms of frontotemporal dementia, hallucinations have been reported in up to 17% of sporadic patients, although the lack of a formal inclusion criterion in the consensus clinical criteria may lead to an underestimate.,

Not only the clinical presentation of frontotemporal dementia is complex, but also the underlying pathology, named frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), which includes three main distinct subtypes of pathologically misfolded proteins: TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43), tau and fused in sarcoma (FUS). Adding further to the complexity, FTLD pathological subtypes are scarcely predictable on the basis of frontotemporal dementia clinical syndromes. On the other hand, we recently showed that single symptoms, rather than clinical syndromes, can be an important indicator of pathology, and that neuropsychiatric features such as hallucinations and perseverative/compulsive behaviour point to specific underlying FTLD pathological subtypes.

Although FTLD brain donors share the common hallmark of frontal and/or temporal atrophy, multiple cortical and subcortical brain areas are affected by variable degrees of distinct subtypes of accumulating pathologies. Moreover, a common finding beside FTLD main pathological subtype is the presence of concomitant FTLD and non-FTLD pathologies, whose clinical significance has not yet been elucidated. Correlations between symptoms of frontotemporal dementia and regional brain abnormalities are traditionally assessed through imaging studies, which provide insights into atrophy patterns, but not into underlying pathology. A comprehensive evaluation of regional vulnerability across the clinical spectrum of frontotemporal dementia should not only incorporate the affected brain region, but also the burden and type of misfolded protein. Moreover, in order to understand the potential impact of each misfolded protein on the clinical presentation, co-occurring pathologies should be taken into account, without any presumptive distinction between main pathological subtype and co-pathology.

### Cognitive profiles discriminate between genetic variants of behavioral frontotemporal dementia [^1132mDka]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) includes a large spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders with a variable clinical presentation of either progressive behavioral and executive deficits (behavioral variant FTD [bvFTD]) or language dysfunction (primary progressive aphasia [PPA]), associated with prominent frontal and/or anterior temporal lobe degeneration. bvFTD is the most common phenotype in the clinical spectrum and the neuropsychological profile is generally characterized by impaired executive function (e.g. planning, set shifting and working memory), social cognition (e.g. theory of mind, emotional processing), whereas memory and visuoconstruction are relatively spared in comparison to executive dysfunction. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that these cognitive impairments vary in severity and progression. Executive dysfunction may be absent or overshadowed by behavioral dysfunctions and/or significant episodic memory impairment can be present even at the earliest stages of the disease. Factors influencing the variety in cognitive impairments between patients with bvFTD are not yet understood.

### Predicting functional decline in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia [^1159KoAF]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

Behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia is characterized by a change in comportment. It is associated with considerable functional decline over the course of the illness albeit with sometimes dramatic variability among patients. It is unknown whether any baseline features, or combination of features, could predict rate of functional decline in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different baseline clinical, neuropsychological, neuropsychiatric, genetic and anatomic predictors on the rate of functional decline as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes scale. We identified 86 subjects with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia that had multiple serial Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes assessments (mean 4, range 2–18). Atlas-based parcellation was used to generate volumes for specific regions of interest at baseline. Volumes were utilized to classify subjects into different anatomical subtypes using the advanced statistical technique of cluster analysis and were assessed as predictor variables. Composite scores were generated for the neuropsychological domains of executive, language, memory and visuospatial function. Behaviours from the brief questionnaire form of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory were assessed. Linear mixed-effects regression modelling was used to determine which baseline features predict rate of future functional decline. Rates of functional decline differed across the anatomical subtypes of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, with faster rates observed in the frontal dominant and frontotemporal subtypes. In addition, subjects with poorer performance on neuropsychological tests of executive, language and visuospatial function, less disinhibition, agitation/aggression and night-time behaviours at presentation, and smaller medial, lateral and orbital frontal lobe volumes showed faster rates of decline. In many instances, the effect of the predictor variables observed across all subjects was also preserved within anatomical subtypes. Furthermore, some of the predictor variables improved our prediction of rate of functional decline after anatomical subtype was taken into account. In particular, age at onset was a highly significant predictor but only after adjusting for subtype. We also found that although some predictor variables, for example gender, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and apathy/indifference, did not affect the rate of functional decline; these variables were associated with the actual Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes score estimated for any given time-point. These findings suggest that in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, rate of functional decline is driven by the combination of anatomical pattern of atrophy, age at onset, and neuropsychiatric characteristics of the subject at baseline.

### Current concepts in the classification and diagnosis of frontotemporal lobar degenerations: a practical approach [^112NCx68]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Frontotemporal lobar degenerations are clinically, genetically, and molecularly heterogeneous diseases characterized by mainly frontal and temporal atrophy and affecting behavioral, language, cognitive, and motor functions. The term frontotemporal dementia incorporates 3 distinct clinical syndromes seen in frontotemporal degenerations: behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia, progressive nonfluent aphasia, and semantic dementia. Progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome, corticobasal syndrome, and motor neuron disease syndrome are also associated with frontotemporal lobar degenerations. The neuropathologic hallmark of frontotemporal lobar degenerations is accumulation of abnormal proteins in the cytoplasm and nuclei of neurons and glial cells. Proteins involved in pathologic processes that represent the basis for frontotemporal lobar degeneration classification are tau protein, transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa, and "fused in sarcoma" protein. The aim of this review is to provide a summary of practical approaches for neuropathologic diagnostics of the rapidly evolving classifications of frontotemporal lobar degenerations.

METHODS

Design

An explorative approach was chosen by performing a mixed model of qualitative and quantitative research techniques by using an exploratory sequential design.

First, qualitative research was initiated with a literature review for hypothetical features outside the diagnostic criteria of bvFTD and AD that are associated with the end stage of dementia. The literature review was performed in PubMed, in March 2019 by ME. Articles between 1982 and 2019 were retrieved. The following search terms were used in various combinations: 'Frontotemporal dementia', 'FTD', 'behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia', 'behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia', 'bvFTD', 'FTLD', 'Frontotemporal Lobe Degeneration', 'Alzheimer's disease', 'AD', 'early onset', 'young onset', 'end stage', 'end of life', 'final stage', 'advanced dementia', 'palliative', 'palliative care', 'terminal', 'neuropsychiatry', 'survival', 'progression', 'cause of death', 'die', 'dying', 'mortality', 'mortal', 'nursing home'. The search led to twenty-four articles and the features deriving from this literature review were noted.

### Computationally derived anatomic subtypes of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia show temporal stability and divergent patterns of longitudinal atrophy [^112wF3M9]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is a clinically, neuroanatomically, and pathologically heterogeneous syndrome, most commonly caused by aggregation of two types of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathology, FTLD‐tau and FTLD‐TDP. Though neuropathological characteristics do not reliably predict distinct bvFTD clinical features, there is a specific correspondence between clinical symptoms and underlying neuroanatomy. Pathognomonic symptoms of the bvFTD syndrome, including early decline of social behavior and personal conduct, such as loss of empathy, coldness, and compulsiveness, correspond to neurodegeneration in specific cingulo‐insular and temporal lobe regions. However, both the symptom constellations and the underlying dysfunction in the associated intrinsically connected networks (ICNs) differ substantially across bvFTD patients. Thus, using patterns of anatomy to categorize patients into distinct, stable, clinical subtypes of bvFTD is likely to elucidate specific mechanisms and vulnerabilities in the affected regions. Particularly if these anatomic bvFTD subtypes remain distinct over the disease course, such classification would yield an improved taxonomy to help clinicians better predict the longitudinal progression of an individual patient's atrophy and clinical symptoms.

### Behavioural and cognitive profiles in frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease: a longitudinal study [^117WPx4s]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) encompasses a heterogeneous spectrum of diseases that involve degeneration of the brain's frontal and temporal lobes. Behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), semantic dementia (SD; also known as semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia) and progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA, also known as nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia) are the main clinical variants of FTD. BvFTD is the most common variant and is characterised by changes in behaviour, personality, executive and social cognition in the context of prefrontal and insular degeneration. SD is characterised by early and profound loss of semantic knowledge, attributable to progressive degeneration of the anterior temporal lobe (ATL), generally more pronounced on the left than the right hemisphere. In 30% of SD cases, the opposite pattern of brain atrophy is observed, with greater right than left ATL involvement. These patients tend to show early prosopagnosia and behavioural changes, in addition to language disturbances. Based on this differentiation, SD has often been divided into left-dominant SD (SDL) and right-dominant SD (SDR).

Importantly, many clinical symptoms overlap across FTD variants. Patients diagnosed with SD exhibit a degree of clinical, imaging and pathological overlap with bvFTD. This is most notable for those diagnosed with SDR who tend to show socioemotional and behavioural disturbances comparable to that seen in bvFTD. Similarly, semantic and language deficits typical in SD are also observed in bvFTD. In addition, some bvFTD patients will experience episodic memory disturbances of a severity similar to that observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Conversely, a subset of AD patients will exhibit early dysexecutive/behavioural presentations driven by underlying frontal atrophy, further complicating its differentiation from bvFTD.

The relative rarity of some FTD variants may reflect the lack of sensitivity of existing cognitive and behavioural screening measures, resulting in bias towards the detection of common dementias such as AD and bvFTD. Several approaches have been proposed to address this bias and to better reflect the diversity within the spectrum of FTD disorders. These approaches range from using combinations of clinical, radiological and pathological features transdiagnostically to identify the hierarchy of key behavioural and cognitive measures. Varying revisions of standard measures of global cognitive function have been recommended to include symptoms more specific for particular FTD variants, such as emotional apathy for bvFTD and prosopagnosia for SDR.

### Frontotemporal dementia: correlations between psychiatric symptoms and pathology [^113GjbZv]. Annals of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

The pathology of FTD, termed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), is characterized by the unifying macroscopic hallmark of atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes. 7 On a microscopic level, aggregates of distinct types of misfolded proteins can be observed. TAR DNA‐binding protein‐43 (TDP‐43) aggregates occur in approximately 50% of patients, microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) in 40%, and fused in sarcoma (FUS) aggregates are seen in 5 to 10%. 7, 8 C9orf72 and GRN mutations are associated with TDP‐43 aggregation, whereas mutations in MAPT lead to tau aggregation. 5 Within the molecular class TDP‐43, 5 different histotypes (A‐E) have been described based on the morphology and distribution of cytoplasmic and neuritic aggregates across brain layers. 9 TDP‐C is the predictable histopathology in the majority of patients with svPPA. 10 However, in the remaining sporadic patients with FTD, the underlying phenotype can scarcely be predicted based on the clinical phenotype.

Previous efforts to identify clinicopathological correlations in FTD focused on the underlying pathologies of the FTD clinical subgroups. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 When focusing on the 5 core behavioral symptoms of bvFTD, predicting the underlying pathological phenotype remains challenging. 18 Here, we set out to investigate clinicopathological correlations at the symptom level in a large FTD cohort encompassing all clinical variants, and include a broader spectrum of symptoms than those that have been incorporated in the consensus clinical criteria, such as neuropsychiatric symptoms.

### Gaps in clinical research in frontotemporal dementia: a call for diversity and disparities-focused research [^112je8vC]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is one of the leading causes of dementia before age 65 and often manifests as abnormal behavior (in behavioral variant FTD) or language impairment (in primary progressive aphasia). FTD's exact clinical presentation varies by culture, language, education, social norms, and other socioeconomic factors; current research and clinical practice, however, is mainly based on studies conducted in North America and Western Europe. Changes in diagnostic criteria and procedures as well as new or adapted cognitive tests are likely needed to take into consideration global diversity. This perspective paper by two professional interest areas of the Alzheimer's Association International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment examines how increasing global diversity impacts the clinical presentation, screening, assessment, and diagnosis of FTD and its treatment and care. It subsequently provides recommendations to address immediate needs to advance global FTD research and clinical practice.

### New approaches to the treatment of frontotemporal lobar degeneration [^115MkZt9]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Treatment approaches for frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are rapidly evolving with improved understanding of the disease. This brief review highlights recent advances.

Recent Findings

Early-onset dementia has a devastating impact on families and rids its victims of their most productive and rewarding years. Over the past 10 years, FTLD has emerged as the commonest cause of dementia under the age of 60 years, outstripping even Alzheimer's disease in prevalence. Remarkable progress has occurred in our understanding of FTLD both as a set of distinctive clinical syndromes and as a set of disorders with unique genetic and pathological profiles. Although there are no Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for FTLD, new evidence of specific genetic and neurochemical defects is beginning to provide a strong rationale for pharmacological treatment.

Summary

Behavioral changes, which are common in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and semantic dementia, often respond to treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Memantine also holds promise to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms, but more prospective trials are needed. With better understanding of pathogenic molecular pathways involving microtubule-associated protein tau, progranulin and TDP-43, potential disease-modifying therapies are being studied in animal models and approaching human trials.

Frontotemporal dementia

The clinical, pathological, and epidemiological features of frontotemporal dementia – are summarized in Box 2.

Protein markers

In 5–10% of all patients with frontotemporal dementia who constitute a subset of those with autosomal dominant disease, frontotemporal dementia is caused by haploinsufficiency of progranulin, encoded by the GRN gene, because of mutation of one GRN allele. Most of the relevant GRN mutations involve a premature stop codon and consequent nonsense-mediated decay of the resultant progranulin fragment, impairment of progranulin secretion, or absence of a functionally important cysteine residue in the protein.

Other patients with familial frontotemporal dementia have etiologic mutations of the MAPT gene that encodes tau protein. Mice in which MAPT has been engineered to overexpress a repressible form of the human mutant tau protein develop progressive locomotor hyperactivity, the severity of which is age dependent. The mutant tau aggregates and forms deposits in the frontal lobes of the mice. Enhancing the prevalence of the N-ace-tylglucosamine adduct or decreasing phosphorylation of the mutant tau decreases tau aggregation and deposition in the frontal lobes and prevents the hyperactive behavior. It has been conjectured that the murine hyperactivity is the equivalent of the wandering behavior prevalent in people with frontotemporal dementia.

Neurodevelopmental roles of protein markers

Frontotemporal dementia shares many of its pathological features with a neurodegenerative disorder with onset in adolescence, the variety of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) due to mutations of the GRN gene which encodes the protein progranulin. Unlike genetic cases of frontotemporal dementia, NCL is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in GRN. NCL due to GRN mutations is an autosomal recessive disorder that differs clinically from frontotemporal dementia. It results in seizures, myoclonus, retinitis pigmentosa, cataracts, cerebellar ataxia, and dementia. The divergence of age of onset and disease manifestations between NCL and frontotemporal dementia reflects one of a handful of situations of gene dose dependence of clinical phenotype.

### An update on genetic frontotemporal dementia [^112SaGn7]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder presenting with distinct changes in behaviour, language and motor function. Despite often being considered as a rare disease, FTD is probably the most common form of dementia experienced in people under the age of 60, with an estimated lifetime risk of 1 in 742. The behavioural variant (bvFTD) is characterised by changes in personality, while the language variant (known as primary progressive aphasia, PPA) is typically associated with progressive speech production or comprehension difficulties. People with FTD can also develop motor deficits, either amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTD-ALS) or Parkinsonism, in the latter case often with specific features of a corticobasal syndrome (CBS) or progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).

### Frontotemporal dementia: correlations between psychiatric symptoms and pathology [^112SxhxB]. Annals of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

The term frontotemporal dementia (FTD) defines a group of neurodegenerative syndromes with diverse clinical presentations, including the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and language dominant syndromes, such as primary progressive aphasia (PPA), including the nonfluent/agrammatic variant of PPA (nfPPA), and the semantic variant of PPA (svPPA). 1, 2 Other syndromes that are part of this group are characterized by prominent movement symptoms, such as corticobasal syndrome, progressive supranuclear palsy, and FTD with motor neuron disease. Most patients present with mixed behavior, language, and motor symptoms, but are diagnosed based on their most pronounced and first onset of symptoms and/or behavior. The past decade has seen a fast evolution of knowledge on the clinical and genetic features of FTD. In 2011, diagnostic criteria for bvFTD and PPA were revised which improved diagnostic accuracy. 1, 2 Mutations in genes, such as chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72), progranulin (GRN), and microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) have been identified in about 25% of patients with FTD. 3 More recently, neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as psychosis and depressed mood, have been recognized to be part of the early clinical presentation of FTD, both in C9orf72 repeat expansion carriers and noncarriers. 4, 5, 6 Due to the clinical variability and overlap of symptoms with primary psychiatric diseases and other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, and given the lack of biomarkers, it remains challenging to diagnose FTD accurately in a clinical setting.

### The clinical and pathological phenotypes of frontotemporal dementia with C9ORF72 mutations [^117J68W4]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2013). Low credibility.

An expanded hexanucleotide repeat in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72), on chromosome 9p21, has recently been identified as a major cause of familial frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The neuropathology and clinical characteristics associated with C9ORF72 mutations are heterogeneous with the unknown pathomechanism. These cases were reported with a series of neuropathology, including TDP-43 pathology, ubiquilin (UBQLN) pathology, p62 pathology, microglial pathology, RNA-binding protein pathology and pathology associated with dipeptide-repeat (DPR) proteins. TDP-43 positive neuropathology was important in FTD patients with the mutations. Nevertheless, the majority of reports agree with a special pattern of neuropathology with p62 positive, TDP-43-negative inclusions being a consistent feature. Although subjects with the C9ORF72 mutations more frequently present with earlier onset age, earlier death, a shortened survival and a positive family history, most of the subjects present with typical clinical features of FTD. All these findings support that the C9ORF72 mutations become important newly recognized causes of FTD, providing a more detailed characterization of the associated clinical and pathological features. The following review summarizes the pathological development of FTD associated with C9ORF72, the clinical and pathological features of this cohort, some pathological mechanism hypotheses, and describes their phenotypic range and overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases.

### Overlap in the diagnostic criteria of frontotemporal dementia syndromes with parkinsonism [^11475PyJ]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases can be challenging, especially with parkinsonism and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) syndromes. In clinical practice, the diagnosis is mostly based on prevailing clinical diagnostic criteria rather than specific biomarkers or definite findings. These clinical diagnostic criteria have been formed and revised by expert consensus multiple times as new information and data have emerged.

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a neuropathological term used to describe a spectrum of diseases that involve degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. The most common disease in this category is behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), typically characterized by changes in cognition and behavior.bvFTD is the second most common degenerative cognitive disease in the working class population, after Alzheimer's disease (AD). The differential diagnosis between AD and other neurodegenerative diseases is a common problem in neurology outpatient clinic. Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS) are diseases typically presenting with parkinsonism, yet defects in cognition and behavior are also common and neuropathologically these disorders are categorized as FTLD spectrum diseases. On the other hand, up to 30% of the individuals with bvFTD present with parkinsonian symptoms. These diseases may partly share common pathological mechanisms as they are mainly classified as tauopathies or transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) proteinopathies, which differentiates them from the most common cause of parkinsonism, idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by α-synucleinopathy. Another common tauopathy, AD, has partly similar pathologic characteristics. The gold standard for definite diagnosis of these diseases is neuropathological confirmation or detection of causal autosomal dominant mutations, but in clinical practice these are rarely available or feasible and the inherited forms of PSP and CBS are extremely rare.

The current clinical diagnostic criteria for bvFTD was established in 2011, for CBS in 2013, for PSP in 2017and for PD in 2015. These criteria have multiple overlapping and generally common neurological features, which could lower their specificity for accurate diagnosis of a specific disorder. In this retrospective cohort study, we evaluated the patient records of a large group of patients with relevant FTD syndrome diagnoses associated with parkinsonism to study the fulfilment of these diagnostic criteria and the potential clinical overlap between diagnoses of bvFTD, PSP, and CBS, with PD regarded as an important differential diagnosis. We also investigated whether we could retrospectively discover commonly used factors or biomarkers for better differentiation of the diseases that could further increase diagnostic specificity toward a correct diagnosis.

### Dementia: what pharmacists need to know [^117FbAK5]. Canadian Pharmacists Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on dementia:

- **Definition**: Dementia is a clinical syndrome characterized by a progressive cognitive decline that interferes with the ability to function independently.
- **Pathophysiology**: Dementia is mostly caused by Alzheimer's disease (60–80%), vascular injury (stroke; 20%), Lewy bodies (5–15%), and frontotemporal impairment (Pick's disease).
- **Disease course**: Alzheimer's disease, vascular injury, Lewy body deposition, and frontotemporal lobe impairment result in dementia, which causes clinical manifestations of gradual, persistent, and progressive decline in cognition and function. Cognitive deficits may present as memory loss, communication and language impairments, agnosia, apraxia, and impaired executive function (reasoning, judgment, and planning). Dementia progression may lead to behavioral and psychological symptoms including wandering, hoarding, sexual disinhibition, eating inappropriate objects, repetitive behaviors, restlessness, agitation, apathy, aggression, psychosis, hallucinations, and delusions causing considerable distress and safety risk for the patient and their caregivers.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Annual mortality associated with dementia in men and women is 38.3% and 30.5%, respectively.

Dementia due to frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorders — presentation, criteria, imaging, and epidemiology: Frontotemporal dementia is characterized in its early stages by changes in personality, significant apathy, executive dysfunction, deterioration of social skills, emotional blunting, behavioral disinhibition, and prominent language abnormalities, with difficulties with memory, apraxia, and other features of dementia usually following later; as the dementia progresses, it may be accompanied by extreme agitation, and early prominent personality/behavior change, severe apathy, and/or early language deficits help to distinguish it from Alzheimer's disease. Two sets of diagnostic criteria for frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorders have been proposed, and the criteria of McKhann et al. include progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal ganglionic degeneration, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with dementia, and hippocampal sclerosis; argyrophilic grain disease may also be included. Structural brain imaging typically reveals prominent frontal and/or temporal atrophy with relative sparing of the parietal and occipital lobes. The formal diagnosis of Pick's disease depends on the neuropathological finding of Pick inclusion bodies. About one-third of cases are familial, the disorder most commonly manifests in patients ages 50–60 years, and the course is progressive and can be more rapid than that of Alzheimer's disease.

### Predictors of care home admission and survival rate in patients with syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration in Europe [^114EE26S]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) causes a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders with a wide range of clinical, genetic, and neuropathologic features. Behavioral and personality changes are among the most prominent symptoms in the behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD)while speech and language deficits are characteristic of primary progressive aphasia (PPA). A significant proportion of patients have associated extrapyramidal symptoms that may form part of either progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)or corticobasal syndrome (CBS)while others present with overlapping motor neuron disease (MND), which defines the FTD-MND.

In recent years, as the understanding of the molecular and clinical intricacies of FTLD has progressively improved, so too has the ability to develop novel interventions that might address the diverse and complex challenges posed by this disorder. However, treatment development, effective care, and social management remain difficult tasks, in part due to the extreme heterogeneity and the rareness of the disease. Knowledge of the natural disease history and predictors of disease trajectories is critical for ongoing efforts to assess the efficacy of treatment approaches and to promote adequate planning of public health service policies.

INTRODUCTION

The behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is a common form of young‐onset dementia, but the diagnosis can be unstable. It is often initially misdiagnosed as a psychiatric disorder while some diagnosed with bvFTD will subsequently have their diagnosis changed. The Frontotemporal Dementia Consortium criteria, also referred to as the 'Rascovsky criteria', categorizes the clinical features of bvFTD by integrating behavioural symptoms, neuropsychological, neuroimaging, histopathological and genetic information. Nonetheless, detecting the behavioural features of bvFTD and discriminating them from other disorders can be challenging.

Patients characteristically lack insight into their behavioural changes, making them unreliable historians. This means that identification of the clinical phenotype of bvFTD heavily depends on an informant — whose symptom reporting may be subjective. For instance, because informants usually lack prior experience with bvFTD, they may struggle to recognize when behaviours, such as disinhibition, lack of empathy or preference for sweet foods, reach a level indicative of a neurodegenerative disease. These factors likely contributed to the finding in one study that physicians had an accuracy of only 27% in correctly identifying bvFTD. The study examined the referral symptomatology and demographic details associated with true‐positive and false‐positive diagnoses but did not elaborate on how other clinical factors impacted the diagnosis.

The present study aimed to identify factors leading to true‐positive and, particularly, false‐positive diagnoses of bvFTD by examining the referrals from specialist physicians to a tertiary cognitive disorders clinic. Specifically, we sought to examine the types of evidence that had been used by physicians in reaching their diagnosis with a view to identifying whether or not such evidence ultimately proved reliable. Such analyses might offer potential to improve diagnostic accuracy by highlighting pitfalls in the diagnostic process.

### The graded multidimensional geometry of phenotypic variation and progression in neurodegenerative syndromes [^115QUP33]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical variants of Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration display a spectrum of cognitive-behavioural changes varying between individuals and over time. Understanding the landscape of these graded individual/group level longitudinal variations is critical for precise phenotyping; however, this remains challenging to model. Addressing this challenge, we leverage the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database to derive a unified geometric framework of graded longitudinal phenotypic variation in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. We included three time point, cognitive-behavioural and clinical data from 390 typical, atypical and intermediate Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration variants (114 typical Alzheimer's disease; 107 behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia; 42 motor variants of frontotemporal lobar degeneration; and 103 primary progressive aphasia patients). On these data, we applied advanced data-science approaches to derive low-dimensional geometric spaces capturing core features underpinning clinical progression of Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes. To do so, we first used principal component analysis to derive six axes of graded longitudinal phenotypic variation capturing patient-specific movement along and across these axes. Then, we distilled these axes into a visualizable 2D manifold of longitudinal phenotypic variation using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection. Both geometries together enabled the assimilation and interrelation of paradigmatic and mixed cases, capturing dynamic individual trajectories and linking syndromic variability to neuropathology and key clinical end points, such as survival. Through these low-dimensional geometries, we show that (i) specific syndromes (Alzheimer's disease and primary progressive aphasia) converge over time into a de-differentiated pooled phenotype, while others (frontotemporal dementia variants) diverge to look different from this generic phenotype; (ii) phenotypic diversification is predicted by simultaneous progression along multiple axes, varying in a graded manner between individuals and syndromes; and (iii) movement along specific principal axes predicts survival at 36 months in a syndrome-specific manner and in individual pathological groupings. The resultant mapping of dynamics underlying cognitive-behavioural evolution potentially holds paradigm-changing implications to predicting phenotypic diversification and phenotype-neurobiological mapping in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration.

### Expert opinions on pharmacological symptomatic treatment of behavioral symptoms in frontotemporal dementia: a survey of the neuropsychiatric international consortium on frontotemporal dementia (NIC-FTD) [^1121aVhw]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), caused by frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is the second most common cause of young onset dementia. FTD is characterized by progressive frontal, temporal, and/or insular atrophy. FTD encompasses a heterogeneous spectrum of clinical syndromes, of which behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) is the most common. bvFTD is characterized by profound and progressive changes in behavior and cognition. In bvFTD, patients often lack any insight into their disease.

Presently, there is no curative treatment available for bvFTD. Clearly, the lack of curative treatment poses a serious problem. Concomitantly, on the symptomatic level, there is no consensus on the optimal pharmacological treatment. Currently, clinicians confronted with behavioral symptoms in bvFTD have to treat these pragmatically. As there is no curative treatment for bvFTD expected in the near future, a more effective symptomatic treatment is pivotal to reducing the burden of this disease for both the patients and their caregivers. This burden is reflected by stated unmet needs according to caregivers and patient organizations.

BEHAVIORAL VARIANT FTD

We turn first to the most common clinical form of FTD, which is now referred to as bvFTD. A renaissance of interest in the focal dementias began in the 1970s and accelerated in the1980s. Workers from Lund, Sweden reported on a large series of patients with dementia and found that a high proportion had evidence of frontal lobe degeneration. Since only a small proportion had Pick bodies — the remainder had very similar findings but without specific inclusions — the Lund group preferred to adopt the term "frontal degeneration of non-Alzheimer type". At approximately the same time, the Manchester group began a series of important clinico-pathological studies of patients with pre-senile dementia. They, likewise, found a high proportion of cases with a progressive frontal lobe syndrome who had neither the changes (plaques and tangles) typical of Alzheimer's disease (AD) nor specific inclusion pathology. They introduced the term "dementia of frontal type". Over the next few years, other groups described similar cases under the labels "frontal lobe degeneration" and "dementia lacking distinct histological features". Gradually, the label of FTD was applied to such cases, but later, after the realization that patients with progressive aphasia share clinical and pathological features, the term bvFTD was adopted. Epidemiological studies have established that collectively FTD is the second most common cause of dementia under age 65 with a prevalence that approximates that of AD.

### Distinctive progression patterns of brain structural damage aid classification of frontotemporal dementia variants [^1123Vi9K]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) encompasses diverse clinical phenotypes, primarily characterized by behavioral and/or language dysfunction. A newly characterized variant, semantic behavioral variant FTD (sbvFTD), exhibits predominant right temporal atrophy with features bridging behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). This study investigates the longitudinal structural MRI correlates of these FTD variants, focusing on cortical and subcortical structural damage to aid differential diagnosis and prognosis.

Methods

Seventy‐one FTD patients (bvFTD = 45, sbvFTD = 11, svPPA = 15) and 37 healthy controls participated in a prospective study involving up to 24 months of serial neurological, neuropsychological, and 3 T MRI assessments. Cortical thickness and subcortical/cerebellar volumes were analyzed with linear mixed‐effect models. Support vector machine (SVM) models were used to classify subjects using baseline and longitudinal patterns of structural damage.

Results

At baseline, sbvFTD showed right‐predominant temporal pole involvement associated with significant right frontal atrophy. Longitudinally, bvFTD showed widespread bilateral cortical and basal ganglia damage, svPPA demonstrated steady temporal lobe progression, and sbvFTD progressed primarily in left temporal and frontal regions with limited right hemisphere involvement. Baseline cortical thickness of frontal regions predicted subsequent functional decline in bvFTD and sbvFTD. A multiclass SVM model provided a good diagnostic classification accuracy, with similar results when using baseline data only (82%) and adding longitudinal data (83%).

Conclusions

This study delineates the unique structural MRI features and progression of FTD variants, highlighting sbvFTD as a distinct entity with early extra‐temporal involvement. These findings support the development of diagnostic and prognostic tools leveraging neuroimaging biomarkers.

### Proposed research criteria for prodromal behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia [^1143NpSt]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Finally, we were not able to evaluate the role of biomarkers in this study, and the biomarker criterion (Criterion 3: B3) is intended to capture a wide range of biomarkers that may become available in the future. As biomarker research continues to rapidly advance, these criteria can undergo revision, and clinical feature requirements may be relaxed; for example, two clinical features may be sufficient for an MBCI-FTD diagnosis in the context of strong biomarker evidence. This is a proposition especially worth considering for clinical trial enrolment when a genetic mutation is present (see Supplementary Table 5 for sensitivity and specificity analyses of the criteria when two features are required).

We have proposed the first preliminary diagnostic criteria for prodromal bvFTD, or MBCI-FTD, leveraging data from one of the largest prodromal bvFTD cohorts reported to date. The criteria correctly classified 95% of the prodromal bvFTD group on which they were developed, and 74% of a separate, more heterogeneous cohort (Validation Group). False positive rates were low, in both healthy controls (7–10%) and individuals with prodromal Alzheimer's disease (11–16%). These criteria represent a step towards defining a clinical prodrome of bvFTD, and will be valuable for clinical trial enrolment, and for early diagnosis and counselling. Future research should prioritize validation in other, larger cohorts.

### Recommendations to distinguish behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia from psychiatric disorders [^112DjVUX]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

The behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is a frequent cause of early-onset dementia. The diagnosis of bvFTD remains challenging because of the limited accuracy of neuroimaging in the early disease stages and the absence of molecular biomarkers, and therefore relies predominantly on clinical assessment. BvFTD shows significant symptomatic overlap with non-degenerative primary psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders and even personality disorders. To date, ∼50% of patients with bvFTD receive a prior psychiatric diagnosis, and average diagnostic delay is up to 5–6 years from symptom onset. It is also not uncommon for patients with primary psychiatric disorders to be wrongly diagnosed with bvFTD. The Neuropsychiatric International Consortium for Frontotemporal Dementia was recently established to determine the current best clinical practice and set up an international collaboration to share a common dataset for future research. The goal of the present paper was to review the existing literature on the diagnosis of bvFTD and its differential diagnosis with primary psychiatric disorders to provide consensus recommendations on the clinical assessment. A systematic literature search with a narrative review was performed to determine all bvFTD-related diagnostic evidence for the following topics: bvFTD history taking, psychiatric assessment, clinical scales, physical and neurological examination, bedside cognitive tests, neuropsychological assessment, social cognition, structural neuroimaging, functional neuroimaging, CSF and genetic testing. For each topic, responsible team members proposed a set of minimal requirements, optimal clinical recommendations, and tools requiring further research or those that should be developed. Recommendations were listed if they reached a ≥ 85% expert consensus based on an online survey among all consortium participants. New recommendations include performing at least one formal social cognition test in the standard neuropsychological battery for bvFTD. We emphasize the importance of 3D-T1 brain MRI with a standardized review protocol including validated visual atrophy rating scales, and to consider volumetric analyses if available. We clarify the role of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET for the exclusion of bvFTD when normal, whereas non-specific regional metabolism abnormalities should not be over-interpreted in the case of a psychiatric differential diagnosis. We highlight the potential role of serum or CSF neurofilament light chain to differentiate bvFTD from primary psychiatric disorders. Finally, based on the increasing literature and clinical experience, the consortium determined that screening for C9orf72 mutation should be performed in all possible/probable bvFTD cases or suspected cases with strong psychiatric features.

4.2 Conclusions and future directions

This study reports the real‐world frequency of the core diagnostic criteria for probable bvFTD in one of the largest cohorts of patients to date. Fourteen years after their publication, overall, these diagnostic criteria achieve their aim. Importantly, diagnostic profiles were not influenced by age, sex, education attainment, or disease duration, further supporting their broad applicability. An important limitation is, however, with the core Criterion F, which should be modified. We also argue that the addition of a criterion examining the integrity of social functioning is now warranted.

Despite this positive outcome, further investigations are needed to evaluate whether these findings are applicable to cohorts from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Similarly, research is also needed to determine the clinical profiles within pathologic and larger genetic subgroups of the disease, and their relations to neuroimaging findings. This in turn will help inform disease trajectory and ultimately aid in the development of pathology‐specific therapies.

### Phenotypic signatures of genetic frontotemporal dementia [^115Gm23x]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a clinically, pathologically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. Mutations in a number of genes are associated with FTD, although until recently only two [progranulin (GRN) and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT)] were known to be major causes of the disease. This review describes recent progress in identifying clinical and neuroanatomical phenotypes associated with autosomal-dominant FTD.

Recent Findings

Around a third to a half of FTD patients have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Up to 10% of patients have a mutation in GRN and a similar proportion have a mutation in MAPT. Recently a group of patients have been shown to have a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the noncoding region of chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72). A further group of patients have an autosomal dominant family history but no mutations in any of the known genes including a group of patients who have the same pathology as GRN mutations (type A TDP-43 pathology) but are negative for GRN mutations. Clinical phenotypes vary across the different mutations. Neuroimaging studies show that GRN and MAPT mutations have distinct patterns of atrophy — asymmetric fronto-temporo-parietal atrophy with GRN versus relatively symmetric medial temporal and orbitofrontal lobe atrophy with MAPT mutations. Neuroimaging of patients with an expansion in C9ORF72 has yet to be studied in detail.

Summary

Genetic FTD is heterogeneous but certain phenotypic signatures of the major causative genes can be identified.

### Frontotemporal dementia: correlations between psychiatric symptoms and pathology [^117LBk2m]. Annals of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The pathology of frontotemporal dementia, termed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), is characterized by distinct molecular classes of aggregated proteins, the most common being TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43), tau, and fused in sarcoma (FUS). With a few exceptions, it is currently not possible to predict the underlying pathology based on the clinical syndrome. In this study, we set out to investigate the relationship between pathological and clinical presentation at single symptom level, including neuropsychiatric features.

Methods

The presence or absence of symptoms from the current clinical guidelines, together with neuropsychiatric features, such as hallucinations and delusions, were scored and compared across pathological groups in a cohort of 150 brain donors.

Results

Our cohort consisted of 68.6% FTLD donors (35.3% TDP-43, 28% tau, and 5.3% FUS) and 31.3% non-FTLD donors with a clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia and a different pathological substrate, such as Alzheimer's disease (23%). The presence of hyperorality points to FTLD rather than non-FTLD pathology (p < 0.001). Within the FTLD group, hallucinations in the initial years of the disease were related to TDP-43 pathology (p = 0.02), including but not limited to chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) repeat expansion carriers. The presence of perseverative or compulsive behavior was more common in the TDP-B and TDP-C histotypes (p = 0.002).

Interpretation

Our findings indicate that neuropsychiatric features are common in FTLD and form an important indicator of underlying pathology. In order to allow better inclusion of patients in targeted molecular trials, the routine evaluation of patients with frontotemporal dementia should include the presence and nature of neuropsychiatric symptoms.

### Focal thalamus pathology in frontotemporal dementia: phenotype-associated thalamic profiles [^117CgnQP]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The clinical phenotypes of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are defined by distinctive clinical features and associated with unique cortical atrophy patterns. Clinical manifestations in FTD however are not solely driven by cortical pathology, but stem from the selective dysfunction of corticobasal circuits, the majority of which are relayed through thalamic nuclei. The objective of this study is the systematic radiological characterisation of thalamic pathology across the clinical spectrum of FTD to describe phenotype-associated thalamic signatures.

Methods

170 participants were included in a multimodal, prospective neuroimaging study to evaluate thalamic degeneration at a nuclear, vertex, and morphometric level using a uniform imaging protocol and a multimodal analysis approach.

Results

Patients with behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD), non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA), semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-FTD (ALS-FTD) exhibit distinctive thalamic disease-burden profiles with the preferential degeneration of specific thalamic nuclei. While vertex analyses reveal largely overlapping thalamic atrophy patterns, morphometric analyses successfully capture focal intra-thalamic degeneration.

Conclusions

Mirroring selective cortical vulnerability, focal rather than global thalamic atrophy characterises the clinical subtypes of FTD. Thalamic degeneration is a likely contributor to the heterogeneity of clinical manifestations observed in FTD. As thalamic imaging techniques capture different facets of pathological change and differ in their sensitivity to detect distinguishing features, future studies should implement a multimodal approach with complementary MRI techniques.

### Defining repetitive behaviours in frontotemporal dementia [^1117ULhb]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

Repetitive behaviours are common manifestations of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Patients with FTD exhibit various types of repetitive behaviours with unique behavioural and cognitive substrates, including compulsivity, lack of impulse control, stereotypy and hoarding. Other sources of repetitive behaviours, such as restrictive interests and insistence on sameness, may also be seen in FTD. Although repetitive behaviours are highly prevalent and potentially discriminatory in this population, their expression varies widely between patients, and the field lacks consensus about the classification of these behaviours. Terms used to describe repetitive behaviours in FTD are highly heterogeneous and may lack precise definitions. This lack of harmonization of the definitions for distinct forms of repetitive behaviour limits the ability to differentiate between pathological behaviours and impedes understanding of their underlying mechanisms. This review examines established definitions of well-characterized repetitive behaviours in other neuropsychiatric disorders and proposes operational definitions applicable to patients with FTD. Building on extant models of repetitive behaviours in non-human and lesion work and models of social behavioural changes in FTD, we describe the potential neurocognitive bases for the emergence of different types of repetitive behaviours in FTD and their potential perpetuation by a predisposition towards habit formation. Finally, examples of distinct therapeutic approaches for different forms of repetitive behaviours are highlighted, along with future directions to accurately classify, measure and treat these symptoms when they impair quality of life.

### The cortical asymmetry index for subtyping dementia patients [^112sQBhR]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a clinically, pathologically, and genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder associated with frontal and temporal atrophy. FTD patients tend to be misdiagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially at relatively young ages, although early behavioural and personality changes typical of FTD are not common in initial AD. However, AD is the most frequent dementia and sometimes is the first choice for many non-specialist clinicians. For this reason, there is a need to identify tools to help accurately diagnose dementia's underlying etiologies and their subtypes. Cortical asymmetry has been associated with characteristically clinical features in psychiatric and neurological conditions. In this sense, FTD patients show a more asymmetrical pattern at visual inspection compared to AD.

Within the FTD phenotypes, the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) is the most asymmetric. In this sense, the study of brain asymmetry could help in the diagnosis of the different phenotypes of FTD: the behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) or the FTD-related primary progressive aphasia phenotypes, including svPPA and nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA). A measure of cortical asymmetry could help in the early differential diagnosis or monitoring of the progress of neurodegeneration.

The differences between structural measures from the left and right hemispheres can be detected in structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). There is no established way to calculate the asymmetry, and different approaches have been used in multiple works on various brain diseases. Usually, these approaches use mean values across hemispheres or measures derived from linear arithmetic. Then, computational algorithms can obtain measures of cortical asymmetry from the global and regional cortical thickness (CTh), surface area, or subcortical volumes. Previously published works indicate that approaches using the probability distribution to obtain an asymmetric index could get better results and are currently being used in other biological areas. Using a probability distribution-based asymmetric index to evaluate cortical asymmetry offers advantages in terms of robustness to variability, statistical power, capturing the probabilistic nature of the data, handling distributional changes, and robustness to outliers. However, it also presents challenges related to computational complexity, higher data requirements, and potential interpretation challenges.

### Variations in regional SPECT hypoperfusion and clinical features in frontotemporal dementia [^112i6dHX]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize the presenting clinical features for frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and contrast them with the degree of frontal and temporal hypoperfusion on SPECT imaging.

Methods

The authors evaluated 74 patients who eventually met Consensus Criteria for the FTD form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (excluding primary progressive aphasia and semantic dementia) on 2-year follow-up. On first presentation, these patients had undergone both an FTD Inventory for 12 features based on core and supportive Consensus Criteria and SPECT imaging. The initial clinical diagnostic features were contrasted with variations in regional SPECT hypoperfusion.

Results

The patients with FTD had more hypoperfusion in the right frontal lobe than in other regions; the subgroup of 25 patients who met Consensus Criteria from the first presentation had the most right frontal hypoperfusion. Frontal lobe involvement was associated with significant apathy, whereas temporal lobe involvement was associated with hypomania-like behavior. Right frontal lobe hypoperfusion further predicted loss of insight, environmental dependency, and stereotyped behaviors. Other associations included left frontal hypoperfusion with a decline in personal hygiene and left temporal hypoperfusion with compulsions and mental rigidity.

Conclusions

On first presentation, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is disproportionately a right frontal disease evident on behavioral measures and on SPECT. Nonetheless, patients with FTD can initially present with further regional differences in clinical diagnostic features, such as apathy with bifrontal hypoperfusion and hypomania-like behaviors with anterior temporal involvement.

### Clinicopathological correlations in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia [^116uUPFi]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

Accurately predicting the underlying neuropathological diagnosis in patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) poses a daunting challenge for clinicians but will be critical for the success of disease-modifying therapies. We sought to improve pathological prediction by exploring clinicopathological correlations in a large bvFTD cohort. Among 438 patients in whom bvFTD was either the top or an alternative possible clinical diagnosis, 117 had available autopsy data, including 98 with a primary pathological diagnosis of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), 15 with Alzheimer's disease, and four with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis who lacked neurodegenerative disease-related pathology outside of the motor system. Patients with FTLD were distributed between FTLD-tau (34 patients: 10 corticobasal degeneration, nine progressive supranuclear palsy, eight Pick's disease, three frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism associated with chromosome 17, three unclassifiable tauopathy, and one argyrophilic grain disease); FTLD-TDP (55 patients: nine type A including one with motor neuron disease, 27 type B including 21 with motor neuron disease, eight type C with right temporal lobe presentations, and 11 unclassifiable including eight with motor neuron disease), FTLD-FUS (eight patients), and one patient with FTLD-ubiquitin proteasome system positive inclusions (FTLD-UPS) that stained negatively for tau, TDP-43, and FUS. Alzheimer's disease was uncommon (6%) among patients whose only top diagnosis during follow-up was bvFTD. Seventy-nine per cent of FTLD-tau, 86% of FTLD-TDP, and 88% of FTLD-FUS met at least 'possible' bvFTD diagnostic criteria at first presentation. The frequency of the six core bvFTD diagnostic features was similar in FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP, suggesting that these features alone cannot be used to separate patients by major molecular class. Voxel-based morphometry revealed that nearly all pathological subgroups and even individual patients share atrophy in anterior cingulate, frontoinsula, striatum, and amygdala, indicating that degeneration of these regions is intimately linked to the behavioural syndrome produced by these diverse aetiologies. In addition to these unifying features, symptom profiles also differed among pathological subtypes, suggesting distinct anatomical vulnerabilities and informing a clinician's prediction of pathological diagnosis. Data-driven classification into one of the 10 most common pathological diagnoses was most accurate (up to 60.2%) when using a combination of known predictive factors (genetic mutations, motor features, or striking atrophy patterns) and the results of a discriminant function analysis that incorporated clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological data.

### Clinical and pathological features of familial frontotemporal dementia caused by C9ORF72 mutation on chromosome 9p [^112Tspoa]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are closely related clinical syndromes with overlapping molecular pathogenesis. Several families have been reported with members affected by frontotemporal dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or both, which show genetic linkage to a region on chromosome 9p21. Recently, two studies identified the FTD/ALS gene defect on chromosome 9p as an expanded GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in a non-coding region of the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 gene (C9ORF72). In the present study, we provide detailed analysis of the clinical features and neuropathology for 16 unrelated families with frontotemporal dementia caused by the C9ORF72 mutation. All had an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Eight families had a combination of frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis while the other eight had a pure frontotemporal dementia phenotype. Clinical information was available for 30 affected members of the 16 families. There was wide variation in age of onset (mean = 54.3, range = 34–74 years) and disease duration (mean = 5.3, range = 1–16 years). Early diagnoses included behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (n = 15), progressive non-fluent aphasia (n = 5), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (n = 9) and progressive non-fluent aphasia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (n = 1). Heterogeneity in clinical presentation was also common within families. However, there was a tendency for the phenotypes to converge with disease progression; seven subjects had final clinical diagnoses of both frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and all of those with an initial progressive non-fluent aphasia diagnosis subsequently developed significant behavioural abnormalities. Twenty-one affected family members came to autopsy and all were found to have transactive response DNA binding protein with M(r) 43 kD (TDP-43) pathology in a wide neuroanatomical distribution. All had involvement of the extramotor neocortex and hippocampus (frontotemporal lobar degeneration-TDP) and all but one case (clinically pure frontotemporal dementia) had involvement of lower motor neurons, characteristic of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In addition, a consistent and relatively specific pathological finding was the presence of neuronal inclusions in the cerebellar cortex that were ubiquitin/p62-positive but TDP-43-negative. Our findings indicate that the C9ORF72 mutation is a major cause of familial frontotemporal dementia with TDP-43 pathology, that likely accounts for the majority of families with combined frontotemporal dementia/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis presentation, and further support the concept that frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis represent a clinicopathological spectrum of disease with overlapping molecular pathogenesis.

### Neuropsychiatric symptoms in frontotemporal dementia: more than just noise? [^117FyLog]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Neuropsychiatric symptoms cause significant suffering and poor quality of life for patients and their caregivers. They are not considered specific to frontotemporal dementia (FTD); therefore, their clinical role and impact might be underestimated.

Objective

The aims of the present study are to: 1) describe the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in FTD starting from the prodromal stage, 2) define their association with disease severity, 3) identify symptoms which are unrelated to FTD-specific symptoms, and 4) assess their association with clinical features and outcomes.

Results

In this retrospective study, we analyzed data of 461 FTD patients, including behavioral variant of FTD (bvFTD, n = 318) and primary progressive aphasia (PPA, n = 143). Neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and patients' staging and global disease severity were estimated using the Clinical Dementia Rating plus NACC FTLD.

Results

The most common neuropsychiatric symptoms in prodromal FTD were irritability (48%), depression (35%), and anxiety (34%); delusions were reported in 6%of prodromal bvFTD cases. The severity of most neuropsychiatric symptoms increased with global disease severity. Psychosis (delusions and hallucinations) and mood symptoms (depression and anxiety) were mostly independent from FTD-specific symptoms. Psychosis was associated with older age, higher disease severity, shorter survival rate, and was higher in bvFTD than in PPA.

Conclusions

Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in patients with FTD, also in the prodromal phase. Psychosis might be unrelated to FTD pathology, and be associated with worse clinical outcomes. The prompt detection and treatment of these symptoms might improve patient's management and quality of life.

### Sex differences in clinical phenotypes of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia [^111K3ysV]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, there are sex‐linked differences in the clinical phenotypes of sporadic bvFTD. The discrepancy in prevalence of females between genetic and sporadic bvFTD might be attributable to misdiagnosis in females with sporadic bvFTD due to overlapping symptoms with psychiatric disorders. Because psychiatric misdiagnosis can lead to delayed and inappropriate treatment, clinicians should have more sex‐specific considerations when evaluating symptoms and making diagnosis.

### Non-pharmacological management for patients with frontotemporal dementia: a systematic review [^116ttPR8]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by changes in behavior and language caused by focal degeneration of the frontal and anterior temporal lobes. The behavioral symptoms are distressing to patients and their caregivers. Non-pharmacological management is important as no disease-specific pharmacological treatment for FTD is currently available. The primary objective is to review the literature on non-pharmacological management for FTD and to propose directions for future research, with reference to findings. A search was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. Search terms included "frontotemporal dementia", and words related to non-pharmacological management, and it identified a total of 858 articles. Results revealed that very few randomized controlled trials exist on non-pharmacological management interventions for FTD. These interventions have been proposed by literature based on clinical experience. A small number of studies have supported behavioral management techniques that exploit disease-specific behaviors and preserved functions in patients with FTD, along with the management of caregivers' distress. These limitations warrant well-designed large-scale research to examine effects of non-pharmacological interventions on behavioral symptoms of FTD.

### Fourteen years later: reviewing the diagnostic criteria for behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia [^111XiiYR]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Behavioral‐variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is the most common syndrome associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), accounting for between 50% and 70% of all cases of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It is characterized by a progressive and pervasive decline in behavior and personality, and a variety of cognitive deficits, most commonly affecting executive function and social cognition. A subset of patients may also present with, or develop, motor features associated with motor neuron disease or extrapyramidal motor disorders, such as corticobasal syndrome or progressive supranuclear palsy.

Current classification and diagnosis of bvFTD is based on the 2011 consensus diagnostic criteria. These criteria focus on the presence of six core clinical features: five behavioral (disinhibition, apathy, loss of sympathy/empathy, compulsive behaviors, and hyperorality) and one cognitive (dysexecutive profile with preservation of episodic memory and visuospatial ability). Presence of these core features is generally gathered from various sources, including clinical investigations, cognitive evaluation, and caregiver‐based questionnaires.

### Frequency of ubiquitin and FUS-positive, TDP-43-negative frontotemporal lobar degeneration [^114NPofd]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most common type of presenile dementia, and a clinically, genetically and pathologically heterogeneous disorder. Behavioural changes and cognitive dysfunctions, especially language, are core clinical features. Four clinical subtypes can be distinguished: the behavioural variant of FTD (bvFTD), semantic dementia (SD), progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), and FTD with motor neuron disease (FTD-MND).

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the common underlying pathology of all four clinical variants, and can be divided into FTLD with tau-positive immunoreactive inclusions (FTLD-tau) and FTLD with ubiquitin-positive immunoreactive inclusions (FTLD-U). After the TDP-43 protein was found to be the major constituent of ubiquitin-positive inclusions, the latter term was changed to FTLD-TDP. However, the identification of TDP-43-negative inclusions in some FTLD-U cases has resulted in the designation of a new neuropathological subtype, atypical FTLD-U. Very recently, the name of this subtype has been changed into FTLD-fused in sarcoma (FTLD-FUS) by the observation of positive staining of these inclusions with antibody against FUS protein.

The characteristic features of FTLD-FUS are an early-onset FTD with severe progressive psychobehavioural changes, a negative family history and striking atrophy of the striatum at neuropathological examination. Its exact frequency is yet unknown, and neuroimaging features may differentiate it from other subtypes during life. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of FTLD-FUS in our FTLD-U cases and to describe the clinical, neuroimaging and neuropathological features of FTLD-FUS. Furthermore, we estimated the prevalence of FTLD-FUS in our clinical cohort of FTD on the basis of a combination of specific clinical features.

### A neuroanatomical and cognitive model of impaired social behaviour in frontotemporal dementia [^114RXoD6]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

Transdiagnostic approaches to assessment and clinical research

Whilst the CS-SC and other proposals posit discrete functions/representations to prefrontal versus ATL regions, bvFTD and semantic dementia patients do not divide absolutely and selectively along the same anatomical division. Notwithstanding distinct clinicopathological correlations with underlying molecular aetiologies, there are patient exemplars of classical bvFTD and semantic dementia representing different phenotypic points along a frontotemporal atrophy continuum, with many other 'mixed' FTD patients being intermediate. Accordingly, group-level comparisons provide important general clues about broad distinctions within FTD but are not optimal for understanding (i) the distinct functions of prefrontal versus ATL regions; and (ii) systematic variations and shared symptoms that span FTD subtypes. These features can be revealed by adopting a transdiagnostic approach and multidimensional analytics, and the results supplemented by convergent information from other patient groups and healthy participants.

Clinical assessments, diagnosis and management pathways

Inspired by the CS-SC framework, the development of new neuropsychological tests able to distinguish between degraded social-semantic representations versus social control problems would provide strong clues about the neural and cognitive bases driving a patient's behaviour change. In doing so, it may be possible to improve the delineation between semantic and behavioural variants of FTD, as well as understand the range and severity of problems faced by the many FTD patients with a mixed neurocognitive profile. Such group comparisons combined with transdiagnostic explorations could help lead us towards (i) better understanding of the underlying anatomical changes, pathology and genetic factors; and (ii) tailoring of both behavioural management and pharmacological interventions for the different types of deficits in social cognition.

### Frontotemporal dementia… [^115mqRC6]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

What is frontotemporal dementia. Frontotemporal dementia, or FTD, is a disease in which people lose tissue at the front and sides of their brain. This gradually causes problems with behavior and language. Doctors do not know what causes it. Who gets it. Anyone can get FTD, but it usually happens in people 45 to 65 years of age. It also happens more often in people with family members who have had dementia. How do I know if a friend or family member has it. People with FTD typically don't have the severe memory problems that people with Alzheimer disease do. There are different types of FTD that can affect different functions. People with FTD may have changes in behavior, such as losing interest in doing things. Sometimes these symptoms can seem like depression. Some people with FTD may say or do inappropriate things. They don't usually see a problem with the behaviors or admit there is anything to be worried about.

Sometimes a person's language is affected. For example, the person may say things that have no meaning or that are hard to understand. There are no routine blood or imaging tests to diagnose FTD. However, magnetic resonance imaging may be able to help with diagnosis and ruling out other causes. Doctors can also ask questions that may help to diagnose FTD. Can it be treated. There is no cure for FTD. Most medicines treat symptoms, such as depression. Counseling and support groups may help people with FTD and their families. Where can I get more information.

### Pick's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Pick complex… [^116pEdRw]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Arnold Pick1 described progressive aphasia and personality changes as the major clinical syndromes of frontotemporal atrophy more than 100 years ago. Subsequent focusing on round argyrophilic neuronal inclusions resulted in a confusing dichotomy over the term Pick's disease. When used as a clinical entity, it refers commonly to a protean frontotemporal syndrome that may present in various combinations of a behavioral disorder and a progressive language deficit, as described by Pick and others. Frontal lobe dementia, characterized by apathy and social disinhibition was recently described as a distinct "if not new" entity. 2, 3 It was subsequently renamed FTD4 and more recently, frontotemporal lobar degeneration. The atrophy, which can be demonstrated on neuroimaging, often involves the temporal lobes.

Although a language loss progressing to mutism is also included in the syndrome of FTD, 2–4 progressive aphasia may appear as the first symptom and dominates the picture for several years without other cognitive deficits. A series of these patients characterized with decreasing speech output were described, 5 and subsequently the condition was called "primary progressive aphasia". Initially this was also conceived to be a unique entity, but the clinical and pathological overlap with frontotemporal atrophies and PiD was later emphasized. 6 A fluent variety of progressive aphasia has been described as "semantic dementia, " in which patients lose semantic memory and the meaning of words but retain articulation and syntax. Patients with this condition who underwent postmortem examination also had the pathological features of Pick complex.

Although many PPA cases progress slowly, many will develop the characteristic behavioral and personality alterations of FLD if they are followed up long enough. Both may develop CBD as well. It appears that older descriptions of spongiform dementia with MND probably had a Pick-variant pathological picture rather than true CJD. Since protease-resistant prion proteins are used to define CJD, the differentiation of spongiform encephalopathies is placed on firmer scientific grounds. Furthermore, ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclusions in the cortex and brainstem characterize some cases of MND with FTD. 9 However, there are cases of FLD with these pathological characteristics without MND. Many of the patients with FTD or PPA with MND have a rapidly progressive course, with early death from dysphagia. Conversely, the progression in some of the patients with MND may preclude the documentation of dementia.

### The genetic and pathological classification of familial frontotemporal dementia… [^117Vveoj]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

High-power view of dentate gyrus showing lack of ubiquitin immunoreactivity in frontotemporal dementia with neuronal loss and spongiosis but without intracellular inclusions, dense ubiquitin inclusions in frontotemporal dementia with ubiquitin inclusions, and dense and granular tau immunoreactivity in frontotemporal dementia with neuronal and glial tau deposition. Bar indicates 50 µm. FRONTOTEMPORAL dementia is a clinical diagnosis based on progressive personality change and language impairment related to frontotemporal lobar atrophy. It is a frequent cause of dementia, particularly in the younger age group, accounting for between 12% and 20% of all dementia cases. 1 Pick disease is the archetypal pathological form of FTD.

It is characterized pathologically by the presence of swollen α-B-crystallin–positive neurons, and argyrophilic, tau-positive round inclusions that are particularly numerous in the granule cells of the hippocampal dentate fascia and the superficial layers of the frontotemporal neocortex. Pick disease is sometimes also used as a clinical term for patients presenting with a progressive frontal syndrome or language disorder, and as a diagnosis for neurological conditions with radiologic frontotemporal lobar atrophy; strictly, however, Pick disease should be reserved for pathologically diagnosed disease. The FTD with tau deposition involved extensive neuronal and glial tau deposition with coiled oligodendroglial inclusions and tufted astrocytes.

The FTD with ubiquitin inclusions involved the occurrence of ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative small tanglelike or dot inclusions and neuropil threads in the frontal and temporal cortices, most prominently in the superficial cortical layers. Other pathological findings were similar in all 3 groups. All 3 pathological subtypes generally involved superficial vacuolation and astrocytosis of the frontal and temporal cortex, and flattening and atrophy of the caudate nucleus. Clinically, some affected individuals in each pathological subtype showed evidence of parkinsonism. Only 1 family in this series was identified to have clinical motor neuron involvement, and this family did not have typical neuronal ubiquitin inclusions, although some granular neuronal ubiquitin immunoreactivity was identified.
