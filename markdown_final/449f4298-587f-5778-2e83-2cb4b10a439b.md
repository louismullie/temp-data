## Question

A 56-year-old woman with breast cancer is receiving her second cycle of paclitaxel chemotherapy in the infusion center. About 10 minutes into the infusion, she tells the nurse that she feels 'strange' and has an urgent need to use the bathroom. She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or rash. The nurse is unsure whether to be concerned, as her symptoms are vague and she has no obvious signs of distress.

According to current guidelines on hypersensitivity reactions to chemotherapy, what is the most appropriate immediate action in response to this patient's symptoms?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the most appropriate immediate action is for a 56-year-old woman who, 10 minutes into a paclitaxel infusion, reports feeling "strange" and having an urgent need to use the bathroom, with no chest pain, dyspnea, or rash. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical significance of these vague prodromal symptoms in the context of paclitaxel hypersensitivity. Then, I should verify the guideline-directed immediate actions, including whether to stop the infusion and what vitals to obtain. Next, I will consider the pathophysiology and timing of taxane reactions to gauge risk. Finally, I will outline documentation, observation, and next steps for rechallenge or desensitization if indicated, making sure I align with ESMO, NCCN, and AAAAI guidance [^29d28930] [^b2babbe2] [^9a55c575].

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of these symptoms. Feeling "strange" and experiencing a sudden urge to urinate or defecate are recognized prodromal features that can precede a hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel; ESMO explicitly advises paying serious attention to such nonspecific complaints and immediately evaluating the patient by measuring blood pressure and pulse rate, because early reactions can be subtle before progressing to hypotension, dyspnea, or rash [^29d28930].

> Wait, let me verify the immediate action. The most appropriate first step is to stop the infusion now and check vital signs, not to wait for more definitive signs; ESMO directs stopping or slowing the infusion for grade 1/2 infusion reactions and emphasizes prompt recognition with immediate medical attention, while NCCN instructs that standing orders should enable the infusion nurse to stop the drug and initiate supportive measures immediately while awaiting the provider, which fits this scenario of early, nonspecific symptoms [^c9c32435] [^b2babbe2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about severity. I initially thought "this is clearly a grade 1 reaction", but I should correct that: with only vague prodromal symptoms and no organ involvement yet, this best fits a grade 1 reaction by CTCAE-like frameworks, yet grading is retrospective and should not delay stopping the infusion; the priority is to halt the drug and assess ABCs, because taxane reactions can escalate quickly even without classic skin or respiratory findings early on [^d81f9278] [^295ddff1].

> I need to ensure I address the pathophysiology and timing. Paclitaxel immediate hypersensitivity reactions occur in roughly 10–50% of patients on first exposure, most often within the first 10–15 minutes, and are frequently complement-mediated rather than IgE-mediated; this timing and mechanism explain why early nonspecific symptoms like anxiety, flushing, back pain, or visceral urgency can herald a reaction despite premedication, reinforcing the need to stop and reassess immediately [^1b034a62] [^0f5e80cc].

> Next, I should review what to do after stopping. I will now examine the essentials: assess airway, breathing, circulation, and level of consciousness; obtain blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature; start an IV line if not already present; and be ready to administer oxygen, H1 antihistamine, H2 blocker, and corticosteroid for grade 1/2 reactions, escalating to epinephrine if hypotension or respiratory compromise emerges; NCCN and ESMO align on these steps and on having emergency equipment and standing orders available [^295ddff1] [^b2babbe2] [^b5a4810d].

> Let me consider documentation and follow-up. I should confirm that the event is recorded with pre-infusion assessments, a clear description of symptoms and timing, severity grading, medications given, and management steps; ESMO and NCCN stress standardized grading and thorough documentation to guide future decisions about rechallenge or desensitization, and they recommend consulting allergy/immunology for reactions suspicious for anaphylaxis or when planning re-exposure strategies [^17b9ef69] [^16bc7a15].

> I should double-check the plan for rechallenge. If this was a mild, non-anaphylactic reaction, options include resuming the same infusion with slower titration and additional premedication, or proceeding to formal desensitization if the drug is essential; for severe or life-threatening reactions, permanent discontinuation is advised unless under specialist-guided desensitization, and NCCN notes that switching to albumin-bound paclitaxel may help in some cases but will not overcome all infusion reactions, so decisions should be individualized and protocolized [^07ccaada] [^0651b1e4] [^6ed63a85].

> In summary, I need to ensure the immediate action is explicit: stop the paclitaxel infusion right now, obtain vital signs, and begin guideline-concordant assessment and supportive care; these vague prodromal symptoms are precisely the early warning signs that warrant stopping the infusion and observing closely, because taxane hypersensitivity reactions can evolve rapidly even when premedication has been given [^29d28930] [^c9c32435] [^b2babbe2].

---

The most appropriate immediate action is to **stop the infusion immediately** and assess the patient for a hypersensitivity reaction, even if symptoms are vague [^29d28930]. Early signs of paclitaxel hypersensitivity can be subtle — such as feeling "strange", anxiety, or gastrointestinal urgency — and may progress rapidly to severe reactions [^1b034a62]. The nurse should **check vital signs**, observe for developing symptoms, and notify the treating clinician promptly [^295ddff1]. Do not resume the infusion until the patient is fully evaluated and stabilized [^cd7267b8].

---

## Clinical significance of vague symptoms

Vague symptoms such as feeling "strange", anxiety, or gastrointestinal urgency can be **early manifestations** of a hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel [^29d28930]. These symptoms may precede more obvious signs such as rash, dyspnea, or hypotension, making early recognition critical [^1b034a62]. Paclitaxel hypersensitivity reactions are well-documented and can occur despite premedication, with reported rates of severe reactions ranging from 2% to 4% [^bb703d45].

---

## Recommended immediate actions

According to current guidelines and expert consensus, the following **immediate actions** are recommended:

- **Stop the infusion immediately**: Discontinue the paclitaxel infusion without delay, even if symptoms are mild or vague [^cd7267b8].

- **Assess vital signs**: Check blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature [^notfound].

- **Observe for developing symptoms**: Monitor for progression of symptoms, including rash, dyspnea, chest pain, hypotension, or gastrointestinal symptoms [^b2babbe2].

- **Notify the treating clinician**: Inform the oncologist or treating physician promptly for further evaluation and management [^notfound].

- **Document the event**: Record the time, symptoms, vital signs, and actions taken for future reference and management planning [^17b9ef69].

---

## Rationale for stopping the infusion

Stopping the infusion immediately is critical because paclitaxel hypersensitivity reactions can **escalate rapidly**, even from mild initial symptoms [^bb703d45]. Early intervention prevents progression to severe reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening [^b2babbe2]. Guidelines emphasize that even vague symptoms such as feeling "strange" or gastrointestinal urgency should be taken seriously and prompt immediate cessation of the infusion [^29d28930].

---

## Subsequent management steps

After stopping the infusion, the following steps should be taken:

- **Symptomatic treatment**: Administer supportive care as indicated, such as antihistamines, corticosteroids, or epinephrine if symptoms progress to moderate or severe reactions [^b2babbe2].

- **Evaluation of the reaction**: Assess the severity and characteristics of the reaction to determine whether desensitization or alternative chemotherapy agents should be considered for future cycles [^07ccaada].

- **Patient education**: Inform the patient about the signs of hypersensitivity reactions and the importance of reporting symptoms promptly in future infusions [^ecfef4e9].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

In summary, the most appropriate immediate action for a patient experiencing vague symptoms such as feeling "strange" and gastrointestinal urgency during paclitaxel infusion is to **stop the infusion immediately**, assess vital signs, observe for progression, and notify the treating clinician. This approach aligns with current guidelines and ensures patient safety by preventing escalation of hypersensitivity reactions [^29d28930].

Taxanes are an important class of antineoplastic agents used in the treatment of a wide variety of cancers. However, paclitaxel and docetaxel, which are the most commonly used taxanes, elicit immediate hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) in 5% to 10% of patients. Almost all patients that experience these reactions can be safely re-exposed to taxanes either through desensitization or challenge. This article describes the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of HSRs to taxanes and discusses the different options for their safe readministration.

available. Anaphylaxis and severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by dyspnea and hypotension requiring treatment, angioedema, and generalized urticaria have occurred in 2–4% of patients receiving TAXOL in clinical trials. Fatal reactions have occurred in patients despite premedication. All patients should be pretreated with corticosteriods, diphenhydramine, and H2 antagonists. Patients who experience severe hypersensitivity reactions to TAXOL should not be rechallenged with the drug. TAXOL therapy should not be given to patients with solid tumors who have baseline neutrophil counts of less than 1500 cells/mm³ and should not be given to patients with AIDS-related Kaposi = s sarcoma if the baseline neutrophil count is less than 1000 cells/mm³.

In order to monitor the occurrence of bone marrow suppression, primarily neutropenia, which may be severe and result in infection, it is recommended that frequent peripheral blood cell counts be performed on all patients receiving TAXOL. DESCRIPTION TAXOL Injection is a clear colorless to slightly yellow viscous solution. It is supplied as a. drug. The later phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of paclitaxel from the peripheral compartment. Pharmacokinetic parameters of paclitaxel following 3- and 24-hour infusions of TAXOL at dose levels of 135 and 175 mg/m2 were determined in a Phase 3 randomized study in ovarian cancer patients and are. The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel were also evaluated in adult cancer patients who received single doses of 15–135 mg/m2 given by 1-hour infusions, 30–275 mg/m2 given by 6-hour infusions, and 200–275 mg/m2 given by 24-hour infusions in Phase 1 & 2 studies. Values for CLT and volume of.

Possible interactions of paclitaxel with concomitantly administered medications have not been formally investigated. CLINICAL STUDIES Ovarian Carcinoma First-Line Data: The safety and efficacy of TAXOL followed by cisplatin in patients with advanced ovarian cancer and no prior chemotherapy were evaluated in two Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, controlled trials. In an. over 3 hours followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 or cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 for a median of six courses. Although the protocol allowed further therapy, only 15% received both drugs for 9 or more courses. In a study conducted by the Gynecological Oncology Group, 410 patients with. carcinoma studies are described in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section in tabular and narrative form.

Second-Line Data: Data from five Phase 1 & 2 clinical studies, a multicenter randomized Phase 3 study, as well as an interim analysis of data from more than 300 patients enrolled in a. treatment referral center program were used in support of the use of TAXOL in patients who have failed initial or subsequent chemotherapy for metastatic carcinoma of the ovary. Two of the Phase 2 studies utilized an initial dose of 135 to 170 mg/m2 in most patients administered over 24 hours by continuous. Phase 3 second-line ovarian carcinoma study are described in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section in tabular and narrative form. The results of this randomized study support the use of TAXOL at doses of 135 to 175 mg/m2, This label may not be the latest approved by FDA.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^1b034a62]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Taxanes — general and major symptoms note that immediate hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel and docetaxel occur in around 10% of patients, most commonly on first exposure, despite premedication with antihistamines and corticosteroids; Nab-paclitaxel and cabazitaxel are less frequently associated with such reactions, and Cremophor-EL and polysorbate 80 are thought to be responsible because they can cause complement activation and generate anaphylatoxins, though an IgE-mediated mechanism could also be responsible; most immediate reactions are moderate in severity with the most frequently reported symptoms being skin flushing, dyspnea, chest pain, and back pain, and in patients with hypotension, a serum tryptase level can be measured, with an elevated level supporting a mast cell–mediated reaction.

### Feasibility of stopping paclitaxel premedication after two doses in patients not experiencing a previous infusion hypersensitivity reaction [^1fb207a6]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

As the usage of weekly paclitaxel administration has increased due to improved efficacy and/or less toxicity, the necessity for repeated doses of premedications to prevent infusion hypersensitivity reactions with every dose and the safety of discontinuing these premedications are relevant questions. Hence, our study is important given the simplified approach that prospectively explored stopping premedications after two doses.

In summary, these results showed no use of rescue medication to treat infusion hypersensitivity reactions in 55 patients receiving varying doses and schedules of paclitaxel after premedications were discontinued, with a 95% CI of 0–5.3%. Based on these results, the standard practice of premedicating patients prior to every dose of paclitaxel may include the option of discontinuing premedications with the third and subsequent doses in patients who had not experienced a prior infusion hypersensitivity reaction. This approach looks promising but must be validated with a larger, prospective, randomized trial. Subsequent prospective trials should also include validated questionnaires to assess the side effects of standard premedications and the degree of interference that these symptoms cause on quality of life.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^ee03ab72]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Taxane hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) reintroduction — severity-based pathway — is defined and operationalized with desensitization, challenge, and regular infusion steps. Mild immediate reactions are limited to the skin or a single organ/system; moderate reactions involve at least 2 organs/systems without a significant drop in blood pressure or oxygen saturation; severe reactions involve at least 2 organs/systems with a significant drop in blood pressure (systolic ≤ 90 mm Hg and/or syncope) and/or oxygen saturation (≤ 92%). In patients undergoing desensitization or challenge, premedication can be adjusted for the next procedure using the same or a longer protocol; if the hypersensitivity reaction does not recur, treatment can proceed to a shorter desensitization protocol, challenge, or regular infusion, and each procedure can be repeated several times to ensure tolerance before advancing.

### Hypersensitivity reactions to platinum agents and taxanes [^bc89d8f5]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

More than 20 years ago, platinum agents and paclitaxel became the standard first-line regimens for treatment of ovarian cancer based on clinical trial data from the Gynecologic Oncology Group and European investigators. Their increased use was accompanied by a relatively high prevalence of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) in women requiring repeated cycles of chemotherapy. Rapid drug desensitization (RDD) has allowed patients to continue receiving first-line treatments and avoid unnecessary switches to second- or third-line therapies that might be less effective or more toxic. Since the early 2000s, many institutions have implemented protocols for evaluation and treatment of patients with HSRs to chemotherapy agents. Along the way, there has been significant evolution in our understanding of both IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated reactions to these drugs. Areas of active research include optimal risk stratification based on patient history, skin testing, and biomarkers, as well as the safety and efficacy of various desensitization protocols and strategies for delabeling.

### A three-step taxane titration protocol decreases hypersensitivity reactions during first and second exposures [^6de0ba60]. JCO Oncology Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients receiving taxanes are at risk for developing hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) primarily during first and second lifetime exposures. Immediate HSRs require emergency care and can interfere with the continuation of preferred treatment. Although different approaches to slow titration have been used successfully for desensitization after HSR occurrence, there are no standardized recommendations for taxane titration to prevent HSRs.

Purpose

To determine if a gradual, three-step infusion rate titration decreases the rate and severity of immediate HSRs during first and second lifetime exposures to paclitaxel and docetaxel.

Methods

We used a prospective, interventional design with historical comparisons to evaluate a sample of 222 first and second lifetime exposure paclitaxel and docetaxel infusions. The intervention was a three-step infusion rate titration provided at the initiation of first and second lifetime exposures. Ninety-nine titrated infusions were compared with 123 historical records of nontitrated infusions.

Results

Compared with the nontitrated group (n = 123), the titrated group (n = 99) had significantly less HSRs (19% v 7%; P = 0.017). No significant difference in HSR severity was found between groups (P = 1.00). However, four nontitrated patients received epinephrine, and one required transfer to the emergency department (ED) because of reaction severity. In contrast, no titrated patients received epinephrine or required transfer to the ED. In the nontitrated group, seven patients did not complete their infusions versus one patient in the titrated group.

Conclusion

A standardized, three-step infusion rate titration prevented HSR occurrence. Significant issues affecting practice feasibility and sustainability were addressed.

### Management of chemotherapy hypersensitivity reactions and desensitization: an SGO clinical practice statement [^b4886f16]. Gynecologic Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The goal of this practice statement is to help members and their multidisciplinary teams recognize infusion reactions and hypersensitivity reactions in the clinical setting. It will provide recommendations to help guide response to reactions and desensitization when appropriate, to promote safe use of chemotherapeutic agents among all providers in the delivery process.

Methods

A multi-disciplinary team of healthcare professionals from the Society of Gynecologic Oncology Education Committee collaborated to review peer reviewed literature and guidelines to develop a practice statement on the management of chemotherapy hypersensitivity reactions and desensitization regimens.

Results

There is always potential for a patient to have a reaction to any medication, with both infusion reactions and hypersensitivity reactions potentially occurring in the treatment of gynecologic cancers. Premedication to prevent reactions should be given at least prior to infusion for regimens that include the most common agents associated with reactions. At the time when reaction is occurring it might be difficult to distinguish between an infusion reaction versus true hypersensitivity given the similarities in signs and symptoms, therefore it is important that orders to manage reactions be included in every chemotherapy order set so the infusion nurse can provide immediate interventions while waiting for the provider to arrive to assess the patient. Desensitization is a potential option to allow the patient to continue to receive the offending agent. While a variety of desensitization regimens have been presented in the literature, the goal is to minimize steps and variability to decrease opportunity for errors during chemotherapy preparation or administration.

Conclusion

Incorporating a review of the literature and clinical experience from the SGO Education Committee, this paper provides an overview of current approaches for prevention and management of reactions to commonly used chemotherapy agents for gynecologic cancers.

### The taxanes: toxicity and quality of life considerations in advanced ovarian cancer [^fb4904ad]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Premedication guidelines

Patients receiving taxane therapy require premedication to minimise the risk of hypersensitivity reactions. However, the premedication guidelines recommended for paclitaxel and docetaxel are markedly different. As indicated in Table 1

Table 1
Premedication guidelines for the taxanes, patients who receive paclitaxel require both intravenous histamine H 1 and H 2 antagonists in addition to oral corticosteroids before 1-, 3- or 24-h infusions, although there is some evidence that premedication is not needed before prolonged infusions (those exceeding 96 h). By contrast, the premedication regimen recommended for patients receiving docetaxel consists of 3 days' oral dexamethasone (8 mg twice daily).

Corticosteroid therapy is used in part to prevent hypersensitivity reactions, but major aims are to delay the onset and decrease the severity of fluid retention, and to decrease the frequency and severity of skin and nail changes. A 5-day premedication was originally recommended for patients being treated with docetaxel, but this was subsequently reduced to 3 days after the latter regimen was shown to be associated with similar rates of fluid retention and less mucositis and infection.

Management of drug reactions — preparation and acute response during chemotherapy: Patients and their families should be counseled about the possibility of a drug reaction and the signs and symptoms of one, and patients should be told to report any signs and symptoms of a drug reaction, especially after they have left the clinic (ie, delayed rash). Clinicians and nursing staff should be prepared for the possibility of a drug reaction every time a patient is infused with a drug, standing orders should be written for immediate intervention, and the treatment area should have appropriate medical equipment in case of a life-threatening reaction. Epinephrine (intramuscular [IM] 0.3 mL of 1 mg/mL solution/ Epipen) should be used for any patient experiencing hypotension (systolic blood pressure of < 90 mm Hg) with or without other symptoms of an allergic/hypersensitivity reaction during or shortly after any chemotherapy drug treatment, and in the setting of acute cardiopulmonary arrest standard resuscitation (advanced cardiovascular life support [ACLS]) procedures should be followed. Desensitization can be considered for patients who have had drug reactions, and if a patient has previously had a very severe life-threatening reaction, the implicated drug should not be used again unless under guidance of an allergist or specialist with desensitization experience. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Paclitaxel [^bb703d45]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING

Paclitaxel should be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Appropriate management of complications is possible only when adequate diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available.

Anaphylaxis and severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by dyspnea and hypotension requiring treatment, angioedema, and generalized urticaria have occurred in 2 to 4% of patients receiving paclitaxel in clinical trials. Fatal reactions have occurred in patients despite premedication. All patients should be pretreated with corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, and H₂antagonists (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Patients who experience severe hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel should not be rechallenged with the drug.

Paclitaxel therapy should not be given to patients with solid tumors who have baseline neutrophil counts of less than 1,500 cells/mm³ and should not be given to patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma if the baseline neutrophil count is less than 1,000 cells/mm³. In order to monitor the occurrence of bone marrow suppression, primarily neutropenia, which may be severe and result in infection, it is recommended that frequent peripheral blood cell counts be performed on all patients receiving paclitaxel.

### Immediate hypersensitivity reaction to chemotherapeutic agents [^5ea67b63]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

An increase by 70% in new cases of cancer is expected over the next 2 decades, with more than 8 million people dying each year from the disease, an estimated 13% of all deaths worldwide. Several new chemotherapeutic agents have been rapidly developed and many of them approved through a fast-track process. In parallel, adverse reactions to chemotherapy have increased dramatically worldwide, frequently preventing the use of first-line therapy for cancer and jeopardizing patients' treatment outcomes. The present review focuses on immediate hypersensitivity reactions (IHRs) induced by chemotherapeutic agents. We address general features of these reactions and specific characteristics of the most prevalent agents involved. On the basis of scientific evidence, we suggest classifying acute reactions to chemotherapy as toxic, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and IHRs (anaphylactic-type reactions). IHRs to chemotherapeutic agents are unpredictable adverse reactions with potentially lethal consequences. Correct diagnosis and proper management of oncologic patients with IHRs are fundamental in order not to deprive them of the first-line treatment for their disease. In this scenario, rapid drug desensitization is a groundbreaking procedure that enables selected patients to receive the drug that induced an IHR in a safe way, minimizing the risks of anaphylaxis and treatment failure.

### The timeliness of patients reporting the side effects of chemotherapy [^0caba48c]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To explore the actions cancer patients reported they would take in response to a range of common side effects of chemotherapy and whether these were considered appropriate based on current guidelines and evidence; and to explore the sociodemographic and cancer-related variables associated with patients selecting the appropriate action (immediate medical attention or reporting) for two potentially life-threatening side effects: fever, and unusual bleeding and bruising.

Methods

Four hundred thirty-six medical oncology and haematology patients receiving chemotherapy completed two surveys to provide demographic, disease and treatment characteristics, and details on how they would respond if they experienced a range of specified side effects of chemotherapy (for example, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, and skin rash or nail changes). The proportion of patients reporting the appropriate action for each side effect was calculated. Multiple logistic regressions examined the patient demographic and cancer characteristics associated with selecting the appropriate action (seeking immediate medical attention) for two potentially life-threatening side effects of chemotherapy: high fever of 38 °C or more, and unusual bleeding or bruising.

Results

Two thirds of patients indicated that they would seek immediate medical attention for high fever (67%), but only 41% would seek immediate attention for bleeding or bruising. Cancer type and time since diagnosis were significantly associated with patients indicating that they would seek immediate medical attention for high fever; while time since diagnosis was the only variable significantly associated with patients reporting that they would seek immediate medical attention for unusual bleeding or bruising. For chronic side effects, like skin rash or nail changes, and tingling or numbness, which usually do not require urgent reporting, only between 12 and 16% would report them immediately. A significant proportion of patients reported that they would "do nothing" about fatigue or tiredness (24%). By comparison, less than 10% patients reported that they would do nothing for the other side effects investigated.

Conclusions

Tools need to be created so that patients better understand the side effects after being treated with chemotherapy and what action they should take.

### Rapid inpatient / outpatient desensitization for chemotherapy hypersensitivity: standard protocol effective in 57 patients for 255 courses [^0b45614c]. Gynecologic Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Hypersensitivity reactions (HR) to chemotherapy often prompt permanent discontinuation and deprive the patient of the most active regimen. We investigated the safety and effectiveness of a rapid desensitization protocol used in inpatient and outpatient settings for patients with HR to various chemotherapy and related agents.

Methods

A 3-solution, 12-step protocol delivered doubling drug doses by step, infusing the target dose over 5.8 h for inpatient and 3.8 h for outpatient administration.

Results

57 consecutive patients who had moderate to severe HR to chemotherapy were evaluated for desensitization. All 57 patients successfully completed 255 courses of desensitization (127 to carboplatin, 114 to paclitaxel, and 14 to four other agents) where 16 patients received 51 courses in the outpatient setting (34 to carboplatin and 17 to paclitaxel). 225 courses (88.2%) were completed without any HR. 18 patients had breakthrough symptoms (BS) over 30 courses (11.8%) that were less severe than their initial HR. After management of breakthrough symptoms, these patients finished all 30 courses and tolerated subsequent desensitizations on a modified protocol. 21 of 26 patients (81%) with HR to carboplatin had positive skin tests to carboplatin. Cancer response to chemotherapy administered by desensitization was within the expected range after 1–3 years of follow-up.

Conclusion

The rapid desensitization protocol was safe and effective in both the inpatient and outpatient settings and allowed appropriate patients with moderate to severe HR to continue chemotherapy. This study warrants the incorporation of the protocol into standard clinical practice.

NCCN Gynecologic oncology drug reactions — hypersensitivity profile and management are outlined as follows: Virtually all drugs have the potential to cause adverse hypersensitivity reactions, either during or after the infusion, and in gynecologic oncology treatment agents that more commonly cause adverse reactions include carboplatin, cisplatin, docetaxel, liposomal doxorubicin, and paclitaxel. Most reactions are mild infusion reactions (skin reactions, cardiovascular reactions, respiratory or throat tightness), but more severe allergic reactions (life-threatening anaphylaxis) can occur; infusion reactions are more common with paclitaxel, whereas allergic reactions (true drug allergies) are more common with platinum agents (carboplatin, cisplatin). Patients who have had severe life-threatening reactions should not receive the implicated agent again unless under the care of an allergist or expert in managing drug reactions, and if a mild allergic reaction has previously occurred and it is appropriate to administer the drug again, a desensitization regimen should be used even if the symptoms have resolved, with various desensitization regimens published and to be followed.

### Feasibility of stopping paclitaxel premedication after two doses in patients not experiencing a previous infusion hypersensitivity reaction [^ef8c21bc]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Endpoints and assessment

The primary endpoint was to estimate the incidence of rescue medication usage during paclitaxel doses 3 through 6 for patients whose premedication regimen was discontinued. Previous studies have not adequately defined what constitutes a "severe" or "clinically relevant" infusion reaction, what scale/scoring system was used to grade them, and how many patients actually received parenteral rescue medications to treat these reactions. We selected the use of rescue medication as our primary endpoint, rather than occurrence of an infusion hypersensitivity reaction, because the former is a more measurable endpoint given the difficulty of grading these reactions.

Clinical signs and symptoms of paclitaxel hypersensitivity reactions (Table 1) may vary. Grading of these hypersensitivity reactions is challenging due to the fact that no standard criteria have been developed: NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.1 for "Allergic Reaction/Hypersensitivity" (Table 2) was not all encompassing; for example, paclitaxel infusion hypersensitivity may also include diaphoresis, anxiety, tachycardia, symptomatic chest pain, and back pain. Furthermore, in routine clinical practice, parenteral "rescue" medications are often administered at the onset of the infusion hypersensitivity reaction to minimize the severity and progression of the reaction. Therefore, the use of parenteral medications in symptomatic patients is not restricted to CTCAE grade 3 (and higher) reactions only.

### Prospective study testing a simplified paclitaxel premedication regimen in patients with early breast cancer [^39af6a85]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In early clinical trials of paclitaxel, hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) to paclitaxel occurred in up to 30% of patients. After the introduction of premedication with antihistamines and corticosteroids, and prolongation of infusion time, the rate of severe reactions was reduced to 2%–4%. Conventional practice is to administer 12–20 mg of dexamethasone (frequently as two doses starting the evening before chemotherapy), H₁‐receptor antagonists, and H₂‐receptor antagonists prior to every cycle of paclitaxel. The current package insert for paclitaxel contains a black box warning referencing the risk of anaphylaxis and severe HSRs and states that all patients should be pretreated with corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, and H2‐antagonists.

However, the majority of HSRs to paclitaxel occur within the first two cycles. In a study of 450 patients who received paclitaxel premedication, 44 (9%) patients experienced a total of 71 infusion reactions. Notably, 48% of infusion reactions occurred during the initial cycle of paclitaxel, with 23%, 13%, 8%, and 4% of reactions during cycles 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Of the 44 patients who experienced at least one HSR, 77% experienced a reaction during cycle 1, and 18% had their first reaction during cycle 2. Only 5% of patients experienced an initial reaction after the second cycle of paclitaxel.

### Feasibility of stopping paclitaxel premedication after two doses in patients not experiencing a previous infusion hypersensitivity reaction [^7eda98e2]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Interestingly, in our trial, a subset of nine (13%) patients who despite having no infusion hypersensitivity reactions felt that the late side effects attributed to paclitaxel (such as plantar skin peeling, lower extremity rash and facial burning, rash on dorsal arm, itching, indigestion, and allergic rhinitis) could be ameliorated by premedications and requested that they be continued (n = 3) or resumed after stopping (n = 6). Following discontinuation of dexamethasone, no patients requested an antiemetic premedication be added for nausea.

There are several limitations to this trial including a small sample size and lack of a control arm. Quality of life, nursing convenience, patient time spent in the infusion suite, and cost data, collected before and after paclitaxel premedication discontinuation also would have been of interest. A small number (15%) of patients included in the primary analysis received 175 mg/m 2 doses, and although our study was not powered to look at differences between paclitaxel doses, this approach appears to be applicable regardless of paclitaxel dose. The upper limit of the 95% CI (5.3%) exceeds what was previously stated as an acceptable rate of rescue medication usage (5%), however this can be attributed to sample size. If three more subjects would have been included in the primary analysis, then the upper bound of the one-sided 95% CI would have been 5.0%; recall that six patients not included in primary analysis had premedications resumed in later cycles despite not experiencing an infusion hypersensitivity reaction after paclitaxel premedications were stopped. As the incidence of rescue medication usage in this trial was 0%, these results support the research hypothesis.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Note: Contact of the undiluted concentrate with plasticized PVC equipment or devices used to prepare solutions for infusion is not recommended. In order to minimize patient exposure to the plasticizer DEHP [di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate], which may be leached from PVC infusion bags or sets, diluted paclitaxel solutions should be stored in bottles (glass, polypropylene) or plastic bags (polypropylene, polyolefin) and administered through polyethylene-lined administration sets.

All patients should be premedicated prior to paclitaxel administration in order to prevent severe hypersensitivity reactions. Such premedication may consist of dexamethasone 20 mg PO administered approximately 12 and 6 hours before paclitaxel, diphenhydramine (or its equivalent) 50 mg I.V. 30 to 60 minutes prior to paclitaxel, and cimetidine (300 mg) or ranitidine (50 mg) I.V. 30 to 60 minutes before paclitaxel.

For patients with carcinoma of the ovary, the following regimens are recommended (see CLINICAL STUDIES, Ovarian Carcinoma):

1) For previously untreated patients with carcinoma of the ovary, one of the following recommended regimens may be given every 3 weeks. In selecting the appropriate regimen, differences in toxicities should be considered (see TABLE 11 in ADVERSE REACTIONS, Disease-Specific Adverse Event Experiences).

Ovarian cancer — drug-specific considerations and premedication for hypersensitivity: Most mild reactions are infusion reactions and more commonly are caused by taxanes (docetaxel, paclitaxel) but can also occur with platinum agents (carboplatin, cisplatin), whereas most severe reactions are allergic reactions more commonly caused by platinum agents. Premedication components include H1 blocker antihistamine (eg, diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine), H2 blockers (eg, cimetidine, famotidine), and corticosteroids (eg, methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, dexamethasone). In hypersensitivity, consider switching to albumin-bound paclitaxel or consider switching to docetaxel; however, there are no data to support switching taxanes, and cross reactions have occurred and have been life-threatening; some reactions to paclitaxel may occur because of the diluent. For platinum-specific guidance see Drug Reaction to Platinum Agents (OV-D, 4 of 7).

### Fatal outcome of a hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel: a critical review of premedication regimens [^8083989d]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

A hypersensitivity reaction (HSR), defined as any immunological response to a drug resulting in an adverse reaction, is a frequent side effect during paclitaxel infusion. Symptoms vary from mild pruritus to anaphylaxis. The occurrence of HSRs can be influenced by administration of an appropriate premedication. Oral premedication with dexamethasone at a dose of 20 mg given orally at 12 and 6 h before infusion of paclitaxel has been shown to reduce the incidence of paclitaxel-induced HSRs significantly. However, due to logistical factors, short-course premedication with intravenously (i.v.) administered dexamethasone given 30 min prior to paclitaxel infusion has become customary in many centres. Retrospective analyses comparing the effectivity of both prophylactic regimens have been performed. However, outcomes from these studies are inconsistent. In this report, the rationale of short-course i.v. dexamethasone is discussed at the occasion of a fatal anaphylactic event after paclitaxel infusion with the latter premedication regimen.

Discussion

As this review shows, the optimal use of desensitization protocols in different patient populations and settings is still being tailored. With increasing safety data over time, more patients with mild-to-moderate initial HSRs, and even some with severe initial HSRs, have been desensitized in outpatient infusion centers at institutions experienced with RDD, instead of in the ICU. This has significant advantages in terms of patient access and convenience, ease of scheduling, and resource demands. As pharmacy and nursing resources differ between inpatient and outpatient settings, reports of ongoing experiences in the outpatient setting will add to the literature on safety and efficacy.

The information outlined here is intended to help institutions determine what pathway might best meet their needs. These decisions require consideration of the time and resources required for desensitization, urgency of treatment, and availability of trained staff and standardized protocols for treatment of HSRs. Institution-specific factors may also affect decisions around use of skin testing, drug challenge, and choice of desensitization protocol. For example, serial ST may be more beneficial in situations when advancing from slower to faster desensitization infusions would improve convenience or quality of life for patients — by enabling transition to outpatient slowed infusion at centers where desensitization must occur in the ICU. In contrast, if patients can receive empiric desensitizations in the outpatient infusion center, additional visits for skin testing may not be desired by the patient, even if feasible. As discussed above, institutions differ in terms of whether drug challenge is even considered in the initial evaluation for low-risk or ST-negative patients, or only after uneventful desensitizations.

### Pre-medication protocols for the prevention of paclitaxel-induced infusion related reactions: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1cc88e6b]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Prophylaxis against infusion-related reactions (IRR) from paclitaxel with steroids and antihistamines is a standard of care due to high rates of IRR. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively summarize the evidence behind various prophylaxis strategies.

Methods

EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials were searched (1946 to May 14, 2021). The primary outcomes were Grade 3/4 IRR and any-grade IRR. Secondary outcomes included treatment delay or discontinuation and adverse events secondary to pre-medications.

Results

Of the 1285 unique citations, 26 studies were selected: 11 studies for quantitative analysis and 15 studies for qualitative analysis. Studies included randomized controlled trials and observational studies (n = 25–281). There was a non-significant benefit in favour of oral steroids starting 12 h prior to paclitaxel administration versus intravenous steroids immediately prior to paclitaxel administration for grade 3/4 IRRs, with a risk difference (RD) of 2% [95%CI 0 to 5%], any-grade IRR with a RD of 4% [95%CI: -1% to 9%] and treatment discontinuation with a RD of 1% [95%CI -1% to 2%]. For de-escalation strategies, a point-estimate for any-grade IRR was 0.44% [95% CI, 0 to 0.02, p = 0.98] and for grade 3/4 IRR was 3.1% (95% CI, 0.02 to 0.07, p = 0.11).

Conclusion

Although studies have high risk of bias and risk, differences between steroid routes of administration were small, there was a non-significant trend in favour of oral steroids. De-escalation strategies after two previous successful paclitaxel infusions have an overall low incidence rate of severe IRR and warrant further prospective clinical trials. Insufficient evidence remains to recommend for or against other interventions for the prevention of paclitaxel IRR.

NCCN ovarian cancer — post-reaction agent selection and platinum hypersensitivity management include the following: For those with more than one mild reaction to a non-platinum agent, consider switching to paclitaxel (albumin-bound) due to medical necessity (ie, hypersensitivity reaction) or consider switching to docetaxel; however, there are no data to support switching taxanes, and cross reactions have occurred and have been life-threatening. Some reactions to paclitaxel may occur because of the diluent, in which case switching to albumin-bound paclitaxel could diminish future risks. For patients with hypersensitivity to platinum-reagents, data suggest that re-administration of platinum-based treatment resulted in hypersensitivity reactions in approximately one third of patients, although none were severe (grade ≥ 3), and survival was improved compared with patients who were switched to non-platinum agents. Data also suggest that an extended infusion schedule and use of premedication may decrease the number of hypersensitivity reactions to carboplatin.

### Fatal outcome of a hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel: a critical review of premedication regimens [^44493bf3]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

However, this treatment regimen requires a good compliance by the patients. To avoid rescheduling chemotherapy schemes due to noncompliance, attention was focused on anecdotal cases in which dexamethasone was administered shortly before paclitaxel infusion. In several retrospective series, 5–20 mg of dexamethasone administered i.v. 3 min before the infusion of paclitaxel showed equal success as the oral premedication of historical cases. These reports are in contrast with a recent report by, who retrospectively showed that a single-dose i.v. corticosteroid prophylactic regimen was associated with a significantly higher rate of HSR than the two-dose oral corticosteroid regimen. Bearing in mind the pharmacological properties of dexamethasone, the short-course i.v. premedication schedule given 30 min before paclitaxel infusion is unlikely to result in an adequate level of immunosuppression during the infusion of the drug. This may explain the results of Kwon et al. This is confirmed by the observation that the incidence of HSRs is not influenced by the dosage of i.v. administered dexamethasone 30 min before chemotherapy infusion. It is possible that retrospective analysis and comparison of the study cohort with historical controls bias the observed protective effect of short-course i.v. prophylaxis by dexamethasone. A prospective randomised study in which the oral pre-treatment regimen is compared with the short-course i.v. administration of dexamethasone is preferable.

In conclusion, the fatal outcome of the paclitaxel-associated HSR in the patient illustrates the need for continuous awareness and questions the importance of routine i.v. premedication for paclitaxel administration.
