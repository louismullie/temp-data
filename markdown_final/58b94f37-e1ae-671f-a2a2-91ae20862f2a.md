## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about ulcerative colitis treatment education. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the disease entity and scope. Then, I should verify the overarching treatment goals and treat-to-target principles. Next, I will stratify by disease severity and extent, followed by detailing induction and maintenance strategies for mild-to-moderate versus moderate-to-severe disease. After that, I should review special populations and scenarios, including acute severe UC, proctitis, and pediatrics. Finally, I will integrate monitoring, safety, and shared decision-making, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the disease entity and scope so I don't conflate entities. Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory bowel disease characterized by continuous mucosal inflammation starting in the rectum and extending proximally to varying degrees, with bloody diarrhea as the hallmark symptom; diagnosis relies on colonoscopy with histology, and management aims to induce and maintain steroid-free remission with endoscopic improvement to reduce hospitalizations and surgery [^a981818a] [^be2e07da].

> I need to ensure the treatment goals are explicit and measurable. The modern paradigm is treat-to-target, prioritizing both clinical remission and endoscopic improvement (Mayo endoscopic score 0 or 1) to increase durable steroid-free remission and prevent complications; fecal calprotectin is recommended to monitor response and detect relapse, and shared decision-making is emphasized to align therapy with patient values and comorbidities [^a63017d6] [^6dfcb870] [^0e968984].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about therapy before stratifying severity and extent. I should confirm that mild-to-moderate disease typically lacks systemic features and has limited endoscopic severity, whereas moderate-to-severe disease includes frequent stools with blood, anemia, systemic symptoms, and more extensive or severe endoscopic inflammation; extent matters because distal disease may respond to topical therapy, while extensive disease generally requires systemic strategies [^a981818a] [^57cdadc8].

> For mild-to-moderate UC, I will now examine induction. Oral 5-ASA at ≥ 2 g/day is first-line, with once-daily dosing as effective as divided dosing; combining oral and rectal 5-ASA improves outcomes, and rectal 5-ASA is preferred over rectal corticosteroids for distal disease; if remission is not achieved, I should double-check dosing and adherence before escalating, and avoid switching to another 5-ASA formulation if already optimally dosed [^4b9c4002] [^8da57395] [^eaf23e9d] [^1dfe2411].

> Wait, let me verify the role of corticosteroids in mild-to-moderate disease. Colonic-release budesonide or rectal corticosteroids can be considered for induction when 5-ASA is insufficient or not tolerated, but systemic corticosteroids are not for maintenance due to adverse effects; I should confirm that patients understand this boundary to prevent steroid dependence [^5f8be889] [^e3394d9b] [^01389db1].

> Next, I should review maintenance for mild-to-moderate UC. Oral 5-ASA at ≥ 2 g/day is standard maintenance to reduce relapse risk; I need to ensure adherence and consider rectal therapy for distal disease, and remember that thiopurines are not first-line here unless there is steroid dependence or 5-ASA intolerance [^1088ac5a] [^8bd31be2].

> For moderate-to-severe UC, I should confirm that 5-ASA monotherapy is inadequate and that advanced therapies are indicated. Systemic corticosteroids are appropriate for induction, but I must plan a steroid-sparing maintenance strategy from the outset; infliximab is often preferred as the first anti-TNF, and combination with an immunomodulator can improve durability, though I should individualize based on infection risk and patient preference [^43a94f5d] [^0e968984] [^997acce9].

> Let me consider non-TNF options and sequencing. Vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and JAK inhibitors such as upadacitinib are effective alternatives, with vedolizumab favored when systemic immunosuppression is undesirable; I should confirm that patients with higher infection risk or extraintestinal manifestations may benefit from mechanism-specific choices, and that head-to-head data remain limited, guiding shared decision-making [^e51da28d] [^c685d3bd] [^d797f48a] [^836da45d].

> I should double-check the stance on thiopurine monotherapy in moderate-to-severe disease. Guidelines suggest against thiopurine monotherapy for induction due to limited efficacy, but thiopurines can be considered for maintenance after steroid-induced remission or when advanced therapies are contraindicated; methotrexate monotherapy is not recommended for induction or maintenance in UC [^bb1c75e5] [^7af2d7f3].

> But wait, what if the patient presents with acute severe UC. Hospitalization, IV corticosteroids, and early surgical consultation are essential; if there is no improvement within about 3–5 days, rescue therapy with infliximab or cyclosporine is indicated, and colectomy should not be delayed if rescue fails; I need to ensure close monitoring and multidisciplinary coordination during this window [^c22f0d1d].

> For isolated proctitis, I should confirm that rectal 5-ASA is first-line and superior to rectal steroids; many patients are undertreated, and a meaningful fraction will eventually require advanced therapies, so I should reassess periodically and escalate promptly if steroid dependence emerges [^eaf23e9d] [^aff64be7].

> In pediatrics, I need to ensure growth and nutrition are prioritized alongside disease control. Management principles mirror adults, but steroid-sparing strategies and attention to bone health, pubertal delay, and psychosocial needs are critical; surgery rates remain substantial, reinforcing the need for timely escalation when indicated [^47cca3a2] [^21efda16].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety. Fecal calprotectin is recommended to assess response and detect relapse, and endoscopic improvement should be pursued; I must screen for infections such as TB and hepatitis B before biologics, monitor CBC and LFTs on immunomodulators, and counsel on malignancy risk and vaccination strategies; shared decision-making is essential to balance efficacy, safety, and cost [^6dfcb870] [^0e968984].

> Hold on, I should verify the evolving evidence on early advanced therapy. The AGA suggests considering early advanced therapy in moderate-to-severe UC rather than step-up after 5-ASA failure, acknowledging very low certainty and the need to individualize based on disease severity, risk factors, and patient preferences; this remains an area of active research and debate [^465cdfbb] [^7c3bac2a].

> Let me reconsider the practical synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Mild-to-moderate UC is managed with optimized 5-ASA, adding rectal therapy and short courses of topical steroids if needed, with maintenance on 5-ASA; moderate-to-severe UC requires systemic corticosteroids for induction with a planned transition to steroid-sparing maintenance using anti-TNF, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, or JAK inhibition, selected via shared decision-making and comorbidity considerations; throughout, treat-to-target with endoscopic improvement and biomarker-guided monitoring improves long-term outcomes [^a63017d6] [^6dfcb870] [^0e968984].

---

Ulcerative colitis (UC) management is **severity-based** and **treat-to-target**, aiming for steroid-free remission with endoscopic healing [^a63017d6] [^60e530ff]. For mild-to-moderate UC, start with oral 5-ASA (≥ 2 g/day) [^4b9c4002] and add rectal 5-ASA for distal disease [^8da57395]; escalate to budesonide or systemic steroids if needed, but avoid long-term steroids [^5f8be889] [^01389db1]. For moderate-to-severe UC, use biologics (infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab) or JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, upadacitinib) [^95ef9d1b] [^d797f48a]; consider combination therapy (e.g. infliximab plus azathioprine) for enhanced efficacy [^997acce9]. Acute severe UC requires hospitalization, IV corticosteroids, and early rescue therapy or colectomy if no improvement in 3–5 days [^c22f0d1d]. Maintenance therapy should continue the effective agent and monitor for adverse effects; surgery is reserved for refractory disease or dysplasia [^28879b5c].

## Disease severity classification

UC severity is classified by **clinical features, endoscopy, and biomarkers**:

| **Severity** | **Clinical features** | **Endoscopic features** | **Biomarkers** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mild | ≤ 4 stools/day, minimal bleeding, no systemic features | Erythema, friability, no ulcers | Normal CRP/ESR, low FC |
| Moderate | 4–6 stools/day, bleeding, minimal systemic features | Ulcers, erythema, friability | Elevated CRP/ESR, FC 100–250 µg/g |
| Severe | ≥ 6 stools/day, severe bleeding, systemic features | Deep ulcers, spontaneous bleeding | High CRP/ESR, FC > 250 µg/g |

## Induction of remission

### Mild-to-moderate UC

- **5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA)**: First-line therapy; oral ≥ 2 g/day [^4b9c4002]; add rectal 5-ASA for distal disease [^8da57395].
- **Rectal therapy**: Enemas or suppositories for proctitis or distal colitis [^4136bb2a] [^eaf23e9d].
- **Budesonide**: Consider if 5-ASA is inadequate or not tolerated [^5f8be889] [^907d5411].
- **Systemic corticosteroids**: Use short-term only; not for maintenance [^01389db1].

---

### Moderate-to-severe UC

- **Systemic corticosteroids**: Prednisone 40–60 mg/day until remission, then taper [^notfound].
- **Biologics**: Infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab [^95ef9d1b] [^c685d3bd].
- **JAK inhibitors**: Tofacitinib or upadacitinib for induction [^d797f48a].
- **Combination therapy**: Infliximab plus azathioprine for enhanced efficacy [^997acce9].

---

### Acute severe UC

- **Hospitalization**: IV corticosteroids (e.g. hydrocortisone 100 mg IV every 8 hours) [^notfound].
- **Rescue therapy**: Infliximab or cyclosporine if no improvement in 3–5 days [^notfound].
- **Colectomy**: Indicated for refractory disease or complications (e.g. perforation, toxic megacolon) [^c22f0d1d].

---

## Maintenance of remission

- **5-ASA**: Continue at ≥ 2 g/day for mild-to-moderate UC [^1088ac5a].
- **Thiopurines**: Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine for steroid-dependent UC [^8bd31be2] [^43d21ff7].
- **Biologics**: Continue the effective agent (infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab) [^95ef9d1b] [^c685d3bd].
- **JAK inhibitors**: Tofacitinib or upadacitinib for maintenance [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular **clinical assessment** should track symptoms, adverse effects, and adherence. Endoscopy at 6–12 months helps confirm remission and guide therapy. Fecal calprotectin supports monitoring of inflammation and detection of relapse [^6dfcb870]. Routine labs (CBC, liver enzymes, renal function) and drug-level monitoring are essential for safety and optimization [^notfound].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for **medically refractory disease**, acute severe UC unresponsive to rescue therapy, or dysplasia/cancer. Options include total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) or end ileostomy [^28879b5c].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

- **S1P modulators**: Ozanimod and etrasimod are approved options [^notfound].
- **Anti-IL-23 agents**: Further studies are ongoing [^notfound].
- **Personalized medicine**: Biomarkers to guide therapy selection are under development [^891ad428].

---

UC management is **individualized** by severity, with 5-ASA for mild disease and biologics/JAK inhibitors for moderate-to-severe disease; treat-to-target with endoscopic healing and minimize steroid exposure [^a63017d6].

### IBD therapeutics: what is in the pipeline? [^e9b14950]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic long-term relapsing and remitting disorder including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The aim of therapy is to induce and maintain remission. Anti-TNF therapies dramatically improved clinical outcomes but primary failure or secondary loss is a common problem as well as potential side effects potentially limiting efficacy and long-term use. The advent of new targeted agents with the potential for greater safety is welcomed in IBD and offers the potential for different agents as the disease becomes refractory or even combination therapies to maximise effectiveness without compromising safety in the future. More data are required to understand the best positioning in pathways and longer-term safety effects.

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis [^891ad428]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

AGA Living Clinical Practice Guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis — future directions and updating plan note that "future selection of therapy may be based on predictive clinical and biomarker-based models", but "there is a paucity of data on how such models can inform treatment selection in the real-world setting", with "ongoing research efforts using multi-omic platforms using serum, stool, and tissue specimens" to develop predictive biomarkers. It emphasizes that "Shared decision making is an important process in selecting the management strategy for management of ulcerative colitis" and describes potential strategies including "combination advanced therapy or episodic use of nonimmunogenic advanced therapies, such as small molecules", while stating that "Further primary data are required to accurately inform the positioning of such strategies". For maintenance as a living guideline, it specifies that "the AGA will update relevant recommendations from these guidelines by periodic review of evidence every 6 months", and that the review "will include availability of phase 3 or phase 4 efficacy data for new treatments, treatment strategies, or existing treatments, as well as significant new safety concerns informing treatment positioning".

### Indications and options for surgery in ulcerative colitis [^28879b5c]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis affects differing lengths of the colon and rectum. Surgical treatment is considered curative when the entire colon and rectum is removed. However, surgical treatment of ulcerative colitis should only be pursued for additional complicating factors of the disease. In addition, the current physiologic status as well as the patient's desire to retain intestinal continuity should be considered. This article outlines the current indications for surgical treatment in patients with ulcerative colitis, the various surgical options, and the techniques used to accomplish these goals.

### A review of the therapeutic management of ulcerative colitis [^1b22bc40]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing and remitting gastrointestinal disorder of uncertain aetiology. The last two decades have seen an expansion in the therapeutic arsenal used to treat UC. This has resulted in improved clinical remission and response rates. Nonetheless, staples in our current medical management originate from trials conducted in the early 20th century. In this review article, we aim to outline the key milestones in the history of the medical management of UC in addition to highlighting promising therapeutic developments for the future.

### Oral 5-ASA therapy in ulcerative colitis: what are the implications of the new formulations? [^484cc77e]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is the standard first-line treatment for mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. A variety of 5-ASA delivery systems are available and in development, including both oral and rectal formulations; all of which aim to deliver the active drug to the colon while minimizing systemic absorption. Because the efficacy of most oral 5-ASA therapies is broadly similar, the appropriate selection of a given formulation often relies on other factors. This article explores the differences between oral 5-ASA formulations in terms of their delivery system, reviews the available data on oral 5-ASA treatment efficacy and tolerability, and examines the rationale for changing from one 5-ASA formulation to another if a patient does not respond to, or worsens on, their existing agent.

### Management of ulcerative colitis [^47cca3a2]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The guidelines referenced in this review offer a useful summary for how to manage UC. They highlight the need for accurate diagnosis, early initiation of appropriate therapy and ongoing assessment of disease progress and the side effects of treatment. Care is often centralised, but awareness of who and when to refer for assessment both initially and during relapse (particularly for severe colitis) will remain an important part of the overall management of these children.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^57cdadc8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis — therapeutic management guidance: Therapeutic management in UC should be guided by the extent of bowel involvement, an assessment of disease activity and disease prognosis; patients with moderate-to-severely active UC or with high risk of hospitalization or colectomy should be treated with therapies that have evidence for efficacy based on clinical trials and real world studies. We recommend that prognosis should guide choice of therapy as much as activity of inflammation at the time of acute illness.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^79e63f1d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

ACG guideline — Grading of recommendations and implications for ulcerative colitis care states that factors influencing the strength of the recommendation include the quality of the evidence, clinical and patient-reported outcomes, risk of harm, and costs/ healthcare resource utilization. Strong recommendations are offered when the desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable effects, with patient implications that most individuals would prefer the recommended course and clinician implications that most patients should receive the recommended course or an alternative with similar strength. Conditional recommendations are offered when trade-offs are less certain — either because of low quality evidence or because evidence suggests that desirable and undesirable effects are closely balanced, with patient implications that some individuals would want the suggested course while others may not and clinician implications that a shared decision-making model considering patient values and preferences is appropriate.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^0e968984]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis in adults — key concept statements indicate that there are no validated therapeutic biomarkers or companion diagnostic tests to enhance selection or predict response to treatment for the patient with active ulcerative colitis (UC); patients with UC should have available all medical options as recommended by their doctor and healthcare team, and third-party payers and requirements for step therapy should not come between the patient and their healthcare team in making decisions about treatment for UC; patients with moderately to severely active UC have higher rates of response and remission with their first therapies than after failure of one or more other advanced therapies; given the expanding number of therapies per mechanistic class, a distinction between primary nonresponse and secondary nonresponse is important to select the next therapeutic option; post hoc subgroup analyses and network meta-analyses provide hypothesis-generating data but are not sufficient to stratify therapies for individual patients; infliximab is the preferred anti-TNF therapy for patients with moderately to severely active UC; some patients with moderately to severely active UC who are at higher risk for infectious complications may benefit from vedolizumab or an anti-IL-23 strategy over more systemically immunosuppressed medical options; and initial and subsequent therapies for moderately to severely active UC may be chosen based on extraintestinal manifestations, including the involvement of joints or skin, in which therapies having efficacy for both UC and the extraintestinal organ is known.

### Ulcerative colitis care pathway [^4acf1681]. Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis care pathway — risk stratification and remission targets emphasize that the standard assessment of ulcerative colitis (UC) activity at a single time point is insufficient and that disease risk is important; patients with mild or moderate symptoms but deep ulcers on colonoscopy should receive immunomodulatory and/or biologic therapy, treatment success is defined as steroid-free clinical remission, and clinical remission remains the primary therapeutic goal.

---

### A review of the therapeutic management of ulcerative colitis [^cfc7e673]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The history of UC is flagged by several clinical trials that underpin and influence our current clinical practice (Figure 1). The biological era is considered the fulcrum that is propelling current and anticipated developments in the field. Given the associated drawbacks with immunosuppressive therapies, additional treatment options are being explored and progressing to clinical trials. With this in mind, we anticipate the therapeutic landscape and current treatment paradigms to undergo marked transformation over the proceeding decade.

### Medical management of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease-strategies for inducing and maintaining remission [^02b25dd9]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Medical management of ulcerative colitis (UC) and crohn's sisease (CD) is complex. While there is significant overlap in medical therapies used for UC and CD, there remain few distinct differences in their management. The overall goals of therapy are to achieve disease remission, prevent complications, decrease the need for surgical interventions, and restore patients' quality of life. In the current article, we discuss currently available therapies and their mechanisms, limitations and side effects, followed by a comprehensive discussion of key consideration points in regards to the medical management.

### French national consensus clinical guidelines for the management of ulcerative colitis [^224f7c35]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of multifactorial etiology that primarily affects the colonic mucosa. The disease progresses over time, and clinical management guidelines should reflect its dynamic nature. There is limited evidence supporting UC management in specific clinical situations, thus precluding an evidence-based approach.

Aim

To use a formal consensus method - the nominal group technique (NGT) - to develop a clinical practice expert opinion to outline simple algorithms and practices, optimize UC management, and assist clinicians in making treatment decisions.

Methods

The consensus was developed by an expert panel of 37 gastroenterologists from various professional organizations with experience in UC management using the qualitative and iterative NGT, incorporating deliberations based on the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation recommendations, recent reviews of scientific literature, and pertinent discussion topics developed by a steering committee. Examples of clinical cases for which there are limited evidence-based data from clinical trials were used. Two working groups proposed and voted on treatment algorithms that were then discussed and voted for by the nominal group as a whole, in order to reach a consensus.

Results

A clinical practice guideline covering management of the following clinical situations was developed: (i) moderate and severe UC; (ii) acute severe UC; (iii) pouchitis; (iv) refractory proctitis, in the form of treatment algorithms.

Conclusions

Given the limited available evidence-based data, a formal consensus methodology was used to develop simple treatment guidelines for UC management in different clinical situations that is now accessible via an online application.

### Management of ulcerative colitis [^21efda16]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) in children is increasing. The range of treatments available has also increased too but around 1 in 4 children still require surgery to control their disease. An up-to-date understanding of treatments is essential for all clinicians involved in the care of UC patients to ensure appropriate and timely treatment while minimising the risk of complications and side effects.

### Therapy of ulcerative colitis: state of the art [^d3a6c1e0]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Advances in conventional therapy, novel targets and therapeutic goals are the highlights of treatment for ulcerative colitis in the last year. There have also been disappointments. This review summarizes the highs and lows, with an emphasis on strategy as opposed to seeking the newest treatment option.

Recent Findings

In conventional therapy, once daily therapy for 5-aminosalicylic acid is generally sufficient. Furthermore, a new 5-aminosalicylic acid (mesalamine MMX) has been released that effectively induces and maintains remission. There have been reappraisals of immunomodulators and further evaluation of (yes, now conventional!) infliximab for ulcerative colitis. Opportunistic infections, long-term outcomes and the burden of disease are being characterized. New therapeutic targets included an antibody against T cells (anti-CD3), but trials on visilizumab for acute severe colitis have been suspended. T-cell costimulation, phosphatidylcholine to promote barrier function, new anti-tumour necrosis factor agents, B-cell (anti-CD20) depletion and complementary therapies represent new therapeutic horizons. International agreement is needed on activity indices, definitions of remission, therapeutic goals (including mucosal healing) and outcomes that matter to patients, so that trials can be compared.

Summary

Advances will take time to alter mainstream practice, but 2007–2008 is the year of organized strategies, with European, American and British guidelines on ulcerative colitis published or in press. These should be the platform for better outcomes for patients.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the medical management of nonhospitalized ulcerative colitis: the toronto consensus [^3bfdd616]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The medical management of ulcerative colitis (UC) has improved through the development of new therapies and novel approaches that optimize existing drugs. Previous Canadian consensus guidelines addressed the management of severe UC in the hospitalized patient. We now present consensus guidelines for the treatment of ambulatory patients with mild to severe active UC.

Methods

A systematic literature search identified studies on the management of UC. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Statements were developed through an iterative online platform and then finalized and voted on by a working group of specialists.

Results

The participants concluded that the goal of therapy is complete remission, defined as both symptomatic and endoscopic remission without corticosteroid therapy. The consensus includes 34 statements focused on 5 main drug classes: 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA), corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapies, and other therapies. Oral and rectal 5-ASA are recommended first-line therapy for mild to moderate UC, with corticosteroid therapy for those who fail to achieve remission. Patients with moderate to severe UC should undergo a course of oral corticosteroid therapy, with transition to 5-ASA, thiopurine, anti-TNF (with or without thiopurine or methotrexate), or vedolizumab maintenance therapy in those who successfully achieve symptomatic remission. For patients with corticosteroid-resistant/dependent UC, anti-TNF or vedolizumab therapy is recommended. Timely assessments of response and remission are critical to ensuring optimal outcomes.

Conclusions

Optimal management of UC requires careful patient assessment, evidence-based use of existing therapies, and thorough assessment to define treatment success.

### New targets in inflammatory bowel disease therapy: 2021 [^eedb5879]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In the rapidly progressing world of inflammatory bowel disease, this review discusses and summarizes new drug targets and results from major clinical trials in order to provide an update to physicians treating patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).

Recent Findings

Multiple new mechanisms in the treatment of IBD are being developed and many are showing promising results in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients. In addition to efficacy, some of these treatments may provide safety benefits over existing therapies.

Summary

The IBD physicians' therapeutic armamentarium is rapidly expanding and keeping abreast of these developments is required in order to provide patients with optimized individualized care.

### Management of ulcerative colitis [^aeadeeed]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Medical management of UC

The treatment recommendations are based on the guidelines produced by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the joint guidelines produced by the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN). These guidelines provide very useful and comprehensive algorithms, which cover most common clinical eventualities.

Most patients with UC can be treated on an outpatient basis, but with hospitalisation necessary for ASC. The main aim of treatment of UC in children is to achieve maximum possible symptomatic control with minimal side effects, while allowing children to function as normally as possible. The target for treatment increasingly is also looking at intestinal healing beyond simple symptomatic control to try and reduce the risk of long-term complications and surgery. Treatments can be broadly considered as those used to induce remission (at diagnosis or for a subsequent flare), such as 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) agents, corticosteroids and biologics, and those used for long-term maintenance of remission such as 5-ASA agents, biologics and thiopurines.

### Comparison of the EMA and FDA guidelines on ulcerative colitis drug development [^d996e714]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

In 2016, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released revised EMA and new FDA draft guidelines related to the development of drugs intended for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. We sought to compare and contrast the EMA draft guideline with the FDA draft guidance to facilitate further discussion and perhaps harmonization between the 2 guidelines when they are finalized.

Methods

A concordance document was created by arranging like or similar topics addressed by the guidelines side by side in a tabular format. This concordance table served as a source for writing the narrative. The first draft was subjected to repeated rounds of reviews and revisions by the authors and outside reviewers, all of them familiar with the subject matter from a regulatory science and/or academic perspective.

Results

The FDA guidance focuses on end points, whereas the EMA guideline additionally supplies much useful information for trial design. FDA guidance appears more aspirational, suggesting the development of entirely new patient-reported outcome instruments and the incorporation of a not-yet-validated histology instrument into the definition of mucosal healing.

Conclusions

The guidelines by the FDA and the EMA complement each other and together are aimed to further practical drug development toward more clinically relevant end points in ulcerative colitis. Efforts are needed to harmonize the documents.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^a63017d6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for ulcerative colitis, more specifically with respect to treatment targets, ACG 2025 guidelines recommend to treat patients with UC to achieve endoscopic improvement, defined as the resolution of inflammatory changes with a Mayo endoscopic score of 0 or 1, to increase the likelihood of sustained steroid-free remission and to prevent hospitalizations and surgery.

---

### Treatment of ulcerative colitis with steroids (in whom, how long, what dose, what form) [^01389db1]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids are a nonspecific immune modulator used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Topical and systemic forms of corticosteroids have been shown to be effective in induction of clinical remission and remain first-line therapy for acute severe ulcerative colitis. A large proportion of patients experience adverse effects, however, including some serious adverse effects, including infection and increased mortality. Newer formulations of gut selective corticosteroids have reduced adverse effects associated with steroids.

---

### Differential efficacy of medical therapies for ulcerative colitis according to disease extent: patient-level analysis from multiple randomized controlled trials [^6963c347]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In clinical trials for moderate to severe UC, patients with isolated proctitis have historically been excluded. Among the recruited patients, typically two-thirds have left-sided disease and one-third extensive disease at baseline; however, disease location is not used as a stratification factor. Given that patients with extensive versus left-sided colitis have different prognosis and inflammatory burden, it is plausible that response to treatment could vary. Thus, we undertook an individual patient level data meta-analysis from multiple clinical trials of advanced therapies in UC to investigate whether clinical outcomes were influenced by disease distribution. By identifying the impact of disease distribution on treatment efficacy, the results may help to inform treatment recommendations as well as the design of future clinical trials.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^4302f34a]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

8 Concluding remarks

These British Society of Gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults have been developed along with all major UK stakeholders in UC and Crohn's disease healthcare, including patient representation through close collaboration with Crohn's and Colitis UK.

They are published at a time of rapid change in many aspects of IBD. Recent developments highlighted include new imaging techniques; increasing numbers of new drugs; changes in the way these drugs are used with accelerated treatment and reduction in prolonged use of older therapies with greater toxicity; the increasing importance of infection screening at diagnosis; changes in therapeutic goals (such as mucosal healing) and advances in therapeutic monitoring. This makes IBD treatment ever more complex and highlights the importance of multidisciplinary working, and finding more effective ways to deliver services. We have also emphasised the vital importance of patient education, empowerment and partnership in order to ensure that the patient's needs (and not the technology) remain the focus of all those treating IBD patients.

We have drawn together concise guidance and evidence supporting a wide range of statements that inform best practice in the care of patients with UC and Crohn's disease, including the quality of the evidence available and the strength of recommendations, with a Delphi consensus process to show level of agreement. Many areas are clearly in a state of rapid evolution, and there remain obvious gaps in our understanding. In reference to this, we have presented the key unmet research themes arising from our systematic review and have also presented the importance of each from a patient's perspective. We hope this exercise will highlight aspects of care that are of importance to IBD patients and the healthcare community, and thus may inform government, Research Councils, medical research funding bodies and industry as to areas of research priority in order to advance care for UC and Crohn's disease patients in 2019 and beyond.

### World gastroenterology organization practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of IBD in 2010 [^9e569e81]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a group of idiopathic, chronic, inflammatory intestinal conditions. Its two main disease categories are: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), which feature both overlapping and distinct clinical and pathological features. While these diseases have, in the past, been most evident in the developed world, their prevalence in the developing world has been gradually increasing in recent decades. This poses unique issues in diagnosis and management which have been scarcely addressed in the literature or in extant guidelines. Depending on the nature of the complaints, investigations to diagnose either form of IBD or to assess disease activity will vary and will also be influenced by geographic variations in other conditions that might mimic IBD. Similarly, therapy varies depending on the phenotype of the disease being treated and available resources. The World Gastroenterology Organization has, accordingly, developed guidelines for diagnosing and treating IBD using a cascade approach to account for variability in resources in countries around the world.

### Ustekinumab for treating ulcerative colitis: an expert opinion [^e23528fc]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Biologic agents have revolutionized the therapeutic management of ulcerative colitis. Anti-tumor necrosis factor agents were the first biologic drugs used to induce and maintain remission in this inflammatory bowel disease. Recently, another biologic option, ustekinumab, has become available for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.

Areas Covered

In this article, the authors review the literature on the efficacy and safety of ustekinumab in the context of current biologic agents used for the management of this disease. The potential role of ustekinumab in the treatment paradigm of the disease is also discussed. Expert opinion: The UNIFI trial has demonstrated the efficacy and safety of ustekinumab in induction and maintenance phases of treatment for ulcerative colitis. Ustekinumab may provide clinical benefit in a range of settings in patients with ulcerative colitis, even for those with multiple treatment failures, which are relatively common in daily clinical practice. Future clinical trials should compare the efficacy of ustekinumab with existing biologic agents in the management of ulcerative colitis.

AGA guideline — treatment sequencing in adult outpatients with moderate-severe ulcerative colitis states that the AGA suggests early use of advanced therapies with or without immunomodulator therapy, rather than gradual step up after failure of 5-ASAs [Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence]. Comment: Patients, particularly those with less severe disease, who place higher value on the safety of 5-ASA therapy, and lower value on the efficacy of immunosuppressive therapies, may reasonably choose gradual step up therapy with 5-ASA therapy.

### Preventive care considerations… [^ecd1e899]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment INDUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF REMISSION The goal of managing patients with ulcerative colitis is to attain mucosal healing with symptom control so that sustained steroid-free remission can be achieved and prevent hospitalizations and surgeries. Initiation of treatment begins with stratifying disease activity into mild vs. moderate to severe. The American College of Gastroenterology Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index provides a set of criteria to help determine if the disease is in remission, mild, moderate to severe, or fulminant. TREATMENT OF MILD DISEASE The 2019 guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology recommend treatment of mild ulcerative proctitis with rectal 5-amino-salicylic acid therapies. 1 Mild to moderate colitis should be treated with a combination of rectal 5-ASA enemas and oral 5-ASA therapies. Rectal 5-ASA enemas are preferred to rectal steroid formulations. Mesalamine is more potent than sulfasalazine for inducing remission.

TREATMENT OF MODERATE TO SEVERE DISEASE First-line therapy for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis is biologics. 14 Biologic agents with or without glucocorticoids and immune modulators should be used to induce and maintain remission. Thiopurines or methotrexate should not be used as monotherapy. 1 Systemic corticosteroids are effective in inducing remission, but dosages and treatment duration should be limited. Other options for inducing remission include tumor necrosis factor–alpha antibodies, anti-integrin antibodies, anti-interleukin antibodies, and Janus kinase inhibitors 1. Fecal microbiota transplantation induces remission in some patients with ulcerative colitis, but current use is limited to clinical trials. 15–17. COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE One probiotic modestly improves symptoms.

It also helps to prevent pouchitis, an abnormal immune response in patients susceptible to autoimmune disease that leads to inflammation of the rectal pouch fashioned after a colectomy. 19–21 A systematic review of six small studies found that curcumin promotes clinical and endoscopic improvement when added to conventional therapy in patients with mild ulcerative colitis. 22 Acupuncture is considered safe in addition to conventional treatment, but high-quality evidence of effectiveness is lacking. 25.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^8aed0061]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is an idiopathic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology that seems to be rising in incidence and prevalence throughout the world. These guidelines were developed to indicate the preferred approach to the management of adult patients with ulcerative colitis as established by valid scientific research and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology under the auspices of the Practice Parameters Committee. The scientific evidence for the recommendations made in these guidelines was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process, assessing the quality of the evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low) and assigning a strength of recommendation based on its apparent clinical benefit (strong or conditional). In instances where the available evidence was not appropriate for a formal Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation recommendation, but there was consensus of significant clinical merit, statements were developed using expert consensus (termed key concept statements). These guidelines are meant to be broadly applicable to practitioners regardless of specialty or interest and should be viewed as the preferred, but not only, approach to clinical scenarios. As opposed to standards of care, guidelines are inherently flexible, and physicians should use them as tools in choosing the best course in a specific clinical situation. These guidelines represent the state of the evidence at the time of this publication. As new evidence emerges, these guidelines will be continuously reviewed, and updates will be published as needed to assure continued validity.

### Ulcerative colitis [^a981818a]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the colon, and its incidence is rising worldwide. The pathogenesis is multifactorial, involving genetic predisposition, epithelial barrier defects, dysregulated immune responses, and environmental factors. Patients with ulcerative colitis have mucosal inflammation starting in the rectum that can extend continuously to proximal segments of the colon. Ulcerative colitis usually presents with bloody diarrhoea and is diagnosed by colonoscopy and histological findings. The aim of management is to induce and then maintain remission, defined as resolution of symptoms and endoscopic healing. Treatments for ulcerative colitis include 5-aminosalicylic acid drugs, steroids, and immunosuppressants. Some patients can require colectomy for medically refractory disease or to treat colonic neoplasia. The therapeutic armamentarium for ulcerative colitis is expanding, and the number of drugs with new targets will rapidly increase in coming years.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^043fdbd9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis in adults — future directions highlight unmet needs, stating that this guideline did not address the arenas of endoscopic surveillance or management of UC during pregnancy and that these topics will be addressed in future guidelines and a pregnancy consensus statement by the ACG. There is great interest in the application of IUS to the assessment of UC, and further research is needed to define the timing of this tool and the role for transmural assessment in prognosticating treatment response and outcomes. The authors note a great need for head-to-head RCTs to clarify sequencing and positioning of therapies and to understand the role and optimal timing for elective proctocolectomy, emphasizing that such direct evidence is needed to inform comparative effectiveness. Additional priorities include prediction biomarkers for personalized therapy selection, breaking through the existing therapeutic ceiling in UC via novel mechanisms of action and combinations of therapies to improve efficacy without sacrificing safety while addressing costs and access issues, and determining whether earlier advanced treatment in UC improves long-term outcomes. For future IBD guideline updates, the ACG has initiated a rapid update protocol, with updated guidance released annually to provide timely and practical guidance on the ever-changing field.

### Placebo response and remission rates in randomised trials of induction and maintenance therapy for ulcerative colitis [^4ef47f67]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

It is important to minimize placebo rates in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to efficiently detect treatment differences between interventions. Historically, high placebo rates have been observed in clinical trials of ulcerative colitis (UC). A better understanding of factors influencing placebo rates may lead to more informed clinical trial design.

Objectives

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate placebo response and remission rates in RCTs evaluating UC treatments in adult patients.

Search Methods

Electronic databases (i.e. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL) were searched from inception to 1 March 2017 with no language restrictions applied. Reference lists and conference proceedings of major gastroenterology meetings were also handsearched to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Placebo-controlled RCTs of adult patients with UC treated with corticosteroids, aminosalicylates, immunosuppressives or biologics were eligible, provided enrolment and outcome assessment was conducted using the Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UCDAI) or the Mayo Clinic Score. The minimum trial duration was two weeks for induction trials and four months maintenance trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of authors independently determined study eligibility and extracted data with any disagreements resolved through consensus. Outcomes of interest included the proportion of patients with clinical response and remission. Trial characteristics such as the design, participant demographics and disease history, interventions, and enrolment and assessment criteria were also recorded. The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Pooled placebo response and remission rates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using a binomial normal model for proportions. Induction of remission and maintenance studies were pooled separately. The impact of study-level characteristics on placebo response and remission rates was investigated using mixed-effects meta-regression analyses with logits of event rates as the outcome variables. An assessment of pooled placebo rates over time was conducted using a cumulative meta-analysis based on date of publication. Publication bias was examined using funnel plots.

Main Results

The screening process identified 61 included studies which encompass 58 induction phases (5111 patients randomised to placebo) and 12 maintenance phases (1579 patients randomised to placebo). For induction trials, the pooled estimate of placebo response was 33% (95% CI 30% to 36%) while the pooled estimate of placebo remission was 12% (95% CI 9% to 15%). For maintenance trials, the pooled estimate of placebo response was 23% (95% CI 19% to 28%) while the pooled estimate of placebo remission was 17% (95% CI 10% to 27%). Studies enrolling patients with more active disease confirmed objectively by endoscopy were associated with significantly lower placebo remission and response rates than trials enrolling patients with less active disease (27% versus 4%, OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.25 to 5.42, P = 0.01 for UCDAI endoscopy sub score ≥ 1 versus ≥ 2 for remission; and 27% versus 4%, OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.82, P = 0.02 for UCDAI endoscopy sub score greater than or equal to one versus greater than or equal to two for response). With respect to drug class, the lowest placebo response and remission rates were observed in trials evaluating corticosteroids (23%; 95% CI 19 to 29%, and 5%; 95% CI 2 to 11%, respectively). Trials of biologics had the highest placebo response rate (35%; 95% CI 30 to 41%), while trials evaluating aminosalicylates had the highest placebo remission rate (18%; 95% CI 12 to 24%). Disease duration of greater than five years prior to enrolment was associated with a significantly lower placebo response rate compared to disease duration of less than or equal to five years (29% versus 47%, respectively; OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.92, P = 0.02). The requirement of a minimum rectal bleeding score for study eligibility was associated with an increased placebo response rate compared to studies that did not use rectal bleeding for trial eligibility (37% versus 32%, respectively; OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.82, P = 0.02). Finally, the time point of primary outcome assessment was found to be significantly associated with placebo remission rates such that every one week increment in endpoint assessment was associated with a 6% increase in the placebo remission rate (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.10, P = 0.01). Cumulative meta-analysis indicated a consistent increase in the placebo response rate from 1987 to 2007 (from 13% to 33%), although rates have remained constant from 2008 to 2015 (32% to 34%). Similarly, placebo remission rates increased from 1987 to 2007 (5% to 14%) but have remained constant from 2008 to 2015 (12 to 14%). On meta-regression, there were no statistically significant differences between the 1987–2007 and 2008–2015 point estimates for both response (P = 0.81) and remission (P = 0.32).

Authors' Conclusions

Placebo response and remission rates vary according to endoscopic disease severity and rectal bleeding score at trial entry, class of agent, disease duration, and the time point at which the primary outcome was measured. These observations have important implications for the design and conduct of future clinical trials in UC and will help researchers design trials, determine required sample sizes and also provide useful information about trial design features which should be considered when planning new trials.

### Determining the optimal treatment target in patients with ulcerative colitis: rationale, design, protocol and interim analysis for the randomised controlled VERDICT trial [^879e637f]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

The VERDICT trial is underway to determine the optimal treatment target in UC. As of 1 March 2023, 432 patients have been randomised, representing approximately 65% of the target enrolment of 660 patients. The recruitment rate has been on target, and the protocol has otherwise been followed to date. Consistent with findings from a previous interim analysis, interim results reported here further confirm the continued enrolment of a typical moderate to severe UC population and the feasibility of achieving the treatment targets in each of the three groups. Full study completion and results are expected in 2025. Final results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific meetings. Results of this study will help to inform treatment targets in clinical practice, drug development and future evidence-based guidelines.

Dissemination

Investigators will be responsible for obtaining documented informed consent from all patients prior to study participation. This study is registered in the EudraCT registry (identifier: 2019-002485-12) and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry (identifier: NCT04259138). Results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and at scientific congresses.

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis [^16f7c233]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

AGA living clinical practice guideline — PICO questions for adult outpatients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis outline comparisons of pharmacologic strategies and key outcomes. Immunomodulator monotherapy options listed are thiopurines (azathioprine, mercaptopurine) and methotrexate (oral or SC). For tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists, combination therapy with a TNF antagonist and an immunomodulator (thiopurines or methotrexate) is assessed with outcomes including induction of clinical remission and maintenance of clinical remission. For non-TNF biologics, combination therapy with a non-TNF antagonist biologic and an immunomodulator (thiopurines or methotrexate) is compared with non-TNF antagonist biologic monotherapy and immunomodulator monotherapy (thiopurines or methotrexate), with outcomes of induction of clinical remission and maintenance of clinical remission. Among patients in steroid-free remission on combination therapy, discontinuation of an immunomodulator or discontinuation of a biologic is contrasted with continuation of combination therapy, focusing on prevention of relapse. Treatment strategies are also contrasted as top-down therapy (upfront use of advanced therapies and/or immunomodulator therapy; upfront use of biologic-based combination therapy) versus step therapy (acceleration to advanced therapy only after failure of 5-ASA; initial use of immunomodulator or advanced therapy).

### Defining failure of medical therapy for inflammatory bowel disease [^d998ae9d]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Over the past 2 decades, advances in biologic and small molecule therapeutics have resulted in a rapid increase in our armamentarium of therapies for inflammatory bowel disease. Despite these advancements, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis remain chronic and progressive diseases. One of the primary reasons for persistent inflammation and bowel damage is failure of medical therapy. With growing therapeutic options, there is an increased temptation to quickly move to the next therapy and label the prior therapy as a failure; however, this can lead to inadequate optimization of medications and poor control of disease. On the other hand, failure to recognize ongoing mucosal inflammation despite optimized treatment and moving to the next agent can lead to progression of disease and long-term complications. As our options for medical therapy continue to increase, it has become more important to recognize failure of therapy in order to promptly move to the next therapeutic agent without abandoning therapies prematurely. In this review, we aim to define failure of medical therapy for inflammatory bowel disease with the goal of offering guidance on when it is appropriate to attempt optimization of current medical treatment as opposed to moving on to the next agent or treatment approach.

### Ulcerative colitis [^7d920111]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is an idiopathic, chronic inflammatory disorder of the colonic mucosa, which starts in the rectum and generally extends proximally in a continuous manner through part of, or the entire, colon; however, some patients with proctitis or left-sided colitis might have a caecal patch of inflammation. Bloody diarrhoea is the characteristic symptom of the disease. The clinical course is unpredictable, marked by alternating periods of exacerbation and remission. In this Seminar we discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic approach, natural history, medical and surgical management, and main disease-related complications of ulcerative colitis, and briefly outline novel treatment options. Enhanced understanding of how the interaction between environmental factors, genetics, and the immune system results in mucosal inflammation has increased knowledge of disease pathophysiology. We provide practical therapeutic algorithms that are easily applicable in daily clinical practice, emphasising present controversies in treatment management and novel therapies.

### Ischaemic colitis: practical challenges and evidence-based recommendations for management [^d9a9a6d6]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Ischaemic colitis (IC) is a common condition with rising incidence, and in severe cases a high mortality rate. Its presentation, severity and disease behaviour can vary widely, and there exists significant heterogeneity in treatment strategies and resultant outcomes. In this article we explore practical challenges in the management of IC, and where available make evidence-based recommendations for its management based on a comprehensive review of available literature. An optimal approach to initial management requires early recognition of the diagnosis followed by prompt and appropriate investigation. Ideally, this should involve the input of both gastroenterology and surgery. CT with intravenous contrast is the imaging modality of choice. It can support clinical diagnosis, define the severity and distribution of ischaemia, and has prognostic value. In all but fulminant cases, this should be followed (within 48hours) by lower gastrointestinal endoscopy to reach the distal-most extent of the disease, providing endoscopic (and histological) confirmation. The mainstay of medical management is conservative/supportive treatment, with bowel rest, fluid resuscitation and antibiotics. Specific laboratory, radiological and endoscopic features are recognised to correlate with more severe disease, higher rates of surgical intervention and ultimately worse outcomes. These factors should be carefully considered when deciding on the need for and timing of surgical intervention.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^60e530ff]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis in adults — conclusions outline disease characterization and management, noting that UC is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory condition of the recto-colon and colon with variable activity and severity and significant morbidity. Appropriate management involves successful induction of both clinical and endoscopic remission followed by use of a corticosteroid-free maintenance strategy and ongoing monitoring for disease and drug-related complications. Choice of therapy is based on activity, severity, extent of inflammation and prognostic factors, and may include oral, topical (rectal), or systemic therapies, as well as surgery. Patients with moderate-to-severe disease should be treated early in their disease course with therapies that have been shown to be effective and should not linger with suboptimal therapy or recurrent courses of corticosteroids. In general, the induction therapy selected drives the choice of maintenance therapy. Positioning considerations include a single head-to-head trial in moderately to severely active UC, separation of induction and maintenance strategies for some patients with ASUC, and considerations of comorbid or concomitantly existing extraintestinal manifestations. We advocate for preservation of the clinician-patient shared decision-making approach to therapy selection and exclusion of limitations imposed by third-party payers.

The goals for treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are changing from elimination of symptoms toward complete disease control-a process that demands both clinical and endoscopic remission. This new IBD treatment paradigm has been shifting from a conventional "step-up" approach toward a more "top-down" early intervention treatment strategy. Recent studies suggest that the use of biologic agents, specifically those targeting tumor necrosis factor alpha, earlier in the treatment course improves patient outcomes and can prevent progression to irreversible bowel damage. Although the strategy of early intervention has accumulating evidence in Crohn's disease, there is less evidence supporting its impact in ulcerative colitis.

### Efficacious dosing regimens for anti-TNF therapies in inflammatory bowel disease: where do we stand? [^05fa972c]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

During the last decades, biologics have revolutionized the treatment of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Even though the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) armamentarium is rapidly expanding with novel biologics, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antibodies remain the first-line biologic therapy in most areas of the world. However, anti-TNF therapy is not effective in all patients (primary non-response) and patients can lose effect over time (secondary loss of response).

Areas Covered

This review provides an overview of the current induction and maintenance dosing regimens of the available anti-TNF antibodies and associated challenges in adult patients with IBD. We outline different strategies to overcome these difficulties, including combination therapy, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), and dose escalation. Finally, we discuss expected future progress in anti-TNF management.

Expert Opinion

Anti-TNF agents will remain a cornerstone of IBD treatment in the coming decade. Progress will be made in biomarkers for the prediction of response and individualized dosing regimens. The advent of subcutaneous infliximab challenges the need for concomitant immunosuppression.

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis [^7c3bac2a]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) — upfront advanced therapy versus step-up: In adult outpatients with moderate-to-severe UC, the AGA suggests early use of advanced therapies with or without immunomodulator therapy, rather than gradual step up after failure of 5-ASAs [Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence]. Patients, particularly those with less severe disease, who place higher value on the safety of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) therapy and lower value on the efficacy and risks of adverse effects of advanced therapies and immunomodulators, may reasonably decline early use of these therapies. Since the last guideline published in 2020, no new randomized controlled trials comparing upfront advanced therapies and/or immunomodulator therapy versus step-up therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe UC were identified, and 5-ASAs are not indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe UC.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^d24d782b]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Symptomatically active ulcerative colitis — evaluation strategy for treatment adjustment: In patients with symptomatically active UC, the AGA suggests an evaluation strategy that combines biomarkers and symptoms, rather than symptoms alone, to inform treatment adjustments. (Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence) Patients, particularly those with severe symptoms, who place a high value on avoiding the burden of biomarker testing, over a potentially higher risk of inappropriate overtreatment, may reasonably choose symptom-based evaluation for treatment decisions. Evidence informing this recommendation did not identify any RCTs directly comparing the two strategies; instead, cross-sectional data show that 85%–90% of patients with RBS 2 or 3 and SFS 2 or 3 had moderate to severe inflammation on endoscopy, implying an FP rate of 10%–15%, while in similar patients the absence of elevated biomarkers decreases the FP rate to < 5%. Potential benefits of symptom-based management include convenience and faster decisions, whereas potential harms of a biomarker-based approach include costs, inconvenience of stool-based testing, and possible delays due to test completion.

3.5 Initial treatment of active UC with 5-ASA

Statement 3. We recommend that mild to moderate ulcerative colitis should be managed with oral 5-ASA 2–3 g/day (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). We recommend the addition of 5-ASA enemas, rather than oral treatment alone (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. Agreement: 95.6%).

Statement 4. We suggest that ulcerative colitis patients flaring on 5-ASA therapy should receive dose escalation to 4–4.8 g/day orally alongside 5-ASA enemas (GRADE: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 82.2%).

Oral 5-ASA (5-aminosalicylic acid) is the standard therapy for mild to moderately active UC. Meta-analyses support the efficacy of oral 5-ASA for induction therapy for mild to moderately active UC. Once daily dosing is as effective as divided doses. Doses ≥ 2 g/day are more effective than dosages < 2 g/day for remission (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.85 to 0.98). The majority of patients with mild to moderate UC will respond to 2–3 g 5-ASA (depending on formulation used) and higher doses can be used in those with more severe symptoms or those not responding initially.

### Ulcerative colitis [^be2e07da]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of unknown aetiology affecting the colon and rectum. Multiple factors, such as genetic background, environmental and luminal factors, and mucosal immune dysregulation, have been suggested to contribute to UC pathogenesis. UC has evolved into a global burden given its high incidence in developed countries and the substantial increase in incidence in developing countries. An improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying UC has led to the emergence of new treatments. Since the early 2000s, anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) treatment has significantly improved treatment outcomes. Advances in medical treatments have enabled a paradigm shift in treatment goals from symptomatic relief to endoscopic and histological healing to achieve better long-term outcomes and, consequently, diagnostic modalities have also been improved to monitor disease activity more tightly. Despite these improvements in patient care, a substantial proportion of patients, for example, those who are refractory to medical treatment or those who develop colitis-associated colorectal dysplasia or cancer, still require restorative proctocolectomy. The development of novel drugs and improvement of the treatment strategy by implementing personalized medicine are warranted to achieve optimal disease control. However, delineating the aetiology of UC is necessary to ultimately achieve disease cure.

### Best practice in the management of mild-to-moderately active ulcerative colitis and achieving maintenance of remission using mesalazine [^12098c01]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Optimizing treatment goals in ulcerative colitis requires recognizing the needs of patients. It is increasingly recognized that adapting treatment strategies aligned with patient needs can improve patient compliance and consequently minimize relapse rates. Tailoring of treatment strategies can improve not only patient quality of life, and decrease the number harmed by adverse events from more potent drugs, but can also save valuable healthcare costs by avoiding high-cost treatment interventions associated with acute ulcerative colitis. This review will consider several elements of mesalazine management from the patient perspective based on a range of clinical and patient-focused evidence. By highlighting patient preferences in disease management it is envisaged that this review will aid physicians to optimize treatment decisions with the different mesalazine preparations available.

### Are there any differences in the efficacy and safety of different formulations of oral 5-ASA used for induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis? evidence from cochrane reviews [^2a86a2cb]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

We systematically reviewed and compared the efficacy and safety of oral mesalamine formulations (sustained release, delayed release, and prodrugs) used for induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis. The main objective of this review was to determine if there are any differences in efficacy or safety among the oral 5-ASA drugs.

Methods

A literature search in February 2013 identified all applicable randomized trials. Study quality was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria were used to assess the overall quality of the evidence. Studies were subgrouped by common mesalamine comparators for meta-analysis. Studies were pooled for analysis if they compared equimolar doses of oral 5-ASA.

Results

Seventeen studies that evaluated 2925 patients were identified. The risk of bias was low for most factors, although 1 study was single blind and 3 were open label. No difference was observed between oral 5-ASA and comparator 5-ASA formulations in the proportion of patients with clinical remission (relative risk, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.86–1.02), clinical improvement (relative risk, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.77–1.01), or relapse at 12 months (relative risk, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.80–1.28). Subgroup analyses showed no important differences in efficacy. No significant difference was demonstrated in rates of adverse events or withdrawal due to adverse events.

Conclusions

There does not seem to be any difference in efficacy or safety among the various formulations of oral 5-ASA. Oral mesalamine is an effective and safe treatment of mild-to-moderate or quiescent ulcerative colitis regardless of the chosen formulation.

### Diet as a treatment for inflammatory bowel disease: is it ready for prime time? [^bbf7c42d]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diet remains an important topic for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), yet few guidelines for dietary recommendations exist. There is a growing interest in the use of diet as treatment or adjuvant therapy for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Here, we highlight the latest evidence on the use of diet for treatment of symptoms, active disease and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

Recent Findings

The Crohn's Disease Exclusion Diet (CDED) and the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) are studied diets that have gained popularity, but there is growing interest in the use and efficacy of less restrictive diets such as the Mediterranean diet. Recent data suggest healthful dietary patterns alone, with an emphasis on whole foods that are high in vegetable fibre and that promote less consumption of ultra-processed foods may also help achieve remission in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

Summary

In this review, we summarize the literature on diet as treatment for IBD. We highlight the latest clinical dietary studies, randomized clinical trials, as well as new and emerging diets for the treatment of IBD.

### Management of proctitis in ulcerative colitis and the place of biological therapies [^aff64be7]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 20–30% of the patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) may present with isolated proctitis. Ulcerative proctitis (UP) is a challenging condition to manage due to its significant burden in terms of disabling symptoms.

Areas Covered

PubMed was searched up to March 2024 to identify relevant studies on UP. A comprehensive summary and critical appraisal of the available data on UP are provided, highlighting emerging treatments and areas for future research.

Expert Opinion

Patients with UP are often undertreated, and the disease burden is often underestimated in clinical practice. Treat-to-target management algorithms can be applied to UP, aiming for clinical remission in the short term, and endoscopic remission and maintenance of remission in the long term. During their disease, approximately one-third of UP patients require advanced therapies. Escalation to biologic therapy is required for refractory or steroid dependent UP. For optimal patient care and management of UP, it is necessary to include these patients in future randomized clinical trials.

### Timing of proper introduction, optimization and maintenance of anti-TNF therapy in IBD: results from a Delphi consensus [^7cd55293]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) with a rapidly growing worldwide incidence. The last decades presented rapid progress in pharmacological treatment leading in many cases to clinical and endoscopic remission, including biological treatment with anti-TNF agents.

Aim

The exact timing of introduction, optimization and maintenance of anti-TNF therapy in IBDs is not thoroughly covered in current guidelines.

Methods

We used the Delphi panel methodology to gather the IBD experts' views and achieve consensus for clinical recommendations on introducing and maintaining anti-TNF therapy for patients with IBDs.

Results

Twelve recommendations achieved a high level of consensus in two assessment rounds by 52 (1st round) and 47 (2nd round) IBD experts.

Conclusion

In many clinical situations, the early use of anti-TNF therapy is recommended. Nowadays, the cost-efficacy profile of anti-TNF biosimilars makes them the first-line drug in a substantial proportion of patients, thus providing the opportunity to increase access to biological therapy.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the management of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis [^1e02ec60]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Guideline scope and effect metrics — management of mild–moderate ulcerative colitis centers on 5-ASA–based therapies with defined interpretation of relative risk. Therapeutic efficacy and safety are similar with different 5-ASA formulations, and comparability of the different commercial formulations of mesalamine at equivalent doses was assumed. The guideline addresses the medical management of patients with mild–moderate UC, focusing on oral and topical 5-ASA medications, rectal corticosteroids, and oral budesonide, and it does not present separate recommendations for induction and maintenance of remission. It notes that some patients will not respond adequately and may need to escalate therapy to systemic corticosteroids, immunomodulators, or biologic therapies, and that the use of biologic therapies and immunomodulators is not specifically addressed. Estimates of medication effects are presented as the risk for failure to induce or maintain remission, and a relative risk (RR) < 1 indicates the agent under evaluation is more effective than the comparison medication or placebo, whereas RR > 1 indicates it is less effective.

### French national consensus clinical guidelines for the management of Crohn's disease [^3e53149b]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic and disabling condition. There is no curative medical treatment but current treatments provide increasingly sustainable control of the disease and allow patients a better quality of life. There is limited evidence supporting CD management in specific clinical situations, thus precluding an evidence-based approach.

Aims

To help clinicians in making informed treatment decisions, a group of 59 French gastroenterologists with experience in the management of CD met to develop straightforward and practical algorithms based on the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) recommendations.

Methods

This experts' opinion was developed following a Nominal Group consensus methodology. Nine clinical situations were identified: mildly active CD; uncomplicated moderately active CD, with, and without poor prognostic factors; uncomplicated severely active CD; perianal CD with a single fistula; perianal CD with complex fistula with or without abscess; complicated CD with abscess; intestinal stricture; and post-operative CD. Two working groups were formed and proposed algorithms that were then approved by a two-thirds majority of the Nominal Group.

Results

These algorithms represent the pragmatic consensus of a group of experts in gastroenterology on the modalities of therapeutic care in different clinical situations in CD. They are available via a web application at: www.algorithmici.com.

### Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis [^43d21ff7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Maintenance of remission is essential in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in terms of disease course and long-term prognosis. The thiopurines azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine have longstanding merit in ulcerative colitis, but more therapeutic options have been developed. This review is an update and extension of a review last published in 2016.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine in monotherapy or combined therapy regimens compared to placebo or active controls for the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (until May 2023), ClinicalTrials.gov (until May 2023), Embase (until August 2022), MEDLINE (until May 2023), and WHO ICTRP (until May 2023). We checked reference lists of the included studies and, if needed, contacted the authors to request more data or information.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of at least 24 weeks' duration comparing azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with placebo or any other medication, or comparing different treatment modalities of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine, in persons of any age with quiescent ulcerative colitis were eligible. We only considered studies with mixed IBD populations or with a preceding induction period if separate results on participants with ulcerative colitis in remission were available or could be calculated. The primary outcome was failure to maintain clinical or endoscopic remission (relapse). Secondary outcomes included change in disease activity, quality of life, hospitalization, need for surgery, days off work, adverse events, and withdrawal due to adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data using standard forms, resolved any disagreements by consensus, and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 2). We conducted separate analyses by type of control, calculated pooled risk ratios (RRs) or risk differences (RDs) using the fixed-effect model unless heterogeneity was likely, and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 10 studies in the review, including 468 adult participants with ulcerative colitis. The risk of bias across these was low for most outcomes, but we considered some outcomes to have some concerns or high risk of bias due to insufficient information on concealment of allocation and outcome measurement. Based on five placebo-controlled studies, azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine may reduce the risk of failing to maintain remission. In the thiopurine group, 45% (64/143) of participants failed to maintain remission compared to 67% (96/143) of participants receiving placebo (RR 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.82; 5 studies, 286 participants; low-certainty evidence). Three studies reported withdrawals due to adverse events. Among participants on azathioprine, 4% (3/80) withdrew due to adverse events compared to 0% (0/82) of placebo participants (RD 0.04, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.09; 3 studies, 162 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is of low certainty when comparing 6-mercaptopurine to 5-aminosalicylate. Based on one three-armed trial, 27% (3/11) of 6-mercaptopurine participants failed to maintain remission compared to 100% (2/2) of 5-aminosalicylate participants (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.97; 1 study, 13 participants; low-certainty evidence). This trial also involved an induction phase; we only included the results for participants in remission. The single trial comparing 6-mercaptopurine to 5-aminosalicylate did not report separate data on adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events for the subgroup with successful induction of remission, so we could not analyze these outcomes for this comparison.

Authors' Conclusions

Low-certainty evidence suggests that azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine therapy may be more effective than placebo for the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis. More research is needed to evaluate the value of therapeutic drug monitoring and the effects of various treatment modalities on long-term safety.

### Stopping biologics in IBD-what is the evidence? [^4c50dfc2]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Biologic treatments have revolutionized the way we treat inflammatory bowel disease patients (IBD). Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) antibodies are superior to conventional therapies to achieve sustained remission without steroids and mucosal healing. The objective of IBD treatment has evolved from symptom alleviation to a combination of absence of symptoms and intestinal healing. Nevertheless, biologics are expensive and are associated with an increased risk of infections and possibly skin cancers. Therefore, the duration of these treatments may be questioned, and stopping them may be contemplated by some patients and clinicians, while it is sometimes even imposed by some jurisdictions across the world. In the present paper, I highlight the recent literature about outcomes after biologics withdrawal, patients' profiles associated with these outcomes, monitoring after withdrawal, and results of retreatment. We also introduce the concept of biologic treatment cycles in IBD.
