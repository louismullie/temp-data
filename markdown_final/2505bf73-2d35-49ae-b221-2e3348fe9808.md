## Question

Patient with esophageal cancer had aspiration pneumonia, is being treated with Zosyn and elects hospice. Should Zosyn be continued in hospice?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking if Zosyn (piperacillin-tazobactam) should be continued in hospice for aspiration pneumonia in a patient with advanced esophageal cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the goals of care in hospice and whether antimicrobials meaningfully change outcomes or comfort at end of life. Then, I should review the disease context of aspiration pneumonia in esophageal cancer and the likelihood of reversibility. Next, I will evaluate guideline recommendations for aspiration pneumonia and their applicability in hospice. After that, I should weigh benefits versus burdens of ongoing IV Zosyn in this setting. Finally, I will outline ethically aligned alternatives, consider rare exceptions for a time-limited trial, and make a clear recommendation with an action plan.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: by electing hospice, the patient has prioritized comfort and quality of life over disease-directed life prolongation, which reframes interventions to those that relieve distress with minimal burden; in advanced esophageal cancer, dysphagia and structural derangements place patients at high risk for recurrent aspiration that is typically not curable within hospice parameters, so I need to ensure any treatment aligns with comfort rather than cure or marginal survival, and to keep the focus on symptom relief and dignity in the limited-prognosis context, not on microbial eradication or aggressive monitoring [^1123ftQ1] [^112TXXUH] [^111zfLsR].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence on antimicrobials at end of life before assuming benefit; hospice cohorts suggest most patients either decline antibiotics or use them only symptomatically, with no survival advantage from antimicrobial choice, and symptom control — not cure — is the only legitimate indication at this stage, which means antibiotics should not be continued by default but rather used only when they clearly improve distressing symptoms with acceptable burden [^114kcqZv] [^115fDHvC] [^1123ftQ1].

> Hold on, I should review aspiration pneumonia guidance, but I must not overgeneralize acute-care recommendations; IDSA/ATS CAP guidance advises against routine anaerobic coverage in suspected aspiration unless there is concern for abscess or empyema, and HAP/VAP guidance includes agents like piperacillin-tazobactam for empiric MSSA coverage in selected hospitalized patients, yet these frameworks presume a disease-modifying intent and hospital-level trajectory that do not automatically translate to hospice goals focused on comfort, so applicability is limited here and must be filtered through the patient's palliative priorities [^111TRU1E] [^111Vs8ak] [^112wwogJ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also confirm what contemporary statements say about course of therapy; BTS 2023 suggests a 5-day antibiotic course for aspiration pneumonia when recovery is the goal, but that presumes reversibility and improvement targets that do not match a hospice scenario of recurrent aspiration risk from irreversible anatomy, so these time frames are informative for acute care yet not directive for end-of-life decisions centered on comfort over cure [^1121NzV4] [^113BLNdp] [^11346AWb].

> I will now examine benefits versus burdens of continuing IV Zosyn; potential benefits are limited to palliation of fever, secretions, or dyspnea if these are truly infection-driven, whereas burdens include invasive IV access, dosing every 6–8 hours, monitoring, antibiotic adverse effects including gastrointestinal upset and C. difficile risk, and treatment that may prolong the dying process without improving quality of life, which in hospice generally tips the balance against continuation absent clear symptomatic gain; even data on extended or continuous infusion improving mortality in acute pneumonia do not speak to hospice comfort endpoints, so I should not conflate those results with palliative benefit [^1123ftQ1] [^115fDHvC] [^117RFnyk].

> Let me consider disease trajectory and recurrence risk; in advanced esophageal cancer the aspiration risk is driven by dysphagia, obstruction, and impaired airway protection that are not reversible in hospice, so even if this episode transiently improves, recurrent aspiration is expected and infection often represents a terminal event rather than a modifiable episode, reinforcing that repeated or ongoing IV antibiotics are medically futile for altering outcome and often misaligned with comfort-first care [^111zfLsR] [^113aRb1J] [^112TXXUH].

> I need to ensure ethical alignment; non-maleficence argues against burdensome IV therapy with low likelihood of meaningful benefit, beneficence supports prioritizing non-antibiotic measures that reliably relieve dyspnea, fever, and secretions, autonomy and informed preferences are already expressed via hospice election, and futility applies when the intervention does not achieve the patient's goal of comfort or change the trajectory, all of which together counsel stopping IV antibiotics unless they clearly and promptly alleviate distress with minimal burden [^1123ftQ1] [^112TXXUH].

> Next, I should review comfort-focused alternatives; for dyspnea and air hunger use opioids and anxiolytics as needed, for fever use antipyretics, for secretions use frequent repositioning, gentle suctioning, and non-pharmacologic mouth care, recognizing that audible secretions often fluctuate near end of life and can be managed supportively; if swallowing management remains relevant for comfort, consider speech-language pathology input, though in late hospice stages the emphasis is on noninvasive comfort, and if families strongly request antibiotics only for symptom relief, a short oral course could be discussed as less invasive than IV, with explicit acknowledgment of limited benefit [^112TXXUH] [^111u2okN] [^115RbBpo] [^114kcqZv].

> But wait, what if symptoms are clearly infection-driven and very distressing; in rare, exceptional circumstances, a time-limited trial of antibiotics can be considered if the patient or family explicitly requests it after informed discussion, IV access is already comfortable, and there are predefined 48–72 hour stopping criteria for lack of symptom improvement, ensuring decisions are revisited via shared decision-making frameworks designed for end-of-life infection management rather than open-ended continuation [^115fDHvC] [^1123ftQ1].

> Final recommendation, and let me double-check it against the above: discontinue IV piperacillin-tazobactam and transition fully to comfort-focused care, because there is no demonstrated survival benefit in hospice, the underlying aspiration risk is irreversible, the burdens of IV therapy outweigh symptom benefits in most cases, and acute-care pneumonia guidelines are not directly applicable when the care goal is comfort rather than cure; reserve only a tightly bounded, symptom-driven, short trial if the family requests after informed consent and if there are clear distressing infection-attributable symptoms with objective improvement targets [^114kcqZv] [^115fDHvC] [^1121NzV4] [^1123ftQ1] [^112TXXUH].

> Action plan, and I should confirm it aligns with hospice standards: explain to the patient and family that the infection likely reflects the natural end-of-life trajectory in advanced esophageal cancer and that stopping IV antibiotics focuses on maximizing comfort, intensify non-antibiotic symptom measures for dyspnea, fever, and secretions, document the goals-of-care conversation and agreed plan, and reassess frequently; if a rare time-limited trial is pursued solely for symptom relief, set explicit 48–72 hour stop criteria and discontinue promptly if no clear symptomatic benefit is observed [^1123ftQ1] [^112TXXUH] [^115fDHvC].

---

No, **Zosyn should not be continued** in hospice for a patient with esophageal cancer and aspiration pneumonia unless there is a clear, short-term symptom benefit aligned with the patient's goals [^114kcqZv] [^115fDHvC]. Hospice care prioritizes **comfort**, and antibiotics are not routinely used unless they relieve distressing symptoms [^113aRb1J] [^1123ftQ1]. Zosyn can cause adverse effects and may not improve quality of life or survival in this context [^115fDHvC]. If symptom control is needed, consider a shorter oral or subcutaneous regimen; otherwise, discontinue Zosyn and focus on comfort measures [^1121NzV4] [^114kcqZv].

---

## Clinical considerations for antibiotic use in hospice care

Hospice care emphasizes **comfort and quality of life**, so antibiotics are used only when they clearly relieve distressing symptoms [^115fDHvC] [^1123ftQ1]. In advanced cancer, antibiotics often do not improve survival or quality of life; decisions should be individualized based on patient goals and symptom burden [^114kcqZv] [^113aRb1J].

---

## Evidence regarding continuation of antibiotics in hospice care

Antibiotics in hospice are primarily for **symptom control**, not survival or disease modification [^115fDHvC]. In a hospice study of patients with advanced cancer, most chose no antibiotics or symptom-directed use only, and antibiotics did not affect survival [^114kcqZv]. Symptom control was more likely in urinary infections than in respiratory infections, where benefit was limited [^114kcqZv] [^113aRb1J].

---

## Risks and benefits of continuing Zosyn in hospice care

### Potential benefits

Potential benefits include **symptom relief**, which may reduce fever, dyspnea, and cough if the infection is responsive [^114kcqZv]. **Short-term improvement** is also possible, with transient comfort gains in select patients.

---

### Potential risks

- **Adverse effects**: Diarrhea, nausea, allergic reactions, renal impairment, and C. difficile [^115fDHvC].
- **Burden of care**: IV administration requires lines and monitoring, causing discomfort and reducing mobility [^1123ftQ1].
- **Antibiotic resistance**: Prolonged use increases resistance risk, limiting future options [^1152EZRZ].
- **Limited benefit**: Often does not improve quality of life or survival in advanced cancer [^113aRb1J].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **individualized decisions** based on goals, prognosis, and symptom burden [^1123ftQ1]. Antibiotics should be discontinued when they do not provide clear symptom relief or align with patient preferences [^114kcqZv] [^113aRb1J]. Hospice care should focus on comfort, symptom management, and quality of life [^112TXXUH].

---

## Alternative approaches to managing aspiration pneumonia in hospice care

If antibiotics are discontinued, prioritize comfort-focused measures:

- **Symptom management**: Opioids for dyspnea, antipyretics for fever, anticholinergics for secretions [^112TXXUH].
- **Positioning**: Elevate head of bed and reposition to reduce aspiration and improve comfort [^111GEvEu].
- **Oral care**: Regular oral hygiene to reduce bacterial load and discomfort [^114xX1Fy].
- **Nutritional support**: Consider soft or pureed diets if consistent with goals [^111zfLsR].
- **Palliative sedation**: For refractory symptoms, consider proportional sedation [^1123ftQ1].

---

## Ethical considerations and patient autonomy

Ethical care respects **autonomy**, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. Continuing Zosyn without clear benefit may cause harm and added burden, conflicting with hospice goals. Shared decision-making should guide care, prioritizing comfort and patient preferences [^1123ftQ1].

---

## Recommended course of action

Given the limited benefit and potential harms, **Zosyn should generally be discontinued** in hospice unless it clearly relieves symptoms and aligns with patient goals [^115fDHvC]. If symptom control is needed, consider a short-course oral or subcutaneous regimen; otherwise, focus on comfort measures [^1121NzV4].

---

## Documentation and communication

Document the **rationale** for discontinuing Zosyn, including the patient's goals, prognosis, and expected outcomes. Communicate clearly with the patient, family, and hospice team to ensure understanding and alignment with care goals [^1123ftQ1].

---

- **Zosyn should not be continued** in hospice for esophageal cancer with aspiration pneumonia unless it provides clear symptom relief consistent with patient goals [^114kcqZv]. Hospice care should prioritize comfort and quality of life, using antibiotics only when they meaningfully reduce distress [^1123ftQ1].

At least one-third of patients at the end of life (EOL) receive interventions that are without benefit, and a similar proportion die in the intensive care unit. The article discusses the role of antimicrobials in patients at the EOL, including patient populations and scenarios in which antimicrobials may or may not have benefit. It also reviews adverse outcomes associated with antimicrobial use at the EOL, including societal harms. Finally, an algorithm to aid in the management of suspected infections at the EOL is proposed.

### Antimicrobial use in patients with advanced cancer receiving hospice care [^114kcqZv]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with advanced cancer receiving hospice and palliative care are highly susceptible to infections. The decision to treat an active or suspected infection in end-of-life care can be challenging. To develop guidelines for antimicrobial use (antibiotics and antifungals) in palliative care, we discussed antimicrobial options with 255 patients with advanced cancer as they entered a community-based hospice and palliative care program. We documented the use and effectiveness of the antimicrobials employed during the palliative care period.

Most patients (79.2%) opted for either no antimicrobials or symptomatic use only. Choices were influenced by age, desire for symptom control, life-prolongation considerations, and the patient's condition. After admission, 117 patients experienced a total of 129 infections, with the most common sites being the urinary tract, respiratory tract, mouth/pharynx, and skin/subcutaneous tissues. The use of antimicrobials effectively controlled symptoms in the majority of urinary tract infections, but was less effective in controlling symptoms at other infection sites.

Survival was not affected by the patients' choice to use antimicrobials, the prevalence of infections, or the actual use of antimicrobials. Symptom control may be the primary indication for antimicrobial use in patients receiving hospice and palliative care.

### Management of infections in palliative care patients with advanced cancer [^113aRb1J]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2002). Low credibility.

To characterize infections and their management in oncology patients at the end of life, we conducted a review of the literature. Eight studies assessing infection in 957 patients with various malignancies were identified. Forty-two percent of terminally ill patients developed infections in the final phase of care. The greatest frequency of treatment with antibiotics occurred in acute care hospitals. Enterobacteriaceae and S. aureus were the most frequently isolated bacteria, and urinary and respiratory tracts were the most frequently involved sites of infection. A total of 19–39% of individuals with suspected infection and advanced cancer died. The decision whether to treat or not in the palliative care setting may be complex and requires an individualized approach. Further research in this area will help develop a consensus for management that will facilitate the education of students and residents regarding complex decisions of care of infections at the end of life.

### American Cancer Society head and neck cancer survivorship care guideline [^115RbBpo]. CA (2016). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for laryngeal cancer, specifically concerning survivorship and rehabilitation (gastroesophageal complications), the 2016 ACS guidelines recommend referring patients with complaints of dysphagia, postprandial cough, unexplained weight loss, or pneumonia to an experienced speech-language pathologist. This referral is for instrumental evaluation of swallowing function to assess and manage dysphagia and possible aspiration. Recognize the potential for psychosocial barriers to swallowing recovery and refer to an appropriate clinician if barriers are present. Patients should also be referred to a speech-language pathologist for videofluoroscopy as the first-line test in cases of suspected stricture due to the high degree of coexisting physiological dysphagia.

### Effectiveness of water jelly ingestion for both rehabilitation and prevention of aspiration pneumonia in elderly patients with moderate to severe dysphagia [^114xX1Fy]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Many swallowing exercises require physical strength, stamina, good comprehension, and memory. Patients often need to gradually increase their endurance. Therefore, water jelly ingestion three times a day may be useful as a simple strategy for oral intake rehabilitation. Additionally, water jelly plays a role in oral care by clearing oral residue. Oral care reduces the risk of aspiration pneumonia by reducing oral flora and lowering the induction threshold of the cough reflex, an airway defense reflex, through an elevation of substance P. In light of the use of food to remove oral residues containing proteins, sugars, and lipids, water jelly may contribute to reducing aspiration pneumonia.

This study has limitations. The small sample size and the single-hospital setting in Japan are notable constraints. The analyses were retrospective, and it was not possible to completely eliminate the influence of patients' backgrounds and confounding factors, even though patients were consecutively enrolled. Although all patients in studies 1 and 2 underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy to differentiate oropharyngeal dysphagia from esophageal or gastric cancer, neither esophageal manometry nor radiography was used for any subjects. Therefore, patients with esophageal motility disorders such as diffuse esophageal spasm or achalasia may not have been excluded. Larger, randomized multicenter trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of water jelly.

### Esophageal adenocarcinoma: The influence of medications used to treat comorbidities on cancer prognosis [^113ZE3Kz]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Esophageal adenocarcinoma has experienced a continuous rise in incidence since the early 1970s and is the fastest rising cancer among white men in the United States. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that medications commonly used to treat multiple chronic conditions, such as aspirin, non-aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and statins, as well as powerful acid suppressants like proton pump inhibitors, are associated with a reduced risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.

The chemopreventive potential of these classes of medications appears to be especially applicable to persons with Barrett's esophagus, the only known premalignant condition for esophageal adenocarcinoma. However, it is not known whether these medications also influence cancer recurrence and cancer-specific mortality in persons diagnosed with esophageal adenocarcinoma. This is an important question because most patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma have one or more comorbid conditions at the time of their cancer diagnosis and are receiving medication to treat these conditions.

This article summarizes the evidence on the associations between four commonly used classes of medications and (1) risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's esophagus and (2) risk of cancer recurrence and cancer-specific mortality in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma.

### Outcomes in older adults with metastatic esophageal and gastric carcinoma treated with palliative chemotherapy [^111ewrbR]. The Oncologist (2024). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal malignancies are a leading cause of cancer-related deaths and morbidity, increasingly diagnosed in older adults. Historically, this group of patients has been excluded from clinical trials, relying on the extrapolation of results for clinical application in those aged 75 years or older. We sought to determine if older adults diagnosed with incurable gastroesophageal malignancies tolerated chemotherapy as well as younger patients, achieved similar survival outcomes, and to identify patterns in the rationale for non-receipt of chemotherapy in the elderly. In our retrospective analysis, we observed that older adults tolerated palliative chemotherapy as well as patients aged under 75 years and achieved similar survival outcomes. This suggests that age itself should not be a determinant for the receipt of palliative chemotherapy, with performance status and comorbidities being more appropriate predictors of outcome.

### Antibiotic resistance in the patient with cancer: Escalating challenges and paths forward [^1152EZRZ]. CA (2021). Low credibility.

Infection is the second leading cause of death in patients with cancer. Loss of efficacy in antibiotics due to antibiotic resistance in bacteria is an urgent threat to the continuing success of cancer therapy. In this review, the authors focus on recent updates on the impact of antibiotic resistance in the cancer setting, particularly on the ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.). This review highlights the health and financial impact of antibiotic resistance in patients with cancer. Furthermore, the authors recommend measures to control the emergence of antibiotic resistance, highlighting the risk factors associated with cancer care.

A lack of data in the etiology of infections, specifically in oncology patients in the United States, is identified as a concern, and the authors advocate for a centralized and specialized surveillance system for patients with cancer to predict and prevent the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Finding better ways to predict, prevent, and treat antibiotic-resistant infections will have a major positive impact on the care of those with cancer.

### In vitro and in vivo activities of piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem at different inoculum sizes of ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae [^112D1jmw]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

The inoculum effect is a laboratory phenomenon in which the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an antibiotic is increased when a large number of organisms are exposed. Due to the emergence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-Kpn) infections, the inoculum effect of ESBL-Kpn on β-lactams was studied in vitro and in vivo using an experimental model of pneumonia.

The in vitro inoculum effect of 45 clinical ESBL-Kpn isolates on β-lactams was evaluated at standard (10⁵ CFU/mL) and high (10⁷ CFU/mL) organism concentrations. The MIC50 of piperacillin-tazobactam, cefotaxime, and cefepime was increased eight-fold or more, and that of meropenem was increased two-fold.

The in vivo inoculum effect was evaluated in an ESBL-Kpn pneumonia mouse model treated with bacteriostatic effect-adjusted doses of piperacillin-tazobactam (1000 mg/kg four times daily, %T > MIC; 32.60%) or meropenem (100 mg/kg twice daily, %T > MIC; 28.65%) at low/standard (10⁴ CFU/mouse) and high (10⁶ CFU/mouse) inocula. In mice administered a low inoculum, no mice died after treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem, whereas all the control mice died.

In contrast, in the high inoculum model, all mice in the piperacillin-tazobactam-treated group died, whereas all meropenem-treated mice survived and had a decreased bacterial load in the lungs and no invasion into the blood. In conclusion, meropenem was more resistant to the inoculum effect of ESBL-Kpn than piperacillin-tazobactam both in vitro and in vivo.

### Clinical outcomes with extended or continuous versus short-term intravenous infusion of carbapenems and piperacillin/tazobactam: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117RFnyk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The study aimed to determine if the superior pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties of carbapenems and piperacillin/tazobactam, when administered for extended durations, correlate with reduced mortality. A search was conducted via PubMed and Scopus for studies that included patients treated with either extended (≥ 3 hours) or continuous (24 hours) versus short-term (20–60 minutes) infusions of these antibiotics. Fourteen studies, encompassing 1229 patients, were included. Results indicated that mortality was lower among patients receiving extended or continuous infusions of carbapenems or piperacillin/tazobactam compared to those receiving short-term infusions, with a risk ratio (RR) of 0.59 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.41–0.83. Additionally, patients with pneumonia who received extended or continuous infusions exhibited lower mortality compared to those receiving short-term infusions (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.26–0.96). Data concerning other specific infections were unavailable. This evidence, primarily derived from nonrandomized studies, suggests a potential benefit of extended or continuous infusion in reducing mortality. However, well-designed randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm these findings before widespread adoption of such approaches.

### Rykindo extended-release microspheres [^1111EQH3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dysphagia**: Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced Alzheimer's dementia. Antipsychotic drugs, including RYKINDO, should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Priapism**: Priapism has been reported during postmarketing surveillance of other risperidone products. Severe priapism may require surgical intervention.

- **Body temperature dysregulation**: Atypical antipsychotics may disrupt the body's ability to reduce core body temperature. Both hyperthermia and hypothermia have been reported in association with the use of oral risperidone or risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular). Strenuous exercise, exposure to extreme heat, dehydration, and anticholinergic medications may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature; use RYKINDO with caution in patients who may experience these conditions.

### Death unrelated to cancer and death from aspiration pneumonia after definitive radiotherapy for head and neck cancer [^117QqNLU]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

The incidence of hypopharyngeal and supraglottic cancer (HSC) is high in Japan. This study aimed to retrospectively identify risk factors for death unrelated to cancer and death from aspiration pneumonia after definitive radiotherapy (RT) for HSC.

Overall, 391 patients who began definitive RT for HSC between 2006 and 2014 were identified from the Osaka International Cancer Institute electronic database. Among these patients, 33 had a history of surgery for esophageal cancer (EC) and 19 received simultaneous RT for synchronous EC. The cause of death was divided into three main categories: "cancer under study", "other malignancy", and "unrelated to cancer". The Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR).

The median follow-up for survivors was 8 years (range: 3.6–14.1). By the last follow-up, 202 patients had died. Death from "cancer under study", "other malignancy", and "unrelated to cancer" occurred in 92 (45.5%), 55 (27.2%), and 55 (27.2%) patients, respectively. Twelve patients died from aspiration pneumonia. In multivariate analysis for death unrelated to cancer and death from aspiration pneumonia, a history of surgery for EC (HR: 3.87, p < 0.001; HR: 6.84, p = 0.007, respectively) and simultaneous RT for synchronous EC (HR: 3.74, p = 0.006; HR: 16.37, p < 0.001, respectively) were significant risk factors.

The laryngeal preservation approach by RT for HSC patients with a history of surgery for EC and simultaneous RT for synchronous EC should be used with caution.

### Gefitinib for oesophageal cancer progressing after chemotherapy (COG): a phase 3, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial [^113D81QH]. The Lancet. Oncology (2014). High credibility.

Evidence is scarce for the effectiveness of therapies for oesophageal cancer progressing after chemotherapy, and no randomised trials have been reported. We aimed to compare gefitinib with placebo in previously treated advanced oesophageal cancer.

- **Methods**: For this phase 3, parallel, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, eligible patients were adults with advanced oesophageal cancer or type I/II Siewert junctional tumours, histologically confirmed squamous-cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma, who had progressed after chemotherapy, with WHO performance status 0–2, and with measurable or evaluable disease on CT scan. Participants were recruited from 48 UK centres and randomly assigned (1:1) to gefitinib (500 mg) or matching placebo by simple randomisation with no stratification factors. Patients, clinicians, and trial office staff were masked to treatment allocation. Treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient choice. The primary outcome was overall survival, analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN29580179.

- **Findings**: Between March 30, 2009, and Nov 18, 2011, 450 patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups (one patient withdrew consent; 224 patients allocated gefitinib and 225 allocated placebo included in analyses). Overall survival did not differ between groups (median 3.73 months, 95% CI 3.23–4.50, for gefitinib vs 3.67 months, 95% CI 2.97–4.37, for placebo; hazard ratio [HR] 0.90, 95% CI 0.74–1.09, p = 0.29). Among the prespecified patient-reported outcomes, 110 patients were on gefitinib.

### Palliative chemotherapy and targeted therapies for esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancer [^111b8KDc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Almost half of the patients with esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer present with metastatic disease at diagnosis. Chemotherapy and targeted therapies are increasingly used with a palliative intent to control tumor growth, improve quality of life, and prolong survival. At the time of writing, and with the exception of ramucirumab, evidence for the efficacy of palliative treatments for esophageal and gastroesophageal cancer is lacking.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of cytostatic or targeted therapy for treating esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer with palliative intent.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Web of Science, PubMed Publisher, Google Scholar, and trial registries up to 13 May 2015, and we handsearched the reference lists of studies. We did not restrict the search to publications in English. Additional searches were conducted in September 2017 prior to publication and are listed in the 'Studies awaiting assessment' section.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on palliative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy versus best supportive care or control in people with esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted data. We assessed the quality and risk of bias of eligible studies according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We calculated pooled estimates of effect using an inverse variance random-effects model for meta-analysis.

### A randomized controlled clinical trial of palliative therapies for patients with inoperable esophageal cancer [^114ar2ex]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). High credibility.

A dramatic rise in incidence, an aging population, and expensive palliative treatments have led to an escalating burden on clinicians managing inoperable esophageal cancer, with only limited evidence of effectiveness. This study compares the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of self-expanding metal stents (SEMSs) with other palliative therapies to aid clinicians in making an evidence-based treatment choice.

We conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial with 215 patients followed until death or study closure. The primary outcome measures were dysphagia, quality of life (QL) six weeks following treatment, and total cost of treatment. Secondary outcome measures included treatment-associated morbidity, mortality, survival, and cost-effectiveness. An intention-to-treat analysis was carried out.

There was a significant difference in mean dysphagia grade between treatment arms six weeks following treatment (P = 0.046), with worse swallowing reported by rigid stent-treated patients (mean dysphagia score difference = -0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.10 to -0.89, P = 0.014). Global QL scores were lower at both one and six weeks following treatment for patients treated by SEMSs (mean difference QL index week 1 = -0.66; 95% CI: -0.02 to -1.30, P = 0.04; mean difference QL index week 6 = -1.01; 95% CI -0.30 to -1.72, P = 0.006), which were associated with higher post-procedure pain scores in the SEMS patient group.

### Risperdal [^113MmQHg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dysphagia**: Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced Alzheimer's dementia. RISPERDAL and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Priapism**: Priapism has been reported during postmarketing surveillance. Severe priapism may require surgical intervention.

- **Body temperature regulation**: Disruption of body temperature regulation has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Both hyperthermia and hypothermia have been reported in association with oral RISPERDAL use. Caution is advised when prescribing for patients who will be exposed to temperature extremes.

- **Patients with phenylketonuria**: Inform patients that RISPERDAL M-TAB orally disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine. Phenylalanine is a component of aspartame. Each 4 mg RISPERDAL M-TAB orally disintegrating tablet contains 0.84 mg phenylalanine; each 3 mg tablet contains 0.63 mg; each 2 mg tablet contains 0.42 mg; each 1 mg tablet contains 0.28 mg; and each 0.5 mg tablet contains 0.14 mg phenylalanine.

### Safety of esophageal cancer surgery during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe: A multicenter study [^113GUSHV]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Many hospitals postponed elective surgical care during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Some centers continued elective surgery, including esophageal cancer surgery, utilizing preoperative screening methods; however, there is no evidence supporting the safety of this strategy as postoperative outcomes after esophageal cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic have not yet been investigated.

- **Methods**: This multicenter study in four European tertiary esophageal cancer referral centers included consecutive adult patients undergoing elective esophageal cancer surgery from a prospectively maintained database in a COVID-19 pandemic cohort (1 March 2020–31 May 2020) and a control cohort (1 October 2019–29 February 2020). The primary outcome was the rate of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.

- **Results**: The COVID-19 cohort consisted of 139 patients, versus 168 patients in the control cohort. There was no difference in the rate of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (13.7% vs. 8.3%, p = 0.127) and number of pulmonary complications (32.4% vs. 29.9%, p = 0.646) between the COVID-19 cohort and the control cohort. Overall, postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were comparable between both cohorts. History taking and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used as preoperative screening methods to detect a possible severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in all centers. No patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 pre- or postoperatively.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment in community-acquired pneumonia: A multicenter randomized clinical trial [^117PyR3C]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). High credibility.

The study on the duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia was published by Ane Uranga and colleagues in 2016 in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. This research focuses on community-acquired pneumonia.

The central question addressed was the role of the duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. The study employed a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) design and involved 312 patients (116 female, 196 male).

- **Population**: The inclusion criteria were hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

- **Key exclusion criteria**: Patients with HIV infection, chronic immunosuppression, residence in a nursing home, recent discharge from an acute care hospital, subacute care unit, or palliative care unit within the last 14 days, and those who had taken antibiotics within 30 days prior to admission were excluded.

- **Interventions**: Two groups were studied:
	1. Protocolized duration of antibiotic treatment for a minimum of 5 days with discontinuation after 5 days (n = 162).
	2. Physician-guided antibiotic discontinuation where the duration was determined by physicians (n = 150).

- **Primary outcome**: The primary outcome was the difference not exceeding the non-inferiority margin in clinical success at day 10, with results showing 56.3% success in the protocolized group versus 48.6% in the physician-guided group (RR 1.16, 95% CI -0.53 to 2.85).

### Esophageal cancer: Challenges, concerns, and recommendations for management amidst the COVID-19 pandemic [^113FyqAN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Since December 2019, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide, raising great concern, particularly in immunosuppressed cancer patients. The pandemic situation remains extremely dynamic, necessitating proactive management decisions from oncologists and oncologic surgeons to mitigate the risk of both SARS-CoV-2 infection and cancer metastasis. Esophageal cancer, in particular, is one of the deadliest types of malignancy worldwide, reflecting both aggressive biology and a lack of adequate treatment. Several challenges and concerns regarding the management of esophageal cancer have been raised in light of the ongoing viral pandemic. The primary aim of this review is to summarize the salient evidence for recommendations and optimal treatment strategies for patients with esophageal cancer amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Safety of a novel upper esophageal sphincter balloon dilator [^114T7iJV]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Low credibility.

Swallowing impairment can be debilitating, leading to chronic discomfort, weight loss, malnutrition, dehydration, social isolation, aspiration pneumonia, and even death. In a national cohort of inpatients, a dysphagia diagnosis resulted in a 13-fold increase in mortality. The prevalence of dysphagia in the elderly population can be as high as 20%. Up to 40% of patients treated for head and neck cancer may develop silent aspiration and upper esophageal sphincter (UES) stenosis.

Dilation of the esophagus and UES is one of the most commonly performed procedures to treat dysphagia. Indications for esophageal dilation include esophageal webs, rings, and strictures. In 1674, Sir Thomas Willis described the first esophageal dilator, which was developed from a carved whalebone to treat a patient with achalasia. Napoleon's surgeon, Dr. Alexis Boyer, performed the first esophageal bouginage in the 1880s. Despite the storied history and common practice of esophageal dilation, the cylindrical shape of esophageal dilators has remained unchanged since the use of a whalebone over 350 years ago.

Dilators were initially developed to distend the round lumen of the esophageal body. However, the UES differs in shape from the esophagus. The pyriform sinuses are bound medially by the aryepiglottic folds, laterally by the thyroid cartilage, and posteriorly by the posterior hypopharyngeal wall. The inferior pharyngeal constrictor comprises the muscular component of the fossae and is divided into thyropharyngeus and cricopharyngeus components. The thyropharyngeus arises from the oblique line of the thyroid cartilage.

### Palliative chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for dysphagia in advanced oesophageal cancer: a multicentre randomised controlled trial (TROG 03.01) [^111svudV]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

A short course of radiotherapy is commonly prescribed for palliative relief of malignant dysphagia in patients with incurable oesophageal cancer. We compared chemoradiotherapy with radiotherapy alone for dysphagia relief in the palliative setting.

- **Methods**: This multicentre randomised controlled trial included patients with advanced or metastatic oesophageal cancer, randomly assigned (1:1) through a computer-generated adaptive biased coin design to either palliative chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy alone for treatment of malignant dysphagia at 22 hospitals in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the UK. Eligible patients had biopsy-proven oesophageal cancer that was unsuitable for curative treatment, symptomatic dysphagia, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0–2, and adequate haematological and renal function. Patients were stratified by hospital, dysphagia score (Mellow scale 1–4), and presence of metastases. The radiotherapy dose was 35 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks for patients in Australia and New Zealand, and 30 Gy in ten fractions over 2 weeks for patients in Canada and the UK. Chemotherapy consisted of one cycle of intravenous cisplatin (either 80 mg/m² on day 1 or 20 mg/m² per day on days 1–4 of radiotherapy at clinician's discretion) and intravenous fluorouracil 800 mg/m² per day on days 1–4 of radiotherapy in week 1. Patients were assessed weekly during treatment. The primary endpoint was dysphagia relief, defined as ≥ 1 point reduction on the Mellow scale at 9 weeks and maintained 4 weeks later.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: A retrospective cohort study [^1142gMa4]. Chest (2024). Low credibility.

Our study has several strengths. First, the large sample size of 3,999 patients allowed for more precise estimates. Second, the study included 18 hospitals, both academic and community, thereby increasing the generalizability of the study findings. Third, the GEMINI database was comprehensive and included detailed medication and patient data. Data on medication orders allowed accurate capture of antibiotic exposure during the entire hospital stay. Patient data allowed for adjustment of many prognostic factors in the propensity score overlap weighting analysis. All study patients underwent complete follow-up in the hospital.

The study had important limitations that merit mentioning. First, ICD-10-CA codes for aspiration pneumonia have not been validated previously to capture aspiration pneumonia and may have included aspiration pneumonitis that does not require antibiotic therapy. However, we coupled the ICD-10-CA diagnosis codes with the physician's decision to treat with first-line CAP antibiotics, which reflected a clinical diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia necessitating antibiotic therapy. Most aspiration pneumonitis cases resolve within 48 hours. Based on the cumulative incidence curves (Fig 2), mortality continued to increase steadily after day 2, which followed the typical course for aspiration pneumonia rather than aspiration pneumonitis. A prior study used the same method based on International Classification of Diseases codes to capture and differentiate aspiration pneumonia from other pneumonias.

Second, the primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.

### ASO author reflections: Safety of performing esophageal cancer surgery during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe: A multicenter study [^112ZifFT]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Many centers around the world postponed elective surgical care during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to several factors. Hospitals needed to shift medical resources to increase intensive care unit (ICU) capacities and other wards to handle the growing number of COVID-19 patients, and to prevent patients and healthcare workers from potentially acquiring in-hospital severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. This strategy of postponing elective surgery was supported by a large study indicating that patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection undergoing surgery had an increased risk for postoperative pulmonary complications and mortality. As a result, many centers were forced to postpone treatment for esophageal cancer patients for an extended period. Moreover, some centers switched to alternative treatment measures, such as definitive chemoradiotherapy.

Conversely, some centers managed to continue elective cancer surgery, including esophageal cancer surgery, with the implementation of effective preoperative screening methods. However, there was no evidence at the time supporting the safety of continuing elective esophageal cancer surgery during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, several societies released guidelines discouraging the use of minimally invasive surgery, as these procedures could potentially contaminate surgical staff with SARS-CoV-2.

### Comparison of ceftriaxone plus macrolide and ampicillin/sulbactam plus macrolide in treatment for patients with community-acquired pneumonia without risk factors for aspiration: an open-label, quasi-randomized, controlled trial [^114eDyGm]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Patients aged 15 years or older, hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) without risk factors for aspiration, were enrolled. The diagnostic criteria for CAP are defined as radiological findings of a new and/or progressive infiltrate(s) and two or more of the following symptoms: cough; sputum or change of sputum character (increased volume and/or purulence); dyspnea; pleuritic chest pain; tachycardia; documented axillary body temperature ≥ 37.5 °C within the past 24 hours; rigors and/or chills; general malaise; abnormal breathing sounds; auscultatory findings consistent with the lung infiltrate on chest examination; and white blood cell (WBC) count < 3000/mm³ or ≥ 10,000/mm³. The severity of pneumonia was determined according to the pneumonia severity index (PSI).

Cases meeting any of the following criteria were excluded: suspected aspiration pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia; hospitalization within 60 days of symptom onset; active lung cancer (excluding completely resected cases); terminal illness; immunocompromising disease (including human immunodeficiency virus infection, active hematologic malignancies, neutropenia, and congenital immunodeficiency) or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy (use of ≥ 10 mg of prednisolone-equivalents and/or immunosuppressants); pregnant or breastfeeding; known allergy to the indicated antibiotics; or presence of other infiltrative diseases such as organizing pneumonia, radiation pneumonitis, drug-induced pneumonia, obstructive pneumonia, tuberculosis or fungal infection, and empyema.

### Safety of esophageal cancer surgery during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe: A multicenter study [^111sB94t]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Esophageal cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Curative treatment for locally advanced esophageal cancer consists of esophagectomy combined with perioperative (radio-)chemotherapy. Esophagectomy is a complex surgical procedure and is associated with substantial morbidity, in particular, postoperative pneumonia and consecutive respiratory failure.

Many hospitals postponed elective surgical care during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This was necessary as medical resources were shifted to increase intensive care unit capacities, to prevent patients from acquiring in-hospital severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, and to address concerns regarding the safety of healthcare workers and patients. This strategy is supported by a recent study demonstrating that patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection undergoing surgery have an increased risk for postoperative pulmonary complications and mortality. Additionally, patients scheduled for esophageal cancer surgery are at high risk for symptomatic COVID-19 because of epidemiologic characteristics such as high age, male sex, and high prevalence of obesity; immunosuppression due to neoadjuvant therapy; high prevalence of pre-existing pulmonary comorbidities; and transthoracic esophagectomy with single lung ventilation.

On the other hand, some countries have implemented national guidelines advising the use of preoperative SARS-CoV-2 screening methods in order to continue elective surgery. Certain international tertiary hospitals specializing in esophageal cancer have adopted these practices to ensure the continued treatment of patients.

### Methods for decreasing risk of aspiration pneumonia in critically ill patients [^111GEvEu]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Pneumonia is a significant clinical concern in critically ill hospitalized patients, leading to an increase in the use of antibiotics, length of hospital stay, and the risk of mortality. Pneumonia caused by aspiration of gastric contents is of particular concern in patients who need mechanical ventilation and feeding through a nasogastric tube. Therefore, methods for decreasing the risk of aspiration are very important.

- **Factors influencing development**: This review article summarizes factors that might influence the development of aspiration pneumonia, such as the position of the patient's body or type of hospital bed, methods of feeding, medications administered, suctioning of subglottic secretions, and bacterial decontamination.

- **Prevention methods**: Elevating the head of the bed (45 degrees), continuous subglottic suctioning, and oral decontamination seem to be effective in the prevention of aspiration pneumonia.

### Prevention of postoperative pneumonia by perioperative oral care in patients with esophageal cancer undergoing surgery: a multicenter retrospective study of 775 patients [^1178AbUS]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Low credibility.

Postoperative pneumonia is one of the major complications after esophageal cancer surgery. The risk factors associated with postoperative pneumonia include poor general health, smoking, decreased pulmonary function, diabetes mellitus, surgical stress, old age, postoperative aspiration, and oral hygiene. In this study, the effect of perioperative oral care on reducing postoperative pneumonia was examined since the evidence to date is not clear.

- **Methods**: A multicenter, retrospective investigation of the relationship between perioperative oral care and the incidence of postoperative pneumonia in patients undergoing esophageal cancer surgery was conducted. A total of 775 patients who underwent thoracoscopic esophageal resection at 25 hospitals between 2016 and 2017 were enrolled in the study. Various factors were examined for correlation with the development of postoperative pneumonia.

- **Results**: Multivariate analysis showed that old age, smoking habit, lower hemoglobin, higher creatinine, postoperative dysphagia, and lack of oral care intervention were independent risk factors for pneumonia. Oral care was more effective in preventing pneumonia in hospitals where the incidence of postoperative pneumonia was lower than 20%, while it was not effective in hospitals where the incidence was higher than 20%.

- **Conclusion**: The results of the study suggest that it is recommended to carry out perioperative oral care in esophageal cancer surgery.

### Dysphagia: Evaluation and collaborative management [^113LqLSq]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is common but may be underreported. Specific symptoms, rather than their perceived location, should guide the initial evaluation and imaging. Obstructive symptoms that seem to originate in the throat or neck may actually be caused by distal esophageal lesions. Oropharyngeal dysphagia manifests as difficulty initiating swallowing, coughing, choking, or aspiration, and it is most commonly caused by chronic neurologic conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, or dementia. Symptoms should be thoroughly evaluated because of the risk of aspiration. Patients with esophageal dysphagia may report a sensation of food getting stuck after swallowing. This condition is most commonly caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease and functional esophageal disorders. Eosinophilic esophagitis is triggered by food allergens and is increasingly prevalent; esophageal biopsies should be performed to make the diagnosis. Esophageal motility disorders such as achalasia are relatively rare and may be overdiagnosed. Opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction is becoming more common. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is recommended for the initial evaluation of esophageal dysphagia, with barium esophagography as an adjunct. Esophageal cancer and other serious conditions have a low prevalence, and testing in low-risk patients may be deferred while a four-week trial of acid-suppressing therapy is undertaken. Many frail older adults with progressive neurologic disease have significant but unrecognized dysphagia, which significantly increases their risk of aspiration pneumonia and malnourishment.

### Antibiotics versus non-antibiotic in the treatment of aspiration pneumonia: Analysis of the MIMIC-IV database [^111dXWvL]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

- **Patterns in antibiotic usage and patient counts**: The columns show the number of antibiotics used, and the broken lines show the number of people taking drugs. The horizontal axis represents the number of antibiotics used. "0" indicates that no antibacterial drugs have been used, "1" indicates that only one antibacterial drug has been used, and "2" indicates the combination of two antibacterial drugs, and so on for 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

- **Distribution of different antibiotics and their combinations in patients with aspiration pneumonia**: Figure 7 shows the five most commonly used antibiotics (vancomycin, ForGC, piperacillin-tazobactam, metronidazole, third-generation cephalosporins (ThirGC)) and their combinations in patients with aspiration pneumonia. The most common combination therapy was vancomycin + piperacillin-tazobactam (N = 396), followed by vancomycin + ForGC (N = 246). Only three patients received a combination of all five antibiotics. A total of 102 patients were treated solely with ThirGC, and a relatively smaller number of patients were treated exclusively with metronidazole.

- **Antibiotic utilization, patient numbers, and survival rates**: As illustrated in Fig. 8, an analysis was conducted on the usage, patient numbers, and survival rates associated with antibiotics. The results indicate that the combination of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam was the most commonly used, while the combination of levofloxacin and metronidazole achieved the highest survival rate at 97.6%.

### Differences in the features of aspiration pneumonia according to site of acquisition: Community or continuing care facility [^112J6T2h]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2006). Low credibility.

The study aimed to determine the prevalence of aspiration pneumonia and compare the features and risk factors for this condition in patients from continuing care facilities (CCFs) and the community who were admitted to the hospital with pneumonia.

This was a prospective population-based study conducted in six hospitals in the Capital Health Region (Edmonton), Alberta, Canada. The participants included 1,946 adults admitted with pneumonia, stratified by their residence as community or CCF.

Measurements included the prevalence of aspiration pneumonia, risk factors, and outcomes such as mortality, length of stay, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates. The results showed that 10% of those with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) had aspirated, compared to 30% of those with CCF-acquired pneumonia. Patients with community-acquired aspiration pneumonia (CAAP) and CCF-acquired aspiration pneumonia (CCF-AP) were younger, more likely to go to ICU, more likely to require mechanical ventilation, had a longer length of stay, and exhibited higher mortality rates than nonaspirators.

- **Risk factors**: For those with CAAP, impaired consciousness due to alcohol, drugs, or hepatic failure predominated, whereas 72% of those with CCF-AP had neurological disease resulting in dysphagia.

- **Treatment**: Eighty percent were treated with antibiotics effective against anaerobic bacteria.

In conclusion, aspiration pneumonia is prevalent in patients with both CAP and CCF-acquired pneumonia. The risk factors vary significantly, with a noted high mortality rate, especially linked to neurological disease.

### A study of 13 patients with gastric tube in place after esophageal resection: Use of omeprazole to decrease gastric acidity and volume [^116nr3eG]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether oral omeprazole 20 mg decreases the risk of aspiration pneumonia in patients with gastric tube reconstruction.

- **Design**: Consecutive study.
- **Setting**: Operating room of a cancer center.
- **Patients**: Thirteen patients with gastric tube reconstruction for esophageal cancer.
- **Interventions**: Oral omeprazole 20 mg was administered the night before surgery. A rapid-sequence induction with cricoid pressure was utilized for the induction of anesthesia. After tracheal intubation, a nasogastric catheter was inserted into the gastric tube, and the contents were aspirated.
- **Measurements and main results**: The pH and volume of the gastric contents were measured. The pH and volume of the gastric tube contents were 4.5 ± 1.6 (ranging from 2.5 to 7.0) and 9.5 ± 10.2 mL (ranging from 0 to 30 mL), respectively. Food residue was recognized in nine patients. There was no patient with a pH below 2.5 and a volume of 25 mL or greater.

The study concluded that omeprazole 20 mg decreased the acidity and volume of the gastric tube contents and reduced the risk of aspiration pneumonia in patients with a gastric tube in place.

### American Cancer Society head and neck cancer survivorship care guideline [^1122A7os]. CA (2016). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for oropharyngeal cancer, particularly with respect to survivorship and rehabilitation (gastroesophageal complications), the ACS 2016 guidelines recommend referring patients with complaints of dysphagia, postprandial cough, unexplained weight loss, or pneumonia to an experienced speech-language pathologist. This referral is for an instrumental evaluation of swallowing function to assess and manage dysphagia and possible aspiration.

It is important to recognize the potential for psychosocial barriers to swallowing recovery, and patients should be referred to an appropriate clinician if such barriers are present. In cases where a stricture is suspected, refer patients to a speech-language pathologist for videofluoroscopy, as it is the first-line test due to the high degree of coexisting physiologic dysphagia.

### Aspiration pneumonia after chemo-intensity-modulated radiation therapy of oropharyngeal carcinoma and its clinical and dysphagia-related predictors [^11159sjZ]. Head & Neck (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess aspiration pneumonia (AsPn) rates and predictors after chemo-irradiation for head and neck cancer.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective study of 72 patients with stage III to IV oropharyngeal cancer treated definitively with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) combined with weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel. AsPn was recorded prospectively, and dysphagia was evaluated longitudinally through 2 years post-therapy by observer-rated (Common Toxicity Criteria version [CTCAE]) scores, patient-reported scores, and videofluoroscopy.

- **Results**: Sixteen patients (20%) developed AsPn. Predictive factors included T classification (p = .01), aspiration detected on videofluoroscopy (videofluoroscopy-asp; p = .0007), and patient-reported dysphagia (p = .02-.0003), but not observer-rated dysphagia (p = .4). Combining T classification, patient-reported dysphagia, and videofluoroscopy-asp provided the best predictive model.

- **Conclusion**: AsPn continues to be an under-reported consequence of chemo-irradiation for head and neck cancer. These data support using patient-reported dysphagia to identify high-risk patients requiring videofluoroscopy evaluation for preventive measures. Reducing videofluoroscopy-asp rates by minimizing radiation doses to swallowing structures and conducting trials to reduce treatment intensity in patients predicted to do well is likely to reduce AsPn rates.

### Treatment of nosocomial postoperative pneumonia in cancer patients: a prospective randomized study [^115qhFzT]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

Nosocomial pneumonia continues to be associated with high morbidity and mortality in cancer patients.

- **Methods**: In an attempt to find an optimal treatment for this infection, non-neutropenic cancer patients with postoperative nosocomial pneumonia were randomized to receive either piperacillin/tazobactam (P/T) 4.5 g i.v. every 6 hours (30 patients) or clindamycin (Cl) 900 mg plus aztreonam (Az) 2 g i.v. every 8 hours (22 patients). Amikacin 500 mg i.v. every 12 hours was given to all patients for the first 48 hours.

- **Results**: The two groups were comparable for the characteristics of pneumonia that included gram-negative etiology and duration of intubation. Response rates were 83% for patients who received P/T and 86% for those who received Cl/Az (P > .99). There were no serious adverse events; however, at our center, the cost of the P/T regimen was $73.86 compared with $99.15 for the Cl/Az regimen.

- **Conclusions**: The two regimens had comparable high efficacy, and P/T had a slight cost advantage. Either of these antibiotic regimens combined with an aminoglycoside could lead to a favorable outcome in cancer patients at high risk for nosocomial pneumonia.

### Safety of esophageal cancer surgery during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe: A multicenter study [^112jP8S9]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Many hospitals postponed elective surgical care during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Some centers continued elective surgery, including esophageal cancer surgery, with the use of preoperative screening methods; however, there is no evidence supporting the safety of this strategy, as postoperative outcomes after esophageal cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic have not yet been investigated.

- **Methods**: This multicenter study in four European tertiary esophageal cancer referral centers included consecutive adult patients undergoing elective esophageal cancer surgery from a prospectively maintained database in a COVID-19 pandemic cohort (1 March 2020–31 May 2020) and a control cohort (1 October 2019–29 February 2020). The primary outcome was the rate of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.

- **Results**: The COVID-19 cohort consisted of 139 patients, versus 168 patients in the control cohort. There was no difference in the rate of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (13.7% vs. 8.3%, p = 0.127) and the number of pulmonary complications (32.4% vs. 29.9%, p = 0.646) between the COVID-19 cohort and the control cohort. Overall, postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were comparable between both cohorts. History taking and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used as preoperative screening methods to detect a possible severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in all centers. No patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 pre- or postoperatively.

- **Conclusion**: These findings suggest that esophageal cancer surgery can be performed safely during the COVID-19 pandemic with appropriate preoperative screening.

### Antibiotic therapy in comatose mechanically ventilated patients following aspiration: Differentiating pneumonia from pneumonitis [^116dkVcF]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The study aimed to determine the proportion of patients with documented bacterial aspiration pneumonia among comatose ICU patients who showed symptoms suggesting either bacterial aspiration pneumonia or non-bacterial aspiration pneumonitis.

The research was designed as a prospective observational study set in a university-affiliated 30-bed intensive care unit (ICU). It involved a prospective cohort of 250 patients admitted to the ICU with coma (Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤ 8) and treated with invasive mechanical ventilation. There were no interventions introduced as part of the study.

- **Measurements and main results**: The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with microbiologically documented bacterial aspiration pneumonia. Patients meeting predefined criteria for aspiration syndrome routinely underwent telescopic plugged catheter sampling during bronchoscopy before starting probabilistic antibiotic treatment. When cultures were negative, the antibiotic treatment was stopped.

	- Of the 250 included patients, 98 (39.2%) had aspiration syndrome, including 92 before mechanical ventilation discontinuation. Telescopic plugged catheter sampling in these 92 patients showed bacterial aspiration pneumonia in 43 patients (46.7%). Among the remaining 49 patients, 16 continued to receive antibiotics, usually for infections other than pneumonia. Of the 33 patients whose antibiotics were discontinued, only two subsequently showed signs of lung infection. In the six patients with aspiration syndrome after mechanical ventilation, and therefore without telescopic plugged catheter, antibiotic treatment was continued for 7 days.

Mechanical ventilation duration, ICU length of stay, and mortality rates were also monitored.

### Lessons learnt in the end-of-life management of a hospice inpatient with advanced oropharyngeal cancer established on clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia [^1115ghFj]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Clozapine is a tightly controlled medication used effectively as a last-line agent in treatment-resistant schizophrenia, with a relatively narrow therapeutic window and significant interactions. Both underdosing and toxicity can be catastrophic to the patient. Patients with complex mental health illnesses are more at risk of head and neck cancers due to the high prevalence of associated risk factors, including smoking, diet, and alcohol. These patients also face barriers to accessing and using healthcare and may not tolerate procedures for artificial routes for feeding and medications. As the disease progresses, these patients are vulnerable to clozapine toxicity from factors such as constipation, reduction in cigarette smoking, weight loss, and medication interactions. Conversely, they also risk underdosing with a relapse of distressing psychotic symptoms as the swallow deteriorates. This case highlights the need for considerate planning, prescribing, close monitoring, and awareness alongside the importance of multidisciplinary working when caring for this patient group.

### Esophageal cancer: Challenges, concerns, and recommendations for management amidst the COVID-19 pandemic [^1129PqVJ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

According to a few experts, patients with advanced disease, but without symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection, should ideally continue with their planned radiotherapy sessions to achieve symptom palliation. Additionally, when palliative care has been administered, forced quarantine, as imposed in most countries worldwide, should be supported by the respective team of internists and primary care specialists responsible for pain control and feeding route maintenance.

On the other hand, other physicians state that palliative medical treatments at home should ideally replace radiation therapy until the disease reaches a plateau point, especially in high-risk areas such as in Italy. EC patients with unresectable, obstructive tumors might benefit from endoscopic stent placement in order to facilitate oral feeding. Most importantly, expert panels, medical ethicists, and palliative support groups will play a vital role in facing these challenging issues given the pragmatic aspects of healthcare resources available during this ongoing viral pandemic.

### ASO author reflections: Safety of performing esophageal cancer surgery during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe: A multicenter study [^114sSBpR]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

The international, multicenter cohort study assessed the safety of continuing esophageal cancer surgery by comparing the rate of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation between a COVID-19 cohort and a control cohort of patients undergoing elective esophageal cancer surgery. The rate of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation was comparable between both cohorts (13.7% in the COVID-19 cohort vs. 8.3% in the control cohort), as was the number of pulmonary complications (32.4% vs. 29.9%). Additionally, there was no difference in the overall 30-day mortality rate between both cohorts.

Preoperative history-taking and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing were used in all participating centers as screening methods, and no patients tested positive for COVID-19 pre- or postoperatively. Seventy-five percent of all esophagectomies were performed minimally invasive. Our study did not assess the COVID-19 presence among surgical staff; however, as no patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 pre- or postoperatively, minimally invasive surgery could be used safely.

The results of the study provide evidence for the safety of continuing elective esophageal cancer surgery, and potentially all other major cancer surgeries, during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic under the condition that a secure screening protocol is in place for patients undergoing esophageal cancer surgery.
