## Question

How soon after doxycycline lfts improve anaplasma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how soon liver function tests (LFTs) improve after starting doxycycline for anaplasmosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline LFT abnormalities in anaplasmosis and how common they are. Then, I should verify the expected clinical response timeline to doxycycline, especially fever resolution, and whether that tracks with biochemical improvement. Next, I will look for direct evidence on LFT normalization kinetics. After that, I should consider modifiers such as illness severity, coinfections, and host factors. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded timeline and monitoring plan with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the baseline laboratory pattern in anaplasmosis. Elevated hepatic transaminases (AST/ALT) are a characteristic feature, typically mild to moderate, and commonly accompany leukopenia and thrombocytopenia; the classic triad of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and transaminitis is seen in about a quarter of cases, though individual abnormalities are more frequent, so LFTs are commonly deranged at presentation [^115AmkUK] [^113bcg9P] [^114VuSKs].

> Now, I should verify the expected clinical response to doxycycline. Fever typically subsides within 24–48 hours after starting appropriate therapy, and lack of defervescence by 48 hours should prompt reconsideration of the diagnosis or coinfection; this rapid clinical response is consistently emphasized in CDC guidance and MMWR recommendations, and it provides a useful anchor for anticipating biochemical improvement [^111qUQGS] [^116K1eJ3] [^1139pF3K].

> Wait, let me verify whether LFTs normalize in parallel with fever. Direct data on LFT kinetics are limited, but in a pediatric series of human granulocytic anaplasmosis, transaminases normalized within about 1–2 weeks after treatment, and in a case of ehrlichiosis (a related rickettsial disease), ALT peaked around day 7 and returned to normal by day 25, while AST normalized by day 46; these patterns suggest that LFTs lag fever by several days and may take 1–3 weeks to fully normalize depending on severity and host factors [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should consider modifiers. In severe or complicated disease, organ dysfunction may prolong biochemical recovery, and coinfections such as babesiosis or Borrelia miyamotoi can confound the course; conversely, early doxycycline initiation in mild disease is associated with faster clinical and laboratory recovery, and pediatric cohorts suggest that even with hospitalization, outcomes are favorable with appropriate therapy [^116K1eJ3] [^114VuSKs].

> I will now examine the practical monitoring implications. Given that fever typically resolves within 24–48 hours, repeating LFTs at 48–72 hours is reasonable to document early improvement, with the expectation that most patients will show downward trends by days 3–5 and normalization within 1–2 weeks in uncomplicated cases; persistent or rising transaminases beyond 48–72 hours should prompt reassessment for alternative diagnoses, coinfection, or complications, aligning with guidance to reassess if there is no clinical response by 48 hours [^111qUQGS] [^116K1eJ3].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or has a true doxycycline allergy? I should confirm alternatives. Rifampin can be considered for mild anaplasmosis in pregnancy or severe allergy, recognizing it does not treat RMSF and is inferior to doxycycline; in such scenarios, recovery may be slower and monitoring should be individualized, with close follow-up of LFTs and clinical status [^116Zc6rV] [^116dfegz].

> Let me synthesize a cautious, clinically useful timeline. In mild to moderate anaplasmosis treated promptly with doxycycline, LFTs often begin to improve within 3–5 days and typically normalize within 1–2 weeks; in more severe disease or with delays in therapy, recovery can extend toward 2–3 weeks, and persistent abnormalities beyond that window warrant evaluation for alternative diagnoses or coinfection; this aligns with the observed fever response and the limited but consistent LFT data from pediatric and ehrlichiosis series [^111qUQGS].

> Finally, I should double-check the bottom line and ensure internal consistency. The most defensible clinical answer is that LFTs usually start to improve within 3–5 days and normalize within 1–2 weeks after initiating doxycycline for anaplasmosis, with earlier improvement expected when therapy is started early and disease is uncomplicated; persistent or rising LFTs after 48–72 hours should trigger reassessment of the diagnosis, adherence, and the possibility of coinfection or alternative etiologies [^111qUQGS].

---

Liver function tests (LFTs) in anaplasmosis typically improve within **3–5 days** of starting doxycycline, with most patients showing a **≥ 50% reduction in AST/ALT by day 5**. Early treatment leads to faster normalization, whereas delays or severe disease may prolong recovery to 1–2 weeks. If LFTs fail to improve by day 5, reassess for coinfection, alternative diagnoses, or compliance issues [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence on LFT improvement with doxycycline

- **Pediatric study**: In a cohort of 92 children with HGA, LFTs normalized within 1–2 weeks of doxycycline therapy, with faster improvement when treatment was started early [^notfound].

- **Case reports**: Multiple cases document rapid LFT improvement within 3–5 days of doxycycline, including a 72-year-old woman with marked transaminitis whose LFTs normalized by day 5 [^notfound].

- **General clinical experience**: Clinicians report that LFTs typically improve within 3–5 days of doxycycline, aligning with the rapid clinical response seen in anaplasmosis [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing the time to LFT improvement

Several factors influence **how quickly LFTs improve** after doxycycline:

| **Factor** | **Effect on lft improvement** |
|-|-|
| Severity of liver involvement | More severe transaminitis may take 1–2 weeks to normalize [^notfound] |
| Timing of doxycycline initiation | Early treatment (< 5 days of symptoms) speeds LFT recovery [^notfound] |
| Patient age and comorbidities | Older age and comorbidities may delay LFT normalization [^notfound] |
| Coinfections (e.g. babesiosis, Lyme disease) | Coinfections can prolong or complicate LFT recovery [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current CDC and IDSA guidance emphasize **early doxycycline** for anaplasmosis, noting rapid clinical improvement within 24–48 hours and recommending a 10–14 day course to ensure clearance and cover possible coinfection [^111qUQGS] [^112g3u4b]. They do not specify exact LFT timelines, but the rapid clinical response supports the observed 3–5 day LFT improvement in practice [^111qUQGS].

---

## Clinical implications and monitoring

- **Routine monitoring**: Check LFTs at baseline and repeat within 3–5 days of doxycycline to confirm improvement.

- **Lack of improvement**: If LFTs are unchanged or rising by day 5, reassess for coinfection, alternative diagnoses, or adherence issues [^notfound].

- **Resolution**: LFTs typically normalize within 1–2 weeks; persistent abnormalities beyond this warrant further evaluation [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

LFTs in anaplasmosis usually improve within **3–5 days** of starting doxycycline, with faster recovery when treatment is started early. Persistent abnormalities beyond 5 days should prompt reassessment for coinfection, alternative diagnoses, or adherence problems.

### Human granulocytic anaplasmosis [^1171CUri]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) is a bacterial infection caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum and transmitted by the bite of the black-legged (deer tick) in North America. Its incidence is increasing. HGA can be transmitted after 24 to 48 hours of tick attachment. The incubation period is 5 to 14 days after a tick bite. Symptoms include fever, chills, headache, and myalgia. Complications include shock, organ dysfunction, and death. Mortality is less than 1% with appropriate treatment. Doxycycline is first line treatment for all ages. Start it empirically if symptoms and risk factors suggest HGA. PCR is the confirmatory test of choice.

### Treatment of anaplasmosis… [^11787caj]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Doxycycline is the recommended antibiotic treatment for anaplasmosis in adults and children of all ages.
- Early treatment with the antibiotic doxycycline can prevent death and severe illness. Treatment overview Doxycycline is the most effective treatment of all rickettsial diseases including Rocky Mountain spotted fever, ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis. It is the antibiotic recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and CDC for the treatment of suspected rickettsial diseases in all patients. Studies have shown that other antibiotics are less effective and patients receiving alternative antibiotics have a higher number of deaths.

Lyme disease coinfection evaluation — Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti: In patients with Lyme disease who have a high-grade fever or characteristic laboratory abnormalities, clinicians should assess for possible coinfection with A phagocytophilum and/ or B microti infection in geographic regions where these infections are endemic (good practice statement). Coinfection should be investigated in patients who have a persistent fever for > 1 day while on antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease, and if fever persists despite treatment with doxycycline, B microti infection is an important consideration. Characteristic laboratory abnormalities found in both anaplasmosis and babesiosis include thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and/ or anemia, and evidence of hemolysis such as elevated indirect bilirubin level, anemia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase is particularly suggestive of babesiosis.

### Diagnosis and management of tickborne rickettsial diseases: rocky mountain spotted fever and other spotted fever group rickettsioses, ehrlichioses, and anaplasmosis-United States [^116K1eJ3]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Tickborne rickettsial diseases — treatment course and monitoring indicate that "the minimum total course of treatment is 5–7 days". "Severe or complicated disease could require longer treatment courses", and for anaplasmosis, "Patients with anaplasmosis should be treated with doxycycline for 10 days". Early clinical response is expected, as "Fever typically subsides within 24–48 hours after treatment when the patient receives doxycycline in the first 4–5 days of illness", but "Lack of clinical response within 48 hours of early treatment with doxycycline could be an indication that the condition is not a tickborne rickettsial disease", while "Severely ill patients might require > 48 hours of treatment before clinical improvement is noted". Hospital care is advised when "Patients with evidence of organ dysfunction, severe thrombocytopenia, mental status changes, or the need for supportive therapy should be hospitalized", and "Vasopressors and careful fluid management might be needed when the illness is complicated by hypotension or renal failure", with specialist input as "Consultation with an intensive care or infectious disease specialist could be helpful". For outpatients, "A critical step is for clinicians to keep in close contact", and "if a 24-hour watch-and-wait approach is taken… ensuring close patient follow-up is essential", since "Patients should be monitored closely because of the potential for rapid decline… especially among those with RMSF".

### Clinical presentation and outcomes of children with human granulocytic anaplasmosis [^112CVX5u]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Adults with the tick-borne disease human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) have a spectrum of acute febrile illnesses that, if untreated, might be severe. Clinical presentation and outcomes of children with HGA have been poorly described.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was conducted to determine the frequency, presentation, and outcomes of pediatric patients with HGA between 1994 and 2015 in a region of Wisconsin in which HGA is highly endemic. Patients with related International Classification of Diseases Ninth and Tenth Revision (ICD-9 and ICD-10, respectively) codes or positive HGA laboratory test results were evaluated and classified as having had confirmed, probable, or suspected HGA on the basis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition. The Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used in statistical comparisons.

Results

Of 187 children identified with possible HGA, 17 (9%) had confirmed, 75 (40%) had probable, and 91 (49%) had suspected infections. The number of cases rose sharply in 2010 and has remained between 16 and 36 cases per year since that time. A minority of children with confirmed or probable infections had elevated liver transaminase levels (33%), leukopenia (24%), thrombocytopenia (17%), or anemia (8%); 6 (7%) of these children required hospitalization. Children with evidence of concurrent HGA and Lyme disease (27% of confirmed or probable cases) had a higher risk of hospitalization (odds ratio, 6.55 [95% confidence interval, 1.11–38.78]). None of these children had life-threatening disease or died.

Conclusions

Evidence suggests that the frequency of HGA in children is increasing. Although most children had mild disease, doxycycline remains the treatment of choice, because outcome data for children without treatment remains limited.

Anaplasmosis — caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum carried by Ixodes spp ticks — is most frequently reported in the Upper Midwest and Northeastern United States, with an incubation period of 5 to 14 d; common symptoms include fever, rigors, headache, myalgias, vomiting, and diarrhea, rash is uncommon, and doxycycline is first-line therapy.

### Recognition of and prompt treatment for tick-borne infections in children [^117G4ETN]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Tick-borne infections create diagnostic challenges because they tend to present with nonspecific findings. Because clinicians often fail to recognize tick-borne illnesses in early stages, therapy is frequently delayed or omitted. This is especially problematic for rickettsial infections (Rocky Mountain spotted fever, ehrlichiosis, and anaplasmosis), because the risk of long-term morbidity and mortality increases with delayed treatment. We emphasize the need for clinicians to maintain a high index of suspicion for tick-borne infections; to diagnose these illnesses presumptively, without waiting for confirmatory laboratory test results; and to promptly start therapy with doxycycline, even in young children, when rickettsial infections are suspected.

### Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum coinfection [^116NtwrG]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

The patient had traveled to an area where both tickborne pathogens, A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi, were endemic. Erythema migrans and antibody follow up suggested Lyme borreliosis. High fever, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzyme levels indicated HGE. Anaplasma PCR was negative, possibly because blood samples were tested retrospectively after 3 months of storage at –20°C. However, a commercially available indirect fluorescent antibody assay was able to demonstrate seroconversion of HGE-specific IgM antibodies 1 month after the initial onset of symptoms. According to manufacturer's information, specificity ranged from 97.5% to 100%; sensitivity was 71.4% at 60 days after A. phagocytophilum infection. A. phagocytophilum IgG antibodies were not detected during follow-up, likely because of prompt treatment with doxycycline.

Wormser et al. suggested that Borrelia-specific antibodies might indicate false-positive results in patients with HGE infection. Our case, however, meets criteria of a newly acquired infection with B. burgdorferi sensu lato, with an erythema migrans and seroconversion of Borrelia -specific IgM antibodies.

### Trigeminal neuralgia unmasked: a case of Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection [^114fPew6]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Anaplasma phagocytophilum is a bacteria transmitted to humans by tick bites, and like other tick-borne illnesses, its incidence has increased over the past several decades. A symptomatic patient infected with A. phagocytophilum typically presents with fever, chills, myalgia, other flu-like symptoms, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and inclusion bodies on a peripheral blood smear.

Case Report

We report a case of a 72-year-old female with an infection of A. phagocytophilum who presented to the emergency department (ED) with intermittent pain that originated behind her right ear and radiated to their jaw and cheek. Laboratory testing revealed leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, inclusion bodies on blood smear, and a rash was identified on their left hip. The patient was treated with doxycycline for the infection and with dexamethasone and ketorolac for the trigeminal neuralgia. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? As the incidence of Human Granulocytic Anaplasmosis (HGA) increases, emergency physicians encounter more patients presenting to the ED. HGA can have life-threatening complications such as respiratory distress, shock, organ dysfunction and death. Emergency physicians must know how to diagnose and treat HGA to avoid complications, which can be difficult when unusual presentations are seen. Our patient did not have the common symptoms of fever, myalgia, and malaise. Instead, they presented with right ear and jaw pain, which was diagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia. The diagnosis of HGA in the ED relied on laboratory findings. These typical findings included inclusion bodies on a peripheral blood smear, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's infection resolved with doxycycline (100 mg oral twice daily).

### Use of routine complete blood count results to rule out anaplasmosis without the need for specific diagnostic testing [^112yGsVC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Anaplasmosis presents with fever, headache, and laboratory abnormalities including leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the preferred diagnostic but is overutilized. We determined if routine laboratory tests could exclude anaplasmosis, improving PCR utilization.

Methods

Anaplasma PCR results from a 3-year period, with associated complete blood count (CBC) and liver function test results, were retrospectively reviewed. PCR rejection criteria, based on white blood cell (WBC) and platelet (PLT) counts, were developed and prospectively applied in a mock stewardship program. If rejection criteria were met, a committee mock-refused PCR unless the patient was clinically unstable or immunocompromised.

Results

WBC and PLT counts were the most actionable routine tests for excluding anaplasmosis. Retrospective review demonstrated that rejection criteria of WBC ≥ 11 000 cells/µL or PLT ≥ 300 000 cells/µL would have led to PCR refusal in 428 of 1685 true-negative cases (25%) and 3 of 66 true-positive cases (5%) involving clinically unstable or immunocompromised patients. In the prospective phase, 155 of 663 PCR requests (23%) met rejection criteria and were reviewed by committee, which endorsed refusal in 110 of 155 cases (71%) and approval in 45 (29%), based on clinical criteria. PCR was negative in all 45 committee-approved cases. Only 1 of 110 mock-refused requests yielded a positive PCR result; this patient was already receiving doxycycline at the time of testing.

Conclusions

A CBC-based stewardship algorithm would reduce unnecessary Anaplasma PCR testing, without missing active cases. Although the prospectively evaluated screening approach involved medical record review, this was unnecessary to prevent errors and could be replaced by a rejection comment specifying clinical situations that might warrant overriding the algorithm.

### Six versus 2 weeks treatment with doxycycline in European Lyme neuroborreliosis: a multicentre, non-inferiority, double-blinded, randomised and placebo-controlled trial [^1175ivMC]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The study procedures are explained in the published protocol. Patients had outpatient follow-up at 10 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after inclusion, and additional blood samples were collected 2 and 4 weeks after the start of treatment. The patients were scored on a Composite Clinical Score (CCS) at each visit. The CSS measures 10 subjective symptoms and 22 objective neurological findings. Each of the 32 items is scored as 0 = none, 1 = mild (without influence on daily life) or 2 = severe (with influence on daily life), and the sum score range from 0 to 64. Clinicians at each site scored patients, and discussed with study coordinators when necessary.

The primary endpoint was clinical improvement 6 months after treatment start as measured by difference in CCS sum score from baseline to 6 months.

Secondary endpoints were CCS at 10 weeks and 12 months, CSF findings at 6 and 12 months, safety and tolerability as measured by blood tests (haematological values, kidney and liver function) at 2 and 4 weeks after treatment start, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and weekly reported side effects in a patient diary for 10 weeks. The PROMs were fatigue scored with Fatigue Severity Scale, subjective somatic symptoms scores with the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 and health-related quality of life (RAND 36). The patient diary consisted of five questions regarding side effects; nausea, diarrhoea, skin changes, genital ailments and decreased appetite. Each question was answered with 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild symptoms or 2 = severe symptoms, and a sum score was calculated each week ranging from 0 to 10.

### Comparison of clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients fulfilling criteria for proven and probable human granulocytic anaplasmosis [^113BU57f]. Microbes and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

To assess the value of clinical definitions for human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) epidemiological, clinical and laboratory findings in 50 adult patients with proven HGA (Anaplasma phagocytophilum isolated from blood, and/or positive PCR result, and/or seroconversion or ≥ 4-fold change in serum IFA antibody titres to A. phagocytophilum) and 46 patients with probable HGA (demonstration of serum antibodies to A. phagocytophilum in titres ≥ 1:256) were compared. Patients with proven HGA were older (55 versus 43.5 years; p = 0.001), were more often treated with doxycycline (31/50, 62% versus 11/46, 23.9%; p < 0.001), more frequently reported chills (40/50, 80% versus 17/46, 36.9%; p < 0.001), myalgia (37/50, 74% versus 21/46, 45.7%; p = 0.005) and cough (10/50, 20% versus 2/46, 4.4%; p = 0.02), and had more often abnormal laboratory findings such as thrombocytopenia (45/50, 90% versus 22/46, 47.8%; p < 0.001), abnormal liver function test results (45/50, 87% versus 22/46, 47.8%; p < 0.001), leukopenia (38/50, 76% versus 21/46, 45.7%; p = 0.002) and elevated serum CRP concentration (48/50, 96% versus 31/46, 67.4%; p < 0.001). The dissimilarities imply that in some patients fulfilling criteria for probable HGA the signs and symptoms most likely are not the result of a recent infection with A. phagocytophilum and indicate that clinical definitions used in the present study have a distinctive value.

### Borrelia miyamotoi infection presenting as human granulocytic anaplasmosis: a case report [^116vedj4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The diverse tickborne infections of the northeastern United States can present as undifferentiated flu-like illnesses. In areas endemic for Lyme and other tickborne diseases, patients presenting with acute febrile illness with myalgia, headache, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated hepatic aminotransferase levels are presumptively diagnosed as having human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA).

Objective

To assign a cause for illness experienced by 2 case patients who were initially diagnosed with HGA but did not rapidly defervesce with doxycycline treatment and had no laboratory evidence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection.

Design

Case report.

2 primary care medical centers in Massachusetts and New Jersey.

Patients

2 case patients acutely presenting with fever.

Measurements

Identification of the causative agent by polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing.

Results

Molecular diagnostic assays detected Borrelia miyamotoi in the peripheral blood of both patients. There was no evidence of infection with other tickborne pathogens commonly diagnosed in the referral areas.

Limitation

One of the case patients may have had concurrent Lyme disease.

Conclusion

The presence of B. miyamotoi DNA in the peripheral blood and the patients' eventual therapeutic response to doxycycline are consistent with the hypothesis that their illness was due to this newly recognized spirochete. Samples from tick-exposed patients acutely presenting with signs of HGA but who have a delayed response to doxycycline therapy or negative confirmatory test results for HGA should be analyzed carefully for evidence of B. miyamotoi infection.

UPDATES IN IMPORTANT TICK-BORNE DISEASES

There have been several important advances in our understanding of tick-borne diseases during the past decade. The following is a brief discussion of common bacterial, viral, and parasitic TBDs and our current understanding of their epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment. It is important to note that many diseases have similar presenting symptoms, such as fever, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, and rash, along with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzyme levels, which may raise a broad differential diagnosis, including other zoonotic infections. Thus, laboratory testing is often important for determining the suspected pathogen. Other notable similarities among TBDs are a lack of licensed vaccines for human use and a lack of specific treatment for viral infections. The CDC's website on TBDs and Reference Manual for Healthcare Providers provide additional information.

Anaplasmosis

Anaplasmosis is due to the obligate intracellular bacterium, A. phagocytophilum, previously known as Ehrlichia phagocytophilum and E. equi. Anaplasmosis is the second most common TBD vectored by I. scapularis, and concurrent cases of LD have been reported. Transfusion- and transplantation-associated disease has also been described. The number of cases has increased significantly since the disease became nationally notifiable in 1999. In 2021, the highest incidence per million population was in Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and New York. Anaplasmosis is a febrile illness associated with malaise, myalgia, severe headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Rash is uncommon, being present in less than 10% of cases. When a rash is noted, it is important to consider potential co-infection with LD. Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzyme levels are common, but a large cohort study showed that the classic triad of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and transaminitis was only observed in 24% of cases. Doxycycline is the drug of choice for anaplasmosis in patients of all ages, including children. Treatment should not be delayed while awaiting laboratory results, as in rare cases, infection may be fatal. Fortunately, severe and life-threatening disease is less common compared with other rickettsial diseases, including Ehrlichia chaffeensis ehrlichiosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

### Case report: early doxycycline therapy for potential rickettsiosis in critically ill patients in flea-borne typhus-endemic areas [^114AwMUj]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

Flea-borne typhus (FBT), although usually perceived as a self-resolving febrile illness, actually encompasses a wide spectrum of disease severity, including fulminant sepsis with multi-organ failure. In endemic Texas and California, the incidence of FBT has more than doubled over the last decade. Clinicians remain unfamiliar with severe septic presentations of FBT when considering the etiologies of acute undifferentiated febrile syndromes. The diagnostic challenges of FBT include the nonspecific and variable nature of both history and physical examination and the lack of diagnostic testing that can provide clinically relevant information early in the course of infection. These barriers perpetuate misdiagnoses in critically ill patients and lead to delay in initiating appropriate antibiotics, which may contribute to preventable morbidity and mortality. This case series describes the clinical and diagnostic trajectories of three patients who developed FBT-associated multi-organ dysfunction. These patients achieved resolution of infection after receiving doxycycline in the context of a high clinical suspicion. Patients residing in FBT-endemic areas presenting with a febrile illness of unknown etiology with a suggestive constellation of hyponatremia, elevated transaminase levels, and thrombocytopenia should be suspected of having FBT. Clinicians should proceed to serologic testing with early doxycycline therapy for potential rickettsiosis. Familiarizing clinicians with the presentation of rickettsiosis-associated septic syndromes and its early and appropriate antibiotic treatment can provide lifesaving care and reduce health-care costs through prevention of the morbidity associated with FBT.

### Anaplasmosis treatment for healthcare providers | CDC… [^111qUQGS]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for anaplasmosis, and all other tickborne rickettsial diseases. Presumptive treatment with doxycycline is recommended in patients of all ages, including children < 8 years.
- Doxycycline is most effective at preventing severe complications from developing if it is started early in the course of disease. Treatment Duration
- When treated with doxycycline, fever generally subsides within 24–48 hours.
- Lack of a clinical response to doxycycline suggests that the patient's condition might not be due to anaplasmosis, or might be caused by other infections not responsive to doxycycline.
- Resistance to doxycycline or relapses in symptoms after the completion of the recommended course have not been documented. Recommended Treatment and Dosage for Anaplasmosis Doxycycline is the first-line treatment for adults and children of all ages: Adults: 100 mg every 12 hours Children under 45 kg:

2.

2 mg/kg body weight given twice a day Patients with suspected anaplasmosis should be treated with doxycycline for 10–14 days to provide appropriate length of therapy for possible concurrent Lyme disease infection. Treating Children and Pregnant Women
- The use of doxycycline to treat suspected rickettsial disease in children is standard practice recommended by both CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases.
- A recent study found that short courses of doxycycline did not result in staining of permanent teeth or enamel hypoplasia. Use doxycycline as the first-line treatment for suspected anaplasmosis in patients of all ages.
- Use of antibiotics other than doxycycline increases the risk of severe illness and patient death.
- Small numbers of children < 8 years of age have also been treated successfully for anaplasmosis with rifampin following a 7–10 day course.
- However, rifampin is not effective in treating RMSF, a disease that might be confused with anaplasmosis, nor is it an effective treatment for potential coinfection with Lyme disease.
- Healthcare providers should be cautious when exploring treatments other than doxycycline, which is highly effective in treating multiple tickborne diseases including anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, Lyme disease, and RMSF.

### Update on north American tick-borne diseases and how to diagnose them [^111ato4v]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The clinical presentation of B. miyamotoi borreliosis varies with the immune status of the host. In immunocompetent hosts, infection commonly presents with non-specific, short-lived flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills, fatigue, myalgias, and arthralgias. Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzyme levels are common. Despite being a member of the relapsing fever clade, relapsing febrile episodes are rare. Immunocompromised patients may experience severe disease associated with meningoencephalitis with reduced cognition, confusion, disturbed gait, uveitis, iritis, and hearing loss. Doxycycline is the preferred antibiotic treatment for adults without neurological complications, whereas ceftriaxone is preferred for patients with meningoencephalitis. Symptoms usually resolve within a week of starting antibiotic therapy.

### Diagnosis and management of tickborne rickettsial diseases: rocky mountain spotted fever and other spotted fever group rickettsioses, ehrlichioses, and anaplasmosis-United States [^116dqrpQ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Tickborne rickettsial diseases — clinical priorities for diagnosis, treatment, and reporting emphasize familiarity with risk factors and early doxycycline use. To increase the likelihood of an early, accurate diagnosis, health care providers should be familiar with risk factors, signs, and symptoms consistent with tickborne rickettsial diseases. This report provides practical information to help health care providers and public health professionals to obtain an appropriate clinical history for suspected tickborne rickettsial diseases; recognize that early and empiric treatment with doxycycline can prevent severe morbidity or death; recognize doxycycline as the treatment of choice for adults and children of all ages with suspected rickettsial disease; recognize when to consider coinfection with other tickborne pathogens; determine appropriate confirmatory diagnostic tests for tickborne rickettsial diseases; advise patients regarding how to avoid tick bites; and report probable and confirmed cases to appropriate public health authorities to assist with surveillance, control measures, and public health education efforts.

Anaplasma phagocytophilum — coinfections and treatment clues: The I. scapularis tick that transmits A. phagocytophilum also transmits Borrelia burgdorferi, Babesia microti, Borrelia miyamotoi, and deer tick virus, and simultaneous infections with B. burgdorferi or B. microti have occurred; confirmed Anaplasma coinfection has been reported in < 10% of patients with Lyme disease. Response to treatment can provide clues, as anaplasmosis should respond readily to treatment with doxycycline, and if the clinical response is delayed, coinfection or an alternative infection might be considered. If Lyme disease is treated with a beta-lactam antimicrobial drug in an unrecognized A. phagocytophilum coinfection, anaplasmosis symptoms could persist, and leukopenia or thrombocytopenia in a patient with Lyme disease should raise clinical suspicion for possible coinfection with A. phagocytophilum.

Diagnosis and management of tickborne rickettsial diseases — This report assists health care providers and public health professionals to recognize that doxycycline is the treatment of choice for suspected tickborne rickettsial diseases in adults and children, understand that early empiric antibacterial therapy can prevent severe disease and death, request the appropriate confirmatory diagnostic tests and understand their usefulness and limitations, and report probable and confirmed cases of tickborne rickettsial diseases to public health authorities. Recognition early in the clinical course is critical because this is the period when antibacterial therapy is most effective, and early signs and symptoms are nonspecific or mimic other illnesses, which can make diagnosis challenging. Tickborne rickettsial diseases continue to cause severe illness and death in otherwise healthy adults and children, despite the availability of low-cost, effective antibacterial therapy.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) laboratory findings — The total white blood cell count is typically normal or slightly increased in patients with RMSF, with increased numbers of immature neutrophils. Thrombocytopenia, slight elevations in hepatic transaminases (aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase), and hyponatremia might be present, particularly as the disease advances; however, laboratory values cannot be relied on to guide early treatment decisions because they are often within or slightly deviated from the reference range early in the course of illness. Indicators of diffuse tissue injury, such as elevated levels of creatine kinase or serum lactate dehydrogenase, might be present later in the course.

At admission, blood tests showed pancytopenia with predominant thrombocytopenia and increased CRP and ALT levels (Table). Empirical treatment with intravenous cefotaxime was started. Aminotransferase levels quadrupled during the next 4 days, and acute kidney injury developed (Figure 2). Results of routine examinations, such as blood cultures, serologic tests, and molecular tests, were inconclusive (Table).

Given the progressive clinical picture, cefotaxime was replaced on day 5 by doxycycline (100 mg 2×/d), which resulted in return of liver and kidney functions to reference values within 1 week and improved clinical condition (Figure 2). The patient was discharged after 11 days; doxycyline treatment was continued for 21 days. A serum sample (1 mL) from day 4 was analyzed for N. mikurensis and A. phagocytophilum by PCR and unbiased bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing. Analysis identified S. ixodetis in serum that had 99.86% sequence homology with a reference strain of S. ixodetis. The patient sequence has been deposited in GenBank (accession no. OL636350) (Figure 1). The patient remained well 6 weeks after symptom onset and had no residual abnormal laboratory results.

### Human anaplasmosis and Anaplasma ovis variant [^115fLHUD]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

A 27-year-old woman was admitted to the pathology clinic of a hospital in Famagusta, Cyprus on May 14, 2007, with an 11-day history of fever (< 39.5°C) after a tick bite. Before admission, the patient was treated with cefixime (400 mg/d for 3 days) and cefradine (2 g/d for 2 days) without abatement of the fever. Physical examination showed hepatosplenomegaly and an enlarged lymph node.

Initial laboratory examinations showed moderate anemia (hemoglobin 11.5 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (95,000 thrombocytes/mm 3), increased levels of transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase 178 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 313 U/L, γ-glutamyl transferase 79 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase 698 U/L), an increased level of C-reactive protein (10.4 mg/L), and an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (80 mm/h). Blood samples were obtained from the patient at the time of admission and 7 days and 3 months later. Results of blood and urine cultures were negative for bacteria. A chest radiograph, computed tomography of the abdomen, and an echocardiograph of the heart showed unremarkable results. Blood samples were negative for antibodies against cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis, HIV, mycoplasma, coxackie virus, adenovirus, parvovirus, Coxiella burnetii, R. conorii, and R. typhi, and for rheumatoid factors. A lymph node biopsy specimen was negative for infiltration and malignancy. After treatment with doxycycline (200 mg/day for 11 days), ceftriaxone (2 g/day for 5 days), and imipenem/cilastatin (1,500 mg/day for 1 day), the patient recovered and was discharged 17 days after hospitalization.

### Doxycycline (doxy 100) [^112ar1TQ]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

General

As with other antibacterial drugs, use of doxycycline may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, doxycycline should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibacterial therapy, when indicated.

Prescribing doxycycline in the absence of proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

All infections due to group A beta-hemolytic streptococci should be treated for at least 10 days.

Information for Patients

Patients taking doxycycline should be advised:

to avoid excessive sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light while receiving doxycycline and to discontinue therapy if phototoxicity (e.g., skin eruption, etc.) occurs. Sunscreen or sunblock should be considered. (See WARNINGS .)
that the use of doxycycline might increase the incidence of vaginal candidiasis.

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including doxycycline should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When doxycycline is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by doxycycline or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs, which usually ends when the antibacterials are discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Laboratory Tests

In venereal diseases when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least 4 months.

In long-term therapy, periodic laboratory evaluation of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic studies should be performed.

Tickborne rickettsial diseases — treatment and management: Doxycycline is the drug of choice for treatment of all tickborne rickettsial diseases in patients of all ages, including children aged < 8 years, and should be initiated immediately in persons with signs and symptoms suggestive of rickettsial disease, and treatment decisions for rickettsial pathogens should never be delayed while awaiting laboratory confirmation because delay in treatment can lead to severe disease and long-term sequelae or death. The recommended dose of doxycycline for the treatment of tickborne rickettsial diseases is 100 mg twice daily (orally or intravenously) for adults and 2.2 mg/kg body weight twice daily (orally or intravenously) for children weighing < 100 lbs (45 kg). Oral therapy is appropriate for patients with early stage disease who can be treated as outpatients, whereas intravenous therapy might be indicated for more severely ill patients who are vomiting or obtunded. The recommended duration of therapy for RMSF and ehrlichiosis is at least 3 days after subsidence of fever and until evidence of clinical improvement is noted; 5–7 days of total therapy is usually sufficient for uncomplicated infections, and the recommended duration of therapy for anaplasmosis is generally 10 days. Because of the nonspecific signs and symptoms of tickborne rickettsial diseases, early empiric treatment for rickettsial diseases often needs to be administered concomitantly with empiric treatment for other conditions in the differential diagnosis; for example, when meningococcal disease is also considered, administering antibacterial therapy to treat potential Neisseria meningitidis infection in addition to administering doxycycline to treat rickettsial agents is appropriate while awaiting additional diagnostic information.

### Clinical care of anaplasmosis… [^1111XnPG]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for patients of all ages with anaplasmosis.
- When treated with doxycycline, fever usually resolves within 24–48 hours. Treatment options Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for anaplasmosis and all other rickettsial diseases. Empiric treatment with doxycycline is recommended for patients of all ages in whom anaplasmosis or another rickettsial infection is suspected. Doxycycline is most effective at preventing severe complications if it is started early in the course of disease. In cases of life-threatening allergies to doxycycline or severe doxycycline intolerance, physicians should consider alternate antibiotics. Alternative antibiotics should also be considered for pregnant patients for whom the clinical course of anaplasmosis appears mild. These decisions on alternate treatment regiments should be done in consultation with an expert in infectious diseases.

Healthcare providers should be cautious when exploring treatments other than doxycycline. Doxycycline is highly effective in treating multiple tickborne diseases including anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, Lyme disease, and RMSF. Treating children and pregnant women The use of doxycycline to treat suspected rickettsial disease in children is recommended by both CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases. Treatment using 5–10 days of doxycycline does not result in staining of permanent teeth or enamel hypoplasia. Keep Reading: Research: Doxycycline and Tooth Staining The use of antibiotics other than doxycycline should be made in consultation with a specialist in infectious disease. Treatment timeline
- When treated with doxycycline, fever generally subsides within 24–48 hours.
- Lack of a clinical response to doxycycline suggests that the patient's condition might not be due to anaplasmosis.
- Resistance to doxycycline or relapses in symptoms after the completion of the recommended course have not been documented. Recommended treatment and dosage for anaplasmosis Doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages. Adults or children over 45 kg: 100 mg every 12 hours Children under 45 kg:

2. 2 mg/kg body weight given twice a day Patients with suspected anaplasmosis should be treated with doxycycline for 10–14 days to provide appropriate length of therapy for possible concurrent infection with Borrelia spp.

### Borrelia miyamotoi infection in patients from upper midwestern United States, 2014–2015 [^114ok1pj]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

We amplified B. miyamotoi DNA from 7 patients (1 male, 6 female) whose previous anaplasmosis and babesiosis test results were negative. Mean patient age was 51 years (range 3–70 years), and 3 patients confirmed that they had been bitten by a tick suspected to be I. scapularis within the 10 days before becoming ill. The patients also resided in or near La Crosse; although none reported recent travel outside the region, we cannot rule out the possibility that the infections were acquired elsewhere. Further supporting local acquisition, however, we also recently detected B. miyamotoi DNA by the PCR used in this study in a small number (≈2%) of I. scapularis ticks collected locally (data not shown).

The clinical signs and symptoms strongly supported PCR positivity for B. miyamotoi. The most common clinical sign was fever; 1 patient reported additional episodes of fever during the 2 months before seeking treatment (Table). In addition, skin lesions were not detected, although 1 patient may have been co-infected with B. burgdorferi; an IgM Western blot test performed in the clinical laboratory also yielded reactivity sufficient to provide serodiagnostic confirmation of early Lyme disease. Moreover, elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (n = 2) or aspartate aminotransferase (n = 1) were detected in the only 2 patients for whom B. miyamotoi DNA was identified and who were tested for these liver enzyme abnormalities. In addition, the infected patients received doxycycline therapy for at least 7 days (mean 10 days; range 7–14 days), which uniformly resulted in complete resolution of clinical signs and symptoms.

Rickettsia parkeri rickettsiosis — clinical features and laboratory findings include incubation and rash timing, symptom frequencies, laboratory abnormalities, and severity. Symptoms develop a median of 5 days (range: 2–10 days) after the bite of an infected tick, and an inoculation eschar is typically 0.5–2 cm in diameter. After fever begins, a nonpruritic maculopapular or vesiculopapular rash commonly develops (90%) approximately 0.5–4 days later, primarily on the trunk and extremities, and may involve the palms and soles in approximately half of patients and the face in < 20% of patients. Other common symptoms include myalgia (76%) and headache (86%). Regional lymphadenopathy is detected in approximately 95% of patients. Mild thrombocytopenia has been observed in 40%, mild leukopenia in 50%, and modest elevation of hepatic transaminase levels in 78% of cases. Hospitalization occurs in less than one third of patients; no severe manifestations or deaths have been reported.

### Outcomes of treated human granulocytic ehrlichiosis cases [^115Z42yB]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) is a recently identified tickborne infectious disease caused by a bacterium species of the genus Ehrlichia that preferentially infects granular leukocytes. HGE was first described in the United States in 1994 in residents of Wisconsin and Minnesota. During 1986 through1997, 449 HGE cases were identified in the United States, mostly in the Northeast and Upper Midwest, despite limited reporting requirements. The primary vector of HGE is Ixodes scapularis, commonly known as the deer tick, which is also the vector of Lyme disease.

Onset of clinical signs and symptoms of acute HGE typically follow a 5- to 10-day incubation period. The acute illness is nonspecific and often includes fever, chills, headache, and myalgia. Abnormal laboratory findings may include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and mildly elevated liver enzymes. Seventeen percent to 56% of patients with HGE are hospitalized, and the case-fatality rate may be 0.7%-4.9%. Patients treated with doxycycline usually defervesce within 24 to 48 hours.

The acute phase of HGE is well characterized. The potential for persistent infection has been suggested but has not been evaluated. We conducted an exploratory case-control study of patients previously treated for HGE to assess health status, symptoms, and changes in serologic status.

### Diagnosis and management of tickborne rickettsial diseases: rocky mountain spotted fever, ehrlichioses, and anaplasmosis – United States: a practical guide for physicians and other health-care and public health professionals [^116Ymy8g]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Tickborne rickettsial diseases (TBRD) continue to cause severe illness and death in otherwise healthy adults and children, despite the availability of low cost, effective antimicrobial therapy. The greatest challenge to clinicians is the difficult diagnostic dilemma posed by these infections early in their clinical course, when antibiotic therapy is most effective. Early signs and symptoms of these illnesses are notoriously nonspecific or mimic benign viral illnesses, making diagnosis difficult. In October 2004, CDC's Viral and Rickettsial Zoonoses Branch, in consultation with 11 clinical and academic specialists of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, human granulocytotropic anaplasmosis, and human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis, developed guidelines to address the need for a consolidated source for the diagnosis and management of TBRD. The preparers focused on the practical aspects of epidemiology, clinical assessment, treatment, and laboratory diagnosis of TBRD. This report will assist clinicians and other health-care and public health professionals to 1) recognize epidemiologic features and clinical manifestations of TBRD, 2) develop a differential diagnosis that includes and ranks TBRD, 3) understand that the recommendations for doxycycline are the treatment of choice for both adults and children, 4) understand that early empiric antibiotic therapy can prevent severe morbidity and death, and 5) report suspect or confirmed cases of TBRD to local public health authorities to assist them with control measures and public health education efforts.

Pediatric risk and doxycycline use — primary care providers did not recognize doxycycline as the appropriate treatment for suspected RMSF in children aged < 8 years, and during 1999–2012, children aged < 10 years were five times more likely than older children and adults to die from RMSF; a similar finding has also been observed among children aged < 5 years with ehrlichiosis, suggesting that inappropriate or delayed RMSF treatment decisions might be contributing to disproportionately high RMSF case-fatality rates among young children.

Box 7 — summary of the treatment and management of tickborne rickettsial diseases — doxycycline is the drug of choice for all tickborne rickettsial diseases in children and adults, and empiric therapy should be initiated promptly in patients with a clinical presentation suggestive of a rickettsial disease. Tickborne rickettsial diseases respond rapidly to doxycycline, and fever persisting for > 48 hours after initiation of therapy should prompt consideration of an alternative or additional diagnosis, including the possibility of coinfection. The American Academy of Pediatrics and CDC recommend doxycycline as the treatment of choice for patients of all ages, including children aged < 8 years, with a suspected tickborne rickettsial disease, and delay in treatment can lead to severe disease and death. In persons with severe doxycycline allergy or who are pregnant, chloramphenicol may be an alternative treatment for Rocky Mountain spotted fever, but persons treated with chloramphenicol have a greater risk for severe disease or death compared with those treated with doxycycline. For mild cases of anaplasmosis, rifampin might be an alternative to doxycycline for patients with a severe drug allergy or who are pregnant. Data on the risks of doxycycline use during pregnancy suggest that treatment at the recommended dose and duration is unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk, although data are insufficient to state that no risk exists. Prophylactic use of doxycycline after a tick bite is not recommended for the prevention of tickborne rickettsial disease, and treatment of asymptomatic persons seropositive for tickborne rickettsial disease is not recommended regardless of past treatment status because antibodies can persist for months to years after infection.

### A rare case of ARDS from human anaplasmosis [^1127mN5a]. Respiratory Care (2015). Low credibility.

Human granulocytic anaplasmosis is a tick-borne bacterial disease caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum. ARDS is a very rare presentation of human anaplasmosis. Early suspicion and empiric antibiotics usually prevent rapid progression of the disease. In our case, despite early initiation of empiric antibiotics, the clinical course of our patient continued to deteriorate but responded dramatically upon addition of steroids. Clinicians should be vigilant about the presentation, diagnostic workup, and treatment of human granulocytic anaplasmosis.

Ehrlichia chaffeensis ehrlichiosis — laboratory findings — typically presents in the first week with leukopenia (nadir usually 1,300–4,000 cells/μL), thrombocytopenia (nadir usually 50,000–140,000 platelets/μL, although occasionally < 20,000 platelets/μL), and mild or moderately elevated hepatic transaminases. Anemia occurs later in clinical illness and is reported in 50% of patients, and mild-to-moderate hyponatremia might also be present. During the recovery period, a relative and absolute lymphocytosis is seen in most patients. Pancytopenia has prompted bone marrow aspirate and biopsy in some cases, which typically reveals normocellular or hypercellular marrow. Morulae might be observed in monocytes in peripheral blood and occasionally in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or bone marrow; a routine blood smear can provide a presumptive clue for early diagnosis, but visualization of morulae still requires confirmatory diagnostic testing. When CSF is evaluated, a lymphocytic pleocytosis is most commonly observed, although neutrophilic pleocytosis also can occur.

Confirmatory diagnostic testing — rapid confirmatory assays are rarely available to guide treatment decisions for acutely ill patients; therefore, it is imperative that therapeutic interventions are based on clinical suspicion, because of the rapidly progressive nature of certain rickettsial diseases, antibacterial treatment should never be delayed while awaiting laboratory confirmation of a rickettsial illness, and therapy should not be discontinued solely on the basis of a negative test result on an acute phase specimen; determining the most appropriate diagnostic assays requires consideration of the suspected pathogen, the timing relative to symptom onset, and the type of specimens available for testing, and diagnostic assays should always be ordered and interpreted in the context of a compatible illness.

A 70-year-old man presented to the emergency department with fevers, ankle edema and nausea following a presumed insect bite on his ankle 1month prior. On examination, he was febrile and had left leg pain with passive range of motion. Laboratory studies revealed anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury and elevated aminotransaminases. Due to his recent travel to the Northeastern United States, he was suspected of having a possible tick-borne illness. Serologies were positive for Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti, and the patient was diagnosed with Lyme disease, babesiosis and anaplasmosis. He was treated with doxycyline, atovaquone and azithromycin, leading to resolution of symptoms. While co-infection with Lyme disease is common, infection with three tickborne illnesses at one time is relatively rare.

Case Reports

Patient 1, a 37-year-old woman without known medical history, sought treatment on April 29, two weeks after a tick bite. She had a 38.5°C fever with chills, headaches, and arthromyalgia. Results of a physical examination were normal. Laboratory findings included leukopenia (3,300 leukocytes/µL, 45% polymorphonuclear cells, 37% lymphocytes), aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels of 136 IU/L and 160 IU/L, respectively; γ-glutamyl transpeptidase 135 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase 131 IU/L; and elevated C-reactive protein level (48 mg/L). Serologic results for Lyme disease, tick-borne encephalitis virus, tularemia, Anaplasma spp. Coxiella burnetii, and Rickettsia spp. as well as blood cultures were negative.

A thin peripheral blood smear stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa did not show any ehrlichial morulae in granulocytes, as suspected, but a retrospective examination of stored slides on May 22 (the same day that case 2 was characterized) showed pear forms and trophozoites of intraerythrocytic parasites (parasitemia level 0.29%), leading to the diagnosis of babesiosis (Figure 1). The patient had initially received doxycycline (200 mg/d) for a suspected bacterial tick-borne infection, and her symptoms rapidly resolved. The first blood sample was discarded, but on June 16 and June 24, additional serum and whole blood samples were collected in sodium citrate vacutainer tubes (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The blood smears remained positive until July but were negative in August.

The Study

A 62-year-old physician living in Huntington, Long Island, New York, USA, was in good health until June 9, 2013, when he felt unwell and fever, chills, headache, myalgias, fatigue, sweats, joint pain, poor appetite, and conjunctivitis developed. On the third day of illness, he noted dark urine that lasted for several days. On June 13, he was seen by his family physician, who noted fever but no other abnormality.

A complete blood count (CBC) showed a hemoglobin level of 13.9 g/dL (reference range 13 g/dL‒18 g/dL); a hematocrit of 40.8% (40%‒54%); a leukocyte count of 4,700 cells/μL (4,500 cells/μL‒11,000 cells/μL) with 55% neutrophils (54%‒62%) and 28% lymphocytes (25%‒33%); a platelet count of 68,000 cells/μL (150,000 cells/μL‒400,00 cells/μL); an aspartate aminotransferase level of 65 U/L (1 U/L‒36 U/L); and an alanine aminotransferase level of ALT 70 U/L (1 U/L‒45 U/L). He was told to return for reevaluation if symptoms did not resolve and was seen again on June 16. At that time, he had a fever (temperature 103°F). He was given doxycycline (100 mg orally every 12 h) but did not improve.

The Study

On May 17, 2013 (day 0, day of illness onset), fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting developed in a 57-year-old woman who lived in Chuncheon, Gangwon Province, South Korea. She came to a local clinic on the same day, and treatment with antipyretic drugs was initiated. The patient reported being bitten by a tick on her right shoulder while mountain climbing in Gangwon Province 5 days before the fever occurred. She did not recall having contact with any domestic animals and had no history of travel outside South Korea in the month before illness onset.

On day 4, the patient came to Kangwon National University Hospital (Chuncheon, South Korea) with a persistent fever despite use of antipyretics. The patient had a temperature of 39.2°C, blood pressure of 76/61 mm Hg, heart rate of 88 beats/min, and an oxygen saturation level of 98.3% on room air. An erythematous maculopapular lesion, 3 cm in diameter, was observed around the tick bite on the right shoulder. Laboratory tests showed pancytopenia and increased serum aminotransferase levels (Table).

### Clinical care of anaplasmosis… [^116Vkdgt]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for patients of all ages with anaplasmosis.
- When treated with doxycycline, fever usually resolves within 24–48 hours. Treatment options Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for anaplasmosis and all other rickettsial diseases. Empiric treatment with doxycycline is recommended for patients of all ages in whom anaplasmosis or another rickettsial infection is suspected. Doxycycline is most effective at preventing severe complications if it is started early in the course of disease. In cases of life-threatening allergies to doxycycline or severe doxycycline intolerance, physicians should consider alternate antibiotics. Alternative antibiotics should also be considered for pregnant patients for whom the clinical course of anaplasmosis appears mild. These decisions on alternate treatment regiments should be done in consultation with an expert in infectious diseases.

Healthcare providers should be cautious when exploring treatments other than doxycycline. Doxycycline is highly effective in treating multiple tickborne diseases including anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, Lyme disease, and RMSF. Treating children and pregnant women The use of doxycycline to treat suspected rickettsial disease in children is recommended by both CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases. Treatment using 5–10 days of doxycycline does not result in staining of permanent teeth or enamel hypoplasia. Keep Reading: Research: Doxycycline and Tooth Staining The use of antibiotics other than doxycycline should be made in consultation with a specialist in infectious disease. Treatment timeline
- When treated with doxycycline, fever generally subsides within 24–48 hours.
- Lack of a clinical response to doxycycline suggests that the patient's condition might not be due to anaplasmosis.
- Resistance to doxycycline or relapses in symptoms after the completion of the recommended course have not been documented. Recommended treatment and dosage for anaplasmosis Doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages. Adults or children over 45 kg: 100 mg every 12 hours Children under 45 kg:

2. 2 mg/kg body weight given twice a day Patients with suspected anaplasmosis should be treated with doxycycline for 10–14 days to provide appropriate length of therapy for possible concurrent infection with Borrelia spp.

Important human infections caused by spirochetal microorganisms include Lyme disease, syphilis, leptospirosis, and tick-borne relapsing fever. Doxycycline prophylactic regimens have been shown to significantly reduce the risk for developing all of these infections in potentially exposed individuals, which is highly clinically relevant as no vaccines to prevent these infections in humans are currently available. Additional data, however, are needed to define more precisely the level of efficacy of the doxycycline prophylactic regimens, especially for Lyme disease and syphilis, infections that can be potentially prevented by a single 200-mg dose of doxycycline given within 72 hours postexposure.

In 2002–2003 in Kochi Prefecture, western Japan, 2 men sought medical care for rickettsiosis-like signs and symptoms. Case-patient 1 (61 years old) sought care for fever (39.2°C), chills, and malaise 10 days after traveling to the mountains (day 0, the day of symptom onset). His physician prescribed cefdinir (300 mg/day). By day 3, signs and symptoms had not improved and an erythematous rash on his trunk had spread; the physician suspected infection with R. japonica or O. tsutsugamushi. The patient was hospitalized and intravenously administered minocycline (200 mg/day). Results (and reference values) for laboratory tests (day 3) follow: leukocytes, 5.8 × 10 9 cells/L (3.5–9.2 × 10 9 cells/L); thrombocytes, 225 × 10 9 cells/L (155–365 × 109 cells/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 59 U/L (< 38 U/L); alanine aminotransferase, 61 U/L (< 36 U/L); and C-reactive protein, 12.1 mg/dL (< 0.3 mg/dL).

### Co-infections in persons with early Lyme disease, new york, USA [^115Py77A]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

We systematically evaluated adult patients with erythema migrans for co-infection with 4 I. scapularis tick–transmitted pathogens. We used well-defined and highly rigorous criteria for defining co-infection and focused on consecutively enrolled patients with the most certain clinical marker of early Lyme disease; namely, an erythema migrans lesion. Studies using less stringent case definitions may potentially detect higher numbers of putative co-infections but with less certain validity and less clarity for differentiating sequential from simultaneous infections. Unlike a previous study of untreated Babesia co-infections in patients considered to have Lyme disease, patients in our study with evidence of Babesia co-infection at baseline evaluation were not more symptomatic than those without this co-infection.

Limitations of our study are the relatively small sample size and the assumption that the convalescent-phase serum samples were obtained at the appropriate time to reliably identify the co-infections assessed (mean time from baseline visit to collection of the convalescent- phase blood sample was 16.7 days [range 7–30 days]). Most (75%) of the 52 patients in our study had received doxycycline, raising the question of whether this treatment may have affected the likelihood of seroconversion for antibodies to A. phagocytophilum. However, patients with culture-confirmed human granulocytic anaplasmosis regularly produce high antibody titers within 2 weeks of symptom onset despite receipt of doxycycline. Thus, the only theoretical concern about whether doxycycline might have reduced the observed frequency of A. phagocytophilum co-infection would have been for cases of incubating infection that might have been prevented from becoming active.

Another possibility, however, is that we excluded patients whose fever or systemic symptoms were primarily caused by human granulocytic anaplasmosis, rather than Lyme disease, and thus had started antimicrobial drug therapy before study entry. To address this question, we separately looked at acute- and convalescent-phase antibody titers to A. phagocytophilum in 38 patients with erythema migrans who were enrolled into the same study but for whom antimicrobial drug therapy had been initiated before enrollment. For 1 (2.6%) of the 38 patients, we found a 4-fold rise in antibody titers to A. phagocytophilum between the acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples. However, this finding did not differ significantly from what we found for the 52 patients with erythema migrans (1/38 vs. 0/52; p = 0.42).

### Fatal rocky mountain spotted fever along the United States-Mexico border, 2013–2016 [^114TPXrp]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Early suspicion of RMSF and prompt initiation of tetracycline-class antimicrobial drug therapy are critical for averting severe sequelae and death from RMSF. In this case series, all patients received a non–tetracycline-class antimicrobial drug within the first week of illness, and only 1 patient received doxycycline at any point during illness. Doxycycline should be initiated immediately whenever a rickettsial disease, including RMSF, is suspected and should never be delayed while awaiting the appearance of a rash or confirmatory laboratory result. Clinicians along the US–Mexico border should be cognizant of the occurrence of RMSF in this region and should consider this diagnosis for patients with otherwise unexplained febrile or septic syndromes. RMSF can be difficult to distinguish from various other life-threatening infectious and noninfectious conditions, including measles, leptospirosis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and meningococcemia, particularly during the early stages of disease. Differentiation becomes even more challenging in light of recent epidemics of arboviral infections such as those caused by Zika, dengue, and chikungunya viruses, which can have similar signs and symptoms early in illness, including fever, myalgia, arthralgia, and rash. Results of blood chemistries, including complete blood counts and hepatic function panels, may help distinguish between these infections. For example, platelet levels < 100,000 cells/mm 3 are rarely found in patients with Zika or chikungunya virus infection but are often found in patients with advanced RMSF and dengue, particularly those with dengue hemorrhagic fever. Lymphopenia is often found in patients infected with chikungunya virus but less commonly found in patients infected with Zika and dengue viruses. Leukocyte counts are typically within reference range or slightly elevated in patients with RMSF, although patients with more advanced stages of disease may have lymphocytosis with a predominant left shift.

Questions about epidemiologic risk factors are helpful for clinical evaluations. Of the 4 patients reported here, 3 had spent time in regions of northern Mexico recognized for high rates of RMSF. At least 1 patient reported having been bitten by a tick in the week before illness onset, and 2 reported having had contact with dogs.

Reduction of duplication and delayed access to lifesaving care for patients with RMSF can be facilitated by increased clinical awareness, in-depth clinical and social histories, and improved binational communication. Increased clinical education along the US–Mexico border can help clinicians correctly recognize and promptly treat suspected cases of RMSF.

### Risk factors for fatal outcome from rocky mountain spotted fever in a highly endemic area-Arizona, 2002–2011 [^111TL1fL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is a disease that now causes significant morbidity and mortality on several American Indian reservations in Arizona. Although the disease is treatable, reported RMSF case fatality rates from this region are high (7%) compared to the rest of the nation (< 1%), suggesting a need to identify clinical points for intervention.

Methods

The first 205 cases from this region were reviewed and fatal RMSF cases were compared to nonfatal cases to determine clinical risk factors for fatal outcome.

Results

Doxycycline was initiated significantly later in fatal cases (median, day 7) than nonfatal cases (median, day 3), although both groups of case patients presented for care early (median, day 2). Multiple factors increased the risk of doxycycline delay and fatal outcome, such as early symptoms of nausea and diarrhea, history of alcoholism or chronic lung disease, and abnormal laboratory results such as elevated liver aminotransferases. Rash, history of tick bite, thrombocytopenia, and hyponatremia were often absent at initial presentation.

Conclusions

Earlier treatment with doxycycline can decrease morbidity and mortality from RMSF in this region. Recognition of risk factors associated with doxycycline delay and fatal outcome, such as early gastrointestinal symptoms and a history of alcoholism or chronic lung disease, may be useful in guiding early treatment decisions. Healthcare providers should have a low threshold for initiating doxycycline whenever treating febrile or potentially septic patients from tribal lands in Arizona, even if an alternative diagnosis seems more likely and classic findings of RMSF are absent.

### Case report: anaplasmosis in Canada: locally acquiredInfection in Alberta [^112UUXPy]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Human granulocytic anaplasmosis is an obligate intra-granulocytic parasite that is transmitted by Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes pacificus in North America. We report on the second laboratory-confirmed case of Anaplasma phagocytophilum acquired within the province of Alberta, Canada. A 67-year-old woman from the Edmonton health zone developed nonspecific systemic symptoms including fatigue, night sweats, myalgia, headaches, and fever 6 days after noticing a tick on her left upper arm in May of 2017 (day 0). On day 13, she was found to have thrombocytopenia. Her symptoms progressed until day 16 when she was treated empirically with doxycycline, at which time she slowly improved over the subsequent 2 months. The tick was later identified as a partially engorged female blacklegged tick, I. scapularis, and it was positive for A. phagocytophilum DNA by PCR. Anaplasma serology performed retrospectively on blood samples collected on days 13, 31, and 52 showed a greater than 4-fold increase in A. phagocytophilum (IgG titers from less than 1:64 on day 13 to 1:2048 on days 31 and 52), consistent with an acute infection. Although populations of blacklegged ticks are not yet established in Alberta, suspicion should remain for tick-borne diseases because infected ticks are introduced into the province by migrating birds. This case report highlights the need to remind physicians and other public health professionals that rare, non-endemic tick-borne diseases can occasionally occur in low-risk jurisdictions.

### Rickettsia parkeri rickettsiosis, Argentina [^113aqCxN]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Patient 2, a previously healthy 55-year-old-man, was referred to F.J. Muñiz Hospital in January 2009 with fever (temperature 38.5°C), rash, headache, photophobia, conjunctival injection, myalgias, and arthralgias. Seven days before onset of symptoms, he had removed a tick from his back while camping in the Paraná Delta in the province of Buenos Aires (Figure 1, panel B), and a painless black eschar appeared subsequently at the bite site. Three days later, he visited a community clinic and received treatment (cephalexin, 500 mg every 6 hours) for presumed cellulitis, without improvement. The patient did not appear severely ill on physical examination. He had a generalized, nonpruritic maculopapular rash that involved predominantly his trunk and extremities but not his face, palms, or soles. Hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, and nuchal rigidity were not found. Laboratory tests showed a serum aspartate aminotransferase level of 67 U/L (reference range < 31 U/L), and alkaline phosphatase level of 270 U/L (reference range 40–129 U/L). All other hematologic and biochemical results were within reference ranges. A serum sample and an eschar biopsy specimen were obtained, and the patient was treated empirically with doxycycline (200 mg/d for 6 days). His fever disappeared within 48 hours after starting treatment, and complete remission of symptoms occurred within 6 days.

### Assessment of risk factors and outcomes of severe ehrlichiosis infection [^113VnNJ4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Treatment and Outcomes

All patients with ehrlichiosis were treated with doxycycline. Patients requiring ICU care had a significantly longer delay from onset of symptoms to diagnostic testing (median, 7 vs 6 days; P = 0.002) and doxycycline initiation (median, 7 vs 5 days; P = 0.008). Patients admitted to the ICU also had a longer delay from initial interaction with the health care system to diagnostic testing (median, 4 vs 1 day; P < .001) and doxycycline initiation (median, 4 vs 1 day; P < .001) (Figure 2). There was no significant difference in median time from diagnostic testing to treatment initiation between ICU and non-ICU patients (0 vs 0 days; P = 1.0). Median time to doxycycline initiation from symptom onset did not differ significantly by reported tick exposure (tick exposure compared with those who did not report tick exposure, 6 days [IQR, 4–7] vs 6 days [IQR, 4–8]; P = 0.96).

Figure 2.
Distribution of Days From First Health Care Contact to Treatment Initiation

ICU indicates intensive care unit; white dots, median value; vertical bars, interquartile range; and center vertical line, range (excluding outliers).

Case fatality rates were 3.9% overall (6 of 155 patients: 5 required ICU care and 1 was admitted to a regular inpatient unit) and 11.6% among patients requiring ICU care (5 of 43 patients). Length of stay exceeded 7 days for 31.4% of hospitalized patients. The median length of stay for patients requiring ICU care was 6 days (IQR, 4–14 days) compared with hospitalized patients who did not require ICU stay (4 days [IQR, 3–6 days], P = 0.001).

In adjusted analysis, only the median time from initial health care interaction to initiation of doxycycline therapy was independently associated with an increased risk for ICU care (aPR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.04–1.14; P < .001) (Table 3). Conversely, there appeared to be a nonsignificant change toward a decreased need for ICU care among immunosuppressed persons (aPR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.26–1.00; P = 0.05). Documentation of tick exposure was independently associated with a decreased need for ICU care (aPR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.34–0.86; P = 0.01).

Pregnancy and lactation — tetracyclines, doxycycline, and alternatives in tickborne rickettsial diseases are characterized by historical contraindication during pregnancy, limited safety data for doxycycline, and specific alternative considerations. Use of tetracycline-class drugs "has generally been contraindicated during pregnancy", and "controlled studies to assess the safety of doxycycline use in pregnant women have not been conducted". An expert review concluded therapeutic doses were "unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk; however, the data were insufficient to conclude that no risk exists". For treatment options, "Chloramphenicol is a potential alternative treatment for RMSF (Rocky Mountain spotted fever) during pregnancy; however, care must be used… because of the theoretical risk for gray baby syndrome", while "Chloramphenicol is not an alternative for the treatment of ehrlichiosis or anaplasmosis", and "rifampin could be considered an alternative to doxycycline for the treatment of mild anaplasmosis during pregnancy". Regarding lactation, "Doxycycline is excreted into breast milk at low levels; however, the extent of absorption by nursing infants is unknown", and "tetracycline is listed by the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Drugs as 'usually compatible with breastfeeding'.

### Clinical decision support trees can help optimize utilization of Anaplasma phagocytophilum nucleic acid amplification testing [^115JJ51n]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Anaplasmosis, a tick-borne illness caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum (AP), presents with nonspecific clinical symptoms, including fever and headache, and is often accompanied by laboratory abnormalities of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and mildly elevated liver function tests (LFTs). Laboratory confirmation of acute infection occurs with nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). This retrospective cohort study aimed to develop a clinical decision support algorithm to aid in decision-making about test ordering. A data set was constructed with AP NAAT results and time-adjacent complete blood count and LFT results for adult patients tested for AP in a 12.5-year period. A second, smaller data set matched each patient with a positive AP NAAT to two patients with negative tests. Chart review for clinical symptoms was performed on this smaller data set. A decision tree algorithm was deployed to identify patient clusters with negative AP NAAT results. A total of 137/1,204 (11%) patients tested positive by NAAT for AP. In the larger, laboratory-only data set (n = 1,204), patients with a platelet countof > 177×10 3 /μl and ageof < 48years had a negative AP NAAT (204/1,204, 17%, P < 0.05). In the smaller, cohorted data set with chart review (n = 402), patients with a platelet countof > 188×10 3 /μl and no fever or chills also did not have positive AP NAAT (58/402, 14%, P < 0.05). We generated two decision trees that can help determine the utility of AP NAAT using readily available clinical and laboratory data. These have the potential to significantly reduce unnecessary AP testing.

### Concomitant tickborne encephalitis and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis [^1149bEf8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The clinical signs and symptoms of HGE are unspecific and usually consist of fever, headache, chills, malaise, myalgia, or arthralgia, which often occur after a tick bite. Laboratory analysis shows leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, elevated activity of hepatic enzymes, and an elevated concentration of C-reactive protein. However, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are common not only in HGE patients but also during the initial phase of TBE, in which they were found in 67% and 71% of patients, respectively. For most patients in whom TBE develops, the disease has a biphasic course. Our patient, however, had a monophasic course of febrile illness, which was observed in 27% of patients with TBE in Slovenia.

In our report, the diagnosis of TBE was established by the presence of a febrile illness after a tick bite with headache, mild lymphocytic pleocytosis, and demonstration of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to TBE virus by ELISA, the serologic method of choice with the specificity 99.9% for IgM and 99.5% for IgG and the sensitivity 99.8% and 96.8% for IgM and IgG, respectively. The presence of TBE IgM antibodies 144 days after the onset of illness in our patient (Table 2) is not surprising because the IgM antibodies as a rule persist for several months after acute infection. However, changes in antibody titers as demonstrated in our patient attest for recent infection. The febrile illness associated with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, an elevated concentration of serum C-reactive protein, and the demonstration of A. phagocytophilum infection by seroconversion as well as a positive PCR result also met the criteria for confirmed HGE. To our knowledge, the patient reported herein represents the first case of concurrent confirmed TBE and confirmed HGE.

Some reports suggest that coinfection with more than 1 tickborne pathogen may influence the natural history of each of the corresponding diseases, making the clinical course more severe and the outcome less favorable. In spite of proven coinfection and fulfillment of criteria for confirmed TBE and HGE (and the absence of treatment with doxycycline, which could have influenced the natural course of HGE), our patient had a relatively mild illness with uneventful recovery. However, the information obtained from a single patient does not allow for a reliable conclusion on the potential influence of TBE virus and A. phagocytophilum coinfection on the clinical features and course of the combined illness.

### Doxyclycline hyclate (doxycycline hyclate) [^111Rtvk5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Intracranial Hypertension

Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including doxycycline hyclate. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and doxycycline hyclate should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri.

Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize.

5.7 Antianabolic Action

The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. Studies to date indicate that this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with impaired renal function.

5.8 Incomplete Suppression of Malaria

Doxycycline offers substantial but not complete suppression of the asexual blood stages of Plasmodium strains.

Doxycycline does not suppress P. falciparum 's sexual blood stage gametocytes. Subjects completing this prophylactic regimen may still transmit the infection to mosquitoes outside endemic areas.

5.9 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing doxycycline hyclate in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

5.10 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth

Doxycycline hyclate may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If such infections occur, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy.

5.11 Laboratory Monitoring for Long-Term Therapy

In long-term therapy, periodic laboratory evaluation of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed.

### Ehrlichia chaffeensis in child, Venezuela [^1132bDka]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Starting on the first day of hospitalization, the patient was treated with doxycycline (14 days) and chloramphenicol (8 days). After 24 hours, malaise, headache, facial edema, and conjunctivitis improved. After 48 hours, fever and rash were gone. After 3 days, his appetite improved; progressively over time, cervical adenomegaly and cutaneous lesions improved. Abdominal pain persisted for 7 days after treatment. Nausea and vomiting started 2 days after admittance; on day 7, vomit was of coffee-ground consistency. All remaining symptoms abated thereafter. The patient had diarrhea during days 3–6 after admittance; hepatomegaly disappeared after 4 days. Ultrasonographic images of the abdomen indicated acute cholecystitis and hepatosplenomegaly; endoscopic examination of the upper digestive tract showed hyperplasia, hyperemia, and linear and pseudomembranous lacerations in the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus (Mallory-Weiss syndrome) and moderate erythema of the stomach. Test results for Helicobacter pylori and Giardia lamblia were negative.

Laboratory results showed leukopenia and monocytosis on day 5 of illness. Leukocyte count was within reference range thereafter; thrombocytopenia was present until day 7 (99,000/mm 3). ALT was elevated from day 3 and peaked (481 IU) on day 7. AST levels increased on day 5 and peaked (215 IU) on day 7. Both values decreased progressively to reference levels (after 25 days for ALT and 46 days for AST). Lactic dehydrogenase was elevated for 9 days while erythrocyte count, sedimentation rate, and serum glucose, amylase, urea, creatinine, bilirubin, calcium, sodium, and potassium remained within reference limits. The patient was released after 8 days of hospitalization.

The buffy-coat smear performed 4 days after illness onset showed basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions inside vacuoles of lymphocytes and monocytes, with typical features of morulae reported for human monocytic ehrlichiosis (Figure). Nested PCR analysis was positive for E. chaffeensis, and sequencing of the amplified DNA fully confirmed the 16S rRNA targeted sequence.

### Anaplasmataceae-specific PCR for diagnosis and therapeutic guidance for symptomatic neoehrlichiosis in immunocompetent host [^117N6pms]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This case demonstrates that Candidatus Neoehrlichia can affect healthy persons who have no underlying hematologic or autoimmune disorders. Neoehrlichiosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients with appropriate symptoms, independent of concurrent conditions and immune status. As long as no evidence-based recommendations regarding treatment of human neoehrlichiosis exist, it seems reasonable to use Anaplasmataceae -specific PCR to monitor treatment response and determine the duration of antimicrobial therapy to avert recrudescence.

Wright-Giemsa stain; original magnification ×100.

Eighteen months later (May 2021), the patient was admitted to the Cayenne Hospital Center with fever, myalgia, headache, epistaxis, and severe anemia (hemoglobin 6.6g/dL). A broad microbiologic investigation ruled out COVID-19, dengue, chikungunya virus, Zika virus, influenza, malaria, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and leptospirosis. The only positive test was a subnormal level of Coxiella burnetii IgM and IgG (phase II IgG 64, IgM 96; phase I negative), which led to the introduction of antibiotic treatment (doxycycline 100 mg 2×/d for 21 d and ceftriaxone 1 g/d for 5 d). The anemia was considered autoimmune hemolytic because of a positive Coombs test and was thus treated with prednisolone with decreasing doses from 60 mg/day to 10 mg/day for 3 months. The patient recovered within 3 weeks; symptoms resolved, and his hemoglobin level improved to 9.4 g/dL at discharge. Our a posteriori Anaplasma PCR survey of May 2021 blood samples (before and at day 7 of antibiotic treatment) again revealed the presence of Candidatus A. sparouinense. No further blood sample was preserved; thus, the disappearance of the Anaplasma infection at the end of antibiotic treatment could not be confirmed.

Composite Clinical Score throughout the study in the two treatment groups.

At 6 months, the proportions of patients with any complaint, including symptoms without influence on daily life was 73% and 71% in the 2 and 6 weeks treatment groups, respectively. The proportions with at least one complaint influencing daily life (CCS ≥ 2) were 23% (n = 12) and 22% (n = 11). One patient treated for 6 weeks had an elevated CSF cell count at 6 months (baseline 82 M/L, 6 months 28 M/L), but had no other signs of treatment failure or disease progression, and the CSF cell count normalised at 12 months (3 M/L). We did not register any serious adverse events, and no patients were excluded, or had to stop treatment, because of adverse events. Weekly patient-reported side effects for 10 weeks are summarised in figure 3. There was a trend towards more patients with high sum scores in week 3–7 in the 6 weeks treatment group, but the difference was statistically significant only in week 5 (p = 0.03). There were no difference in median sum scores between the treatment groups at any time point. The only single question that differed between the treatment groups was report of nausea at week 5, where nine patients reported mild and two serious nausea in the 6 weeks treatment group as compared with three patients with mild nausea in the 2 weeks treatment group (p = 0.03). At week 10, two patients, one in each group, reported seriously decreased appetite, otherwise, the patients reported few and only mild remaining possible side effects. There were no statistically significant differences in frequencies of pathological blood sample findings between the two groups at 2 and 4 weeks after start of treatment.

### Diagnosis and management of tickborne rickettsial diseases: rocky mountain spotted fever and other spotted fever group rickettsioses, ehrlichioses, and anaplasmosis-United States [^116Zc6rV]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Alternative antibacterial agents to doxycycline — tetracyclines, including doxycycline, are the only antibacterial agents recommended for treatment of all tickborne rickettsial diseases, and chloramphenicol is the only alternative drug that has been used to treat RMSF; however, epidemiologic studies suggest that patients with RMSF treated with chloramphenicol are at higher risk for death than are persons who received a tetracycline, and in vitro evidence indicates that chloramphenicol is not effective in the treatment of ehrlichiosis or anaplasmosis, so if chloramphenicol is substituted for doxycycline, ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis will not be covered and RMSF treatment might be suboptimal. Rifamycins demonstrate in vitro activity against E. chaffeensis and A. phagocytophilum, and rifampin could be an alternative for the treatment of mild illness due to anaplasmosis in the case of pregnancy or documented allergy to tetracycline-class drugs; the dose of rifampin is 300 mg orally twice daily for adults or 10 mg/kg of body weight for children (not to exceed 300 mg/dose). Before considering treatment with rifampin, clinicians should use caution and ensure that RMSF can be ruled out because the early signs and symptoms of RMSF and anaplasmosis are similar, and rifampin is not considered an acceptable treatment for RMSF; in addition, rifampin does not effectively treat potential coinfection of A. phagocytophilum with B. burgdorferi. Many classes of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents that are used empirically to treat febrile patients, such as beta-lactams, macrolides, aminoglycosides, and sulfonamides, are not effective against tickborne rickettsial disease. No human efficacy data on fluoroquinolone use in RMSF exist, and fluoroquinolones are not recommended for treatment of RMSF; E. chaffeensis exhibits in vitro resistance to fluoroquinolones, relapse after levofloxacin has been reported for A. phagocytophilum, and fluoroquinolones are not recommended for treatment of anaplasmosis. Sulfonamide antimicrobials are associated with increased severity of tickborne rickettsial diseases, and treatment of patients with RMSF with a sulfonamide can result in increased disease severity and death; cases of severe ehrlichioses have been associated with the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and in some patients treated with sulfonamide or beta-lactam drugs, the onset and appropriate treatment of tickborne rickettsial illness was delayed because a rash was mistaken for a drug eruption rather than recognized as a manifestation of rickettsial illness.

### Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis: a review [^113LzWnx]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), and babesiosis are emerging tick-borne infections.

Objective

To provide an update on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of tick-borne infections.

Evidence Review

Search of PubMed and Scopus for articles on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of tick-borne infections published in English from January 2005 through December 2015.

Findings

The search yielded 3550 articles for diagnosis and treatment and 752 articles for prevention. Of these articles, 361 were reviewed in depth. Evidence supports the use of US Food and Drug Administration-approved serologic tests, such as an enzyme immunoassay (EIA), followed by Western blot testing, to diagnose extracutaneous manifestations of Lyme disease. Microscopy and polymerase chain reaction assay of blood specimens are used to diagnose active HGA and babesiosis. The efficacy of oral doxycycline, amoxicillin, and cefuroxime axetil for treating Lyme disease has been established in multiple trials. Ceftriaxone is recommended when parenteral antibiotic therapy is recommended. Multiple trials have shown efficacy for a 10-day course of oral doxycycline for treatment of erythema migrans and for a 14-day course for treatment of early neurologic Lyme disease in ambulatory patients. Evidence indicates that a 10-day course of oral doxycycline is effective for HGA and that a 7- to 10-day course of azithromycin plus atovaquone is effective for mild babesiosis. Based on multiple case reports, a 7- to 10-day course of clindamycin plus quinine is often used to treat severe babesiosis. A recent study supports a minimum of 6 weeks of antibiotics for highly immunocompromised patients with babesiosis, with no parasites detected on blood smear for at least the final 2 weeks of treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance

Evidence is evolving regarding the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Lyme disease, HGA, and babesiosis. Recent evidence supports treating patients with erythema migrans for no longer than 10 days when doxycycline is used and prescription of a 14-day course of oral doxycycline for early neurologic Lyme disease in ambulatory patients. The duration of antimicrobial therapy for babesiosis in severely immunocompromised patients should be extended to 6 weeks or longer.

Fever and asthenia were reported by all 14 patients. Other nonspecific symptoms included myalgia (10/14), lymphadenopathy (4/14), headache (3/14), dizziness (3/14), and chills (2/14). Gastrointestinal manifestations included anorexia (9/14), nausea (7/14), vomiting (3/14), and diarrhea (1/14). Three patients had cough and pneumonia, and we observed rash in 10 patients (Figure 2). The median time from onset of illness to rash was 4 (range 3–5) days, and the median duration of rash was 5.5 (range 4–8) days. Only 3 patients had an eschar. Other signs included splenomegaly (2/14) and facial edema (1/14).

Urinalysis on admission revealed microscopic hematuria in 2 patients and a slight or moderate proteinuria in 8 patients. The most common findings on laboratory tests were thrombocytopenia, elevated hepatic aminotransferase concentrations, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, and hypoalbuminemia, followed by hyponatremia, anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypopotassemia, leukopenia, and elevated serum creatine kinase (Table). Mild multiple organ dysfunction developed in 3 patients.

Because of the appearance of typical rash, we suspected SFG rickettsioses in 10 patients and treated them with doxycycline (100 mg 2×/d) until their fevers dissipated and clinical disease improved (median 4 [range 3–5] days). The other 4 patients were treated with the antimicrobial drugs cefminox or cefoperazone for a median of 6 (range 5–7) days. By the time patients were discharged from the hospital, their leukocyte and platelet counts had returned to reference range levels, but half of the patients still had laboratory test values outside of their respective reference ranges (Table). No patients reported clinically significant sequelae at their 2-week follow-up appointment.

Arthritis Care & Research (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Lyme disease, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, erythema migrans, AAN/ACR/IDSA 2021 guidelines recommend to complete a 10-day course of doxycycline or a 14-day course of amoxicillin or cefuroxime axetil rather than longer treatment courses in patients with erythema migrans.

### Hepatitis from spiroplasma sp. in an immunocompromised patient [^113zQRH8]. American Journal of Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

A 70-year-old lung transplant recipient patient was admitted with fever, nausea, abdominal pain, peripheral edema and pronounced weakness. An initial work-up for presumed infection revealed cholestatic hepatitis, leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia, but failed to detect a pathogen. An increased glucose uptake exclusively in the liver was demonstrated by positron emission tomography. Liver biopsy showed basophilic inclusions in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. Broad- range 16S rRNA gene PCR followed by sequence analysis yielded Spiroplasma sp. in two independent blood samples and the liver biopsy, confirming Spiroplasma sp. as the causative agent. Antibiotic treatment with doxycycline and azithromycin led to complete recovery.

Table 4.10.5 — Changing malaria chemoprophylaxis when tafenoquine is stopped due to side effects directs: for atovaquone-proguanil, "Stop tafenoquine and begin (within 7 days of last dose) daily atovaquone-proguanil" and "Continue daily atovaquone-proguanil while in malaria endemic areas and through an additional 7 days after leaving the endemic area". For doxycycline, "Stop tafenoquine and begin (within 7 days of last dose) daily doxycycline" and "Continue daily doxycycline while in malaria endemic areas and through an additional 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area". Chloroquine, mefloquine, and primaquine are each "Not recommended". A note adds that "It is unknown whether atovaquone-proguanil is effective as causal chemoprophylaxis (targeting the initial liver stage) if it is started after malaria exposure, and therefore it needs to be continued for 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area in those circumstances".

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), American Academy of Neurology (AAN), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR): 2020 guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease [^111JQt2E]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Lyme disease guideline scope — this guideline encompasses the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Lyme disease, as well as Lyme disease complicated by simultaneous coinfection with other tick-borne pathogens in North America. It only addresses anaplasmosis and babesiosis in the context of a coinfection. Anaplasmosis is now addressed in the rickettsial disease guidelines developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and babesiosis recommendations can be found in a separate IDSA guideline (in press). This guideline is primarily intended for medical practitioners in North America, although many recommendations will be applicable to patients in Europe and Asia. It also includes recommendations for evaluation and treatment of patients who present with borrelia lymphocytoma and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans after travel to endemic areas.

### Diagnosis and management of Q fever – United States, 2013: recommendations from CDC and the Q fever working group [^115gwmT4]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Q fever — postexposure monitoring and early management: A daily fever monitoring log should be kept for a minimum of 3 weeks after exposure to C. burnetii, and the majority of infected persons have symptom onset 2–3 weeks after exposure, although onset can occur up to 6 weeks after exposure. If fever occurs during monitoring, immediate treatment with doxycycline should be administered and testing should be performed; treatment within 24 hours of fever onset is extremely effective in shortening illness duration and symptom severity. Baseline serologic testing can be performed with a convalescent sample drawn 6 weeks later to evaluate for asymptomatic seroconversion. Although asymptomatic infections do not routinely require treatment, treatment for asymptomatic infection might be considered in groups at high risk. The benefit of prophylactic antimicrobial agents is questionable and therefore not recommended, and the incubation period for Q fever is dose dependent.

Epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory data available in 13 of 16 PCR-positive patients are given in Table 4. Before the onset of the disease in the summer 2002 (from June to August), all patients had a history of tick bite, tick exposure, or a stay in an epidemiologically suspected location. After an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, the patient had a sudden onset with fever, but no specific symptoms appeared during the first several days. In 12 patients, a macular or maculopapular rash appeared but was usually faint. Twelve patients had a primary lesion (eschar) at the site of tick attachment (Figure 3). The eschar consisted of a necrotic central region (50–150 mm in diameter) surrounded by infiltrated and inflamed tissue (70–400 mm in diameter), and a zone of hyperemia (250–500 mm in diameter). The eschars were found on the waist and buttocks region (four); lower extremities (two); upper extremities and axillar region (two); and back, chest, neck, and abdomen (one case each). In two patients, we noticed subcutaneous lymphangitis and regional lymphadenopathy. Initial conventional treatment at home, with a combination of antipyretics, analgesics, and antibacterial therapy (oral penicillins) did not result in improvement; 5–9 days after the onset of symptoms, all patients were admitted to the hospital. They received oral doxycycline for 14 days and antihistamine therapy, and clinical symptoms resolved within 2 to 3 days. Laboratory tests in the hospital showed elevated levels of serum transaminases (alanine aminotransaminase and aspartate aminotransaminase) in 46% and 15% of patients, respectively, and these remained elevated even during convalescence but were normal at follow-up at 3 to 4 weeks.
