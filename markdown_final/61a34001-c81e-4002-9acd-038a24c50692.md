## Question

What is long-term management of perforated eardrum?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the long-term management of a perforated tympanic membrane. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial assessment and diagnostic confirmation of the perforation. Then, I should verify etiology and categorize acute versus chronic perforations. Next, I will evaluate candidacy for observation versus closure and consider growth factor options. After that, I need to review surgical planning and perioperative management, followed by postoperative care and rehabilitation. Finally, I will outline long-term follow-up and special scenarios like tubes, trauma, and high-risk populations, making sure I cross-check each claim against guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment elements. I need to ensure we accurately characterize the perforation by size, location, chronicity, and whether the ear is wet or dry, and I should correlate with baseline hearing and symptoms, as this will drive decisions about observation versus repair and influence prognostic counseling. Smartphone or endoscopic imaging can help quantify the defect when visualization is limited, and otoscopic fogging can be a useful bedside clue for an occult perforation when the full tympanic membrane is not visible, but I should verify consistency with tympanometry or pneumatic otoscopy before concluding [^114aBCy8] [^114xkZz9] [^116ziDYg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about management until I classify etiology and chronicity. Acute traumatic perforations frequently heal spontaneously and warrant watchful waiting with water precautions and aural toilet if needed, whereas chronic perforations, particularly in the setting of chronic suppurative otitis media, are less likely to close and may require intervention. Importantly, traumatic perforations in children show very high spontaneous healing rates in observational series, and a recent meta-analysis suggests paper patching can modestly increase closure rates over observation alone, though both approaches have high healing rates overall [^115u61ca] [^112UCj4a]. I should double-check for iatrogenic or tube-related causes because tube type and duration meaningfully alter perforation risk, with short-term tubes averaging around 1–2% persistent perforation versus up to 20% with long-term tubes, and meta-analytic data suggest earlier elective removal of retained tubes may reduce subsequent perforation risk, although the benefit of patching at removal is uncertain [^113qYyU9] [^116TrQum] [^11744GX9].

> Next, I should review who is a candidate for observation versus closure. I need to ensure I account for size, location, and ear status: small dry perforations often heal or remain stable with hearing close to normal and may be observed with strict water precautions, whereas larger, anterior, or wet perforations, and those causing significant conductive deficit or recurrent infections, generally merit closure. Growth factors like bFGF can improve closure rates and shorten healing time for acute or selected chronic perforations, but I should confirm patient selection and local availability before proposing this path [^116jf9iY] [^114Vv2zx] [^1115VEZM]. Wait, let me verify that my size thresholds are evidence-based rather than anecdotal. Although many clinicians use pragmatic cutoffs like greater than 25% as a trigger to intervene, high-quality comparative data are limited, so I should frame these thresholds as consensus practice informed by series and guidelines rather than as absolute rules [^112Dnn2G].

> I will now examine surgical planning when closure is indicated. Myringoplasty yields approximately 80–90% success for persistent perforations, with higher success in dry, nonretracted ears and in older children and adults. Anterior perforations are more technically challenging, and endoscopic techniques can improve visualization and outcomes in some hands, but technique should be individualized to anatomy and surgeon expertise [^112Dnn2G] [^115pnekJ]. Let me consider cartilage-based repairs for atelectasis or revision cases to reduce retraction risk, and I should remember that mastoidectomy is not routinely indicated for simple perforations unless there is concomitant cholesteatoma or refractory mastoid disease, so I should avoid overtreatment in straightforward cases [^1153QwS9] [^1167uBPm].

> But wait, what about modifiable risk factors that can derail closure? I need to check for Eustachian tube dysfunction, smoking, diabetes, and immunocompromise, and I should optimize these preoperatively where possible because they can lower success rates; smoking in particular is associated with reduced closure rates after tympanic membrane repair, so smoking cessation counseling is important preoperatively [^113jpoDH]. Hold on, I should verify that counseling includes realistic expectations for hearing gain, which typically reflects closure of the air–bone gap proportional to perforation size, though high-frequency recovery may lag despite successful closure, especially for larger defects [^116uvAxM].

> Next, I should review perioperative management and water precautions. I need to ensure strict dry ear protocols before and after surgery to reduce infection risk, and if there is discharge, I should treat it with non-ototoxic topical quinolone drops while avoiding ototoxic agents like aminoglycosides or alcohol-containing preparations when the membrane is nonintact. I should confirm the patient's technique for drop administration and consider aural toilet or wick placement if edema limits penetration [^114C4PPy] [^116yKq2Q] [^112TDfG3]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought acetic acid might be a reasonable antiseptic alternative, but I should double-check the label; acetic acid otic is actually contraindicated with a perforated tympanic membrane, so I must not recommend it in this setting [^114dZhGz].

> I will now examine postoperative care and rehabilitation. I need to ensure follow-up otoscopy at about 2–4 weeks to confirm graft position and healing, then periodic audiometry to document closure of the air–bone gap; if a persistent pinhole remains, observation is reasonable because some close spontaneously, but if it enlarges or otorrhea recurs, a second procedure may be needed, and in select cases, adjuvant growth factors can be considered for residual defects [^1115VEZM]. Let me reconsider the timing of return to water exposure; most surgeons advise keeping the ear dry for several weeks after surgery, but I should tailor this to healing status and technique, and counsel on early signs of infection or graft failure that warrant prompt reassessment [^notfound].

> Next, I should review long-term follow-up and surveillance. Even after successful closure, I need to monitor for recurrent perforation, retraction pockets, myringosclerosis, and cholesteatoma, especially in children with Eustachian tube dysfunction or a history of multiple sets of tubes. Periodic pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry can help detect middle ear disease early, and families should be educated to seek care for recurrent infections or hearing changes [^112E3LjL] [^116ziDYg]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not overpromising on durability; long-term data after pediatric tympanostomy show that a meaningful minority of ears have ongoing middle ear disease or sequelae at 5 years, underscoring the need for longitudinal care and timely reintervention when indicated [^114K5NyH].

> I need to ensure I address special scenarios. For patients with tympanostomy tubes, I should avoid placing long-term tubes as initial surgery unless there is a compelling need for prolonged ventilation, and if a retained tube is present beyond about 2–3 years, elective removal is reasonable to mitigate perforation risk. Meta-analytic data suggest earlier removal may reduce perforation, though routine patching at removal does not clearly change outcomes, so I should individualize that decision [^113tK9Np] [^11744GX9]. For traumatic perforations, I should confirm that most heal spontaneously and that conservative management with water precautions and aural toilet suffices, reserving patching or surgery for large defects or those failing to heal by roughly 3 months. Meta-analysis supports a modest benefit of paper patching over observation alone, but both have high closure rates [^115u61ca] [^112UCj4a]. For high-risk populations with high burdens of CSOM, I should consider that prolonged or continuous systemic antibiotics can reduce episodes of AOM and perforation, but I must balance this against resistance risks and community context, and prioritize definitive closure when feasible [^112UW88w] [^111u4aJu].

> Finally, I should double-check that my plan aligns with guideline-based principles: confirm the diagnosis and perforation status, classify etiology and chronicity, stratify risk and hearing impact, choose observation versus closure using shared decision-making, optimize modifiable risks, select technique based on anatomy and expertise, and commit to structured follow-up with prompt management of complications. This iterative approach ensures safety, minimizes recurrence, and maximizes functional outcomes while staying anchored to the best available evidence [^112E3LjL].

The long-term management of a perforated eardrum centers on **keeping the ear dry** [^114C4PPy] and **monitoring for spontaneous healing** [^115u61ca], as most traumatic perforations close within 3 months [^notfound]. Use **non-ototoxic topical antibiotics** for otorrhea [^114C4PPy] and avoid water exposure, trauma, and irritants [^113qYyU9] [^116yKq2Q]. If the perforation persists beyond 3–6 months, causes significant hearing loss, or leads to recurrent infections, refer for **tympanoplasty**, which has an 80–90% success rate [^112E3LjL] [^115wS23m]. Persistent perforations increase the risk of chronic suppurative otitis media and hearing loss [^114ksP7G], so regular follow-up and hearing assessment are essential [^114nm2aE].

---

## Conservative management

### Observation and spontaneous healing

Most traumatic perforations heal spontaneously within 3 months [^notfound]; **observe unless complications arise** [^112UCj4a]. Persistent perforations are more likely after tympanostomy tubes or chronic otitis media and may require intervention [^115wS23m] [^112GsJsP].

---

### Infection prevention and control

- **Topical antibiotics**: Use non-ototoxic topical antibiotics (e.g. ciprofloxacin) for otorrhea; avoid ototoxic agents (e.g. aminoglycosides) when the tympanic membrane is perforated [^114C4PPy] [^116yKq2Q].

- **Aural hygiene**: Keep the ear dry; avoid water exposure, trauma, and irritants [^113qYyU9].

- **Systemic antibiotics**: Reserve for acute otitis media with perforation or chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) [^116DYCfF] [^113KJ5fL].

---

### Hearing assessment and rehabilitation

Regular **audiometric testing** should be performed to monitor hearing and guide management [^notfound]. If a conductive hearing loss persists, consider hearing aids or other assistive devices [^114ksP7G].

---

## Surgical management

### Indications for surgical intervention

- **Persistent perforation**: Failure to heal after 3–6 months of observation [^notfound].

- **Significant hearing loss**: Conductive hearing loss impacting daily life [^notfound].

- **Recurrent infections**: Chronic or recurrent otorrhea despite medical therapy [^114ksP7G].

- **Patient preference**: Desire for closure after informed discussion [^notfound].

---

### Surgical options

| **Surgical procedure** | **Description** | **Success rate** |
|-|-|-|
| Tympanoplasty | Repair of the tympanic membrane with graft (fascia, cartilage, perichondrium) | 80–90% [^112E3LjL] [^115wS23m] |
| Myringoplasty | Simple closure of small perforations | High [^1125H6jx] |
| Ossiculoplasty | Reconstruction of ossicular chain if disrupted | Variable [^111qndo1] |

---

### Factors influencing surgical outcomes

- **Perforation size and location**: Larger or anterior perforations have higher failure rates [^112Dnn2G].

- **Middle ear status**: Active infection or Eustachian tube dysfunction reduce success [^113Twgnr].

- **Patient factors**: Smoking, diabetes, and immune compromise impair healing [^113jpoDH].

---

## Potential complications of untreated perforation

- **Hearing loss**: Conductive or mixed hearing loss [^116uvAxM].

- **Chronic suppurative otitis media**: Persistent infection and otorrhea [^114ksP7G].

- **Cholesteatoma**: Epithelial ingrowth causing destructive lesions [^notfound].

- **Tympanosclerosis**: Scar formation affecting mobility [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Schedule regular visits to assess healing, detect complications, and reinforce **water precautions** [^114nm2aE]. Maintain a high index of suspicion for CSOM, cholesteatoma, and persistent Eustachian tube dysfunction [^notfound].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Emphasize **strict water avoidance** and safe ear-cleaning practices [^1123jHZ8]. Discuss spontaneous healing, infection risks, and when to seek care [^115u61ca]. Review surgical options, expected outcomes, and risks to support informed decisions [^112E3LjL].

---

## Emerging therapies and research

Growth factors such as bFGF may enhance closure and shorten healing time, though **evidence remains limited** [^116jf9iY] [^114Vv2zx]. Tissue engineering approaches are under investigation for TM repair [^116bs8ig]. Minimally invasive techniques aim to reduce morbidity and improve outcomes [^1115VEZM].

---

Long-term management of a perforated eardrum balances **conservative care** with **timely surgery** when indicated, with the goals of preventing infection, preserving or restoring hearing, and minimizing complications.

### What effect does smoking have on the surgical closure of tympanic membrane perforations? A review [^113jpoDH]. Otology & Neurotology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

The link between cigarette smoking and outcome following surgical repair of tympanic membrane perforation is unclear. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review on the link between smoking and success rate following surgical repair of tympanic membrane perforations.

Materials and Methods

Systematic review performed using the following data sources: 1) Cochrane central register of controlled trials (1997 to April 30, 2018), 2) Medline (February 1948 to April 30, 2018), and 3) Embase (1975 to April 30, 2018). Inclusion criteria for this study was: 1) studies reporting surgical closure of tympanic membrane perforations in smokers, 2)primary and revision cases, 3) English language literature, 4) minimum follow-up period of 6 months, and 5) pre and postoperative audiogram. The exclusion criteria were: 1) no identifiable data on smokers in reported outcomes, 2) less than 6 months follow-up, 3) no audiometric outcomes, and 4) non-English language articles.

Results

A total of 75 studies were identified on initial search and 8 were eligible for the study. All studies were of level 4 evidence. In these eight studies, overall surgical closure of tympanic membrane perforation was successful in 512/577 (88.7%) of nonsmokers and 151/197 (76.6%) in smokers. This difference was statistically significant.

Conclusions

Smokers may have a lower success rate compared against nonsmokers for surgical repair of tympanic membrane perforations. Our review has limitations and more prospective high-quality controlled trials are required to further study this association.

### Type 1 tympanoplasty in pediatric patients: a review of 102 cases [^1173i7QD]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we believe that type 1 tympanoplasty can be performed effectively in pediatric population regardless of age, location and type of perforation and surgical approach. Early tympanoplasty has an excellent potential for restoring hearing function and may prevent future complications and deterioration associated with long-term perforations. Bilateral perforations are prone to reperforation, and should be treated with cartilage graft.

### Aural toilet (ear cleaning) for chronic suppurative otitis media [^1155AYug]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection (involving more than one micro-organism) of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Aural toileting is a term describing a number of processes for manually cleaning the ear. Techniques used may include dry mopping (with cotton wool or tissue paper), suction clearance (typically under a microscope) or irrigation (using manual or automated syringing). Dry mopping may be effective in removing mucopurulent discharge. Compared to irrigation or microsuction it is less effective in removing epithelial debris or thick pus. Aural toileting can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antibiotics or topical antiseptics.

Objectives

To assess the effects of aural toilet procedures for people with CSOM.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving people (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. We included any aural toileting method as the intervention, at any frequency and for any duration. The comparisons were aural toileting compared with a) placebo or no intervention, and b) any other aural toileting method. We analysed trials in which background treatments were used in both arms (e.g. topical antiseptics or topical antibiotics) separately.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications, and the adverse events of ear bleeding and dizziness/vertigo/balance problems.

Main Results

We included three studies with a total of 431 participants (465 ears), reporting on two comparisons. Two studies included only children with CSOM in the community (351 participants) and the other study (80 participants) included children and adults with chronic ear discharge for at least six weeks. None of the included studies reported the outcomes of health-related quality of life, ear pain or the adverse event of ear bleeding. Daily aural toileting (dry mopping) versus no treatment Two studies (351 children; 370 ears) compared daily dry mopping with no treatment. Neither study presented results for resolution of ear discharge at between one and up to two weeks or between two to four weeks. For resolution of ear discharge after four weeks, one study reported the results per person. We are very uncertain whether there is a difference at 16 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.72; 1 study; 217 participants) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. No results were reported for the adverse events of dizziness, vertigo or balance problems. Only one study reported serious complications, but it was not clear which group these patients were from, or whether the complications occurred pre- or post-treatment. One study reported hearing, but the results were presented by treatment outcome rather than by treatment group so it is not possible to determine whether there is a difference between the two groups. Daily aural toileting versus single aural toileting on top of topical ciprofloxacin One study (80 participants; 95 ears) compared daily aural toileting (suction) with administration of topical antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) ear drops in a clinic, to a single aural toileting (suction) episode followed by daily self-administered topical antibiotic drops, in participants of all ages. We are unsure whether there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge at between one and up to two weeks (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.30; 1 study; 80 participants) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. There were no results reported for resolution of ear discharge at between two to four weeks. The results for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks were presented by ear, not person, and could not be adjusted to by person. One patient in the group with single aural toileting and self administration of topical antibiotic ear drops reported the adverse event of dizziness, which the authors attributed to the use of cold topical ciprofloxacin. It is very uncertain whether there is a difference between the groups (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.95; 1 study; 80 participants, very low-certainty). No results were reported for the other adverse events of vertigo or balance problems, or for serious complications. The authors only reported qualitatively that there was no difference between the two groups in hearing results (very low-certainty).

Authors' Conclusions

We are very uncertain whether or not treatment with aural toileting is effective in resolving ear discharge in people with CSOM, due to a lack of data and the poor quality of the available evidence. We also remain uncertain about other outcomes, including adverse events, as these were not well reported. Similarly, we are very uncertain whether daily suction clearance, followed by antibiotic ear drops administered at a clinic, is better than a single episode of suction clearance followed by self-administration of topical antibiotic ear drops.

### Otoscope fogging: examination finding for perforated tympanic membrane [^114xkZz9]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

The author reports a recently recognised physical examination finding, otoscope fogging, for perforated tympanic membrane. Otoscope fogging is defined as condensation forming in the view field of the otoscope while inspecting the ear. In the setting of occult perforation secondary to the inability to visualise the entire tympanic membrane, otoscope fogging may provide the clinician with valuable information since medical management may differ if perforation is present.

### The effectiveness of bFGF in the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116jf9iY]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

Tympanic membrane (TM) perforation is commonly encountered in the clinical setting. It can be iatrogenic, or caused by trauma or infections. In the United States, it is estimated that 1 to 3% of the population will have a TM perforation some time in their life. In specific groups (e.g. Indigenous Australians), the prevalence reported has been as high as 28 to 43%. Some perforations may lead to chronic otorrhea and hearing loss, and limit water sports, which may significantly reduce the quality of life. Moreover, chronic TM perforations, if left untreated, serve as a conduit for further infections, acquired cholesteatoma, facial nerve palsy, labyrinthitis, and subperiosteal abscess. Although traumatic TM perforations tend to heal spontaneously, large or chronic perforations may fail to heal and require surgical interventions. In addition, the long-term spontaneous healing rate can sometimes be unsatisfactory. Kristensen reported that healing rate for spontaneous perforations to be 78.7%, which appears to vary depending on the cause of perforation. To repair TM perforations, patients may suffer from complications from conventional surgery. Hence, it is crucial to explore options that may improve the efficacy of repair.

With the advancement in the field of tissue engineering, various bioscaffolds and bioactive molecules have been applied with encouraging results. Among them, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is one of the most commonly used bioactive molecules. Until recently, a majority of the studies were in animal models. However, in the recent years, we have witnessed a surge in the use of bFGF in human trials (,–). Although a majority of trials reported promising benefits, the perforation closure rates varied across the different studies, and there does not appear to be a consensus for hearing benefits. Recently, a literature review supported the role of bFGF in the repair of TM perforation, but to the best of our knowledge, no quantitative analysis has been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of bFGF.

Thus, the aim of this comprehensive meta-analysis was to assess the effectiveness of bFGF for the repair of TM perforations both in healing and hearing by evaluating the current best evidence.

### Panel 7: otitis media: treatment and complications [^114WLTvd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective We aimed to summarize key articles published between 2011 and 2015 on the treatment of (recurrent) acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, tympanostomy tube otorrhea, chronic suppurative otitis media and complications of otitis media, and their implications for clinical practice. Data Sources PubMed, Ovid Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Clinical Evidence (BMJ Publishing). Review Methods All types of articles related to otitis media treatment and complications between June 2011 and March 2015 were identified. A total of 1122 potential related articles were reviewed by the panel members; 118 relevant articles were ultimately included in this summary. Conclusions Recent literature and guidelines emphasize accurate diagnosis of acute otitis media and optimal management of ear pain. Watchful waiting is optional in mild to moderate acute otitis media; antibiotics do shorten symptoms and duration of middle ear effusion. The additive benefit of adenoidectomy to tympanostomy tubes in recurrent acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion is controversial and age dependent. Topical antibiotic is the treatment of choice in acute tube otorrhea. Symptomatic hearing loss due to persistent otitis media with effusion is best treated with tympanostomy tubes. Novel molecular and biomaterial treatments as adjuvants to surgical closure of eardrum perforations seem promising. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of complementary and alternative treatments. Implications for Practice Emphasis on accurate diagnosis of otitis media, in its various forms, is important to reduce overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and antibiotic resistance. Children at risk for otitis media and its complications deserve special attention.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^111u4aJu]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis media (OM) is an important health problem in young children. In most settings the pain or fever of acute OM (AOM) is of principal concern. However, in disadvantaged and Indigenous populations, where symptomatic AOM is less often reported, AOM with tympanic membrane perforation (AOMwiP) and progression to chronic suppurative OM (CSOM) can lead to hearing impairment and educational disadvantage. CSOM is estimated to currently affect between 65 and 330 million people, 60% of whom have a significant hearing loss This global burden mainly affects South East Asia, Western Pacific, Africa and ethnic minorities. A 2001 cross-sectional survey of Aboriginal children aged 6 months to 2.5 years living in 29 remote Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory of Australia, showed perforation rates varying from 0% to 60% (mean rate 24%) between communities. In longitudinal studies of Aboriginal children, OM has been shown to commence within weeks of birth, shortly after nasopharyngeal colonisation with Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-capsular Haemophilus influenzae (NCHi) and Moraxella catarrhalis. This link between bacterial colonisation and early onset of persistent OM suggested to us that long-term antibiotic therapy could be of benefit for Aboriginal infants and others in high-risk populations. The impact of antibiotics has been unclear in populations where rates of CSOM exceed 4%, although systematic reviews demonstrate that antibiotics do prevent some episodes of AOM in more affluent populations, and are particularly beneficial for children with more severe OM.

### Prognostic factors of successful tympanoplasty in pediatric patients: a cohort study [^116UzExz]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The proposed model provides the pediatrician and the otolaryngologist a tool with which to quantify the probability of success that a patient, who presents with chronic perforation of the tympanic membrane and requires surgical intervention, will have.

### Retained tympanostomy tubes: who, what, when, why, and how to treat? [^111r4xUY]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Tympanostomy tube placement is one of the most common surgical procedures performed across the globe. Controversies exist regarding what to do when a tube is considered to be retained in the tympanic membrane for too long.

Materials and Methods

Review of the PubMed medical literature starting in 1990, focusing on English language studies reporting on the definition, complications, and management of retained tympanostomy tubes.

Results

The medical literature reporting on outcomes regarding retained tympanostomy tubes is relatively sparse. Most studies recommend prophylactic removal of tubes after a defined period of time, usually around 2 to 3 years after placement. A preferred method of myringoplasty after tympanostomy tube retrieval has not been established, but most studies recommend grafting the perforation at the time of tube removal.

Conclusions

Although a consensus as to the optimal management of retained tympanostomy tubes is not yet established in the medical literature, a preponderance of studies recommend prophylactic removal at defined period of time (> 2–3 years) before the onset of complications such as otorrhea and granulation tissue formation. Due to a lack of best evidence, the surgeon's preference remains the guiding principle as to the best technique for myringoplasty at the time of removal.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^1132tbYL]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Statement 2 — modifying factors in diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE): Clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy). Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over risk. The action statement profile characterizes the aggregate evidence quality as Grade C, observational studies, the level of confidence in evidence as High, the benefits-harms assessment as a Preponderance of benefits over harm, and the policy level as Recommendation. Key clinical history components that can modify management include diabetes, HIV infection or other immunocompromised states, history of radiotherapy, and presence of tympanostomy tubes or a perforated tympanic membrane (nonintact tympanic membrane).

### Otitis media sequelae and hearing in adolescence after administration of an 11-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine in infancy: a prospective cohort study with long-term follow-up of the ARIVAC trial [^114zedbs]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

According to WHO, 430 million people worldwide have moderate-to-profound hearing loss in the better hearing ear, of whom two-thirds live in Asia and Africa. Deafness and hearing impairment are major forms of disability in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) that cause enormous social, educational, and vocational problems. Chronic middle ear infection is the main cause of mild-to-moderate hearing impairment in children. Middle ear diseases are a common cause of preventable hearing loss, and chronic suppurative otitis media is the most common cause in LMICs. Chronic suppurative otitis media, otitis media with effusion, adhesive otitis media, scarring of tympanic membranes, and hearing loss are sequelae of acute otitis media. Long-term middle ear effects include tympanic membrane perforation, ossicular erosion, and cholesteatoma, and inner ear effects include sensory–neural hearing loss, especially at higher frequencies. Since chronic suppurative otitis media is most likely to occur after episodes of incompletely or inadequately treated bacterial acute otitis media, the problem of underdiagnosed acute otitis media could have a direct impact on the burden of chronic otitis media and its sequelae. Before the introduction of pneumococcal vaccines, the pneumococcus was a major bacterial cause of acute otitis media.

### How does closure of tympanic membrane perforations affect hearing and middle ear mechanics? An evaluation in a patient cohort and temporal bone models [^116uvAxM]. Otology & Neurotology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to determine how tympanic membrane (TM) perforations and their closure, using a paper-patch technique, affect middle-ear mechanics and, thus, conductive hearing for different sizes of the TM perforation.

Study Design

Temporal bone (TB) study and prospective clinical trial.

Setting

Tertiary referral center.

Patients

Nine patients with chronic otitis media for more than 3 months.

Intervention

The TM perforations were closed with a paper patch in all 9 patients. In 5 of 9 patients, myringoplasty was performed. Matching TM perforations were created in a TB model (n = 8) and closed using the paper patch.

Main Outcome Measures

Air-bone gap was measured in all 9 patients of the patient cohort with TM perforations before and after closure and in 5 patients after myringoplasty. Stapes velocity and sound pressure difference between the ear canal and middle-ear cavity were measured in TBs with intact TM, with TM perforations, and with the perforations closed by the paper patch. All measurements in the patient cohort and TBs were performed for different sizes of TM perforations to determine if the effects varied as a function of size.

Results

Degree of the air-bone gap differed as a function of size of the TM perforations and its recovery after closure, and myringoplasty was independent of the size of the TM perforation in the frequency range of 0.25 to 4 kHz. In the TB measurements, although pressure difference across the TM was almost fully recovered by closing the perforation with a paper patch, recovery of the stapes motion was limited at frequencies above 4.5 kHz for larger sizes of TM perforations.

Conclusion

Hearing loss caused by TM perforations depends on the size of the perforation. Hearing returns almost completely across the frequency range after closure except above 4 kHz for larger perforations. This is because the structural damage caused by large TM perforations cannot be completely restored by application of a paper patch.

### T-tubes through cartilage tympanoplasty: is It worth the perforation risk? [^114Mmjtn]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review a single surgeon's experience with T-tube placement through cartilage tympanoplasty versus native tympanic membrane for long-term ventilation of the chronic ear and residual perforation rates following tube removal.

Study Design

Retrospective chart review.

Setting

Two tertiary referral centers.

Patients

One hundred sixteen patients (4–71 yr of age) who underwent either total island cartilage tympanoplasty or posterior palisade cartilage tympanoplasty with T-tube placement primarily or secondarily from 1998 to 2016.

Main Outcome Measures

Long-term outcome of each T-tube was recorded with respect to retention and patency, and tympanic membrane status following either tube removal or extrusion. Audiometric data, age, sex, diagnosis, and procedure(s) performed were considered.

Results

There were 116 patients (122 total ears and 139 total T-tubes) included: 57 ears underwent total island cartilage tympanoplasty with tube placed through cartilage and 65 ears underwent posterior island graft with tube placed through native tympanic membrane. Sixty-eight T-tubes were placed in the total island cartilage group with three (4.4%) residual perforations following removal. Seventy-one T-tubes were placed in the posterior palisade graft group with six residual perforations (8.5%) following removal or extrusion. The mean retention rate for the T-tubes was 3.93 years for the total island tympanoplasty group and 3.58 years for the posterior palisade tympanoplasty group. The mean follow-up for total island tympanoplasty and posterior palisade tympanoplasty was 5.36 and 5.66 years, respectively.

Conclusion

Our data suggest that T-tube placement through cartilage tympanoplasty is worthwhile providing long-term ventilation to the middle ear and portends no higher risk for residual perforation than T-tube placement through native tympanic membrane.

### Postoperative outcomes after tympanoplasty for active versus inactive otitis media patients with tympanic membrane perforation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113bsTmJ]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare postoperative tympanoplasty outcomes between active versus inactive otitis media (OM) patients with tympanic membrane perforation.

Databases Reviewed

Medline via PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar for studies published from inception to March 1, 2023.

Methods

Studies of 15- to 60-year-old patients undergoing microscopic/endoscopic myringoplasty using underlay/overlay technique with reported postoperative mean hearing gain and graft uptake were included. Studies requiring simultaneous surgical procedures, reporting patients with comorbidities and with non-English full text articles were excluded. Articles were independently screened by two researchers with data extracted according to a predetermined proforma in Microsoft Excel. Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment was used for risk of bias evaluation of randomized studies and Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions for nonrandomized studies. Similar studies were pooled for meta-analysis using the inverse variance random effects model to calculate the mean difference and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for mean hearing gain and DerSimonian and Laird random effects model for graft uptake.

Results

Thirty-three studies comprising 2,373 patients met the inclusion/exclusion criteria, seven were pooled for meta-analysis. Included articles showed inactive OM patients have higher average postoperative mean hearing gain of 10.84 dB and graft uptake of 88.7% compared to active OM patients (9.15 dB and 84.2%). Meta-analysis of mean hearing gain (MD, -0.76 dB; 95% CI, -2.11 to 0.60; p = 0.27, moderate certainty) and graft uptake (OD, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.34–1.09; p = 0.10, moderate certainty) have an overall p value > 0.05.

Conclusion

There were no statistically significant differences in postoperative mean hearing gain and graft uptake between active and inactive OM patients undergoing tympanoplasty. Hence, tympanoplasty procedures should not be postponed solely because of patients' preoperative ear discharge status.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^115wS23m]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes — long-term tympanic membrane changes and subsequent surgery risk are described as follows: tubes produce visible tympanic membrane changes and may cause a small or trivial decrease in long-term hearing levels that do not appear to be clinically significant or require intervention in most patients; persistent perforation is the sequela most likely to require intervention, with 80%-90% success rates for surgical closure with a single outpatient procedure; treatment with tubes was associated with a 9.5-times greater risk of subsequent tympanoplasty versus middle ear disease not treated with tubes and a > 200-times greater risk versus no ear disease.

### Surgery for tympanic membrane retraction pockets [^115RNL97]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Tympanic membrane retractions are commonly managed by ENT surgeons. There is currently no consensus as to the indications, timing and options for management of this condition.

Objectives

To study the effectiveness of different surgical options in the management of tympanic membrane retractions.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2010 Issue 1); PubMed (1950 to 2010); EMBASE (1974 to 2010); CINAHL (1982 to 2010); BIOSIS Previews; ISI Web of Science; CAB Abstracts; LILACS; KoreaMed; IndMed; PakMediNet; China National Knowledge Infrastructure; ISCTRN; UKCRN; ICTRP and Google. The date of the search was 17 March 2010.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the surgical management of tympanic membrane retraction pockets in adults or children. Staging of the retraction using a known system must have been performed. Studies of cholesteatoma or perforations were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently collected and analysed data to minimise the effects of selection and reporting bias.

Main Results

Two RCTs were included, involving 71 participants. The first study showed no statistically significant benefit of cartilage graft tympanoplasty over a watch and wait policy for either disease progression or hearing outcome. The second showed no additional benefit from the insertion of ventilation tubes over cartilage tympanoplasty alone with regards to hearing outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

No evidence currently exists to either support or refute the role of surgery in the management of tympanic membrane retractions. Higher quality studies are much needed to ascertain this.

### Long-term outcomes of cartilage-buttressed T-tube tympanoplasty for prolonged middle ear ventilation [^116te48o]. The Laryngoscope (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To report on the safety and efficacy of cartilage-buttressed T-tube tympanoplasty for long-term middle ear ventilation, specifically by examining duration of tube survival, as well as adverse events associated with prolonged middle ear intubation, including persistent tympanic membrane perforation.

Study Design

Retrospective case series of patients undergoing cartilage-buttressed T-tube tympanoplasty between January 2005 and December 2016 in a tertiary-care neurotology private practice.

Methods

Patients who underwent cartilage T-tube tympanoplasty with complete pre- and postoperative audiometric data and a minimum follow-up duration of 12 months were analyzed. T-tube survival and adverse events including persistent tympanic membrane perforation were recorded and compared to published data for other long-term middle ear ventilation techniques.

Results

The study cohort included 72 cartilage-buttressed T-tube tympanoplasties in 68 patients. Median tube survival was 34 months (range, 2–131 months). Incidence of persistent tympanic membrane perforation (n = 1) was 1.4% CONCLUSIONS: Cartilage-buttressed T-tube tympanoplasty is a safe and effective means of accomplishing long-term middle ear ventilation with a considerably lower rate of persistent tympanic membrane perforation as compared to alternative methods of prolonged middle ear ventilation.

### Impact of mastoidectomy on simple tympanic membrane perforation repair [^1167uBPm]. The Laryngoscope (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Mastoidectomy has long been identified as an effective method of treatment for chronic ear infection. The effect of mastoidectomy on patients without evidence of active infectious disease remains highly debated and unproven. The objective in the study was to examine the impact of mastoidectomy on the repair of uncomplicated tympanic membrane perforations.

Study Design

Retrospective study of patients at tertiary referral center.

Methods

Four hundred eighty-four patients who underwent surgical repair of simple tympanic membrane perforations were identified and reviewed in a retrospective manner. Simple tympanic membrane perforations were defined as tympanic membrane perforations of any size and location without any of the following confounding variables: 1). active infection (active otorrhea, abnormal middle ear mucosa, or granulations tissue); 2). ossicular abnormalities (ossicular fixation, ossicular discontinuity, ossicular malformation, or ossicular absence); 3). cholesteatoma; or 4). prior attempt at tympanic membrane repair (prior tympanoplasty or mastoidectomy). Surgical outcome and clinical course were assessed to compare results of tympanic membrane perforation repair with and without canal wall up mastoidectomy.

Results

Tympanic membrane repair was equally effective in both groups at 91%. Hearing results were comparable. Development of persistent ipsilateral otological disease requiring a subsequent ipsilateral procedure was approximately twice as common in the tympanoplasty group. In the tympanoplasty group, 14.1% of patients underwent subsequent ipsilateral otological procedures, and 6.1% of patients in the tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy intact canal wall group underwent subsequent ipsilateral procedures (P < .05). The most common subsequent ipsilateral procedures were tympanoplasty, tympanostomy tube placement, tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy canal wall up, and tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy canal wall down, in that order. After including untreated tympanic membrane perforations as subsequent procedures, the adjusted rate of subsequent procedures was 15.5% in the tympanoplasty group and 12.2% in the tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy group (P > .05).

Conclusion

Mastoidectomy was not necessary for successful repair of simple tympanic membrane perforations. However, mastoidectomy impacted the clinical course in patients by reducing the number of patients requiring future procedures and by decreasing disease progression. This suggests that even in the absence of active evidence of infection, mastoidectomy improved the underlying disease process. Combining mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty during repair of simple perforations in patients with no active evidence of infection remains an appropriate option and may be valuable in reducing the need for future surgery.

### Repair of large traumatic tympanic membrane perforation with a steri-strips patch [^115r5wYJ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effects of the Steri-Strips patch (3M) on the treatment of large traumatic tympanic membrane perforations (TMP).

Study Design

Prospective, randomized, controlled.

Setting

Tertiary university hospital.

Subjects and Methods

A randomized prospective analysis was performed between February 2009 and January 2011 for the treatment of traumatic TMP larger than 50% of the entire tympanic membrane. The results of closure rate, closure time, hearing gain, and rate of otorrhea between conservative observation, paper patching, and Steri-Strips patching groups were compared.

Results

In total, 87 patients were analyzed in this study. The closure rates of the perforations in the Steri-Strips patching, paper patching, and observation groups were 93.3%, 84.2%, and 78.9%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in tympanic membrane closure rate between the 3 groups. The Steri-Strips technique decreased the need for repeat procedures. Overall, the Steri-Strips and paper patching groups showed shorter healing times compared with the observation group. However, there was an increased rate of otorrhea in the Steri-Strips group compared with the observation group.

Conclusion

Steri-Strips patching reduced the healing time and need for repeat procedures in patients with large traumatic TMPs. However, the occurrence of otorrhea was significantly more common in patients treated with the Steri-Strips technique.

### Achieving a successful closure of an anterior tympanic membrane perforation: evidence-based systematic review [^112Dnn2G]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives Surgical repair of a tympanic membrane perforation is a common otologic procedure. However, achieving a successful closure can be challenging, especially if the anterior margin of the tympanic membrane is involved. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature on evidence published in closure of anterior tympanic membrane perforations. Data Sources The following data sources were searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1997 to August, 3 2017), MEDLINE (February 1948 to August 3, 2017), and Embase (1975 to August 3, 2017). Data Extraction Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines were followed. For the purpose of this study, the inclusion criteria were as follows; (1) studies reporting surgical technique for closure of anterior tympanic membrane perforations, (2) primary cases only, (3) articles published in the English language, (4) minimum 6-month follow-up, and (5) recorded pre- and postoperative audiometry. The exclusion criteria were non-English language articles, revision surgery, and no audiometric outcomes. Results On initial search, a total of 181 articles were identified (PubMed, n = 136; Cochrane, n = 28; Embase, n = 17). Based on the criteria, 136 articles were excluded. Full text of 45 articles was reviewed, and a further 24 articles were excluded. A total of 21 articles fulfilled the criteria for study inclusion. Conclusions All published evidence is level 4. High-quality controlled studies are required to determine the most effective method for closure of anterior tympanic membrane perforation.

### Paper patching versus watchful waiting of traumatic tympanic membrane perforations: a meta-analysis [^112UCj4a]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

The aim of the study was to investigate the healing rates, the restoration of hearing, and the time for complete healing of paper patching versus watchful waiting for traumatic tympanic membrane perforations (TTMPs).

Study Design

Systematic review with meta analysis.

Methods

Publications were selected by a search on "PubMed", "Embase", and "Web of Science". A meta-analysis of risk ratios for paper patching (intervention arm) and watchful waiting (control arm) was performed.

Results

Five studies describing 393 TTMPs were included in the quantitative meta-analysis. TTMP healing rates ranged between 84.2% and 95.2% in the intervention arm and between 76.7% and 84.8% in the control arm. The pooled risk ratio of healed TTMPs was significantly higher in the intervention arm than in the control arm (risk ratio: 1.12, 95% confidence interval: 1.04–1.21).

Conclusions

TTMPs have high healing potential with and without intervention. The healing rate of paper patching was superior to that of watchful waiting alone.

### The effectiveness of bFGF in the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113cda1y]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Characteristics of the Studies

Of the 91 studies identified, a total of 14 studies with 1,072 patients were included in this meta-analysis, consisting of seven RCTs and seven non-RCTs (,–). The included studies were published between 2003 and 2018, with a range of follow-up time from 3 to 12 months. Perforations in three studies were chronic due to various causes, while perforations in the other studies were caused by trauma. All studies reported the closure rates (,–); only eight studies reported the healing time. Six studies provided the outcomes of hearing. The characteristics and statistics of the selected documents were summarized in Table 1. The detailed information of the bFGF application in each study was also summarized in Supplemental Table 1, including composition, manufacturer, concentration, doses, frequency, and duration.

### The effectiveness of bFGF in the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Vv2zx]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

This meta-analysis has identified that the application of bFGF can significantly enhance the closure rate as well as shorten healing time for the TM regeneration. There is no evidence, as assessed only from studies of acute perforations, to show that bFGF improves hearing. Given its ease, availability and safety, bFGF can be used effectively for the TM repair. Additional high-quality multi-center randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to further support its efficacy in different ethnic groups especially with chronic TM perforations.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^114EBGYM]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for acute otitis media, more specifically with respect to tympanostomy (AAO-HNSF), AAO-HNS 2022 guidelines recommend to do not place long-term tubes as initial surgery in pediatric patients meeting criteria for tube insertion unless there is a specific reason based on an anticipated need for prolonged middle ear ventilation beyond that of a short-term tube.

### Creating a stable tympanic membrane perforation using mitomycin C [^1139JXYb]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the ability of topically applied mitomycin C to create a stable tympanic membrane perforation.

Study Design and Setting

Twenty-four rats underwent subtotal removal of the tympanic membranes bilaterally. Forty ears received 0.2 mg/ml of mitomycin C. The remaining 8 received phosphate-buffered saline solution (control). Photographs taken every 3 to 5 days for 44 days were digitally scanned and computer analyzed to calculate the percentage of residual perforation. Application of solutions, photography, and data analysis were performed in a blinded fashion.

Results

The mitomycin C treated ears had delayed closure time and healing rate (from day 0 to 25) compared to the control group. All controls healed by day 14. By day 44, 92.5% of the mitomycin C treated ears healed.

Conclusion

Mitomycin C prolongs the closure and healing rate of myringotomies in rat tympanic membranes.

Significance

Myringotomy with concurrent mitomycin C application may be useful for creating an animal model for chronic tympanic membrane perforation and should be tested in human beings as a method to maintain myringotomy patency for long-term ventilation.

### The natural course of tympanic membrane retractions in the posterosuperior quadrant of pars tensa: a watchful waiting policy [^113vgXSM]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Medium credibility.

Owing to the small numbers of young children (n = 6, age ≤ 9 yr old), it was not possible to make any useful subanalysis in this age subgroup. Larger studies are needed to assess the effect of the wait-and-see policy for this specific age because of the higher rates upper respiratory tract infections and acute OME.

Strengths and Limitations

One of the strengths of this study was that it has focused primarily on retractions in the posterosuperior quadrant of the pars tensa, the most commonly affected locations of pars tensa retractions. Furthermore, in all patients oto-endoscopic images and audiometry were available at first and last visits after a mean follow-up of 64 months. This duration of follow-up is reasonably long and therefore made it possible to assess long-term effects of the wait-and-see policy on audiometric outcomes and progression of the retraction. Also, it allows this study to assess the long-term progression to cholesteatoma and tympanic membrane perforation. Furthermore, this study was the first to be conducted in a cohort consisting of both children and adults.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^112E3LjL]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Tympanostomy tube complications and sequelae — anesthesia-related mortality for children undergoing diverse procedures ranges from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 45,000 anesthetics delivered; the most common tube-related sequela is otorrhea, seen in approximately 16% of children within 4 weeks of surgery and 26% of children at any time the tube remains in place (mean, 12–14 months); complications include an obstructed tube lumen in 7% of intubated ears, premature extrusion in 4%, and tube displacement into the middle ear in 0.5%; the posttympanostomy sequela most likely to require intervention is persistent perforation, occurring in about 2% of children; and myringoplasty or tympanoplasty has an 80% to 90% success rate for surgical closure of persistent perforation with a single procedure.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^113tK9Np]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes in children — initial use of long-term tubes: The clinician should not place long-term tubes as initial surgery for children who meet criteria for tube insertion unless there is a specific reason based on an anticipated need for prolonged middle ear ventilation beyond that of a short-term tube. Recommendation against based on observational studies, with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade B with Level of confidence in evidence High, Exceptions None, and Policy level Recommendation. Benefits include avoiding unnecessary adverse events more common with long-term tubes (higher incidence of otorrhea, granulation tissue, tympanic membrane perforation), reducing long-term follow-up, and reducing risk of a retained tube beyond the necessary period of ventilation. Risks and costs for initial management are none, but there is some potential for repeat tubes that might have been avoided with a long-term tube and risk of missing or delayed diagnosis of OME after short-term tube extrusion. Differences of opinion note that 4 of 16 panel members (25%) felt the statement could unintentionally increase use of long-term tubes because of intentional vagueness in determining a need for ventilation beyond the duration of a short-term tube.

### Traumatic perforation of the tympanic membrane: a review of 80 cases [^115u61ca]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Traumatic perforation of the tympanic membrane (TPTM) is often encountered in primary care or in the emergency department (ED). Several therapeutic interventions have been described, but conservative follow-up until spontaneous complete recovery is the most common choice.

Objective

Our goal was to analyze the trauma mechanism, perforation characteristics, and outcome of patients with TPTM.

Methods

The study included patients examined in the ED of a tertiary, university-affiliated medical center because of TPTM between 2012 and 2016. Their medical records were retrospectively reviewed for demographics, trauma mechanism, clinical characteristics, and outcome. A phone survey was performed to obtain the missing information of all the patients who did not continue their follow-up in our outpatient clinic.

Results

We reviewed the histories of 80 patients with a mean age of 26.7 ± 14.6 years (20 children; 25%). TPTM was caused by blunt trauma in 45 patients (56%) and penetrating trauma in 35 patients (44%). Thirty-five patients (44%) completed their follow-up in the hospital outpatient clinic, with a mean duration of 6.2 weeks. Twenty-five patients (38%) completed their follow-up in a community-based otolaryngology clinic, 6 patients (9%) chose not to complete their follow-up, and 14 patients were lost to follow-up. Of the 60 patients who completed follow-up, 56 patients recovered spontaneously, 3 patients underwent successful tympanoplasty, and 1 patient was referred to surgery but was lost to follow-up. All children healed spontaneously.

Conclusion

TPTM was more common in young males with main mechanisms of blunt trauma (an assault) or cleaning the ear canal. All children demonstrated complete spontaneous recovery.

### A new ventilation tube for long-term middle ear ventilation [^113AHrqW]. The Laryngoscope (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

The treatment of secretory otitis media often requires repeated tubulation of the tympanic membrane as the standard ventilation tubes are extruded before the disease of the middle ear has remitted. The T-tube and its modification have been developed to remain longer in situ, often requiring surgical removal. The rates of subsequent persisting tympanic membrane perforations and granulations around the tube have been unacceptably high. In the search for a long-term ventilation tube with fewer complications, the Duravent tube (Smith and Nephew) has been developed. The aim of the study was to estimate duration in situ and observe complications in using the Duravent tube compared with standard tubes and T- tubes.

Study Design

Retrospective study.

Methods

In all, 51 patients have been treated with the Duravent tube over a 2-year period. In all, 72 Duravent tubes have been inserted. All patients were subsequently invited for a follow-up examination at a median time of 28 months (range, 11–43 mo) after the tube insertion and were followed up for 5 years.

Results

The duration in situ was optimal with a median duration of 17 months. The Duravent tube was extruded spontaneously in all but four cases in which surgical removal was necessary. The rate of persisting perforations of the tympanic membrane was low (4.2%) compared with 24% after the use of the T-tube. Likewise, the usual complications connected with long-term ventilation tubes were less frequent (14% compared with 35% when using the T-tube).

Conclusions

In the present study, the Duravent tube has proved superior to other known long-term ventilation tubes. The problem of granulations, otorrhoea, and tube occlusion was significantly less than reported in other studies using the T-tube.

### Long-term complications and surgical failures after ossiculoplasty [^111qndo1]. Otology & Neurotology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To study long-term complications after ossiculoplasty.

Study Design

Case series with chart review.

Setting

Tertiary care referral center otology practice.

Patients

One hundred ninety-five patients (18–88 yr of age) undergoing ossiculoplasty with tympanoplasty or tympanomastoidectomy using cartilage tympanic membrane grafts, retrograde mastoidectomy with canal wall reconstruction, or mastoid obliteration techniques between July 1998 and July 2012. The studied patients all had at least 3 years of clinical follow-up.

Outcome Measures

Incidence of long-term complications, including need for revision surgery, need for secondary ventilation tube placement, recurrence of conductive hearing loss (and related etiologies), recurrent cholesteatoma, and delayed graft failure (recurrent tympanic membrane perforation).

Results

Long-term complications were observed in 10.3% (20/195) of patients. 8.2% (16/195) required revision surgery, 10.2% (17/195) required secondary ventilation tube placement, 3.6% (7/195) experienced recurrence of conductive hearing loss, 4.1% (8/195) had delayed failure of tympanic membrane graft, and 1.5% (3/195) had recurrence of cholesteatoma. Recurrence of conductive hearing loss was caused by the displacement of prosthesis in 3 of 7 patients and extensive scar tissue formation without prosthesis displacement in 4 of 7 patients. Seventy-two percent obtained a postoperative pure-tone average - air-bone gap < 20dB. Forty-eight percent (93/195) obtained a hearing result worse than expected based on the ossiculoplasty outcome parameter staging index.

Conclusion

Long-term complications are a significant consideration in all the patients undergoing ossiculoplasty. Our data suggest that tobacco smoking, Eustachian tube dysfunction, and an unexpectedly poor hearing result on the first postoperative audiogram are all important risk factors for the development of significant complications.

### Surgical management of chronic otitis media: beyond tympanotomy tubes [^113N8BUY]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic ear disease encompasses a wide range of clinical entities amenable to medical and surgical intervention. The otolaryngologist must always consider the goals of surgery — first and foremost to achieve a safe ear. The least invasive procedure capable of eradicating disease is generally chosen. During surgery, a delicate balance has to exist between the careful preservation of function and the aggressive prevention of potentially recurrent disease. Postoperatively, thorough follow-up and good judgment are paramount in avoiding complications and preventing unnecessary additional surgical procedures.

### The latest progress of tympanic membrane repair materials [^116bs8ig]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2022). Medium credibility.

Tympanic membrane perforation is a common disease in otolaryngology, manifested as hearing loss, chronic infection, and often caused by middle ear trauma and infection. Choosing suitable repair materials to repair the perforation of the tympanic membrane is to achieve the purpose of improving the hearing of the patient and improving the discharge of pus. Autologous tissues, such as tragus perichondrium, temporal muscle fascia, tragus cartilage, fat, etc., are commonly used in clinical repair materials, and other materials include foreign bodies and allogeneic materials. Others include foreign bodies and foreign body materials. With the development of medicine and tissue engineering, many synthetic materials have achieved good results in repairing the tympanic membrane and improving hearing. The combined 3D printing technology of tympanic membrane regeneration and bioengineering aims to improve the success rate of surgery, increase the availability of different stents, and provide innovation repair materials and simplify surgical techniques (Sagiv et al., 2020 [1]). This article aims to describe the latest developments in the repair of tympanic membranes with autologous materials, foreign bodies and foreign materials, and artificial synthetic materials.

### AAO-HNSF releases clinical practice guideline on acute… [^1137ob5u]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Sufficient dosing of oral analgesics is essential for alleviating discomfort and allowing patients to rest and continue their normal activities.
- Topical therapy for uncomplicated AOE is the first-line treatment, with no significant differences between different drug classes.
- If a patient has AOE with a perforated tympanic membrane, or if perforation is due to tympanostomy tube placement, then a non-ototoxic topical preparation is advised.
- If AOE is complicated by progression beyond the ear canal, systemic antimicrobial agents may be warranted. From the AFP Editors. Physicians should prescribe topical therapy initially for diffuse uncomplicated AOE. If a patient's tympanic membrane is perforated, including from a tympanostomy tube, the physician should prescribe a non-ototoxic topical preparation. A variety of topical therapies are approved by the U. S.

For patients two years or older, the management course for diffuse AOE is as follows: Analgesics should be prescribed based on the severity of the patient's pain. If the condition has extended beyond the ear canal or if indications for systemic therapy are present, systemic antimicrobials active against Pseudomonas aeruginosaand Staphylococcus aureus should be prescribed. If needed based on the underlying condition, other management options should also be provided. If the condition has not extended beyond the ear canal and no indications for systemic therapy are present, the patient should be evaluated for perforated tympanic membrane or tympanostomy tubes. If either is present, topical therapy with a non-ototoxic preparation should be prescribed. If neither is present, topical therapy based on benefits, cost, adherence, and patient preference should be considered. Either way, the patient should be evaluated for an ear canal obstruction.

If an obstruction is found, an aural toilet should be performed to remove the debris, and a wick should be placed if edema prevents administration of the medication. The patient should be counseled about administering ear drops, regardless of whether an obstruction is present. All patients should be evaluated in 48 to 72 hours to determine whether there has been any improvement in symptoms.

### A review on the use of hyaluronic acid in tympanic membrane wound healing [^1138NymL]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tympanic membrane perforation represents a significant morbidity, especially if it occurs during a child's speech and language development. Recently, there has been an increased interest in hyaluronic-acid-related research and products as a potential therapeutic option for tympanic membrane perforation repair.

Areas Covered

This review describes the physical and chemical properties of hyaluronic acid and examines the role of hyaluronic acid in wound healing, in particular on the tympanic membrane. It also reviews the safety and efficacy of hyaluronic acid and its derivatives in animal studies as well as in clinical trials. Finally, it considers the potential future clinical applications in tympanic membrane perforation repair.

Expert Opinion

Hyaluronic acid has been found to accelerate tympanic membrane perforation closure, shorten the period of healing, produce a better quality neo-membrane and improve hearing. More importantly, hyaluronic acid is biodegradable, safe and biocompatible in the ear. Recently, there has been a trend towards the use of modified hyaluronic acid. However, there is a lack of higher-level evidence to support the use of hyaluronic acid in tympanic membrane perforations in the clinical setting. More large-scale randomised control trials are warranted before these bio-devices will be used routinely.

### The impact of platelet-derived growth factor on closure of chronic tympanic membrane perforations: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^1136NpAn]. Otology & Neurotology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Patients with tympanic membrane (TM) perforations often have infections, and repetitive topical treatment may be required. These infections can be prevented by permanent closure of the TM perforation. Different surgical treatment options have been described, but noninvasive techniques may be preferred as they carry less risk than surgery. One noninvasive approach is to induce wound healing by application of growth factors. The effect and clinical use of applying topical platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) for decrease of size and closure of chronic TM perforations is evaluated.

Study Design

Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study.

Setting

Tertiary referral center.

Patients

Twenty patients with chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma for more than 3 months.

Intervention

Topical treatment with PDGF or placebo applied weekly to the TM for 6 weeks.

Main Outcome Measures

Success rate, defined as a reduction of perforation size of 50% or more to determine relative changes of the perforation size; effect of initial size and location of TM perforation on success rate; and air and bone conduction thresholds to determine air-bone gap measured before treatment.

Results

Randomization made matching pretreatment perforation size of the 2 study groups impossible, and the initial rate perforation/TM was significantly smaller in the PDGF group. No difference between the 2 groups was found for perforation/TM less than 10%. However, success rate did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (power = 0.8), and the effect of PDGF was found to be small (-2%; standard deviation, ± 49%). Initial size and position of the TM perforation were not significant factors determining success. Mean air-bone gap for the frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz was 22.5 dB.

Conclusion

The topical application of PDGF as an office treatment for chronic otitis media is not a favorable alternative to surgery.

### Long-term tympanic membrane pathology dynamics and spontaneous healing in chronic suppurative otitis media [^116mFQG9]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Children in the developing parts of the world have a high prevalence of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). It is estimated that 65 to 330 million people worldwide have CSOM, yet very little is known about the natural course of the disease. The Inuit population of the Arctic regions is among those with the highest prevalences of CSOM. The aim of this study was to examine the long-term tympanic membrane changes since childhood among Inuit adolescents in Greenland and estimate the proportion of individuals affected by CSOM.

Methods

Follow-up study (2009) on a population-based cohort of 591 children originally examined during 1993 to 1994 at 3 to 8 years of age. Follow-up was attempted among 348 individuals still living in the areas. Video otoscopy and tympanometry were used. Data on otologic disease, ear surgery, and antibiotic use for otitis media were collected from medical records.

Results

Of 226 participants (65% of those contacted; median age, 22 years), 28 (12%) had present CSOM or had been surgically treated. Eleven were new cases of CSOM not seen between 1993 and 1994. Of those with CSOM in the initial study, 39% had healed spontaneously. The proportion of spontaneous healing was not influenced by the age at which CSOM was diagnosed in the initial study. Thirty-nine individuals (17%) had CSOM in either the initial study or at follow-up. Of these, 2 had never received antibiotic treatment for otitis media, and 15 had been treated less than 3 times. Eighty individuals (35%) at follow-up had CSOM, had undergone ear surgery, or had sequelae in the form of circular atrophy or myringosclerosis.

Conclusions

The proportion of spontaneous healing and the findings of new cases show that CSOM is a dynamic disease both on the individual as well as on the population level. Every third participant at follow-up had a perforation or sequelae from recurrent or long-lasting perforations, indicating a burden of disease from otitis media larger than what can be estimated in cross-sectional studies. There is a potential for increased treatment of otitis media in this population, which requires raised awareness of the disease in the population and the creation of guidelines customized to conditions in Greenland.

### Paediatric cogan ´ s syndrome-review of literature, case report and practical approach to diagnosis and management [^114XgjPP]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 4
Clinical outcome with respect to systemic treatment modality. Patients from the literature supplemented by our patient. N = 55

Conventional DMARDs included: MTX, AZA, CsA, MMF, CYC. Secondary ocular complications included a glaucoma and a cataract. All patients received topical steroids

Importantly, auditory improvement with pharmacological treatment may be expected only in early stages of the disease before the development of irreversible fibrosis and osteoneogenesis within the organ of Corti. For patients, whose hearing could not be salvaged by pharmacological methods, cochlear implantation (CI) offers an excellent option.

Within the adult CS population, 51 patients have been implanted. Almost half of these patients (23/50, 46%) had a cochlear ossification, which may pose a surgical challenge. However, this obstacle could be managed in all patients by tunnelling through the ossified portion or scala vestibuli electrode insertion. Only 4/51 (8%) patients experienced complications related to the procedure and 6/51 (12%) developed a relapse of CS (interstitial keratitis in 4 and systemic symptoms in 1) immediately after the surgery. Excellent word and sentence recognition scores were reported in 43/46 (93%) after CI. In the present cohort of paediatric CS patients, CI has been shown feasible and beneficial. Altogether 7 paediatric CS patients have undergone a successful CI without complications.

Another reported therapeutic modality for sudden hearing loss are intratympanic steroid injections. These allow for achievement of higher concentrations of steroids in the cochlear fluid avoiding negative side effects of high dose systemic therapy. However, the procedure is associated with a risk of inducing acute middle ear infections or persistent perforation of the tympanic membrane. In addition, there is little evidence for its long-term efficacy in CS patients. In a study done by Parnes et al. 2 patients with CS have undergone repeated intratympanic steroid injections. A clear long-term benefit has been demonstrated in one of them, whereas the other one showed only a transient improvement. The latter developed repeated middle ear infections as a result of the procedure. Looking at our paediatric data, intratympanic steroid injections have been reported in a single child with CS and resulted in no benefit.

### The effectiveness of bFGF in the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116YZUUp]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

After searching, the 91 articles were independently evaluated by two authors (J.H. and B.M.T.) with the following inclusion criteria: 1) observational (retrospective or prospective) or treatment (randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) studies; 2) studies that reported the outcomes on the application of bFGF in adult or pediatric populations. Studies without a control group were excluded. Animal studies, in vitro studies, review studies, and case reports were excluded as well. A third author (Y.S.) was available when any disagreement presented between these two authors. A total of 14 studies were selected for further analysis from the 91 studies through screening the abstract and full texts. Subsequently, the quality of the included studies was judged according to the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias through Review Manager 5.3 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark) (Fig. 2).

FIG. 2
Risk of bias summary for enrolled studies. Green, yellow, and red circles indicate a low, unclear, and high risk of bias, respectively.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure was the complete closure rate in the bFGF treatment group versus the complete closure rate in the control group. The secondary outcomes were the differences in healing time and improvement in hearing. The following data was taken or derived from the full report of the 14 studies for both the treatment and control groups: 1) number of subjects, 2) percentage closure, 3) mean and standard deviation (SD) of closure time in days, 4) mean and SD of four frequency (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz) average of air-conduction threshold in decibels (dB) obtained via standard pure-tone audiometric testing. Also recorded were 1) first author, 2) year of publication, 3) the study design (RCT or non-RCT), and 4) size of perforation targeted by the study.

### Long-term results and prognostic factors of underlay myringoplasty in pars tensa atelectasis in children [^1153QwS9]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Pars tensa retraction is a frequent condition in chronic otitis media, and there is a large diversity of opinions regarding its management.

Objective

To report the long-term results and prognostic factors of myringoplasty in pediatric patients with grade 5 pars tensa atelectasis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was an observational, retrospective case review, conducted at a referral university hospital, of children undergoing surgical intervention for dry tympanic disruption after a clinical history of tensa retraction with a transcanal or postauricular approach under general anesthesia.

Interventions

Underlay myringoplasty with temporalis fascia or tragal perichondrium by transcanal or postauricular approach under general anesthesia.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Anatomical results are reported with a minimum follow-up of 5 years analyzing perforation or retraction of the neotympanum. Age; sex; side, position, and size of the eardrum disruption; surgical approach; graft material; and presence of contralateral disease were correlated with anatomical failure.

Results

The population included 33 girls and 28 boys undergoing 65 interventions; the age varied from 4 to 16 years (mean [SD], 10 [3.2] years). An intact tympanic membrane was obtained in 58 cases (89.2%) with a follow-up varying from 5 to 14 years (mean follow-up, 9 years). None of the variables analyzed significantly predisposed patients to tympanic perforation after surgical repair. There were no new progressive retractions.

Conclusions and Relevance

Tensa retraction resulting in a tympanic disruption can be cured by underlay myringoplasty with perichondrium or temporalis fascia with results similar to those of simple tympanic perforations without recurrent retraction even in the long-term period.

### Epidemiology of persistent tympanic membrane perforations subsequent to tympanostomy tubes assessed with real world data [^112GsJsP]. Otology & Neurotology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To quantify the incidence of persistent tympanic membrane perforation (TMP) after tympanostomy tube (TT) surgery using a large population-based cohort.

Study Design

A retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Medicaid claims data from 1999 to 2006.

Patients

We studied healthy children who had Medicaid eligibility within 6 months of birth that received TTs and had 2 to 7 years of follow-up.

Main Outcome Measures

We operationalized persistent TMP by a charge for tympanoplasty and/or one or more diagnoses of TMP.

Results

We identified 47,724 children who received TTs and had ≥ 2 years eligibility. The incidence of persistent TMP varied, based on definition and follow-up. The 2 and 7-year TMP rates were: 0.38% and 3.81% for two TMP diagnoses 6 months apart or tympanoplasty; 0.26% and 2.94% for two TMP diagnoses 6 months apart; 0.13% and 1.73% for tympanoplasty, alone; 0.04% and 1.21% for tympanoplasty preceded by one TMP diagnosis; and 0.01% and 0.52% for tympanoplasty and two TMP diagnoses 6 months apart. Reinserting TTs was associated with an increased likelihood of persistent TMP (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.98, 95% CI 1.49–2.63). Each year increase in age was associated with 49% increase in the risk of persistent TMP.

Conclusion

Billing claims data may be used to assess the rate of persistent TMP after TT placement in large populations, yielding results consistent with findings from cohort studies and meta-analyses. Our findings may serve as the basis for future TMP research using real world datasets.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^112UW88w]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Our trial supports the notion that asymptomatic bulging of the tympanic membrane is an important predictor of AOM and perforation; this has not been emphasised in the AAP and AAFP guideline. Furthermore, the implications of withholding antibiotic therapy in children with bulging eardrums have not previously been evaluated in high quality studies. Guidelines for management of AOM in Indigenous children define AOM as middle ear effusion with either bulging of the tympanic membrane, recent discharge, ear pain, or redness. There is no option to withhold antibiotics in an Aboriginal child with AOM; for children in whom AOM is associated with perforation, longer courses of antibiotics are recommended. Our RCT supports that recommendation.

A recent meta-analysis of individual patient data from studies in low-risk populations identified subgroups most likely to benefit from antibiotic therapy. In children younger than 2 years of age with bilateral acute otitis media, 55% of controls and 30% on antibiotics still had pain, fever, or both at 3–7 days, with a rate difference between these groups of -25% (95% CI -36% to -14%), resulting in a number-needed-to-treat (NNT) of four children. In children with otorrhoea the rate difference and NNT, respectively, were -36% (-53% to -19%) and three, whereas in children without otorrhoea the equivalent values were -14% (-23% to -5%) and eight. From our results in Aboriginal children (Table 2), the NNT would be about ten for normalisation of ears, about six for prevention of perforation, and about four for either beneficial outcome. If compliance could be guaranteed in Aboriginal children, each NNT would likely be reduced.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^114dmYaq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes in children — adverse events and complications include tympanostomy tube otorrhea (TTO) seen in approximately 16% within 4 weeks and 26% at any time while the tube remains in place; most tubes stay 8 to 18 months with approximately 7% experiencing recurrent TTO, and a Netherlands cohort reported 52% TTO with 3.9% chronic; other complications include tube blockage 7% to 10%, granulation tissue 4%, premature extrusion 4%, and tube displacement 0.5% or lower; myringosclerosis is more common in intubated ears but does not typically cause clinically significant hearing loss; persistent tympanic membrane perforation occurs in 1% to 6% overall, near 3% at 7 years in a Medicaid review, 1% after extrusion, and 2.6% required removal of retained tubes, with repeat tube insertion and older age at surgery associated with perforation; TTO risk factors included young age, recurrent AOM as primary indication, older siblings, and frequent upper respiratory infections.

### Surgical interventions for Ménière's disease [^115fqk62]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Selective reporting

Kitahara 2016 used a ratio of pre/post‐treatment values to define vertigo control as "better", "worse" or "no change". However, the authors only report the number of participants in whom vertigo resolved completely over the course of the study. Although the study was prospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, the only outcome listed here is "all cause mortality". This seems a surprising choice of primary outcome measure (and is also not reported in the publication). There was no report of any adverse events, including relatively common complications of ventilation tube placement, such as otorrhoea or tympanic membrane perforation. We rated it as high risk.

Thomsen 1981 did not publish a protocol. It was unclear if all outcomes are fully reported. Also, there were no adverse events published at the 12‐month follow‐up. We rated it as unclear risk.

Other potential sources of bias

No additional sources of bias were identified in Kitahara 2016.

We are aware that the data presented in Thomsen 1981 were subsequently re‐analysed leading to different conclusions (Welling 2000). Also, there was no control around how patients were treated medically during the nine‐year follow‐up study, which could have a significant impact on the results. We rated it as high risk.

Effects of interventions

See: Table 1; Table 2

1. Ventilation tubes compared to no intervention (plus medical therapy for both groups)

This comparison was addressed by Kitahara 2016. All follow‐up was conducted at 24 months.

1.1. Improvement in vertigo

1.1.1. Global score

This study did not consider improvement in vertigo using a global score.

1.1.2. Vertigo frequency

The study did not report at this time point.

1.1.2.2. 6 to ≤ 12 months

The study did not report at this time point.

The risk ratio (RR) for improvement in the frequency of vertigo (complete resolution) for those receiving ventilation tubes was 1.55 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 1.97; 1 study; 133 participants; Analysis 1.1; very low‐certainty evidence).

1.2. Change in vertigo

This outcome was not reported.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112R4BHy]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) guideline — action statements report that the development group made strong recommendations that (1) clinicians should assess patients with AOE for pain and recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain and (2) clinicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The development group made recommendations that (1) clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal; (2) clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); (3) clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; (4) clinicians should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed; (5) clinicians should prescribe a non-ototoxic preparation when the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube; and (6) clinicians should reassess the patient who fails to respond to initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^116TrQum]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Ear tubes — complications and tube course include perforation, tube position, and extrusion/retention timelines. Perforation risk is reported as "About 1–2 out of every 100 children" after a short-term tube, with "up to 1 in every 5 children" after a long-term tube, and "The hole will often close on its own" or can be repaired. Tubes almost always fall out into the ear canal, though "Very rarely" one can fall "into the middle ear". Most tubes come out "within 12 to 24 months", while tubes still present "after 2 to 3 years" can be removed; early extrusion can occur "before 6 months". Scarring on the eardrum is "usually of no concern".

### Otological and audiological outcomes five years after tympanostomy in early childhood [^114K5NyH]. The Laryngoscope (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Ventilation tubes in the treatment of otitis media in young children remain controversial. Despite abundant research, few prospective long-term follow-up studies have included even a minority of patients under 1 year old. We investigated long-term otological and audiological outcomes in children with recurrent acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion, who were treated early with ventilation tubes.

Study Design

Prospective follow-up.

Methods

Three hundred five children under 17 months of age received a primary tympanostomy in the Central Hospital of Central Finland (Jyväskylä, Finland), and those 281 (92.1%) who were monitored prospectively for 5 years made up the study group. At the final examination, pneumatic otoscope and otomicroscope were used and pure-tone audiometric thresholds of air and bone conduction were measured to define the hearing levels (mean of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 KHz thresholds).

Results

Of ears, 67.3% were healed, 7.1% had a retraction of tympanic membrane in pars flaccida and 9.6% in pars tensa, 7.5% had an ongoing otitis media with effusion, 3.9% had a ventilation tube in place, and 4.6% had a tympanic membrane perforation with mean hearing levels of 7.6, 9.0, 16.0, 18.5, 10.5, and 17.7 dB, respectively.

Conclusions

Hearing in general was well preserved, and no ear presented with adhesive otitis media or cholesteatoma. Adverse otological and audiological outcomes of these young children did not exceed those presented by others for older counterparts. Tympanic membrane perforations, ongoing otitis media with effusion, and pars tensa retractions were causes of mild conductive hearing loss. Because one third of ears continued to have middle ear disease or sequelae, we emphasize the proper follow-up and restoration of middle ear ventilation with repeat ventilation tubes if not otherwise achieved.

### Systemic antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^113KJ5fL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Systemic antibiotics are commonly used to treat people with CSOM. This is the first update to the review published in 2021, and is one of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM.

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic antibiotics compared to placebo, no treatment, or another systemic antibiotic in people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose, and Throat Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, and two clinical trials registers to 15 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing systemic antibiotics (oral, injection) to placebo/no treatment or other systemic antibiotics with at least a one-week follow-up period, involving people with chronic (at least two weeks) ear discharge of unknown cause or due to CSOM. Other treatments were allowed if both treatment and control arms received it.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not, measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks); health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia)/discomfort/local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications, and ototoxicity measured in several ways. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

This update found three new studies (390 participants). Overall, we included 21 studies (2525 participants). We report four core comparisons below, and describe an additional four in the Results section of the review. 1. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo It is very uncertain from a single study if there is a difference between systemic (intravenous) antibiotics and placebo in the resolution of ear discharge between one and two weeks (risk ratio (RR) 8.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88 to 38.21; 1 study, 33 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The study did not report results for resolution of ear discharge after two weeks, or health-related quality of life. The evidence is very uncertain for hearing and serious (intracranial) complications. The study did not report ear pain and suspected ototoxicity. 2. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo (both study arms received topical antibiotics) Seven studies assessed this comparison, with five presenting usable data. There may be little or no difference between oral ciprofloxacin and placebo/no treatment (with all participants receiving ciprofloxacin ear drops) in the resolution of ear discharge between one and two weeks (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.17; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 300 participants; low-certainty evidence), with similar results at two to four weeks. One study reported outcomes beyond four weeks, but the results were not usable. No studies reported health-related quality of life. The evidence is very uncertain for ear pain, serious complications, and suspected ototoxicity. 3. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo (plus topical antibiotics and topical steroids in both study arms) Two studies used topical antibiotics plus topical steroids as background treatment in both arms. It is very uncertain if there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge between metronidazole and placebo at two to four weeks (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.65; 1 study, 30 participants). This study did not report other outcomes. It is also very uncertain if co-trimoxazole improved resolution of ear discharge after four weeks compared to placebo (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.16; 1 study, 98 participants; very low-certainty evidence). From the narrative reporting of one study, there was no evidence of a difference between groups for health-related quality of life, hearing, or serious complications (very low-certainty evidence). 4. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo (plus topical antiseptics in both study arms) One study (136 participants) used topical antiseptics as background treatment in both arms, and found no difference in the resolution of ear discharge between the amoxicillin and no-treatment groups at three to four months (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.41; 136 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The narrative report indicated no evidence of differences in hearing or suspected ototoxicity (very low-certainty evidence). The study reported no other outcomes. Limitations include heterogeneity in the duration and definition of CSOM used by studies included in the review. Although we planned subgroup analyses for different participant characteristics, treatment duration, and spectrum of antibiotic activity, we did not perform these analyses due to lack of available data.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence available to determine whether systemic antibiotics are effective in achieving resolution of ear discharge in people with CSOM is limited. We are very uncertain if systemic antibiotics, when used alone (with or without aural toileting (ear cleaning)), are more effective than placebo or no treatment. When added to an intervention such as topical antibiotics, there may be little or no difference in resolution of ear discharge (very low-certainty evidence). Data were only available for certain classes of antibiotics; it is very uncertain whether one class of systemic antibiotic is more effective than another. Harmful effects of systemic antibiotics were poorly reported in the included studies.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis: timing of elective removal of tympanostomy tubes [^11744GX9]. The Laryngoscope (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective(S)

Tympanostomy tube (TT) placement is the most common surgical procedure in children. Less than 10% of TT do not self-extrude. This study is a systematic review (SR) on elective TT removal in the pediatric population: timing, perforation rates, and role of simultaneous repair. A PICOTS (population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing, setting) question was formulated: In pediatric patients who have retained TT, what is the preferred time to elective removal of such tubes, and what are the outcomes in terms of perforation rates? Does an intervention at the time of TT removal improve perforation rates?

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

We searched four major electronic databases: EMBASE, MEDLINE, CDSR, CCRCT for articles published prior to 02/19/20. EndNote® was used to gather references, review abstracts, and obtain full text articles. Inclusion criteria were studies reporting patients aged 0 to 18years undergoing elective TT removal with follow-up greater than 3months. Exclusion criteria included patients > 18years, duplicate patient series, or case series with fewer than five patients. Articles that were not available in English, not available in full text, and those that only addressed long-acting TT were excluded. Data were pooled and meta-analysis was conducted to examine how timing of TT removal, patching of the tympanic membrane, or any TM intervention at TT removal affected outcomes.

Results

A total of 1,064 references were found. We identified 63 unique studies for full text review. Of these, 17 were selected for SR. MINORS (Methodological Index for Nonrandomized Studies) scores were low-revealing high bias among the studies. Reported perforation rates after elective TT removal ranged from 0% to 57%. Four studies had data suitable for comparative meta-analysis, which showed a significant increase in perforation rates after elective removal of TT after 3years compared to removal prior to 3years (OR 2.89; CI 1.78–4.69). No difference in perforation rates were identified when TM intervention vs. no intervention at time of TT removal was performed (six studies: OR 1.21; CI 0.71–2.07). No difference in perforation rates was identified when the type of TM intervention was compared, including freshening of TM edges, to patching with various materials (paper, fat, gelfoam®/gelfilm®, Trichloroacetic acid) (three studies: OR 1.07; CI 0.52–2.19).

Conclusion

From the data reviewed in this SR and meta-analysis, elective TT removal at or prior to 3years' retention showed decreased perforation rates. However, TM intervention at the time of TT removal was not shown to lower perforation rates. In the absence of tube complications such as granuloma formation, nonfunctional tube, or chronic tube otorrhea, it may be reasonable to wait up to 3years to electively remove a retained TT.

### Outcomes after tympanic membrane perforation during primary stapes surgery for otosclerosis [^113GixEp]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective/Hypothesis

Stapes surgery is occasionally complicated by an intraoperative tympanic membrane perforation (ITMP), traditionally indicating abortion of the procedure due to concerns for postoperative infection and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). This work examines outcomes and complications in completed primary stapes surgeries with and without ITMP.

Study Design

Retrospective review.

Methods

All patients diagnosed with otosclerosis between February 2008 and September 2017 at a tertiary otology referral center were reviewed retrospectively. Primary outcome measures were post-operative air-bone gap (ABG), air conduction and bone conduction pure tone averages, and post-operative complications.

Results

Review revealed 652 primary stapes operations meeting inclusion criteria, of which ITMP occurred in 10. There were no significant differences in pre-operative hearing metrics or demographic characteristics between ears with and without ITMP. There were also no significant differences in post-operative ABG (6.4 vs. 8.0dB HL, P = 0.43) or change in ABG after surgery (-21.6 vs. -18.2dB, P = 0.34) between these two groups. Patients with ITMP were more likely to complain of post-operative dysgeusia (30.0% vs. 5.3%, P = 0.015) but were no more likely to develop reparative granuloma, otitis media, or SNHL (P > .05).

Conclusions

The first review of ITMP and hearing outcomes after stapes surgery is presented. Our findings suggest that it is likely safe and appropriate to proceed with primary stapes surgery and concurrent tympanoplasty in the presence of a small ITMP with minimal risk of infection, SNHL, or worsened hearing outcomes.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^116ziDYg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — tympanometry after pneumatic otoscopy is directed as follows: Clinicians should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy; this is a Strong recommendation based on extrapolation of systematic reviews of diagnostic studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is stated as Grade B with extrapolation from cross-sectional studies using a consistent reference standard for tympanometry as a primary diagnostic method, and the level of confidence in evidence is high for primary diagnosis and medium for use as an adjunct to pneumatic otoscopy. Benefits include improved diagnostic accuracy, confirmation of suspected OME, objective information regarding middle ear status, differentiation of OME versus tympanic membrane perforation by ear canal volume, and prognostic information, whereas risks, harms, and costs include cost, lack of access, equipment calibration and maintenance, and misinterpretation of findings; the benefit–harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit.

### Traumatic tympanic membrane perforations diagnosed in emergency departments [^111VRipi]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs) are frequent events leading to evaluation in the primary care and otolaryngology offices or the emergency department (ED). Despite specific warning labels on packaging of cotton-tipped applicators regarding the risk of injury to the ear canal with personal use, these products are commonly used to remove ear cerumen.

Objective

To analyze the mechanism of injury for traumatic TMPs among patients presenting to the ED.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cross-sectional analysis of cases from 100 emergency departments in the United States. The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System was searched on April 3, 2015, for ear-related injuries with analysis information regarding patient age, patient sex, time and date of injury, specific injury diagnoses, and specific injury mechanisms that occurred across 5 years, from January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2014.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Diagnoses of traumatic TMP documented in the ED visit record as well as patient demographics, diagnoses, and other aspects of the injury, including mechanism of injury.

Results

There were 949 case entries in the database for traumatic TMP, which extrapolates to 4852 ED visits nationally. Of 949 patients evaluated, 568 (59.8%) were men and 381 (40.2%) were women resulting in a male to female ratio of 1.49:1. Most injuries occurred in patients 18 years or younger (602 of 949 [63.4%]) with children younger than 6 years most at risk (331 of 949 [34.9%]). Ear canal instrumentation including foreign bodies was noted in 581 of 949 cases (61.2%), with cotton-tipped applicators noted in 261 (44.9%) of these cases. While foreign body instrumentation represented the leading cause of traumatic TMP in patients aged 0 to 5 years (284 of 331 cases [85.8%]), 6 to 12 years (108 of 158 [68.4%]), 19 to 36 years (85 of 223 [38.1%]), 37 to 54 years (48 of 91 [52.7%]), and 55 years or older (22 of 33 [66.7%]), water trauma was the leading cause of TMP in patients aged 13 to 18 years (43 of 113 cases [38.1%]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Traumatic TMP represents a common reason for evaluation in the ED. Despite common warnings regarding risk of injury to the tympanic membrane with use of a cotton-tipped applicator, it is still a major cause of traumatic TMPs. Other injury mechanisms also play an important role in the teenage and young adult populations.

### Outcomes in children with perforated tympanic membranes after tympanostomy tube placement: results using a pilot treatment algorithm [^1152AasA]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

The objective of this study was to examine the success of a pilot treatment algorithm for tympanic membrane perforations in children after tympanostomy tube placement.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective chart review of children with diagnosed tympanic membrane perforations after tympanostomy tube placement from 1998 to 2003 at a tertiary care children's hospital was performed. The patients had been treated according to an algorithm used by 2 pediatric otolaryngologists for management of tympanic membrane perforations: observation vs myringoplasty. Success rates were examined.

Results

Ninety-five children were identified, 27% of whom had nonhealing perforations after tube extrusion; 73% of the perforations were caused by a retained tube. The median duration of tube retention was 48 months, ranging from 13 to 120 months. After the treatment protocol, 76% of the patients underwent gelatin film or paper patch myringoplasty, 23% had adipose myringoplasty, and 1% were observed. Overall, 91% had healed perforations after the first intervention. Among those requiring a second intervention, the sizes of initial perforations were between 15% and 40%, with postrepair perforation sizes between 5% and 40%. In addition, 75% of those requiring a second intervention underwent tympanoplasty repair and 25% had fat patch myringoplasty. None required a third intervention.

Conclusions

Our treatment algorithm for children with tympanic membrane perforations after tympanostomy tube placement appears to be successful and is an excellent model for other clinicians.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^112o8X3F]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes in children — ventilation duration, device types, and when to consider long-term tubes: Short-term tubes usually afford 8 to 18 months of middle ear ventilation, with Shepard usually extruding by 8 months; commonly used long-term tubes typically remain in place for 2 years or longer, and subannular ventilation tubes achieve long-term ventilation with median 35 months. The main benefit of T-tubes is prolonged ventilation but they are accompanied by increased risk of perforation, myringosclerosis, granulation tissue, cholesteatoma, and chronic otorrhea. About 25% of children need a second set of short-term tympanostomy tubes and about 8% require a third set, with additional risk factors for repeat surgery including having a parent who is a smoker, daycare attendance, breastfeeding for under 3 months, pacifier use, tympanic membrane atelectasis, male sex, asthma, gastrointestinal disease, and prematurity; however, there are no prospective studies to identify specific risk factors that identify children who would benefit from initial long-term tube placement. Consideration for placement of long-term tympanostomy tubes may be reserved for a subset with conditions such as cleft palate, Trisomy 21, or stenotic ear canals that make short-term tube placement difficult or impossible; other relative indications include an atrophic or atelectatic tympanic membrane or a history of premature extrusion of at least 2 sets of prior short-term tubes, and less often family preference to avoid multiple exposures to general anesthesia.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^116yKq2Q]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) with suspected or confirmed tympanic membrane perforation — topical agent selection and ototoxicity cautions are specified as follows: If the tympanic membrane is known or suspected to be nonintact, topical drops that contain alcohol, have a low pH (most acidifying/antiseptic agents), or both should be avoided because of pain and potential ototoxicity, and substances with ototoxic potential (eg, aminoglycosides, alcohol) should not be used when the tympanic membrane is perforated and the middle ear space is open, because the risk of ototoxic injury outweighs the benefits compared with non-ototoxic antimicrobials with equal efficacy; the only topical antimicrobials approved by the FDA (December 2005) for middle ear use are quinolone drops; warnings for neomycin-containing products note that neomycin can induce permanent sensorineural hearing loss, therapy should be limited to 10 consecutive days, and CORTISPORIN Otic Suspension should not be used in any patient with a perforated tympanic membrane; identification of persistent patency is aided by the facts that children with tubes inserted more than 1 year ago should also have the tympanic membrane carefully assessed, since in some cases the tube may remain functional for 3 years or longer, and individuals who taste substances placed into their ear or who can expel air out of their ear canal by pinched nose blowing can be assumed to have a perforation.

### Tympanic membrane regeneration therapy… [^1115VEZM]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Minimally invasive ambulatory surgical procedures, using growth factors such as autologous serum eardrops1 and basic fibroblast growth factor, 2–4 have recently been developed in efforts to achieve closure of perforated tympanic membranes. Such approaches are effective even when perforations are large because the regenerative activity of the TM is reduced at the perforation margins. 3 However, preoperative factors affecting therapy outcomes remain controversial. Nine of the 153 patients developed reperforation more than 1 year after TM perforation closure by regeneration therapy and underwent reoperation. The mean duration of perforation prior to treatment was 32. 0 years. Small, medium, and large perforations, defined as those involving 1, 2, and 3 or more quadrants of the TM, respectively, were found in 73, 55, and 25 patients before treatment.

Of the 30 patients with residual pinhole perforations, the mean improvement in hearing was 8. 9 dB, which was not significantly different from that in the complete closure group. During 24 months of postoperative follow-up, pinhole perforations developed a mean of 7. 5 months after the regeneration therapy. Patients with residual pinhole perforations were observed every 3 to 4 months on an outpatient basis and were advised to undergo a second operation if enlargement of the pinhole perforations and worsening of hearing were observed. At last follow-up, 4 patients with pinhole perforations were found to have progressed to small perforations and had undergone a second session of regeneration therapy. Of the 22 patients with residual perforations, during 21 months of posttreatment follow-up, reperforations developed a mean of 2. 3 months after the regeneration therapy.

We performed regenerative therapy on patients with chronic cases in which the duration of perforation prior to treatment was longer than 6 months. We suggest that mechanical disruption of the edge of the perforation, and the scaffold for newly formed cells and tissues, is required to stimulate the activity of TM stem cells. 3 This is because the outer squamous epithelium around the edge of a chronic perforation prevents TM closure. 18.

Table 3
Primary outcome of acceptable hearing at 5 weeks by treatment group

Secondary outcomes are presented in table 4 and in the appendix. There was a significant increase in acceptable hearing from 5 weeks to 6 months and 12 months (p = 0.0001), with a constant albeit non-significant difference of 7–8% in favour of oral steroid (table 4). Although the rate of tympanometry resolution did not differ significantly over time or between groups (oral steroids vs placebo averaged across all three follow-up timepoints), the treatment groups had a different resolution trajectory over time (in the oral steroid group the rate of resolution increased over time whereas in the placebo group it decreased after 6 months). There was no treatment effect in the proportion of children with otoscopic evidence of a tympanic membrane perforation present in at least one ear, evidence of a middle ear effusion, or bubbles behind the ear drum (table 4).

Table 4
Secondary outcomes based on clinical assessment, functional health status (OM8–30) and health-related quality-of-life (PedsQL and HUI3) scores over time and by treatment group

39 (23%) of 173 children in the oral steroid group and 38 (22%) of 170 in the placebo group had ventilation tubes inserted between 5 weeks and 6 months, as did an additional 23 in each group between 6 months and 12 months (table 4). There was no evidence of an effect on ventilation tube insertion rates from oral steroids. The mean time to insertion of ventilation tubes was 168.0 days (SD 96.1) in the oral steroid group and 165.5 days (104.5) in the placebo group, with no difference between groups (adjusted hazard ratio 1.04 [95% CI 0.71–1.53], p = 0.84).

### Outcomes of perichondrium graft covering the epithelium of the tympanic membrane for large-sized perforations: a 3–5-year follow-up study [^113Twgnr]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate the graft outcomes and iatrogenic cholesteatomas for 3 years following cartilage-perichondrium over-underlay technique with perichondrial graft covering the epithelium for large-sized tympanic membrane (TM) perforations.

Materials and Methods

This prospective case series enrolled patients with large-sized perforation who underwent endoscopic cartilage-perichondrium over-underlay technique. The graft success rate, hearing outcomes, and development of iatrogenic middle ear cholesteatomas and graft cholesteatomas were assessed at 3 years postoperatively.

Results

This study included 62 ears of 62 patients. The mean follow-up duration was 47.3 ± 10.8 (38–64) months. Neovascularization was observed in the lateral perichondrium graft in 55 (88.7%) patients, which inosculated into the TM remnant at 4–5 weeks. However, graft neovascularization was not observed in the four patients with excessive perichondrium graft that migrated into the external auditory canal and the three patients with middle ear infections. The graft failure rate was 6.5% at 6 months, 11.3% at 12 months, 6.5% at 24 months, and the overall graft success rate was 91.8% at the last follow-up. Granular myringitis developed in 11.3% (7/62) of the patients. High-resolution computed tomography revealed well-pneumatized mastoids and middle ear at the final follow-up. However, graft cholesteatomas were observed in 3 (4.8%) patients at 7–24 months postoperatively.

Conclusions

The cartilage-perichondrium over-underlay technique with perichondrial graft covering TM epithelium is safe and effective for the repair of large perforations, with good short- and long-term graft outcomes, minimal risk of graft cholesteatoma development, and no risk of iatrogenic middle ear cholesteatomas.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^116hkgwR]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes and adenoidectomy in recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME): Two found significant improvement in mean number of AOM episodes after tympanostomy tubes during a 6-month follow-up period, but one study that randomly assigned children and followed them for 2 years reported that although prophylactic antibiotics reduced the rate of AOM, no difference in number of episodes of AOM was noted between the tympanostomy tube group and placebo over 2 years. A Cochrane review analyzing 2 studies found that tympanostomy tubes reduced the number of episodes of AOM by 1.5 episodes in the 6 months after surgery, and tympanostomy tube insertion has been shown to improve disease-specific quality-of-life measures in children with OME. Regarding safety, a review reported no major complications in 10 000 tube insertions, with minor complications such as TM tears or displaced tubes seen in 0.16% of ears; a meta-analysis found tympanosclerosis in 32% of patients and chronic perforations in 2.2% of patients with short-term tubes and 16.6% of patients with long-term tubes. Adenoidectomy, without myringotomy and/or tympanostomy tubes, did not reduce the number of episodes of AOM when compared with chemoprophylaxis or placebo, and adenoidectomy alone should not be used for prevention of AOM but may have benefit when performed with placement of tympanostomy tubes or in children with previous tympanostomy tube placement in OME.

Tube design and complication rates — Thermoplastic elastomer tympanostomy tubes had higher rates of occlusion than silicone tympanostomy tubes, with an overall rate of about 11%; in another trial, long-shafted tubes, especially the Armstrong design, were less likely to extrude early than short-shaft tubes, with rate of occlusion about 11% of all tubes and no significant difference in time to first occlusion by tube shape or material. After tube extrusion, only 1.3% of ears had persistent perforation of the tympanic membrane for more than 90 days.

### The effectiveness of bFGF in the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116wpzen]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

TM perforations lead to significant morbidities and lifestyle limitations. Although acute TM perforations tend to heal spontaneously, the long-term healing results are suboptimal. For chronic TM perforations, surgeries using fascia or cartilage autografts are common practice. However, all of these autografts have their own limitations; an ideal graft material is yet to be identified. Moreover, patients who undergo surgeries undertake the risks of general anesthesia, high medical costs, surgical complications, and loss of productivity. Hence, various alternatives have been explored to promote TM regeneration. Previous researches indicate that bFGF is a safe, convenient and effective treatment for TM repair. However, the majority studies are outcome-based and subjective in nature. In this study, we have used quantitative meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of bFGF for TM repair. To our knowledge, this meta-analysis is the first of its kind.

Closure rate serves as the fundamental importance in the evaluation of TM regeneration. The success rates of bFGF application have been reported to be as high as 89.3 to 100% and 83 to 98.1% in acute and chronic TM perforations respectively. Our analysis supports previous findings that bFGF can significantly enhance the closure rate of TM perforations. Given that some clinical trials are non-controlled, we only included studies with control group for this current study. Closure rate in our review ranged from 89 to 100% with the application of bFGF. A meta-analysis of pooled results further demonstrated that bFGF has a statistically significant effect on closure rates of perforated TMs.

Similarly, our results support the current trends in the literature indicating that bFGF significantly shortens the perforation closure time. However, we could only include data for acute perforations. Based on our study, the SMD value for the closure time was –5.89, demonstrating a large and statistically significant effect size. This is clinically relevant, since earlier closure reduces morbidities, costs associated with follow up reviews and audiology, as well as quicker return to sporting activities and fewer precautions required to prevent water entering the ear canal. Lou et al. reported that closure time was around 2 weeks in patients with traumatic TM perforation following bFGF treatment based on 11 clinical studies. In our study, subgroup analysis showed that those studies with small perforations (< 50% of the TM) accounted for high heterogeneity, which may be due to the small sample size and insufficient trials.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^1123jHZ8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — precautions for removal and irrigation highlight safety considerations and technique selection. The suspicion of a nonintact tympanic membrane should be assessed by history and/or physical examination prior to selection of a disimpaction technique, and prior tympanic membrane perforation, prior ear surgery, intratympanic injections, tympanostomy tubes, or barotrauma should prompt use of techniques other than irrigation. Current otitis externa should also be identified; if the ear canal is currently infected, irrigation should be avoided. Pain should alert clinicians to possible infection or other pathology, and if present the ear should be assessed before selecting a method of cleaning. In the presence of a perforated tympanic membrane, irrigation could produce caloric effects resulting in vertigo, some agents can be toxic to the middle or inner ear, and mechanical removal is the preferred technique when eardrum perforation is suspected. Safe and effective irrigation is not always possible in patients with narrow or stenotic ear canals, and specialized equipment and procedures may be required to safely remove cerumen in these patients. A perforated tympanic membrane or patent tympanostomy tube likewise limits options available for cerumen removal.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^114yhws4]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our study shows that Aboriginal infants with OME receiving continuous amoxicillin had more normal ears, fewer perforations and less pneumococcal carriage. There was no statistically significant increase in resistant pneumococci or NCHi in amoxicillin children compared to placebo children who received regular paediatric care and antibiotic treatment for symptomatic illnesses. The option to use long-term antibiotics would be less relevant for western populations where the outcome of untreated OM is less severe, and the balance of benefit and risk is less influenced by the risk of a severe clinical outcome, and more influenced by the potential for increased antibiotic resistance in the child and the community.

### Tympanic perforations in children: when to propose surgical closure? [^115FG6pT]. Otology & Neurotology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aims to analyze the impact of age and other prognostic factors on the success of myringoplasty.

Study Design

A retrospective case series.

Settings

Pediatric ENT department of a tertiary academic center.

Patients

Two hundred forty-one children (318 ears) aged 3 to 17 years with tympanic perforation.

Intervention

Myringoplasty performed between 2009 and 2019.

Main Outcomes Measures

The rate of tympanic closure, perforation recurrence, revision surgery, and audiometric gain were collected. The impact of age and anatomical and surgical factors was analyzed for each procedure.

Results

With a mean follow-up time of 1 year, the tympanic closure rate was 87.7%, the perforation recurrence rate was 18.6%, and 16.7% of ears required reoperation. The mean air-bone gap decreased from 21 dB preoperatively to 12 dB postoperatively (p < 0.0001). We did not find different anatomical and audiometric results for our three groups of patients classified according to age. Audiometric results were associated with the location of the perforation, intraoperative inflammation of the middle ear mucosa, and the surgical technique performed.

Conclusion

Myringoplasty in children is associated with excellent anatomical and functional results, even in the youngest patients. It can be proposed whatever the child's age if the patients are well selected before giving the indication.

### The development and evaluation of a smartphone-aided diagnosis application to measure tympanic membrane perforations [^114aBCy8]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

ObjectivesChronic otitis media is a long-term infection of the middle ear. It is characterized by persistent discharge from the middle ear through a perforated tympanic membrane. It is one of the most common causes of preventable hearing loss, especially in developing countries. Precise estimation of the size of tympanic membrane perforation is essential for successful clinical management. In this study, we developed a smartphone-based application to calculate the ratio of the area of tympanic membrane perforation to the area of the tympanic membrane. Twelve standardized patients and 60 medical students were involved to assess the area of tympanic membrane perforation, in particular, the percentage of perforation size. MethodsIn total, 60 student doctors (including year 5 and year 6 medical students, intern and post-graduate year training of doctors) were recruited during their rotation at the Otolaryngology department of Taipei Medical University Shuang-Ho Hospital. Twelve standardized patients with chronic otitis media were recruited through a single otology practice. Oto-endoscopic examination was performed for all patients by using a commercially-available digital oto-endoscope, and clinical images of the tympanic membrane perforation were obtained. To demonstrate the variability of perforation size estimation by different student doctors, we calculated the percentage of perforation using the smartphone-based application for 12 tympanic membranes objectively and compared the results with those visually estimated by the 60 student doctors subjectively. ResultsThe variance in the visual estimation by the 60 student doctors was large. By contrast, variances in smartphone-based application calculations were smaller, indicating consistency in the results obtained from different users. The smartphone-based application accurately estimated the presence of perforation for tympanic membranes with high consistency. The differences in visual estimations can be considerably great and the variances can be large among different individuals. ConclusionsThe smartphone-based application is a dependable tool for precisely evaluating the size of tympanic membrane perforation.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112G2Tdw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to manage diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as generalized inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The primary purpose is to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief.

Study Design

In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) selected a development group representing the fields of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, family medicine, infectious disease, internal medicine, emergency medicine, and medical informatics. The guideline was created with the use of an explicit, a priori, evidence-based protocol.

Results

The group made a strong recommendation that management of AOE should include an assessment of pain, and the clinician should recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The group made recommendations that clinicians should: 1) distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the ear canal; 2) assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); and 3) use topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; systemic antimicrobial therapy should not be used unless there is extension outside of the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The group made additional recommendations that: 4) the choice of topical antimicrobial therapy of diffuse AOE should be based on efficacy, low incidence of adverse events, likelihood of adherence to therapy, and cost; 5) clinicians should inform patients how to administer topical drops, and when the ear canal is obstructed, delivery of topical preparations should be enhanced by aural toilet, placing a wick, or both; 6) when the patient has a tympanostomy tube or known perforation of the tympanic membrane, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation; and 7) if the patient fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. And finally, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed.

Conclusion

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating patients with AOE. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to the diagnosis and management of this problem.

Significance

This is the first, explicit, evidence-based clinical practice guideline on acute otitis externa, and the first clinical practice guideline produced independently by the AAO-HNSF.

### Medical and surgical management of otitis media in children [^112uyzwf]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

OM, though frequent and seemingly simple to evaluate and manage, remains a treatment challenge. Increasingly sophisticated clinical trials assessing OM medical treatment efficacy and outcome have demonstrated that many treatment regimens that were commonly used a decade ago are no longer recommended. Surgical therapy for OM, though remaining the same, has come under intense scrutiny from several angles but still plays a central role for this disease. Given the multiple facets of OM, its frequency, and its potential to cause short- and long-term morbidity in children, the next decade is sure to bring further treatment innovations.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^113qYyU9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tube otorrhea and complications — frequencies and management — are reported as follows: Acute TTO occurs in up to 50% of children who are closely monitored in RCTs, with cohort studies finding 16% postoperative otorrhea (first 30 days), 26% delayed otorrhea, 7% recurrent otorrhea, and 4% chronic otorrhea. Caregivers should be counseled that TTO responds to topical antibiotic ear drops, does not usually require oral antibiotics, and benefits from water precautions until the discharge is no longer present. Up to 3% of tubes may fail to extrude and require active removal; persistent tympanic membrane perforation occurs with about 2% of short-term tubes and up to 20% of long-term tubes; and localized cholesteatoma may be seen in 0.5% of cases.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^115YBo3g]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes — short-term versus long-term devices differ in duration, indications, and trade-offs. Short-term tubes ventilate for "8 to 18 months, on average; some stay in place 3 years or longer", are the "Routine choice for first ear tube surgery for a child", have "Reduced incidence (vs long-term tubes) of perforation, chronic otorrhea, granulation tissue, myringosclerosis; ease of insertion", but carry "Potential for early extrusion and need for repeat tube surgery". Long-term tubes provide ventilation for "15 months or longer, usually 2 to 3 years; some stay in place 5 years or longer", are a "Selective choice for first ear tube surgery for a child when a need for prolonged ventilation is anticipated; option for repeat tube surgery", offer "Longer period of middle ear ventilation, potential to avoid repeat insertion of short-term tubes and exposure to general anesthesia; ability to insert silastic T-tube in stenotic canal", but have "Increased incidence (vs short-term tube) of perforation, chronic otorrhea, granulation tissue, myringosclerosis, medialization (if short shaft with no outer flange); more difficult to insert". Relative uses include, for short-term tubes, "Repeat ear tube surgery in children without significant risk factors or anatomic changes in the eardrum that would warrant a long-term tube", and for long-term tubes, "Cleft palate, stenotic ear canal, abnormal tympanic membrane (atrophy, atelectasis, retraction pocket), premature extrusion of multiple prior short-term tubes".

### Topical versus systemic antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^113WobcF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection (involving more than one micro-organism) of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Antibiotics are the most common treatment for CSOM, which act to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be administered both topically and systemically, and can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM such as ear cleaning (aural toileting).

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical versus systemic antibiotics for people with CSOM.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving patients (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The studies compared topical antibiotics against systemic (oral, injection) antibiotics. We separated studies according to whether they compared the same type of antibiotic in both treatment groups, or different types of antibiotics. For each comparison we considered whether there was background treatment for both treatment groups, for example aural toileting (ear cleaning).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not, measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks up to four weeks, and after four weeks), health-related quality of life using a validated instrument, ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications and ototoxicity measured in several ways.

Main Results

Six studies (445 participants), all with high risk of bias, were included. All but two studies included patients with confirmed CSOM, where perforation of the ear drum was clearly documented. None of the studies reported results for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks or health-related quality of life. 1. Topical versus systemic administration of the same type of antibiotics (quinolones) Four studies (325 participants) compared topical versus systemic (oral) administration of ciprofloxacin. Three studies reported resolution of ear discharge at one to two weeks and found that the topical administration may slightly increase resolution (risk ratio (RR) 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24 to 1.76; 285 participants; 3 studies; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). In these studies, aural toileting was either not mentioned, or limited to the first visit. Three studies (265 participants) reported that they did not suspect ototoxicity in any participants, but it is unclear how this was measured (very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported the outcomes of ear pain or serious complications. No studies reported results for hearing, despite it being measured in three studies. 2. Topical versus systemic administration of different types of antibiotics (quinolones versus aminoglycosides) One study (60 participants) compared topical ciprofloxacin versus gentamicin injected intramuscularly. No aural toileting was reported. Resolution of ear discharge was not measured at one to two weeks. The study did not report any 'side effects' from which we assumed that no ear pain, suspected ototoxicity or serious complications occurred (very low-certainty evidence). The study stated that "no worsening of the audiometric function related to local or parenteral therapy was observed". 3. Topical versus systemic administration of different types of antibiotics (quinolones versus amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) One study compared topical ofloxacin with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with all participants receiving suction ear cleaning at the first visit. It is uncertain if there is a difference between the two groups in resolution of ear discharge at one to two weeks due to study limitations and the very small sample size (RR 2.93, 95% CI 1.50 to 5.72; 56 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It is unclear if there is a difference between topical quinolone compared with oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with regards to ear pain, hearing or suspected ototoxicity (very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported the outcome of serious complications.

Authors' Conclusions

There was a limited amount of low-quality evidence available, from studies completed over 15 years ago, to examine whether topical or systemic antibiotics are more effective in achieving resolution of ear discharge for people with CSOM. However, amongst this uncertainty there is some evidence to suggest that the topical administration of antibiotics may be more effective than systemic administration of antibiotics in achieving resolution of ear discharge (dry ear). There is limited evidence available regarding different types of antibiotics. It is not possible to determine with any certainty whether or not topical quinolones are better or worse than systemic aminoglycosides. These two groups of compounds have different adverse effect profiles, but there is insufficient evidence from the included studies to make any comment about these. In general, adverse effects were poorly reported.

### Chronic suppurative otitis… [^116DYCfF]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the best treatment for otitis media with tympanic membrane perforation. Evidence-Based Answer. Acute otitis media with tympanic membrane perforation in children should be treated with an oral antibiotic. Topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone is better than oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for treating acute otitis media in children with tympanostomy tubes. Evidence Summary There are three different types of otitis media associated with a perforation of the tympanic membrane: acute otitis media complicated by perforation of the tympanic membrane, presenting as otorrhea; acute otitis media in a patient with tympanostomy tubes; and chronic suppurative otitis media, defined as tympanic membrane perforation with chronic inflammation of the middle ear and persistent otorrhea for two weeks to three months.

1.

ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA WITH PERFORATION A meta-analysis of six RCTs of children six months to 12 years of age with acute otitis media examined the effectiveness of amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid versus placebo or delayed treatment in reducing pain, fever, or both at three to seven days. Clinical cure, defined as cessation of otorrhea at 18 days, was 84. 6 percent in the ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone group versus
58. 5 percent in the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid group.
3. 5 Topical therapy with non-quinolone antibiotics appeared to work about as well, but the data were not as consistent. A 2006 Cochrane review of five generally short studies of variable quality found that topical quinolone antibiotics can clear aural discharge better at one to two weeks than systemic quinolone or nonquinolone antibiotics. 6.

### Grommets (ventilation tubes) for recurrent acute otitis media in children [^1118Agbd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common childhood illnesses. While many children experience sporadic AOM episodes, an important group suffer from recurrent AOM (rAOM), defined as three or more episodes in six months, or four or more in one year. In this subset of children AOM poses a true burden through frequent episodes of ear pain, general illness, sleepless nights and time lost from nursery or school. Grommets, also called ventilation or tympanostomy tubes, can be offered for rAOM.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of bilateral grommet insertion with or without concurrent adenoidectomy in children with rAOM.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 4 December 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing bilateral grommet insertion with or without concurrent adenoidectomy and no ear surgery in children up to age 16 years with rAOM. We planned to apply two main scenarios: grommets as a single surgical intervention and grommets as concurrent treatment with adenoidectomy (i.e. children in both the intervention and comparator groups underwent adenoidectomy). The comparators included active monitoring, antibiotic prophylaxis and placebo medication.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were: proportion of children who have no AOM recurrences at three to six months follow-up (intermediate-term) and persistent tympanic membrane perforation (significant adverse event). Secondary outcomes were: proportion of children who have no AOM recurrences at six to 12 months follow-up (long-term); total number of AOM recurrences, disease-specific and generic health-related quality of life, presence of middle ear effusion and other adverse events at short-term, intermediate-term and long-term follow-up. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

Five RCTs (805 children) with unclear or high risk of bias were included. All studies were conducted prior to the introduction of pneumococcal vaccination in the countries' national immunisation programmes. In none of the trials was adenoidectomy performed concurrently in both groups. Grommets versus active monitoringGrommets were more effective than active monitoring in terms of:- proportion of children who had no AOM recurrence at six months (one study, 95 children, 46% versus 5%; risk ratio (RR) 9.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.38 to 37.80, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 3; low-quality evidence);- proportion of children who had no AOM recurrence at 12 months (one study, 200 children, 48% versus 34%; RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.99, NNTB 8; low-quality evidence);- number of AOM recurrences at six months (one study, 95 children, mean number of AOM recurrences per child: 0.67 versus 2.17, mean difference (MD) -1.50, 95% CI -1.99 to -1.01; low-quality evidence);- number of AOM recurrences at 12 months (one study, 200 children, one-year AOM incidence rate: 1.15 versus 1.70, incidence rate difference -0.55, 95% -0.17 to -0.93; low-quality evidence). Children receiving grommets did not have better disease-specific health-related quality of life (Otitis Media-6 questionnaire) at four (one study, 85 children) or 12 months (one study, 81 children) than those managed by active monitoring (low-quality evidence). One study reported no persistent tympanic membrane perforations among 54 children receiving grommets (low-quality evidence). Grommets versus antibiotic prophylaxisIt is uncertain whether or not grommets are more effective than antibiotic prophylaxis in terms of:- proportion of children who had no AOM recurrence at six months (two studies, 96 children, 60% versus 35%; RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.65, I² = 0%, fixed-effect model, NNTB 5; very low-quality evidence);- number of AOM recurrences at six months (one study, 43 children, mean number of AOM recurrences per child: 0.86 versus 1.38, MD -0.52, 95% CI -1.37 to 0.33; very low-quality evidence). Grommets versus placebo medicationGrommets were more effective than placebo medication in terms of:- proportion of children who had no AOM recurrence at six months (one study, 42 children, 55% versus 15%; RR 3.64, 95% CI 1.20 to 11.04, NNTB 3; very low-quality evidence);- number of AOM recurrences at six months (one study, 42 children, mean number of AOM recurrences per child: 0.86 versus 2.0, MD -1.14, 95% CI -2.06 to -0.22; very low-quality evidence). One study reported persistent tympanic membrane perforations in 3 of 76 children (4%) receiving grommets (low-quality evidence). Subgroup analysisThere were insufficient data to determine whether presence of middle ear effusion at randomisation, type of grommet or age modified the effectiveness of grommets.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence on the effectiveness of grommets in children with rAOM is limited to five RCTs with unclear or high risk of bias, which were conducted prior to the introduction of pneumococcal vaccination. Low to very low-quality evidence suggests that children receiving grommets are less likely to have AOM recurrences compared to those managed by active monitoring and placebo medication, but the magnitude of the effect is modest with around one fewer episode at six months and a less noticeable effect by 12 months. The low to very low quality of the evidence means that these numbers need to be interpreted with caution since the true effects may be substantially different. It is uncertain whether or not grommets are more effective than antibiotic prophylaxis. The risk of persistent tympanic membrane perforation after grommet insertion was low. Widespread use of pneumococcal vaccination has changed the bacteriology and epidemiology of AOM, and how this might impact the results of prior trials is unknown. New and high-quality RCTs of grommet insertion in children with rAOM are therefore needed. These trials should not only focus on the frequency of AOM recurrences, but also collect data on the severity of AOM episodes, antibiotic consumption and adverse effects of both surgery and antibiotics. This is particularly important since grommets may reduce the severity of AOM recurrences and allow for topical rather than oral antibiotic treatment.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^115ZcJR7]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

We believe that our study of long-term antibiotic use is very relevant for Aboriginal and other populations at high risk of tympanic membrane perforation. Unfortunately conjugate pneumococcal vaccine has not significantly reduced ear disease in Australian Aboriginal children. A recent pediatric outreach program in Far North Queensland confirms that CSOM is the most prevalent health problem in Aboriginal children. The poor school achievement of Aboriginal children, already disadvantaged by poverty, has been partially attributed to the chronic hearing loss.

Our study shows that Aboriginal infants with OME receiving continuous amoxicillin had fewer perforations, more normal ears, less pneumococcal carriage and fewer resistant pneumococci than children who received regular paediatric care and antibiotic treatment for acute illnesses but without continuous amoxicillin. The option to use long-term antibiotics would be less relevant for western populations where the outcome of untreated OM is less severe, and the balance of benefit and risk is less influenced by the risk of a severe clinical outcome, and more influenced by the potential for increased antibiotic resistance in the child and the community.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112TDfG3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa with nonintact tympanic membrane — topical therapy selection and evaluation are as follows: When the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation. Policy level: Recommendation. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade D, reasoning from first principles, and Grade X, exceptional situations in which validating studies cannot be performed. Level of confidence in evidence: Moderate. Benefit: Reduce the possibility of hearing loss and balance disturbance. Risk, harm, cost: Eardrops without ototoxicity may be more costly. Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. Intentional vagueness: None. Role of patient preferences: None. Exceptions: None. Differences of opinion: None. Supporting text notes that antibiotics placed into the middle ear can cross the round window membrane and reach the inner ear and that clinical experience with tympanic membrane perforation suggests that hearing loss does not occur after a single short course of therapy; however, severe hearing loss has been observed after prolonged or repetitive administration of topical drops. Evaluation points include that tympanometry can sometimes be helpful in establishing the presence of an intact tympanic membrane, that when tympanometry shows a normal type A tracing the tympanic membrane is assumed to be intact unless there is a reason to believe it is not, and that most tympanostomy tubes remain in the tympanic membrane for at least 6 to 12 months so a patent tube should be assumed if placed less than a year ago.

### Antibiotics for the prevention of acute and chronic suppurative otitis media in children [^117RFwUb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common childhood illness. These middle ear infections may be frequent and painful. AOM may be associated with perforation of the tympanic membrane and can progress to chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of long-term antibiotics (for longer than six weeks) in preventing any AOM, AOM with perforation and CSOM.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March Week 3 2006), OLD MEDLINE (1950 to 1965), EMBASE (1990 to December 2005) and the references of relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials of long-term (longer than six weeks) antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment for the prevention of AOM, AOM with perforation, or CSOM were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted the data for: any AOM; episodes of AOM; any recurrent AOM; episodes of illness; any side effects; any antibiotic resistance, as well as outcomes at end of intervention (any AOM); and following cessation of intervention (any AOM). For dichotomous outcomes, the summary risk ratio (fixed and random-effects models) was calculated. For rate outcomes, the summary incidence rate ratio was calculated.

Main Results

Sixteen studies involving 1483 children met our inclusion criteria. All studies enrolled children at increased risk of AOM, and in seven studies the children were prone to otitis media. The majority of studies were high quality and most (15 studies) reported data for our primary outcomes. None reported AOM with perforation or CSOM. Long-term antibiotics reduced any episode of AOM (13 studies, 1358 children, risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.75; random-effects model) and number of episodes of AOM (12 studies, 1112 children, incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.48, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.62; random-effects model). Approximately five children would need to be treated long term to prevent one child experiencing AOM whilst on treatment. Antibiotics prevented 1.5 episodes of AOM for every 12 months of treatment per child. Statistical heterogeneity was explored. Long-term antibiotics were not associated with a significant increase in adverse events (11 studies, 714 children, RR 1.99, 95% CI 0.25 to 15.89; random-effects model).

Authors' Conclusions

For children at risk, antibiotics given once or twice daily will reduce the probability of AOM while the child is on treatment. Antibiotics will reduce the number of episodes of AOM per year from around three to around 1.5. We believe that larger absolute benefits are likely in high-risk children. These conclusions were not affected by sensitivity analyses.

### Surgical management of complications after hearing aid fitting [^111Dhht7]. The Laryngoscope (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

Standard procedures for hearing aid fitting performed in accordance with established guidelines are well tolerated, safe, and effective. In this article, we present unusual complications after hearing aid fitting that required surgical management.

Methods

Four otologists at a major university center with a combined 65 years of experience performed a retrospective analysis of their surgical practice. Six patients were identified that had encountered severe complications from improper earmold fitting that required surgical intervention.

Results

One patient had a perforation of the tympanic membrane with earmold material found to have migrated into the middle ear cleft. The tympanic membrane healed spontaneously, resulting in persistent otalgia and a maximum air-bone gap. The earmold cast was successfully removed by means of a tympanomastoidectomy. Two patients with presbycusis and normal ear canals developed eardrum perforations and conductive hearing deficits. In both patients, earmold material was found partially occupying the middle ear cleft and removed by way of a transcanal approach. Three patients with prior canal wall down mastoidectomy defects and narrow external ear canals required microtoscopy under general anesthesia or canaloplasty for removal of impacted material.

Conclusion

Proper fitting of hearing aids performed by well-trained medical professionals results in a very low incidence of significant complications. Perforation of the tympanic membrane with impaction of earmold material in the middle ear or mastoid bowl may occur and can be successfully managed by standard otologic surgical techniques.

### Association of tympanostomy tubes with future assistive hearing devices-a population based study [^1125mSzU]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Ear (tympanostomy) tube (TT) placement is a common ambulatory surgery that children undergo. Persistent otitis media with effusion (OME) and recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) are the most common indications for which TT placement is performed.

Insertion of TT has been shown to be associated with development of eardrum pathologic abnormalities, including segmental atrophy, perforation, and cholesteatoma. Furthermore, studies exist supporting higher hearing thresholds in children managed with TT insertion versus those managed conservatively/medically. However, others have not found evidence of hearing loss post-TT insertion.

The consistent feature of these studies is the small sample size, and as such, the risk of type-2 error is present. The current study was designed to evaluate in a large comprehensive population long-term hearing loss in TT patients of a severity that merited a rehabilitative hearing device, and to compare this population to patients with recurrent middle ear disease managed without TT, and to healthy age/sex-matched controls.

### Aural toilet (ear cleaning) for chronic suppurative otitis media [^114LmLKU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media, is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Aural toileting describes processes for manually cleaning the ear, including dry mopping (with cotton wool or tissue paper), suction clearance (typically under a microscope), or irrigation (using manual or automated syringing). Aural toileting can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antibiotics or topical antiseptics. This is one of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM. This is the first update of a Cochrane review published in 2020.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of aural toilet procedures for people with chronic suppurative otitis media.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). The searches were run on 15 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials with at least a one-week follow-up involving adults or children who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. We included any aural toileting method as the intervention, at any frequency, and for any duration. The main comparisons were aural toileting versus placebo or no intervention, and one aural toileting method versus another aural toileting method. Within each comparison, we separated studies into those in which both groups received other concomitant treatments (e.g. antiseptics or antibiotics) and those without concomitant treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology. Our primary outcomes were resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at one week to up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications, and adverse events (dizziness/vertigo/balance problems, ear bleeding). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

This update did not find any new studies. We included three studies with 431 participants (465 ears) reporting on two comparisons. Two studies included only children with CSOM in the community (351 participants) and the other study (80 participants) included children and adults with chronic ear discharge for at least six weeks. One study recruited participants from the Solomon Islands, who were considered a 'high-risk' Indigenous group. None of the included studies reported health-related quality of life, ear pain, or ear bleeding. 1. Daily aural toileting versus no treatment Two studies (351 children; 370 ears) compared daily dry mopping with no treatment. For resolution of ear discharge after four weeks, only one study reported the results per person. We are very uncertain whether there is a difference at 16 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.72; 1 study, 217 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were no results reported for the adverse events of dizziness, vertigo, or balance problems. Only one study reported serious complications, but it was not clear which group these participants were from, or whether the complications occurred pre- or post-treatment, and therefore the certainty of evidence was very low. One study reported hearing, but the results were presented by treatment outcome rather than by treatment group, so it was not possible to determine whether there was a difference between the two groups. 2. Daily aural toileting versus single aural toileting episode (both in addition to topical ciprofloxacin) One study (80 participants; 95 ears) compared daily aural toileting (suction) with administration of topical antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) ear drops in a clinic, to a single aural toileting (suction) episode followed by daily self-administered topical antibiotic drops, in participants of all ages. We are very uncertain if there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge at between one and up to two weeks (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.30; 1 study, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The results for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks were presented by ear, not person, and could not be adjusted to by person. The authors only reported qualitatively that there was no difference between the two groups in hearing results (very low-certainty evidence). One participant in the group with single aural toileting and self-administration of topical antibiotic ear drops reported the adverse event of dizziness, which the authors attributed to the use of cold topical ciprofloxacin. It is very uncertain whether there is a difference between the groups (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.95; 1 study, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were no results reported for the other adverse events of vertigo or balance problems, or for serious complications.

Authors' Conclusions

We are very uncertain whether treatment with aural toileting is effective in resolving ear discharge in people with CSOM when compared to no treatment, due to a lack of data and the poor quality of the available evidence. The evidence was considered very low-certainty as there were concerns over risk of bias, indirectness, imprecision, and suspected publication bias. We also remain uncertain about other outcomes, including adverse events, as these were not well reported. Similarly, we are very uncertain whether daily suction clearance, followed by antibiotic ear drops administered at a clinic, is better than a single episode of suction clearance followed by self-administration of topical antibiotic ear drops. Limitations of the review include lack of recency in data, and limited information on certain population groups or interventions.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^111q8jcD]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Statement 8, manual removal — clinicians may use manual removal requiring instrumentation in the management of cerumen impaction and this is an option based on case series and expert opinion with a balance of benefit and harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C, observational case series and expert opinion, with a high level of confidence in the evidence. Benefits include removal of cerumen impaction under direct visualization, while risks, harms, and costs include bleeding, laceration, tympanic membrane perforation, otalgia, and procedural and equipment cost; the policy level is option and the role of patient preferences is large. Adequate training, experience, and availability of appropriate equipment will minimize the risk of adverse events and maximize the likelihood of successful cerumen removal. Reported concerns include trauma to the external auditory canal, perforation of the tympanic membrane, and rarely infection; suctioning can produce loud noise, may startle the patient, may reach noise levels that are unsafe, and can create a cooling effect eliciting a caloric response with nystagmus and vertigo. The use of cerumenolytic agents during the week prior to the office visit can reduce potential side effects of suction removal such as pain or vertigo.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^117PjRY1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) evidence-based statements — clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal (Recommendation); clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy) (Recommendation); the clinician should assess patients with AOE for pain and recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain (Strong recommendation); clinicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy (Strong recommendation); clinicians should use topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE (Recommendation); clinicians should inform patients how to administer topical drops and should enhance delivery of topical drops when the ear canal is obstructed by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both (Recommendation); when the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube, the clinician should recommend a non-ototoxic topical preparation (Recommendation); if the patient fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness (Recommendation).

### The effectiveness of bFGF in the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111uT1y3]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations in our study. Firstly, a major limitation is that only studies conducted in Japan and China fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. In fact, a majority of the included studies was reported by Lou's group in China. Specifically, six randomized controlled trials (RCT) and four prospective studies among Lou's studies. Only one study published in 2011 is a retrospective study. It is unclear whether these patients included were individual or overlapped patients, which may lead to selection bias. If this represents overlapped patients, it would significantly skew the results of our analysis. Moreover, there may be potential biases due to ethnic and genetic differences among Asians as compared with other ethnic groups. Secondly, our analysis is based on only 14 clinical controlled studies. Though most of them were published recently, the sample size is relatively small. Thirdly, the majority of studies enrolled focused on the efficacy of bFGF in cases of acute or traumatic TM perforation. Only three studies evaluated the closure rate of bFGF in chronic TM perforation. These studies did not report healing time and hearing improvement, thus limiting our analysis. Therefore, well-designed RCTs studies, which focus on chronic TM perforation with larger sample populations without any patching materials are warranted.

### The effectiveness of bFGF in the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116rLdCE]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

METHODS

We followed the population, intervention, comparison, outcomes (PICO) format. Our study question was: for people with TM perforations, can the use of bFGF improve both the healing rate and time, and hearing outcomes? Our review was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Fig. 1).

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^114nm2aE]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Follow-up setting and triggers for referral — Periodic follow-up for all children with tubes is essential to detect and manage complications, which may vary by the type of tube and its composition. Once adequate postoperative tympanostomy tube function and hearing improvement are established within 3 months by the surgeon or designee, some follow-up care may occur in primary care offices; if this approach is chosen, the specialist should ideally be informed of the visit, with referral to otolaryngology implemented upon any complication such as early extrusion, tube obstruction, tube medialization, otorrhea, retained tube, or tympanic membrane perforation.

### Chronic suppurative otitis media [^114ksP7G]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a leading global cause of potentially preventable hearing loss in children and adults, associated with socioeconomic deprivation. There is an absence of consensus on the definition of CSOM, which complicates efforts for prevention, treatment, and monitoring. CSOM occurs when perforation of the tympanic membrane is associated with severe or persistent inflammation in the middle ear, leading to hearing loss and recurrent or persistent ear discharge (otorrhoea). Cholesteatoma, caused by the inward growth of the squamous epithelium of the tympanic membrane into the middle ear, can also occur. The optimal treatment of discharge in CSOM is topical antibiotics. In resource-limited settings where topical antibiotics might not be available, topical antiseptics are an alternative. For persistent disease, surgery to repair the tympanic membrane or remove cholesteatoma might offer long-term resolution of otorrhoea and potential improvement to hearing. Recent developments in self-fitted air-conduction and bone-conduction hearing aids offer promise as new options for rehabilitation.

### Paper patching for chronic tympanic membrane perforations [^114kGDbq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was designed to evaluate the results of paper-patch myringoplasty in patients with chronic perforations of the tympanic membrane of different sizes.

Study Design and Setting

A retrospective survey of paper-patch myringoplasties performed in a tertiary referral academic medical center on 77 patients with chronic perforations of the eardrum was carried out. Data consisted of the causes of the perforations, time the perforations had been present, their size, number of patch applications, duration of application, and number of successfully closed perforations.

Results

Closure rate was 63.2%, 43.5%, and 12.5% for small, medium, and large perforations, respectively. Small perforations needed the least number of repeated applications and the least time for closure.

Conclusions and Significance

Paper patching is technically simple, time saving, safe to perform, cost effective, and suitable as an outpatient procedure and has a good success rate, It should be tried in perforations smaller than 5 mm before a patient is referred for surgery.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^115h1Rrg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Concurrent middle ear disease as a modifying factor: Concurrent middle ear disease can modify treatment of AOE, and patients with a tympanostomy tube or tympanic membrane perforation may develop diffuse AOE because of purulent middle-ear secretions that enter the external ear canal.

### The effectiveness of bFGF in the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116tkPpb]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective:

To investigate the effectiveness of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) versus placebo or no intervention in the treatment of tympanic membrane (TM) perforations from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective and retrospective studies.

Data Sources:

PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were screened from their inceptions to June 2019.

Study Selection:

Inclusion criteria: 1) English language; 2) observational (retrospective or prospective) or treatment (RCT) studies; 3) reported the outcomes on the application of bFGF in adult or pediatric population. Exclusion criteria: 1) studies without a control group; 2) animal studies, in vitro studies, review studies, and case reports.

Data Extraction:

Number of patients, cause of TM perforation, perforation size, treatment, mean age, follow-up time, sex, closure rate, healing time, mean air-bone gap improvement.

Data Synthesis:

A total of 14 studies were included, including seven RCTs and seven non-RCTs with a total of 1,072 participants. The odds ratio for closure rate of bFGF treatment was 7.33 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.65 to 11.53; p < 0.01; I² = 44%) and the standardized mean difference (SMD) for healing time was –5.89 (95% CI: –7.85 to –3.93, p < 0.01, I² = 98%), suggesting bFGF application has a significant effect on closure of TM perforations. However, no significant change in hearing (SMD: 0.08, 95% CI: –0.11 to 0.27, p = 0.39, I² = 0%) was seen as a result of bFGF treatment.

Conclusions:

Our meta-analysis has revealed that the application of bFGF can significantly enhance the closure rate as well as shorten the healing time for TM perforations. In terms of hearing, there is as yet no evidence that bFGF has a significant effect. Given its ease, availability, and safety, bFGF can be used effectively for TM repair.

### Evaluating adverse outcomes after myringotomy or tube placement in head and neck cancer [^111znoNs]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Definition of Adverse Outcomes

In our study, we aimed to define the potential outcomes following surgical intervention for patients with HN cancer, particularly those undergoing radiation therapy, who may experience a variety of ear‐related complications due to treatment side effects and the nature of the disease. We gathered outcomes from the last known status of the patient at their latest follow‐up. We categorized these outcomes into several distinct groups: persistent perforation, where a perforation in the TM fails to heal over time, potentially leading to chronic discomfort or hearing loss; recurrent effusion, repeat buildup of fluid in the middle ear after we had classified the ear as resolved; repeat placements of tympanostomy tubes, required to manage ongoing effusions or prevent recurrence thereof; and healed or resolved ear, indicating successful recovery without further intervention. Lastly, we also assessed the probability of experiencing any adverse outcome, encompassing persistent perforation, recurrent effusion, or repeat placements, as these events necessitated continued treatment or surveillance.

### Long-term follow-up after fat graft myringoplasty: Do size and location matter? [^1125H6jx]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess clinical and functional outcomes of a fat graft myringoplasty under local in an office setting.

Study Design

Prospective case series.

Setting

Tertiary care facility.

Patients

Patients with a tympanic membrane (TM) perforation presenting between December 2005 and June 2019. Inclusion criteria included perforation size > 25% of the surface of the pars tensa of the TM, entire perforation margins visualized through a transcanal view, and lack of spontaneous closure at the 6-month follow-up. The exclusion criteria were the presence of cholesteatoma, wet appearance of the mucosa in the tympanic cavity, ear discharge in the 3 months before surgery, or signs of ossicular inconsistency.

Intervention

In-office fat graft myringoplasty technique under local anesthesia.

Main Outcome Measures

Complete perforation closure rate and audiometric outcomes.

Results

A total of 121 patients underwent the procedure, of whom 21 had bilateral sequential procedures (total 142 ears). Average age was 51.1 ± 18.4 years (range, 3–78 years). The size of perforation was < 25% of TM in 39 (27.5%) ears, 25% to 50% of TM in 49 (34.55%) ears, 50% to 75% of TM in 34 (23.91%) ears, and 75% to 100% of TM in 20 (14.10%) ears. Complete perforation closure was evident in 130 (91.55%) of the 142 ears. Preoperative mean air conduction threshold was 59.3 dB (17–95 dB) and significantly improved into 35.6 dB (10–85 dB; P < .0004) after surgery. Preoperative air-bone gap was 30.2 dB (5–70 dB) and also significantly improved into 10.2 dB (5–65 dB; P < .0001) after surgery.

Conclusion

In office fat graft myringoplasty, in adult and pediatric patients with variable perforation sizes, is a well-tolerated procedure with very satisfactory clinical results.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^1155ndLH]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Chronic bilateral otitis media with effusion (OME) with hearing difficulty — Clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion to children with bilateral OME for 3 months or longer AND documented hearing difficulties. Recommendation based on randomized controlled trials and observational studies, with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B. Level of confidence in the evidence: High. Benefits: Reduced prevalence of MEE, improved hearing, improved child and caregiver QOL, optimization of auditory access for speech and language acquisition, elimination of a potential barrier to focusing and attention in a learning environment. Risks, harms, costs: Risk of anesthesia, sequelae of the indwelling tympanostomy tubes (eg, otorrhea, granulation tissue, obstruction), complications after tube extrusion (myringosclerosis, retraction pocket, persistent perforation), failure or premature tympanostomy tube extrusion, tympanostomy tube medialization, procedural anxiety and discomfort, and direct procedural costs. Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. Policy level: Recommendation. Intentional vagueness: The term hearing difficulty is used instead of hearing loss to emphasize that a functional assessment of how a child uses hearing and engages in the environment is important, regardless of what specific threshold is used to define hearing loss based on audiologic criteria.
