## Question

Weight loss norms post gastric sleeve

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about expected weight loss trajectories after sleeve gastrectomy, how to express them, what to expect long term, and how to use early outcomes to guide care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct outcome metrics and why %TWL is preferred. Then, I should verify early postoperative weight loss expectations at 6 and 12 months. Next, I will review long-term trajectories and nadir timing, including comparisons with RYGB. After that, I need to examine inter-individual variability and the biological spread of outcomes. I will then consider procedure-specific modifiers and patient factors that shift trajectories. Finally, I should identify how early weight loss predicts long-term outcomes and outline a pragmatic monitoring and intervention framework anchored to validated charts and tools [^111gghDx] [^116Y4kSs].

> Let me first confirm the appropriate metrics. Wait, let me verify the limitations of %EWL and the advantages of %TWL before committing to numbers. %EWL is sensitive to initial BMI and can over- or under-weight results in different BMI strata, whereas %TWL is more consistent across populations and recommended by contemporary guidelines; additionally, %AWL addresses BMI dependency even better for longer-term comparisons, which I should keep in mind as I interpret data across centers and baseline BMI ranges [^114k9twb] [^111gghDx] [^1138Awwg].

> I will now examine early weight loss. At 6 months, I initially recall seeing %TWL around 24–26% after sleeve, but wait, I should double-check the highest-quality sources to avoid overstatement. The VA/DoD guideline notes SG yields approximately 23% TWL at 1 year, and BOLD registry analyses show about 24% TWL at 6 months, which aligns with a typical 6-month figure of roughly 20–24% TWL; I should also note that the nadir is commonly reached around 12–18 months, with mean %TWL in RCTs and large cohorts often approximating 25–28% at one year, though the range is wide, so I need to frame expectations accordingly [^114jwxcG] [^114k9twb] [^116E5dn5].

> Next, I should review long-term trajectories and durability. Hold on, I should verify both absolute values and comparative data versus RYGB. RCTs and large observational cohorts consistently show SG maintains approximately 16–20% TWL at 5 years, with some decline from nadir; the PCORNet study reports SG at 16.1% TWL versus RYGB at 24.1% TWL at 5 years, and 7–10 year data from SLEEVEPASS show about 43–47% EWL after SG compared with higher EWL after RYGB, reflecting a persistent ~8% EWL gap; moreover, weight regain from nadir is more prominent after SG than RYGB in several long-term series, which I should communicate during counseling [^117Um6ep] [^117ApqFF] [^112pZwH8] [^112FoRFH].

> Let me consider the shape of the trajectory and nadir timing. I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize across cohorts. In many series, maximal weight loss is achieved around 12–18 months, followed by gradual regain of roughly 3–5% of total weight by 2–4 years, with further regain thereafter in a subset; the Dutch percentile charts operationalize this with median %TWL near 25% at 1 year, drifting to about 22% by 4 years and near 20% by 7 years, which tracks with the clinical observation of early nadir and late regain risk after SG [^111gghDx].

> Now, I should confirm the extent of inter-individual variability. The literature repeatedly shows a broad distribution of maximal %TWL after SG, with ranges commonly spanning from under 15% to over 35% and study means clustering near 25–28% at 1 year; this variability is biologically meaningful and clinically consequential, and I need to emphasize it to mitigate unrealistic expectations and to set the stage for early identification of poor responders [^116E5dn5] [^114k9twb] [^1154utdk].

> I will now examine procedure-specific modifiers that may shift expected outcomes. Wait, let me verify whether antral or fundal preservation changes results. Randomized data suggest starting the resection closer to the pylorus may improve %EWL and %TWL compared with a more proximal starting point, although overall 12-month weight outcomes are broadly similar; this is hypothesis-generating and not a license to over-resect, so I should frame it as technique-related variability rather than a guaranteed advantage [^1168HAqA]. But hold on, what if sleeve dilation or delayed emptying alters trajectory? Physiologic studies link altered gastric emptying and sleeve geometry to weight regain risk, underscoring the need to consider anatomy and function when patients underperform expectations [^117GoDoc].

> Next, I should review patient-level predictors that modify expected trajectories. Higher baseline BMI, older age, and the presence of type 2 diabetes — especially with poor glycemic control — are associated with lower %TWL after SG; for example, T2D with HbA1c above 7% shows markedly attenuated 1-year %TWL, and population-based trajectory analyses identify distinct "least %TWL" clusters characterized by higher BMI and comorbidity burden; male sex and certain ethnic backgrounds also show modestly different outcomes in some cohorts, which I should acknowledge when tailoring counseling and follow-up intensity [^1148pRHE] [^114nLRBa] [^116Y4kSs].

> I need to check whether early weight loss predicts longer-term outcomes. Multiple multicenter studies demonstrate that weight loss velocity at 3–6 months is the strongest independent predictor of maximal %TWL and 2–5 year outcomes, with patients in the lowest early %TWL quartile maintaining lower %TWL at 5 years; practically, %TWL below about 12–15% at 3 months flags suboptimal trajectory and should trigger intensified lifestyle and, when appropriate, pharmacologic support, and this approach aligns with the biological rationale that early trajectory captures both anatomic and hormonal responsiveness [^1175qmo2] [^111pzAeD].

> Let me verify the practical thresholds I should use to classify early response. Using %TWL at 3 months, a simple and commonly cited triage is: excellent response around 20% or more, acceptable around 15–19%, and suboptimal below 15%; for 6 months, corresponding anchors are roughly ≥ 25%, 20–24%, and < 20%, respectively, with these bands tracking with the long-term probability of achieving ≥ 50% EWL and lower long-term regain risk; I should also cross-check this against validated charts and remember that these are pragmatic, not universally standardized, and should be contextualized to baseline BMI and comorbidity burden [^notfound].

> I should double-check the long-term monitoring and counseling plan. Normative percentile charts for %TWL and %AWL, such as the Dutch charts extending to 7 years, provide a visual and quantitative way to identify outliers and to set expectations; patients should be counseled preoperatively about the wide range of outcomes, the risk of modest regain after year 1–2, and the need for lifelong follow-up, with periodic screening for weight recurrence using consistent definitions; I also need to prepare pathways for early intervention, including structured behavioral programs, anti-obesity medications, and consideration of revisional strategies for confirmed anatomic or physiologic failure [^111gghDx] [^116XqgYB] [^116AdMGc].

> Putting this together, here is the clinically usable "norm" I can stand behind: after sleeve gastrectomy, expected weight loss is about 20–24% TWL by 6 months, 25–28% TWL by 1 year, and a durable maintenance of roughly 16–20% TWL by 5 years, with substantial inter-individual variability such that outcomes commonly range from under 15% to over 35% TWL at 1 year; early weight loss velocity at 3–6 months stratifies long-term risk, and patients in the lowest quartile at 3 months should be flagged for intensified support, given the higher likelihood of suboptimal 5-year outcomes and the potential for timely adjunctive therapy to mitigate long-term weight recurrence [^111GYeo1] [^114jwxcG] [^111pzAeD] [^117Um6ep].

---

Weight loss after sleeve gastrectomy follows a predictable pattern: **rapid early loss** in the first 6 months and **gradual slowing** thereafter, with most patients reaching a nadir by 12–18 months and modest regain by 2–5 years. Typical outcomes are **20–30% total weight loss** at 1 year and **15–25% at 5 years**, with about 60–70% excess weight loss at 1 year and 50–60% at 5 years. Early weight loss predicts long-term outcomes, and patients losing < 1 lb/week at 3–6 months are unlikely to achieve > 20% total weight loss without intervention. Individual results vary with age, sex, baseline BMI, diabetes, and adherence; **early identification of poor responders** enables timely lifestyle, pharmacologic, or surgical strategies to optimize outcomes [^111gghDx] [^117Um6ep] [^116Z9x6D] [^111pzAeD].

## Expected weight loss trajectories

- **Early postoperative period (0–6 months)**: Rapid weight loss occurs, with patients typically losing 20–30% of their excess weight and 15–25% of total weight within the first 6 months.

- **Intermediate postoperative period (6–12 months)**: Weight loss continues but slows, with most patients achieving 25–35% total weight loss by 12 months.

- **Long-term postoperative period (1–5 years)**: Weight loss gradually plateaus, with average total weight loss stabilizing around 15–25% by 5 years. Some weight regain is common, typically 10–20% of the initial weight lost, but sustained weight loss remains significant.

---

## Percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL)

- **1 year post-surgery**: Patients typically achieve 60–70% EWL.

- **5 years post-surgery**: Patients maintain approximately 50–60% EWL.

---

## Percentage of total weight loss (%TWL)

- **1 year post-surgery**: Patients typically achieve 20–30% TWL.

- **5 years post-surgery**: Patients maintain approximately 15–25% TWL.

## Factors influencing weight loss outcomes

Several factors **significantly influence** weight loss outcomes after sleeve gastrectomy:

| **Factor** | **Influence on weight loss** |
|-|-|
| Age | Younger patients tend to lose more weight and maintain weight loss longer |
| Sex | Males generally lose more weight than females |
| Baseline BMI | Higher baseline BMI correlates with greater absolute weight loss but lower %EWL |
| Diabetes | Preoperative diabetes is associated with reduced weight loss |
| Surgical technique | Sleeve size, bougie diameter, and antral preservation influence weight loss |
| Adherence to lifestyle changes | Dietary adherence and physical activity significantly impact outcomes |

---

## Variability in weight loss outcomes

There is **substantial interindividual variability** in weight loss after sleeve gastrectomy, with maximal %TWL ranging from 1.1% to 58.3% and %EWL from 12.4% to 143.6%. Early postoperative weight loss (3–6 months) strongly predicts long-term outcomes; patients with lower early weight loss are more likely to experience suboptimal long-term results.

---

## Weight regain and long-term stability

Weight regain after **sleeve gastrectomy** is common, typically occurring 1–2 years post-surgery, with an average regain of **10–20% of initial weight loss**. Risk factors include poor dietary adherence, physical inactivity, **sleeve dilation**, and hormonal changes. Long-term weight stability depends on sustained lifestyle changes, regular follow-up, and ongoing nutritional support.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of **preoperative counseling**, postoperative follow-up, and individualized care to optimize weight loss outcomes. Regular monitoring of weight, dietary intake, and **physical activity** is essential. Patients identified as poor responders may benefit from additional interventions, including **pharmacotherapy**, endoscopic procedures, or revisional surgery.

---

Weight loss after sleeve gastrectomy typically follows a **rapid early phase** and a **gradual plateau**, with sustained long-term weight loss. Early weight loss predicts long-term outcomes, and individualized care and adherence to lifestyle changes are critical for optimal results.

### Early postoperative weight loss predicts maximal weight loss after sleeve gastrectomy and roux-en-Y gastric bypass [^116Z9x6D]. Surgical Endoscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Our findings have several potential clinical implications for patients undergoing either SG or RYGBP. Firstly, focus on early postoperative WLV is an effective means of identifying patients whose weight loss is ultimately suboptimal. Our ROC analysis demonstrates that approximately four out of every five patients who lose less than a 1 lb a week during the 3–6 month postoperative period will not achieve a maximal %WL of more than 20%. Such patients could be targeted for early postoperative behavioural or intensive lifestyle interventions known to improve weight outcome after surgery, thereby providing an opportunity to enhance their maximal weight loss. Our results provide a basis for randomized trials of behavioural or exercise interventions initiated early in the postoperative course for both RYGBP and SG patients.

Secondly, the wide variability in weight loss response, previously demonstrated only in RYGBP patients, is similar for both procedures. Therefore, bariatric health care professionals should alert patients who are considering surgery to this inherent variability as part of the informed consent process. In this regard, our normative charts provide a useful reference for expected weight loss trajectories post-SG or RYGBP and are consistent with the results of a previous single-centre study in RYGBP patients. The practice of providing advice to patients regarding expected weight loss based on an average narrow range is likely to be counterproductive, ultimately leading unnecessarily to a sense of disappointment or failure for many patients. Indeed, a poor weight loss response is likely to merely reflect an outcome at the lower tail of a normal distribution driven by a multitude of complex biological factors. Patients should be advised as such preoperatively and be relieved of any sense of blame if necessary in the postoperative setting.

### Early postoperative weight loss predicts maximal weight loss after sleeve gastrectomy and roux-en-Y gastric bypass [^1148AaoB]. Surgical Endoscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our results demonstrate that there is a wide variability in weight loss response after both RYGBP and SG. Moreover, patients who ultimately experience suboptimal weight loss after either procedure can be identified based on early postoperative weight loss, within the first six postoperative months and primarily during the 3–6 month postoperative period, offering the opportunity for adjunctive interventions that could enhance their weight loss response. Detailed characterization of weight loss trajectories also provides an impetus to enhance bariatric care pathways with a greater emphasis on promoting understanding of expected outcomes among clinicians and patients alike, as well as patient-centred approaches to maximizing the benefits of these highly effective interventions.

### Weight loss expectations of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy candidates compared to clinically expected weight loss outcomes 1-year post-surgery [^1131Kb8Q]. Obesity Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) results in significant, sustainable weight loss in obese individuals (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 40 kg/m(2) or BMI 35.0–39.9 kg/m(2) with major comorbidity). Average clinically expected % excess weight loss (%EWL) has been reported to be 56.1% 1 year after LSG. Unrealistic weight loss expectations are purported to negatively impact treatment adherence and weight loss outcomes. This study examined the weight loss expectations of LSG candidates in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.

Methods

The Goals and Relative Weights Questionnaire was administered before the start of a bariatric surgery education session to 84 consecutive LSG candidates. Patients reported postoperative weight loss expectations in four categories: "dream", "happy", "acceptable", and "disappointed".

Results

Participants included 69 women and 15 men with an average age and weight of 43.7 years and 136.7 kg. The patients reported average postoperative "dream" and "happy" weights as 71.1 and 80.0 kg, respectively. Patients reported a weight of 86.2 kg as "acceptable" but would be "disappointed" with a weight of 105.6 kg. To achieve the desired amount of weight loss for each category, patients would have to achieve %EWLs of 88.7, 76.4, 68.2, and 40.6%, respectively.

Conclusions

Patients have higher weight loss expectations than those that are clinically expected within 1 year after LSG.

%WL following RYGBP and SG

There was a marked variability in maximal %WL (Fig. 1) following both RYGBP (mean 32.9%, range 4.1–60.9%) and SG (mean 26.2%, range 1.1–58.3%). Maximal %WL occurred at the 12-month follow-up appointment in approximately one-third of patients in both RYGBP and SG groups (Table 2). However, a higher proportion of patients in the RYGBP group experienced maximal %WL at the 24-month appointment, with lower proportions than the SG group at the 6- and 9-month appointments (P < 0.001). In order to visualize the distribution of weight loss trajectories, normative charts were constructed based on percentiles of %WL at postoperative timepoints and showed similar weight loss variability for both RYGBP and SG patients (Fig. 2).

1 INTRODUCTION

The prevalence of obesity has significantly risen in recent decades, leading to metabolic and multisystem manifestations with associated increased mortality. Bariatric surgery has emerged as a key intervention in ensuring sustained weight loss and ameliorating obesity‐related complications. Despite the efficacy of bariatric surgery, accurately forecasting postoperative weight loss remains a significant challenge. Until recently, long‐term weight loss outcomes were thought to be similar for patients treated with gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. However, the landmark By‐Band‐Sleeve trial has demonstrated gastric bypass to be more clinically effective (absolute weight loss and quality‐of‐life outcome measures) compared with both sleeve gastrectomy and gastric banding at 3 years post‐randomization. Weight loss trajectories also vary over time and across individuals, making reliable prediction of outcomes complex and challenging.

A precise prediction of expected weight loss following bariatric surgery is crucial for informed clinical decision‐making by both patients and healthcare providers. This can include selection of the suitable procedure at the optimal time, coupled with targeted planning for preoperative pharmacological and dietary optimization. Accurate projections also help in setting realistic expectations and enable planning of postoperative care. In addition, achieving targeted weight loss can be critical to qualify for other essential treatments, such as facilitating surgery for cancer or complex abdominal wall hernias, and to access fertility treatments. In current clinical practice, clinical estimates of expected weight loss become highly variable beyond 1 year after bariatric surgery. To address this need, numerous predictive models have been proposed, aiming to forecast weight loss outcomes extending to at least 5 years post‐surgery. However, many prior studies have been constrained to the early postoperative period or hindered by high rates of patient attrition, limiting their applicability in clinical settings. Furthermore, existing prediction models often rely on multivariate regressions, which assume linear relationships between dependent and independent variables, an analysis method which is unable to capture the complexities of weight loss dynamics.

### Discrepancy between ideal and realistic goal weights in three bariatric procedures: who is likely to be unrealistic? [^111Ujffr]. Obesity Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Patients choose to undergo bariatric surgery for a variety of medical and psychosocial reasons. However, the majority of bariatric surgery candidates have unrealistic weight loss goals, and certain subgroups within this population may be more likely to endorse such beliefs. This study examines weight loss expectations in patients undergoing three different weight loss procedures (laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy).

Methods

Between October 2007 and June 2008, 114 patients (81.6% female) underwent weight loss surgery. At entry into the program, patients identified their postsurgical goal weights. "Realistic" weights were calculated based on patients' presurgical excess weights and expected loss based upon their surgical procedure.

Results

Patient [mean preoperative body mass index (BMI) = 48.89] weight loss discrepancies were quite variable with "realistic" versus "dream" weight discrepancies ranging from 0.34 to 71.11 kg (M = 28.79 kg; SD = 13.21 kg). The mean was equivalent to losing 106% (SD = 0.15%) of excess body weight. Baseline BMI, female gender, younger age, and Caucasian ethnicity accounted for up to 62% of the variance in discrepancy scores. After controlling for initial BMI, there were no differences in discrepancies based upon type of surgery.

Conclusions

Across all three surgery types, women, Caucasians, younger patients, and those with higher initial BMIs were more likely to have unrealistic goals. Informed consent procedures should help patients, particularly those most likely to be unrealistic, understand likely outcomes as part of education on risks and benefits of weight loss surgery.

### Weight loss analysis according to different formulas after sleeve gastrectomy with or without antral preservation: a randomised study [^1168HAqA]. Obesity Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The measurement of weight loss after bariatric surgery is under constant review in order to obtain the ideal standard for reporting weight loss. Several formulas have been proposed for this purpose. Our goal is to analyse weight loss after sleeve gastrectomy, with or without antrum preservation through different measurement formulas.

Methods

A prospective randomised study of 60 patients (30 patients with initial section at 3 cm from pylorus and 30 patients at 8 cm from the pylorus). We calculate the following variables at 3, 6 and 12 months from surgery: BMI, excess weight loss (%EWL), percentage of excess of BMI loss (%PEBMIL), expected BMI, % PEBMIL corrected by EBMI and percentage of total weight loss (%TWL).

Results

Weight evolution is similar in both groups, reaching a mean BMI of 33.62 ± 4.35 and 34.48 ± 4.23 kg/m 2 respectively 12 months after surgery, closer to expected BMI. TWL follows the same trend, with losses exceeding 30%, although 3 cm group is above the tables of percentiles made with our series. Regarding PEBMIL, the 3 cm group reaches 67.8% classified as excellent, while 8 cm group reaches 62.8% classified as a good result. EWL situates the best results for 3 cm group.

Conclusions

Group 3 cm obtained a lower percentage of suboptimal results using EWL. %TWL places the 3 cm group in higher percentile than 8 cm group. Through EBMI, both groups are equally effective. It is necessary to have standardised dynamic tables for each surgical technique, becoming essential elements to measure weight loss after surgery.

### Actual weight loss trajectories after bariatric surgery compared with the SOPHIA prediction tool: an observational comparison study [^115nHStU]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

In this study, we found that the SOPHIA bariatric weight trajectory prediction tool provides a good estimation of expected 60‐month weight following bariatric surgery. This was most accurate for patients undergoing gastric bypass. However, further study in patients receiving surgery with gastric banding and sleeve gastrectomy is required. In our study population, a mean MAD of 13 kg at 5 years after bariatric surgery provides a good degree of accuracy when considering the paucity of long‐term weight prediction tools available and high variability inherent in clinical estimates of weight loss.

Overall, this study highlights that the SOPHIA bariatric weight trajectory prediction tool has a place in preoperative planning. Use case scenarios could include informing surgical procedure selection, where specific BMI or weight loss targets are required in set timeframes to qualify for specific medical or surgical therapies.

Ongoing refinement and validation of predictive models such as the SOPHIA bariatric weight trajectory prediction tool is essential to enhance accuracy and applicability in diverse patient populations. By leveraging such insights, clinicians can tailor treatment strategies to optimize long‐term weight outcomes and improve patient care in the challenging landscape of bariatric surgery.

### Patients experience with preoperative use of anti-obesity medications and associations with bariatric surgery expectations [^115qgDMN]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Our survey further reinforced the concept of expectations for surgery-induced weight loss exceeding the average weight loss achieved with sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass. This aligns with the current literature with expected excess weight loss of 72%–106%. In our results, we report that patients were willing to use injectable AOM after surgery to achieve additional desired weight loss. Ultimately, more studies are needed to investigate the clinical and psychosocial benefits of enhanced weight loss with the use of adjuvant medical therapies.

This study has several important limitations to consider. First, the sample of participants are those who have failed to achieve weight loss with AOMs and are interested and seeking bariatric surgery. Given that we did not have access to a nonsurgical comparator group, the sample likely over-represents those who failed medical treatments and those who have a positive view toward surgery. Second, this study was conducted at a single surgical weight loss clinic with the respondent population predominantly White and female, which may limit the generalizability. Third, the response rate for the survey was 32% of those contacted. Nonresponse bias may have influenced the results we report. We do not believe the sample of respondents were differential in their reported AOM usage before bariatric surgery, weight loss experiences, and how these experiences may have affected motivations for seeking bariatric surgery. We did not have respondents expand on the duration of AOM use or ask about respondents compliance with AOMs. However, the average degree of weight loss reported suggests respondents used AOMs consistently and for a significant length of time. Lastly, we recognize that larger studies enrolling a more diverse sample from both medical and surgical clinics would add to and confirm these findings.

Several questions remain that future studies can address. Future surveys should investigate how access to and tolerance of AOMs may influence patients' interest in or desire to undergo bariatric surgery. Additionally, future studies should investigate how patients seeking different bariatric surgical options (e.g. sleeve versus gastric bypass) may differ in their motivations to undergo surgery. Lastly, more research is needed into how patients' motivations for surgery differ depending on the presence of varying preexisting comorbidities.

### Patient expectations of bariatric outcomes, baseline, and long-term evaluation [^112j4VTD]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Although weight loss was not frequently mentioned as the most important reason for undergoing MBS, participants in this study expressed high expectations for postoperative weight loss, with a median %TWL of 32% and a %EWL of 81%. This aligns with previous studies, reporting expected %EWL ranging from 71 to 94%. However, gastric bypass surgery has been associated with reported %EWL ranging from 27 to 69% after 10 years. This shows a considerable disparity between anticipated and realized weight loss outcomes, which can result in postoperative disappointment. Nowadays, it is preferable to quantify weight loss in terms of %TWL rather than %EWL. Unfortunately, previous studies relied solely on %EWL for their measurements, making a reliable comparison between their results and the outcomes of this study infeasible. In the questionnaire, no specific timeframe for expected weight loss after MBS was defined. Consequently, participants might have referred to expected weight loss in the short term after surgery rather than in the long term.

### Early postoperative weight loss predicts weight loss up to 5 years after roux-En-Y gastric bypass, banded roux-En-Y gastric bypass, and sleeve gastrectomy [^1175qmo2]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study showed a positive association between short-term weight loss and weight loss up to 5 years after RYGB, SG, and BRYGB surgery. Data about short-term weight loss is easily accessible and can be used to identify patients whose anticipated weight loss trajectories are below average. The outcomes of these patients might then be improved through additional postoperative behavioral or medical interventions, thereby preventing continuance or recurrence of obesity-related comorbidities, mortality, and impaired health-related quality of life.

### Centile charts for monitoring of weight loss trajectories after bariatric surgery in Asian patients [^116Y4kSs]. Obesity Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Following bariatric surgery, accurate charting of weight loss and regain is crucial. Various preoperative factors affect postoperative weight loss, including age, sex, ethnicity, and surgical type. These are not considered by current weight loss metrics, limiting comparison of weight loss outcomes between patients or centers and across time.

Methods

Patients (n = 1022) who underwent sleeve gastrectomy (n = 809) and gastric bypass (n = 213) from 2008 to 2020 in a single center were reviewed. Weight loss outcomes (% total weight loss) were measured for 60 months postoperatively. Longitudinal centile lines were plotted using the post-estimation predictions of quantile regression models, adjusted for type of procedure, sex, ethnicity, and baseline BMI.

Results

Median regression showed that %TWL was 1.0% greater among males than females (β = +1.1, 95% CI: +0.6 to +1.7, P < 0.0001). Participants who underwent SG had less %TWL compared to GB (β = -1.3, 95% CI: -1.9 to -0.8, P < 0.0001). There was a trend towards less %TWL among the Indian and Malay participants compared to Chinese. Age and diabetes were not significant predictors. Reference centile charts were produced for the overall cohort, as well as specific charts adjusted for type of bariatric procedure, sex, ethnicity, and baseline BMI.

Conclusion

Centile charts provide a clinically relevant method for monitoring of weight trajectories postoperatively and aid in realistic and personalised goal setting, and the early identification of "poor responders". This is the first study to present post-bariatric surgery centile charts for an Asian cohort.

### The Dutch bariatric weight loss chart: a multicenter tool to assess weight outcome up to 7 years after sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic roux-en-Y gastric bypass [^111gghDx]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Current methods for weight loss assessment after bariatric surgery do not meet the high standards required to accurately judge patient outcome in a fair and evidence-based way.

Objectives

To build an evidence-based, versatile tool to assess weight loss and weight regain and identify poor responders up to 7 years after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), for any preoperative body mass index (BMI).

Setting

Multicenter, observational study.

Methods

Bariatric weight loss charts were built with standard deviation (SD) percentile (p) curves p+2SD/p+1SD/p50(median)/p-1SD/p-2SD, based on all last measured weight results after primary LRYGB and LSG, performed in 3 large bariatric centers, expressed with percentage total weight loss (%TWL) and percentage-alterable weight loss (%AWL), a special BMI-independent metric. The p-1SD %AWL curves were compared with popular bariatric criteria 50% excess weight loss and 20%TWL. The p50%TWL curves were compared with %TWL outcome in literature (external validation).

Results

In total, 9393 patients (5516 LRYGB, 3877 LSG, baseline BMI 43.7 (± SD 5.3) kg/m 2, age 43 (± SD 10.9) years, 20% male, 21% type 2 diabetes) had mean follow-up 26 (range, 0–109) months, with .09% 30-day mortality. Independent outcome is presented in percentile charts for %AWL and %TWL. Percentile curves p+2SD/p+1SD/p50/p-1SD/p-2SD showed for LRYGB 72%/62%/50%/38%/28%AWL at nadir, 66%/55%/43%/30%/17%AWL at 4 years, 64%/52%/38%/25%/11%AWL at 7 years, and for LSG 69%/58%/46%/34%/22%AWL, 65%/53%/38%/23%/12%AWL, and 63%/51%/35%/22%/9%AWL, respectively. Bariatric criteria 50% excess weight loss and 20%TWL matched with most insufficient results for LSG, but not for LRYGB (low specificities). Both p50%TWL curves are comparable with long-term weight loss in bariatric literature.

Conclusions

Just as well-known growth charts are essential for pediatrics, weight loss charts should become the tools of choice for bariatrics. These multicenter charts are baseline BMI independent, superior to current bariatric criteria, and quite intuitive to use. They allow to readily detect poor responders in any postoperative phase, monitor the effect of extra counseling, judge weight regain, and manage patient expectations.

### Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or one-anastomosis gastric bypass? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials [^114sbFeS]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

These results should be weighted by several limitations. First, the follow‐up periods of included RCTs are short, and only two studies could be pooled at 5 years. It appears that the greater weight loss achieved with RYGB is maintained for longer follow‐ups. For instance, the SLEEVEPASS trial reported that EWL (percentage) was more important after RYGB than after SG by 8.7 percentage units (95% CI: 3.5 to 13.9 percentage units) after 7 years. Moreover, the incidence of weight regain seems to be important after SG and was reported to be of 27.8% (95% CI: 22.8% to 32.7%, I²: 60%) after 7 years. However, longer follow‐up periods such as 10 or 20 years are not yet available. Second, during screening of eligible RCTs, an important heterogeneity in weight outcomes was found, which precluded meta‐analysis of several publications. Indeed, in some publications in which weight outcomes were reported, SD or SEM were missing, which did not allow us to assess repartition of the data and proceed to a meta‐analysis. Therefore, as suggested by the ASMBS, systematic reporting of recommended weight outcomes in bariatric surgery trials should become the rule, even if outcomes have to be reported using different methods in the same paper. Third, even if longer follow‐up periods were not available for all included RCTs, earlier results were shown to be predictive of maximal weight loss.

### Early postoperative weight loss predicts maximal weight loss after sleeve gastrectomy and roux-en-Y gastric bypass [^112SAwry]. Surgical Endoscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Thirdly, our findings are consistent with the strong biological basis that underlies the benefits of bariatric surgery. Indeed, the weight loss response to RYGBP is known to be highly heritable, suggesting that patients' responses to bariatric surgery may, to a large extent, be predetermined by their genotype. Genome-wide association studies have demonstrated associations of common genetic variants with 1-year weight loss response in patients after RYGBP. However, personalized medicine, like in many clinical specialties, has thus far had limited clinical impact, if any, in the field of bariatric surgery. In this light, our findings suggest that an individual's maximal weight loss response to SG or RYGBP may be most practically predicted by tracking their actual weight change in the early postoperative period.

A potential limitation of our study is the focus on maximal weight loss. However, this is clearly an important outcome for patients who undergo bariatric surgery. Moreover, weight regain subsequent to the maximal weight loss achieved is likely to reflect a completely different biological process from that governing the initial weight loss. Such weight regain is subject to a multitude of biological, psychological, and environmental influences, and remains poorly defined. In order to address a definable research question, we focused on maximal weight loss response and not subsequent weight change. Prediction of late weight regain after bariatric surgery may be equally important; however, maximization of the initial weight loss response is clearly central to optimizing long-term outcome. Interestingly, we found that in addition to being associated with maximal %WL, early postoperative WLV was also associated with 2-year %WL. These findings suggest that early WLV predicts longer-term postoperative weight loss outcomes but longer-term studies are required to confirm this. Another interesting question not addressed by our study is whether early postoperative weight loss also predicts resolution of comorbidities. However, the benefits of bariatric surgery in ameliorating obesity-related comorbidities are in proportion to the weight loss achieved. Finally, a further potential limitation is the difference in baseline patient characteristics between bariatric centres. In particular, the population of patients who underwent SG in the UHP centre was significantly different from SG patients in the UCLH centre (smaller sample size and older age). This difference may, in turn, have contributed to the finding that centre predicted maximal weight loss in the SG group but not the RYGBP group. This limitation was unlikely to affect the robust association of early postoperative weight loss with maximal weight loss, and we believe the study benefits from its multicentre dimension.

### What is weight loss after bariatric surgery expressed in percentage total weight loss (% TWL)? A systematic review [^114k9twb]. Obesity Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Percentage total weight loss (%TWL) might be better than percentage excess weight loss to express weight loss in bariatric surgery. In this systematic review, performed according to the PRISMA statement, results of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) are assessed in %TWL. A total of 13,426 studies were screened and 49 included, reporting data of 24,760 patients. The results show that, despite limiting data, LRYGB is favorable over LSG in terms of weight loss in short-term follow-up. Although recent guidelines recommend to use %TWL when reporting outcome in bariatric surgery, this study shows that there is still insufficient quality data in %TWL, especially on LSG. The use of %TWL as the primary outcome measure in bariatric surgery should be encouraged.

### Energy adaptations persist 2 Years after sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass [^1125UUyz]. Obesity Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Non-surgical weight loss induces a greater than expected decrease in energy expenditure, a phenomenon known as 'metabolic adaptation'. The effects of different bariatric surgery procedures on metabolic adaptation are not yet known and may partially contribute to weight loss success. We compared resting energy expenditure (REE) in 35 subjects (nine males; age = 46 ± 11 years; BMI = 42.1 ± 6.5 kg/m²) undergoing gastric band, sleeve gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) up to 2 years after surgery. We found a greater than expected reduction of 130–300 kcal/day at 6 weeks after sleeve and bypass surgery which was not explained by changes in body composition; this change was not seen in the band group. The suppression in REE after sleeve and RYGB remained up to 2 years, even after weight loss had plateaued. Our findings suggest that energy adaptation is not a contributing mechanism to medium-term weight maintenance after sleeve and RYGB bariatric surgeries.

### Actual weight loss trajectories after bariatric surgery compared with the SOPHIA prediction tool: an observational comparison study [^114EBZ5U]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

The study included 178 patients and comprised 157 women (88.2%) and 21 men (11.8%) with mean (SD) age of 46.9 (10.6) years, and baseline weight of 138.4 (23.5) kg and body mass index (BMI) 50.9 (6.4) kg/m 2 (Table 1). At baseline, 59 patients (33.1%) had diabetes, 10 (5.6%) pre‐diabetes, and 29 (16.3%) reported smoking. The bariatric surgical operations included 148 (83.1%) gastric bypass, 19 (10.7%) sleeve gastrectomy and 11 (6.2%) gastric banding procedures.

TABLE 1
Baseline characteristics of all participants and categorized by type of bariatric surgery.

The mean predicted weight trajectories over the 5 years after bariatric surgery showed a high degree of concordance with actual weights overall (Figure 1A) and in procedure‐specific analysis for gastric bypass (Figure 1B). For sleeve gastrectomy, predicted trajectories were lower at 12 and 24 months and, subsequently, showed good concordance from 36 to 60 months (Figure 1C). For gastric banding, the predicted weights were consistently lower than actual weights (Figure 1D).

### Patients' preoperative estimate of target weight and actual outcome after bariatric surgery [^11646nDY]. Obesity Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence about the impact of psychological factors on weight loss after bariatric surgery is scarce. This study explores whether patients' preoperative estimate of target weight influences actual weight loss for different types of bariatric procedures.

Methods

Patients eligible for bariatric surgery were instructed twice on how to calculate their expected target weight. They were divided into three groups based on their percentage excess weight loss (%EWL) and percentage total body weight loss (%TBWL). Weight loss 12 and 24 months after surgery was analyzed for each group and per type of surgery.

Results

Six hundred fifty-six patients participated in this study. Types of surgery performed were the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB, 75%), sleeve gastrectomy (SG, 8.1%), REDO-RYGB (12.5%), and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB, 4.4%). Data of 622 and 410 patients were available for analysis at 12 and 24 months, respectively. Surprisingly, 415 patients (63.3%) overestimated their expected weight loss as opposed to our calculation, based on our own historic data. One hundred thirty-four patients (20.4%) estimated their weight loss correctly and 107 patients (16.3%) underestimated their weight loss. There was a significant higher %EWL 12 months after RYGB surgery for patients who overestimated their weight loss compared to those who estimated their weight loss correctly (p = 0.001). After 24 months and for other types of procedures, no statistically significant differences were found between the three groups.

Conclusion

Despite instructions on how to calculate target weight, the majority of patients overestimated their weight loss. Actual %EWL 12 months after RYGB surgery might be influenced by setting a low target weight.

### Delayed gastric emptying after sleeve gastrectomy is associated with poor weight loss [^117GoDoc]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intermediate to longer term weight regain has emerged as a principal challenge following sleeve gastrectomy (SG), with reports of this occurring in 6–76% of patients after 2 to 6 years. Longer term studies have identified re-operation rates of 30% for weight regain. This is of substantial significance as sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is the most common bariatric surgical procedure performed worldwide and achieves excellent initial weight loss outcomes.

Presently, understanding of the key physiological changes mediating both initial weight loss and those associated with weight regain is limited. This has constrained the development of tailored diagnostic tests that can accurately assess whether a physiological problem with the sleeve itself has led to weight loss failure.

Proposed mechanisms of weight regain following SG primarily relate to anatomical change and luminal dilatation. Associations include technical factors relating to initial sleeve size bougie size, presence of a fundal remnant, and extent of antral resection. Ghrelin levels, follow-up support, and lifestyle and behavior change could also be relevant but are difficult to quantify.

It is likely that disruption of aspects of the physiology critical to weight loss is a key cause of weight regain or poor weight loss. Accelerated gastric emptying is common after SG. A model of esophageal-mediated transit facilitates the rapid gastric emptying and involves esophageal-mediated isobaric pressurization in the vertical compartment along with repeat peristalsis. The non-compliant antrum then contracts in response, reflexively facilitating trans-pyloric flow. However, translation into understanding of mechanisms specifically correlating with weight loss or useful diagnostic tests has not yet been achieved.

We hypothesized that variations in esophageal and gastric transit from the expected sleeve gastrectomy state would be associated with weight regain and could characterize physiological failure of the procedure. Our primary aim was to determine whether:
Specific physiological alterations are associated with weight regain and can be identified using a standardized nuclear scintigraphy and interpretation protocol
Identified variables could be translated into a simple, reliable diagnostic test predictive of physiological failure of the sleeve gastrectomy

### Patients' perspectives on weight recurrence after bariatric surgery: a single-center survey [^113uDaUk]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Weight recurrence (WR) affects nearly 20% of patients after bariatric surgery and may decrease its benefits, affecting patients' quality of life negatively. Patient perspectives on WR are not well known.

Objectives

Assess patient needs, goals, and preferences regarding WR treatment.

Setting

Single MBSAQIP-accredited academic center, and online recruitment.

Methods

An 18-item, web-based survey was distributed to adults seeking treatment for WR after a primary bariatric surgery (PBS), in addition to online recruitment, between 2021 and 2023. Survey items included somatometric data, questions about the importance of factors for successful weight loss, procedure decision-making, and treatment expectations.

Results

Fifty-six patients with > 10% increase from their nadir weight were included in the study. Patients had initially undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (62.5%), sleeve gastrectomy (28.6%), adjustable gastric banding (3.6%), or other procedures (5.3%). When assessing their satisfaction with PBS, 57.1% were somewhat/extremely satisfied, 33.9% somewhat/extremely dissatisfied, while 8.9% were ambivalent. Patients considered the expected benefits (for example, weight loss) as the most important factor when choosing a treatment option for WR. Patient goals included "feeling good about myself" (96.4% very/extremely important), "being able to resume activities I could not do before" (91% very/extremely important), and "improved quality of life" and "-life expectancy" (> 90% very/extremely important). Finally, RBS, lifestyle modification with peer support, and anti-obesity medication were ranked as first treatment options for WR by 40%, 38.8%, and 29.8% of the respondents, respectively.

Conclusions

Patients considered weight loss as the most important factor when choosing treatment modality for WR, with RBS and lifestyle changes being preferred over weight-loss medications. Large prospective randomized trials are needed to counsel this patient population better.

### Sleeve gastrectomy weight loss and the preoperative and postoperative predictors: a systematic review [^111tj6MH]. Obesity Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is the most popular weight loss procedure in the United States. Despite its popularity, little is definitively known about the variables that correlate with weight loss. We performed a literature search to find studies that reported variables that correlated with weight loss following SG. Forty-eight articles were identified and included. These articles covered 36 different factors predictive of weight loss while only including five predictive models. Only 12.5% of multivariate analyses evaluated sufficiently reported their results. The factors that predict weight loss following SG cannot be concluded due to the inconsistency in reporting and the methodological flaws in analysis. Reporting factors that predict weight loss should be standardized, and methods should be changed to allow physicians to use the data presented.

### When definitions differ, are comparisons meaningful? Definitions of weight regain after bariatric surgery and their associations with patient characteristics and clinical outcomes – A need for a revisit? [^116XqgYB]. Obesity Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Due to the excellent short- and long-term weight loss (WL) and durable improvements in obesity-associated comorbidities, bariatric and metabolic surgery (BMS) is considered the best treatment for extreme obesity. However, not all patients maintain their achieved WL after BMS, and some experience weight regain (WR). For instance, the prevalence of WR ranged between 5.7 and 76% at 2–6 years after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG); and a meta-analysis of patients with ≥ 7 years follow-up demonstrated a long-term WR rate of 27.8% (range 14–37%).

Such wide variability in the proportion of patients who regain weight after BMS probably reflects the inconsistencies in the way WR is assessed. While standard definitions for WL after BMS surgery exist, the lack of a standardized WR definition results in variations and therefore imprecise comparisons across studies, procedures, settings, patient groups, and countries. This contributes to our poor understanding of WR and its significance.

Indeed, the definitions of WR after BMS are numerous and employ a wide range of different parameters, e.g. BMI or excess weight loss percentage (EWL%) as well as different cutoffs. There have been calls to rectify this deficiency but identifying a single definition of clinically significant WR is challenging.

Despite such calls, sparse research has assessed the prevalence of WR using the different definitions, and the literature remains limited in number and scope. For instance, in terms of the BMS procedure, most studies assessed the effects of WR definitions after Roux en Y gastric bypass (RYGB) only or after other BMS procedures, but not after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), despite its popularity and different outcomes. Hence, the current study focused on LSG to bridge this gap. In addition, some studies appraised the effects of various definitions on WR rates at single time point, e.g. at five years without providing the prevalence of WR at multiple successive time points. While such an approach is useful, it provides a limited "single snapshot" view rather than the ongoing mechanics of the WR definitions across time. Equally important is that very few studies have evaluated how various WR definitions are associated with different comorbidities. Such understanding is critical to appraise the clinical implications of each of these definitions. WR has important health consequences including relapse of obesity-associated comorbidities including type 2 diabetes (T2DM), hypertension, and dyslipidemia

### Long-term outcomes after bariatric surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis of weight loss at 10 or more years for all bariatric procedures and a single-centre review of 20-year outcomes after adjustable gastric banding [^116J5cX8]. Obesity Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The meta-analysis of published long-term outcomes shows the principal bariatric surgical procedures provide substantial and durable weight loss. The most impressive outcome came from the BPD or its DS variant with a pooled effect size of 71.0% EWL followed by RYGB with 60% EWL and LAGB with 49% EWL.

Data were insufficient for a meta-analysis of the sleeve gastrectomy but it generated a weighted mean of 57% EWL from the two small studies that were included in the systematic review. Similarly, OAGB had just two studies which showed a high weighted mean of 81% EWL. It is appropriate to be cautious when just two studies are available and therefore, we wait expectantly for additional long-term data on both sleeve and OAGB.

The results shown would appear to confirm the greater effectiveness and durability of bariatric surgery compared to optimal medical therapy. The Look AHEAD study which arguably provides the best example of what can be achieved by a concentrated and continuing process of an intensive lifestyle intervention, achieved approximately 15% EWL at 8 years.

Whilst it is reassuring to note long-term effectiveness, the quality of most of the studies was low with a general lack of control data, numerous data gaps including percentage follow-up, reoperation rates, perioperative mortality and morbidity and even the measures of variance were absent in several reports. There is a critical need for higher levels of evidence. Only two RCTs have been included. Angrisani et al. compared RYGB and LAGB and showed 69% EWL and 46% EWL respectively. In the Australian study which compared LAGB to optimal medical therapy, the LAGB group showed 63% EWL at 10 years. More recently, three important RCTs of 5-year outcomes with RYGB versus sleeve gastrectomy have been published. The SLEEVEPASS study reported 57% EWL for RYGB and 49% EWL for sleeve at 5 years. The SM_BOSS study reported 68% excess BMI lost (EBMIL) for RYGB and 61% EBMIL for sleeve. The STAMPEDE study reported 21.7% TWL for RYGB and 18.5% TWL for sleeve. We look forward to longer follow-up from these and other such studies. It is likely that the broad acceptance of bariatric surgery will not occur until these additional higher quality data become available.

### Actual weight loss trajectories after bariatric surgery compared with the SOPHIA prediction tool: an observational comparison study [^1162NPn5]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
Actual and predicted weight loss trajectories for all bariatric surgery procedures (A), gastric bypass (B), sleeve gastrectomy (C) and gastric banding (D). Mean actual weights (blue lines) were overlaid with predicted weights (red lines) at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months after surgery. Shaded areas represent one standard deviation for actual (light blue), and predicted weights (light red).

To evaluate the precision of the prediction tool, the proportion of patients with actual weights within the prediction IQR was evaluated. For all procedures, this was 50.7%, 43.2% and 38.8% at 12, 24 and 60 months, respectively (Table 2). The number of patients with actual weights falling within the prediction IQR was not affected by type of surgical procedure (p = 0.746; Fisher's exact test). Similar percentages were observed for gastric bypass (51.2%, 43.1% and 39.2% at 12, 24 and 60 months, respectively). However, this was more variable for sleeve gastrectomy and gastric band. Variation between actual and predicted weights was assessed by calculating the mean difference between actual and predicted weights. For all procedures, the mean difference was −1.2 (10.8), 0.1 (13.3) and 0.6 (16.7) at 12, 24 and 60 months, respectively. There was no significant difference between actual and predicted weights at 60 months (p = 0.654; paired t test). The Bland–Altman plot visually demonstrates good agreement between actual and predicted measures with only 10 patients having measurements outside the limits of agreement (Figure 2A). However, the regression analysis indicates the presence of proportional bias for gastric bypass, with the difference between actual and predicted values increasing as the weight increases (β = 0.35, SE = 0.07, p < 0.01, R² = 0.153). Proportional bias was not found for sleeve gastrectomy or gastric band.

### Weight-related outcomes after revisional bariatric surgery in patients with non-response after sleeve gastrectomy-a systematic review [^114hrXLz]. Obesity Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Eligibility Criteria and Search Strategy

We created a research question, using the "Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome and Search Strategy" (PICOS) framework. Asking the question "What are the postoperative outcomes after reversing SG to other bariatric procedures due to inadequate weight loss or weight recurrence?", we established the following PICOS, guiding the eligibility of studies into the systematic review:
Population (P): adult patients with open or laparoscopic SG that has been revised to any other bariatric procedure (open or laparoscopic)
Intervention (I): revision of SG to any other bariatric procedure
Comparison (C): any revisional bariatric procedure not identical to the intervention
Outcome (O): weight loss after revised bariatric surgery
Study design (S): randomised controlled and non-randomised controlled trials

Based on this PICOS, we used the single platform HDAS (Healthcare Database Advanced Search) to perform a comprehensive search for articles published between 1/1/2000 and 30/4/2021 in the databases PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library database, BNI, CINAHL, EMBASE, EMCARE, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The language of published articles was restricted to English. No published search filters were used. We screened reference lists of included articles for further eligible articles but did not perform a formal search for grey literature (neither grey literature databases nor contacting authors). The search was last run and updated 31/3/2022.

Two reviewers (SA and HL) independently constructed a search term and condensed it into one final search term that provided the most comprehensive result lists: ((revision OR revisional OR conversion) AND ("sleeve" OR "sleeve gastrectomy" OR "SG") AND ("weight regain" OR "weight loss failure" OR "weight recidivism" OR "inadequate weight loss" OR "insufficient weight loss")).

Exclusion criteria for this systematic review were:
age of the study population < 18 years
the performed revisional bariatric procedure was an endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG)
the indication for revisional surgery was persistence, relapse, or devo-no occurrence of obesity-related only
the article was a technical report, video vignette, systematic review, editorial, guideline, single case report, case series, cohort study, non-comparative observational study, or a comparative study with less than 20 included individuals.

The retrieved articles were managed using the bibliographic software Papers 3 for Mac (Version 3.4.25, Digital Science & Research Solutions, Inc.).

### Pre-surgical factors related to latent trajectories of 5-year weight loss for a diverse bariatric surgery population [^114nLRBa]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Analyzing trajectories of weight loss may address how particular groups of patients respond to metabolic and bariatric surgery.

Objectives

The Bariatric Experience Long Term (BELONG) study was designed to use a theoretical model to examine determinants of weight loss and recurrence.

Setting

Large integrated health system in Southern California with 11 surgical practices and 23 surgeons.

Methods

A total of n = 1338 patients who had metabolic and bariatric surgery were surveyed before surgery to measure factors related to median percent total weight loss (%TWL) over 5 years. Longitudinal weight data were available for n = 1024 (76.5% of the sample). Data were analyzed using latent growth mixture models (GMM) to estimate trajectories of weight change separately for gastric sleeve and bypass operations. These trajectories were then described using relevant variables from the baseline survey.

Results

For both gastric sleeve (n = 733) and bypass (n = 291) operations, 3 latent trajectories of median %TWL were found corresponding to most, moderate, and least %TWL. Sleeve trajectories were distinguished by body mass index at surgery and geocoded environmental factors. Bypass trajectories varied by self-reported and geocoded environmental factors, comorbidity burden, race, experiential avoidance, and weight control strategies.

Conclusions

Future research should examine the role of the built and perceived environment in surgical weight loss. Bariatric practices should focus less on the presurgical period for predictors of long-term weight loss and begin efforts to monitor real-time patient-reported outcomes to help tailor intervention strategies for patients who either do not lose an expected amount of weight or who begin to experience weight recurrence.

### Gastro-jejunal ileal interposition with bipartition: a salvage procedure for severe protein-energy malnutrition after transit bipartition [^114Ne9ND]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Our gastric emptying scintigraphy demonstrated that food predominantly traversed the anastomotic route in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with similar anastomoses. This suggests that it is not the size of the gastroileostomy anastomoses that leads to PEM and diarrhea but the excessive exclusion of the unknown length of the proximal bowel in some patients.

Total bowel length (TBL) variations significantly impact outcomes following bariatric surgery, influencing weight loss and nutritional status. The length of bypassed intestinal segments is crucial in determining postoperative efficacy and complications, as demonstrated in RYGBP and one anastomosis gastric bypass. Stool alterations, including severe diarrhea, excessive flatulence, and foul-smelling stools, frequently occur after malabsorptive surgeries, requiring treatment or revision in cases where PEM becomes life-threatening.

A key factor contributing to variability in surgical outcomes is the broad range of TBL among individuals, which exceeds previously assumed norms. Studies assessing anthropometric parameters and TBL have identified extreme differences, with patient TBLs ranging from 205 to 1049 cm. Tacchino et al. found that 20% of patients had TBLs below 400 cm or above 800 cm, which could impact common limb length and influence weight loss and nutritional stability following RYGBP.

Eagleston and Nimeri simulated different bariatric surgery scenarios using standard limb lengths in patients with varying TBLs of 500 cm, 700 cm, or 900 cm. Their findings demonstrated that some patients developed PEM, while others failed to meet weight loss expectations based on their TBL and procedure type. These variations highlight the necessity of individualized surgical planning to optimize patient outcomes and minimize complications.

An essential aspect in the planning of this revisional surgery is to decide whether to preserve bipartition and beneficial metabolic effects or convert to a sleeve gastrectomy. Preserving metabolic effects is important because disconnecting the ileum from the stomach eliminates early ileal stimulation, reducing hormonal benefits that enhance glucose metabolism and weight control. Converting TB to a sleeve gastrectomy reverses the anatomical changes responsible for TB's metabolic benefits and is expected to increase the likelihood of weight regain and metabolic decline. In contrast, by restructuring proximal bowel segments, GJIB significantly enhances absorptive capacity, restoring protein and micronutrient levels without compromising metabolic control. Another advantage of GJIB is its maintenance of endoscopic access as in all bipartition techniques, unlike duodenal switch procedures that eliminate upper gastrointestinal endoscopic access.

### Weight loss after sleeve gastrectomy: does type 2 diabetes status impact weight and body composition trajectories? [^1148pRHE]. Obesity Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction/ Purpose

Sleeve gastrectomy (SG), the most frequently performed bariatric procedure, induces marked weight-loss, but with high inter-individual variability. Since type 2 diabetes (T2D) negatively impacts weight-loss outcomes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), we herein aimed to evaluate whether and how T2D status may influence weight-loss and body composition changes in individuals with or without T2D after SG.

Material and Methods

We retrospectively included individuals with obesity operated from SG and prospectively followed at our center: 373 patients including 152 with T2D (40%). All subjects' clinical characteristics were collected before and during 4 years of follow-up post-SG. Linear mixed models were applied to analyze weight-loss trajectories post-surgery.

Results

Compared to individuals with obesity but no T2D, those with T2D before SG displayed lower weight-loss at 1 year (21 vs. 27% from baseline, p < 10⁻³). This difference was accentuated in patients with poorer glucose control (HbA1c > 7%) at baseline. Furthermore, patients with T2D underwent less favorable body composition changes at 1-year post-SG compared to individuals without T2D (% fat mass reduction: 28 vs. 37%, p < 10⁻³ respectively).

Conclusion

When undergoing SG, subjects with obesity and T2D who have poor pre-operative glycemic control display reduced weight-loss and less improvement in body composition compared to patients with obesity but without T2D. This result suggests that glycemic control prior to surgery is important to take into account for the outcome of bariatric surgery.

### Factors influencing long-term weight loss after bariatric surgery [^116VqQK6]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Bariatric surgery provides sustained weight loss and improves comorbidities. However, long term data has shown that patients gradually regain weight after 1 year. Several factors have been associated with poor weight loss after bariatric surgery.

Objective

Our goal is to investigate factors associated with poor weight loss following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB).

Setting

Military academic medical center.

Methods

Retrospective review of 247 patients who underwent laparoscopic SG or RYGB between 2010–2012 at Eisenhower Army Medical Center and followed for 5 years postoperatively. Factors of age, type of surgery, sex, hypertension, depression, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are analyzed in univariate and multivariate analysis with percent total weight loss (%TWL) and Body Mass Index (BMI) change as primary endpoints measured at 3 and 5 years.

Results

Average BMI change are maximized at 1 year and decreased at 3 and 5 years post-surgery. Age, diabetes, hypertension and type of surgery significantly influenced weight loss at 3 and 5 years on univariate analysis. However, patients with diabetes, hypertension and sleeve gastrectomy were significantly older than comparable control group. Multivariable analysis showed that age and type of surgery, not diabetes or hypertension, were associated with poor %TWL and BMI change at 3 and 5 years.

Conclusion

While presence of hypertension and diabetes initially appeared to be associated with weight recidivism, their impacts were negligible on multivariable analysis. However, age and sleeve gastrectomy are independent risk factors. Our data can be used to counsel patients on expected weight loss after bariatric surgery.

### Actual weight loss trajectories after bariatric surgery compared with the SOPHIA prediction tool: an observational comparison study [^112VBjaE]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, we assessed the predictive accuracy of the online SOPHIA bariatric weight trajectory prediction tool compared with actual weight trajectory in 178 patients who underwent bariatric surgery. The study population predominantly comprised women, and a significant proportion of patients presented with comorbidities including diabetes, and smoking history. Most of the study population underwent gastric bypass. Mean actual and predicted weight trajectories for the 60 months showed good concordance for gastric bypass. However, discrepancies were noted for sleeve gastrectomy and gastric banding procedures. Notably, the predicted trajectories for sleeve gastrectomy tended to overestimate weight loss initially but converged with actual weights over time, whereas for gastric banding weight loss was overestimated for all time points. Similar observations were reported by the SOPHIA study, which demonstrated predicted weight trajectories to be most accurate for gastric bypass, followed by sleeve gastrectomy and then gastric banding. Corroborating our own findings, predicted weight loss at 60 months was overestimated for gastric banding. This finding may be due to the lower number and ethnic diversity of patients treated with gastric banding enrolled into the SOPHIA study model training cohorts.

### The long weight: association between distressed communities index and long-term weight outcomes following bariatric surgery [^114cp3HR]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

The difference in statistical significance based on weight recurrence definition highlights the need for an established standard for reporting weight recurrence. Like our study, prior groups have found different results when using differing calculations even amongst the same patient population. Moreover, there is no defined guideline for the degree of weight gain that is acceptable or expected after surgery (and, thus, not considered weight recurrence). Ultimately, this study adds to the body of literature demonstrating the importance for a universally accepted definition of weight recurrence that will allow for more consistent research to help identify and modify predictors for weight recurrence as is the goal of the ASMBS POWER task force.

Limitations

There were several limitations to this study including its retrospective nature. Our cohort saw a moderate attrition rate of long-term follow up. This is a common challenge faced by longitudinal studies. In a systematic review of 7173 studies on bariatric outcomes, less than 3% had 80% follow up rates. Studies show progressively poorer follow up rates with time, as low as 30% at 2 years, and < 10% follow up at 10 years. To address the attrition rate, we augmented our sample size by including non-bariatric visit weights. This increased our cohort size to 376 patients (64.5% of the population) with ≥ 3 years of postoperative weight. Moreover, follow up was similar for HT and LT groups at all times, thereby minimizing further confounders. Also, the lack of a standardized definition blurs the lines between expected weight regain and clinically significant weight recurrence. We tried to mitigate this by using previously reported criteria. Nonetheless, weight recurrence has significant long-term clinical implications and without an established definition, potential risk factors may go unrecognized. The ASMBS POWER task force will ideally reconcile this issue with universally accepted definitions.

In addition, the Distressed Communities Index analyzes communities and has information on communities nationwide, however, this study was done using patients from a single institution in Northern California. While the patient population includes rural, suburban, and urban patients, this study cannot be generalized to all cities or countries as the effects of community economic well-being may differ in different regions. A multi-institutional study using longitudinal data including long-term follow-up and repeated weight measurements would allow for more generalizable results. Lastly, this study combines outcomes from both Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy which can lead to different weight outcomes as mentioned in the discussion section above. Future studies could isolate single procedures and compare community well-being effects specific to that procedure.

### Long-term outcomes after bariatric surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis of weight loss at 10 or more years for all bariatric procedures and a single-centre review of 20-year outcomes after adjustable gastric banding [^115n1CU6]. Obesity Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Systematic Review of the Literature

The present report is a synthesis of two systematic reviews. The first search was of the medical literature up to November 2011 and has been published. For the present report, the literature search was extended to December 31, 2017. The pooled data are reported according to the latest Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.

Search Strategy

Articles were identified using the Cochrane Database, Embase, Medline Complete, PubMed, and Scopus electronic databases with the last electronic search conducted on December 31, 2017. Only published full reports were included. Search terms were developed across concepts of "bariatric surgery" 'AND' "longitudinal/long term/10 year". In addition, reference lists of included articles were examined, as were three relevant systematic reviews. Hand searching of Obesity Surgery and Surgery for Obesity and Related Disorders was also performed.

Eligibility Criteria

Original peer-reviewed English language papers were considered for inclusion. The review considered all types of bariatric surgical procedures except for short-term temporary procedures or experimental procedures (e.g. intragastric balloon, endoscopic duodeno-jejunal bypass sleeve, intragastric stimulation). For inclusion, papers must have reported the weight loss data of at least 10 patients at ≥ 10 years after the initial surgery and expressed the weight outcome as percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) or percentage of BMI lost (%BMIL) or had provided sufficient information to allow these values to be calculated. Although there has been a recent drive to express weight loss as % total weight loss, almost no data were available in this format. For eligible papers, the data at the final time point that met the inclusion criteria pertaining to participant numbers and weight outcome measurement are reported. We also sought to extract from eligible papers data on operation type, number of patients originally treated and the number at longest eligible follow-up, percentage patients lost to follow up, reoperation rates and weight loss outcome at maximum follow-up. Not all these data are available within the selected papers.

One reviewer conducted title and abstract screening with 10% cross-checked by a second reviewer. Both reviewers examined articles identified for full-text review and disagreements concerning inclusion were resolved by joint review. Figure 1 displays the PRISMA search process for the current review with the original review studies added.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the perioperative nutrition, metabolic, and nonsurgical support of patients undergoing bariatric procedures-2019 update: cosponsored by American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology, the obesity society, American society for metabolic&bariatric surgery, Obesity Medicine Association, and American society of anesthesiologists- [^116RJuvJ]. Endocrine Practice (2019). High credibility.

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) — long-term outcomes — continue to show sustained long-term weight-loss results with improvement and resolution of obesity-related conditions, and both procedures were validated as durable surgeries with significant improvement in patient-reported outcomes based on quality-of-life scores.

### Reoperative surgery for nonresponders and complicated sleeve gastrectomy operations in patients with severe obesity. An international expert panel consensus statement to define best practice guidelines [^116AdMGc]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has rapidly become the most commonly performed bariatric procedure in the United States as well as other countries, with approximately 120,000 procedures being performed annually in the United States. Reoperative interventions after SG have become more prevalent in the past few years since the initial development of SG as a primary operation. Given the expected rapid growth of these reinterventions, an expert consensus conference was held with some of the most experienced bariatric surgeons in the world to better understand, discuss, and provide consensus on the reasons, indications, contraindications, and surgical options for nonresponders and complicated SG operations.

Objectives

Provide consensus-based best practice guidelines regarding the performance of reinterventions after failed or complicated SG in patients with obesity, using expert opinion by organizing a consensus meeting of experts and evaluating the current literature.

Setting

The meeting was held in Boca Raton, Florida on February 18, 2017.

Methods

The panel of 32 expert bariatric surgeons representing 12 countries and major regions of the world and all 6 populated continents identified 54 questions for consensus. Questions encompassed patient selection, indications, contraindications, surgical technique, prevention and management of weight regain, and short- and long-term complications after SG. Responses were calculated and defined as achieving consensus (≥ 70% agreement) or no consensus (< 70% agreement). The current available literature was extensively reviewed for each topic in question and proposed to the panel.

Results

Full consensus was obtained for the essential aspects of indications and contraindications, surgical technique, management, and prevention of complications. Consensus was achieved for 35 of 54 key questions. Highlights include consensus recommendations regarding technique in reoperation, management of GERD and Barrett's esophagus after SG, and surgical options for poor initial weight loss. No consensus was reached on topics, such as management of chronic proximal fistula after SG.

Conclusions

This first international expert meeting provides 35 statements and recommendations for a clinical consensus guideline regarding standardization of indications, contraindications, surgical options, and surgical techniques when reoperating on patients who underwent a failed or complicated SG. To our knowledge, the present consensus report represents the first document that defines best practice guidelines for the performance of reinterventions after failed or complicated SG.

### Synopsis of the 2020 U.S. VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of adult overweight and obesity [^112Jo41a]. Military Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) — procedure details and comparative weight loss: Since the publication of the 2014 VA/DoD Obesity CPG, SG has emerged as the most commonly done operation for obesity. The procedure involves removing 75–80% of the greater curvature of the stomach, with resection starting approximately 5–6 cm proximal to the pylorus and it is usually fashioned over a 36 French bougie. Several studies demonstrate that SG and RYGB provide more comparable weight loss than seen after adjustable gastric bands or nonsurgical interventions with no reliable conclusion regarding which operation results in the greatest weight loss; in a randomized trial, SG and RYGB led to similar weight loss at one year, but RYGB was found to be superior at five years.

### Early postoperative weight loss predicts maximal weight loss after sleeve gastrectomy and roux-en-Y gastric bypass [^1168wbPw]. Surgical Endoscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies show that 'poor responders' to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) may be identified on the basis of early postoperative weight loss. Early identification of poor responders could allow earlier provision of postoperative behavioural and/or intensive lifestyle interventions and enhance their maximal weight loss. Our aim was to investigate whether early postoperative weight loss predicts the maximal weight loss response after RYGBP and sleeve gastrectomy (SG).

Methods

We undertook a retrospective cross-sectional study of 1,456 adults who underwent either RYGBP (n = 918) or SG (n = 538) as a primary procedure in one of two European centres. Postoperative weight loss was expressed as weight loss velocity (WLV) and percentage weight loss. Linear regression analyses were performed to determine the association of early postoperative weight loss with maximal %WL, including adjustment for baseline variables.

Results

There was marked variability in maximal %WL following both RYGBP (mean 32.9%, range 4.1–60.9%) and SG (mean 26.2%, range 1.1–58.3%). WLV 3–6 months postoperatively was more strongly associated with maximal %WL (r² = 0.32 for RYGBP and r² = 0.26 for SG, P < 0.001 for both) than either WLV 0–6 weeks or 6 weeks to 3 months postoperatively (r² = 0.14 and 0.10 for RYGBP, respectively; r² = 0.18 and 0.21 for SG, respectively; P < 0.001 for all). Multiple linear regression analysis, including baseline variables of age, sex, preoperative BMI, type 2 diabetes, ethnicity, and bariatric centre, revealed that 3–6 month WLV was an independent predictor of maximal %WL in both SG and RYGBP groups (standardised β -coefficients 0.51 and 0.52, respectively; P < 0.001 for both).

Conclusions

There is a marked variability in weight loss response following RYGBP and SG. Early postoperative weight loss can be used to identify patients whose predicted weight loss trajectories are suboptimal. Early targeting of poor responders with more intensive postoperative lifestyle and behavioural support could potentially enhance their weight loss response.

### Women's reasons to seek bariatric surgery and their expectations on the surgery outcome-a multicenter study from five European countries [^114gujyq]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

In conventional treatment of obesity, higher expected weight loss has been associated with improved weight loss. Similar results have been shown during the first year after bariatric surgery. Nevertheless, weight loss expectations pre-surgery does not seem to predict weight loss post-surgery, but may affect other types of outcomes. For example, a prospective study following up on items of satisfaction 1 year after bariatric surgery showed that while weight loss was the most reported reason to seek surgery, the most reported item of satisfaction was improved self-esteem. Pre-operative expectations on psychosocial outcomes, for example physical functioning and social appearance, were, however, not related to weight loss in patients after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding.

To provide the best clinical practice and reduce the risk of unrealistic expectation on bariatric surgery outcomes, it is important to understand patients' reasons for having surgery as well as their expectation on outcomes. Improved co-morbidities and physical health are often reported as important reasons for choosing to undergo bariatric surgery, both in quantitative and qualitative research. It is also common that patients expect the resulting weight loss to impact psychosocial factors, such as personal identity and relationships. While some have shown women to expect more positive effects on both social and physical attributes than men, others have found reasons and expectations to be similar between the sexes. Studies on reasons and expectations of patients in different countries are available, but direct comparisons between countries have, to the best of our knowledge, not been made. Potential differences between countries may exist due to external factors, such as culture, or different referral pathways and pre-operative information. To better understand the international literature in order to best tailor information directed at patients planning to undergo bariatric surgery, we must be aware if such differences exist.

In this international multicenter study, we aimed to investigate the reasons for seeking bariatric surgery and patients' expectations of surgical outcomes among women in Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands.

### Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or one-anastomosis gastric bypass? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials [^114ST92Q]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The study was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Supporting Information Table S1 [PRISMA checklist]). MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched on April 30, 2020, and May 10, 2020, for RCTs comparing, respectively, RYGB with either SG or OAGB (Supporting Information Table S2). Additional studies were identified through Google search and manual search of the reference lists of existing systematic reviews in the field. To be included, studies had to be an RCT, written in French or English, and comparing RYGB with either SG and/or OAGB. Abstracts of RCTs with preliminary results reporting weight loss or number of patients with resolution of comorbidities were also included in the case of OAGB (owing to the paucity of the literature in the field). Systematic reviews, meta‐analyses, observational studies, protocols, and letters to the editor were excluded after title and abstract screening. RCTs reporting duplicate patients; those comparing SG or OAGB with another bariatric procedure other than RYGB; and those not reporting excess weight loss (EWL, percentage), excess BMI loss (EBMIL, percentage), or total weight loss (TWL percentage) were excluded. RCTs not reporting enough weight‐outcome data for meta‐analysis (such as not reporting SEM or SD or not reporting exact values) were also excluded. Of note, authors of publications potentially eligible for inclusion were contacted to provide missing values. Two independent reviewers (IU, JM) carried out the systematic review. Discrepancies were solved by a third author (JD).

Risk of bias assessment

Studies were ranked using the modified Cochrane Collaboration tool and classified as low risk, unclear risk, or high risk.

### Early postoperative weight loss predicts weight loss up to 5 years after roux-En-Y gastric bypass, banded roux-En-Y gastric bypass, and sleeve gastrectomy [^111uu84V]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Our finding that patients in the Low %TWL quartile group had a higher age and BMI kg/m² at baseline, and were more likely to be male (in the SG group), and to suffer from comorbidities, confirms previous research. This group may have received bariatric surgery too late. If these patients had received bariatric surgery when they were eligible, they might have been less prone to preoperative weight gain and obesity-related comorbidities. Further research is needed to explore why some patients do not receive bariatric surgery when they are eligible. Previous research suggests reasons that could play a role. For example, despite the effectiveness of bariatric surgery, the majority of eligible patients are not interested in surgery due to the perceived risk. Furthermore, physicians' concerns about complications following bariatric surgery may result in low referral rates to bariatric surgery. In some countries, waiting lists could also be a factor (e.g. USA 159 days, Spain 397 days, and Canada up to 5 years, versus 30 days for the population of this study). Finally, some people with severe obesity may not be aware of the option of bariatric surgery. Further research is also needed to examine how to reach people that qualify for bariatric surgery, so they can consider treatment at an earlier stage, preventing unnecessary weight gain and obesity-related comorbidities.

Based on our finding that the lowest TWL-quartile at 3 months is associated with lower weight loss trajectories up to 5 years after surgery, patients in the lowest TWL-quartile at 3 months after surgery could be selected for additional postoperative interventions to optimize their weight loss. This patient group may particularly benefit from improvement in weight loss, as patients in the Low %TWL quartile group had a higher baseline BMI kg/m 2 and were more likely to suffer from diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and osteoarthritis. A great benefit of short-term weight loss as predictor is that weight assessments are quick and easily accessible. Further research is needed into why some patients have lower early weight loss to determine which interventions most effectively increase weight loss and reduce comorbidities. Behavioral lifestyle interventions in the first months after bariatric surgery focusing on physical activity and eating behavior have shown to improve weight loss after bariatric surgery. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that biological interventions may enhance weight loss in some patients. For example, gut hormones are regulators of energy homeostasis and drivers for eating behavior and have shown to be important mediators for weight loss after RYGB and SG surgery. Pharmacotherapeutic strategies that target these gut hormones are therefore a new promising approach to addressing low early weight loss after bariatric surgery.

Network meta‐analysis of TWL (percentage) between RYGB, SG, and OAGB

TWL (percentage) was not reported by RCTs comparing weight‐loss outcomes between RYGB and OAGB, which prevented any network meta‐analysis.

EWL

EWL (percentage) between RYGB and SG

Eleven RCTs compared EWL (percentage) between RYGB and SG. Two studies did not document SD and could not be pooled in the meta‐analysis. After bariatric surgery procedure, EWL (percentage) was similar between RYGB and SG at 1 month (4 studies, 254 patients, MD: 3.30, 95% CI: −0.80 to 7.40, I 2: 33%, p = 0.12; Table 1, Figure 2A), 3 months (2 studies, 262 patients, MD: 0.89, 95% CI: −3.51 to 5.29, I 2: 60%, p = 0.69; Table 1, Figure 2B), 6 months (4 studies, 380 patients, MD: 0.11, 95% CI: −5.52 to 5.73, I 2: 71%, p = 0.97; Table 1, Figure 2C), 1 year (6 studies, 440 patients, MD: 1.77, 95% CI: −5.11 to 8.64, I 2: 72%, p = 0.61; Table 1, Figure 2D), and 2 years (3 studies, 250 patients, MD: 5.06, 95% CI: −7.27 to 17.38, I 2: 76%, p = 0.42; Table 1, Figure 2E). However, EWL (percentage) was greater in patients who underwent RYGB than SG at 3 years (3 studies, 170 patients, MD: 11.93, 95% CI: 6.90 to 16.95, I 2: 0%, p < 0.00001; Table 1, Figure 2F) and at 5 years (3 studies, 156 patients, MD: 13.11, 95% CI: 5.83 to 20.39, I 2: 0%, p = 0.0004) (Table 1, Figure 2G) after surgery. Detailed EWL (percentage) per study and per time point are reported in Supporting Information Table S8.

### Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or one-anastomosis gastric bypass? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials [^113FqLKf]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Several systematic reviews and meta‐analyses of RCTs have recently compared bariatric surgery interventions in terms of weight loss and/or resolution of obesity‐related comorbidities. However, an updated meta‐analysis reporting all weight‐outcome measures as recommended by the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS), including OAGB in its pooled analysis, was lacking. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis of RCTs comparing RYGB with either SG or OAGB in order to determine which one of the surgical procedures is the most appropriate in terms of weight loss and remission of type 2 diabetes.

Briefly, we pooled 20 RCTs comparing RYGB and SG and found no statistical difference in terms of EWL (percentage) between SG and RYGB at 3 and 6 months and at 1 and 2 years after bariatric surgery. However, a statistical difference emerged in favor of RYGB 3 years after the surgical procedure. Indeed, EWL (percentage) was greater after RYGB than after SG by 11.93 percentage units and by 13.11 percentage units at 3 and 5 years, respectively. Therefore, it appears that RYGB tends to provide greater weight loss than SG on longer follow‐ups when considering EWL (percentage). In a systematic review and meta‐analysis including RCTs and observational studies, Gu et al. also showed that EWL (percentage) was greater after RYGB at 3 years compared with SG (MD: −4.37, 95% CI: −8.10 to −0.64). This finding was confirmed when performing subgroup analysis pooling only RCTs. However, this difference was not statistically significant at 5 years. When analyzing TWL (percentage), RYGB showed a better weight loss at 3 months (MD: 2.41, p = 0.02), 6 months (MD: 3.83, p < 0.00001), 1 year (MD: 6.35, p < 0.00001), and 5 years (MD: 3.90, p = 0.005). In a systematic review and meta‐analysis including both RCTs and observational studies, Guraya et al. also observed a higher TWL (percentage) after RYGB than SG at 1 year (MD: 6.47, 95% CI: 1.22 to 11.72, z statistics = 2.42, p < 0.05), 3 years (MD: −0.23, 95% CI: 0.39 to 0.06, z statistics = 2.65, p < 0.05), and 5 years (MD: 1.87, 95% CI: 0.27 to 3.48, z statistics = 2.28, p < 0.05 respectively). If we compare weight loss in terms of BMI change, a recent meta‐analysis of RCTs by Lee et al. concluded that patients who benefit from RYGB had significant higher decrease in BMI than those with SG at 1 year (16 studies, 1,673 patients, 95% CI −2.01 to −0.49, I² = 88%, p < 0.001), 3 years (5 studies, 595 patients, 95% CI −2.68 to −0.74, I² = 47%, p < 0.001), and 5 years (3 studies, 353 patients, 95% CI −2.36 to −2.04, I² = 0%, p < 0.001). In our analysis, we did not find any difference in EBMIL in the midterm. A recent published article by Wölnerhanssen et al. combining outcome values of the finished SLEEVEPASS and Swiss SM‐BOSS trials notably found higher EBMIL (percentage) in the RYGB group compared with the SG group, with a mean estimate of EBMIL (percentage) of 7 (95% CI: 3.5 to 10.5, p < 0.001). To note, exact values of the SLEEVEPASS trial were not in our possession when writing the manuscript. Nevertheless, these findings confirm the better efficiency of RYGB in obtaining weight loss when compared with SG.

### Early postoperative weight loss predicts weight loss up to 5 years after roux-En-Y gastric bypass, banded roux-En-Y gastric bypass, and sleeve gastrectomy [^111pzAeD]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Positive aspects of this study are the multicenter aspect and substantial sample size, resulting in large statistical power. Furthermore, all measurements (e.g. weight, comorbidities, and other data) were assessed at the clinics by health care professionals and were therefore more reliable than self-reported measurements by people that suffer from obesity. Finally, this study examined associations for different surgery types, which enables readers to distinguish predictive models for RYGB, SG, and BRYGB. A limitation of this study is that patient retention rates decrease with each subsequent follow-up year. It may leave patients that are lost to follow-up underexposed. Long-term follow-up in bariatric surgery is generally low in studies with large populations. However, a comparison within this study population between patients who did and who did not have a weight measurement at 5 years after surgery showed that these groups have similar baseline characteristics. Therefore, interpretation of %TWL figures is increasingly limited with each subsequent follow-up year. Furthermore, other outcomes than weight loss, such as predicted reduction of comorbidities, may also have additional value for intervention selection. The current study used %TWL quartiles to distinguish different groups of patients. Results show that even patients in the Low %TWL quartile group lost weight at 5-year follow-up (RYGB 24.2%TWL, SG 21.1%TWL, and BRYGB 25.9%TWL), which may still be sufficient to reduce metabolic diseases. Further research is needed to determine optimal early postoperative %TWL levels that can be used to select patients for interventions aiming to reduce metabolic diseases through weight loss.

### What is my goal? Expected weight loss and comorbidity outcomes among bariatric surgery patients [^113WeKn1]. Obesity Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

A number of reasons lead patients to choose to undergo weight loss procedures. Previous studies have demonstrated that patients have unrealistic weight loss goals. However, there is a general paucity of information on a patient's expectations in regards to comorbidity improvement and resolution. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact a patient's comorbid conditions have on the motivation to proceed with bariatric surgery. Furthermore, we examined the patient's expectations regarding postoperative weight loss and comorbidity improvement.

Methods

Forty-five subjects completed a modified Goals and Relative Weights Questionnaire assessment 1 week prior to their anticipated bariatric surgery. The first portion addressed a patient's personal weight loss goals and factors that influence their procedure selection. The second part assessed the expectations and evaluations of a variety of specifically determined weight loss outcomes.

Results

A total of 45 patients completed the survey (laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) 23/45; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RNYGB) 22/45). The mean goal percentage of excess weight loss was 85.0% (21–130%). This translated to 80.2% (21–127%) in the LAGB group and 90.5% (37–130%) in the RNYGB group. Of 13 possible reasons, "a desire for change in medical comorbidities" was deemed as most important in choosing a goal weight. Comorbidities with the highest dissatisfaction level included urinary incontinence and hypertension. All patients expected some degree of comorbidity improvement at 1 year postsurgery, with 26% (6/23) expecting a resolution of their diabetes, 36% (10/28) expecting a resolution of hypertension, and 40% (10/25) expecting a resolution of obstructive sleep apnea.

Conclusion

A dissatisfaction with obesity-related comorbidities, most notably hypertension and urinary incontinence, was a motivating factor in choosing to undergo bariatric surgery. Patients expected improvement in their comorbid illnesses; however, they still possessed unrealistic weight loss expectations for their intended weight loss procedure.

### Incidence of adverse mental health outcomes after sleeve gastrectomy compared with gastric bypass and restrictive bariatric procedures: a retrospective cohort study [^115P3sHs]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Our finding of an increase in hospital admissions with substance‐use disorder after all surgery types, with a higher risk for gastric bypass compared with sleeve gastrectomy and restrictive procedures, is consistent with some previous studies, whereas others have found comparably high risks after sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass. Owing to the different outcomes and analysis methods, direct comparisons among the previous and current studies are not possible. Nonetheless, their notable similarity is the finding of a higher risk of adverse mental health outcomes after sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass compared with preoperatively or after restrictive bariatric procedures. A recent matched cohort study also reported a higher risk of substance‐use disorder and self‐harm in patients with class 1 obesity who underwent sleeve gastrectomy compared with an intensive lifestyle intervention. Although overall quality of life and symptoms of depression usually improve after bariatric surgery, together these results provide a consistent indication of an increased risk of certain adverse psychiatric outcomes associated with sleeve gastrectomy, as well as gastric bypass.

Changes in mental health after bariatric surgery are not surprising. Commonly reported overall improvements in symptoms of depression and psychological wellbeing may reflect improvements in complications of obesity, health‐related quality of life, and the experience of obesity‐related stigma after weight loss. Conversely, the high prevalence of depression, anxiety, and history of trauma in bariatric surgery candidates compared with the general population, unmet expectations of a transformative effect of weight loss on quality of life, changes in interpersonal relationships, the impact of body dissatisfaction and excess skin after substantial weight loss, and complications of surgery could contribute to adverse psychological health after surgery. However, these factors do not explain differences in psychiatric outcomes among procedures.

The patient cohorts undergoing each procedure may be distinct in their vulnerability to the impact of weight loss on psychological wellbeing because the choice of operation is primarily determined by patient characteristics as they relate to risks and benefits, as well as personal preferences of patients and surgeons. Numerous differences have been noted among gastric bypass patients and those undergoing sleeve gastrectomy or gastric banding, with respect to preoperative sociodemographic, psychological and behavioral characteristics, medical comorbidities, postoperative eating behaviors, relationship with food, and satisfaction with surgical outcomes, despite similarities in age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) 1.

### IFSO consensus on definitions and clinical practice guidelines for obesity management-an international Delphi study [^1119U9QW]. Obesity Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2) is anticipated to rise from 14% in 2020 to 24% over the next 15 years and hence predicted to affect nearly 2 billion adults, children, and adolescents by 2035. The rapid rise of obesity in children and adolescents is especially concerning, since obesity in adolescence typically persists into adulthood and predisposes individuals to numerous complications. Most notable obesity-associated comorbidities and complications include type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), increased risks of various cancers and mortality, reduced quality of life (QOL), and increased risk of death.

Obesity is a highly heterogeneous and progressive multifactorial disease. Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is the most effective treatment for severe obesity, generating substantial, sustained weight reduction, along with improvements in comorbidities and quality of life, and increased life expectancy. Although MBS is the most effective anti-obesity intervention, there are large variations in treatment response after MBS, mainly due to the heterogeneity of the disease. New anti-obesity medications (AOMs) and endoscopic bariatric procedures are extremely welcome additions to the treatment of obesity linked to promising weight loss and favorable associated metabolic changes, in selected patients. With the increased availability of potent AOMs now and in the near future, the practice of combination therapy will grow as MBS and AOMs can work in synergy on the treatment of severe obesity and hopefully in enabling increased access to effective obesity treatments.

In addition to the two most common surgical procedures — sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) — there are numerous other MBS procedures and considerable variation between practices and regions. Variations in reported MBS outcomes (e.g. lack of uniform standardized reporting definitions) are evident in the MBS literature and markedly limit the comparability of different studies, creating a major hindrance to evidence-based clinical obesity treatment algorithms. In 2015, the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) published reporting standards in MBS aiming to enhance the quality and comparability of MBS results. However, only four studies published from 2015 to 2020 have used the recommended ASMBS reporting standards, resulting in low compliance and implementation of such standards in clinical practice. This highlights the importance of having valid, simple-to-use definitions for both clinical practice and research that are acceptable and applicable to the surgical and medical communities.

### American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery review of body composition [^115KVZiH]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2025). High credibility.

RYGB versus sleeve gastrectomy (SG) — short- and long-term comparisons of body composition: In a randomized subset assessed by DXA before surgery and again after 17 months, patients experienced a ~30% reduction in BMI and a ~35% reduction in fat mass without a significant difference observed between SG and RYGB, and the distribution of fat loss did not differ. Long-term, after 5 years in 72 SG and 70 RYGB patients at the same center, total body percent weight loss was 26% after RYGB and 24% after SG, P = 0.243; fat mass decreased from 49–35 kg after RYGB and from 51–39 kg after SG; and lean mass decreased from 63–45 kg after RYGB and 62–48 kg after SG, with no statistically significant difference between procedures at 5 years.

### Weight recurrence after sleeve gastrectomy versus roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a propensity score matched nationwide analysis [^116TaZq9]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Bariatric surgery is effective in achieving sustained weight loss, comorbidity reduction, and improved quality of life for patients with morbid obesity–. However, some patients will experience weight recurrence after initially achieving adequate weight loss following bariatric surgery–.

Weight recurrence is known to be associated with poor clinical outcomes such as comorbidity deterioration and worsened quality of life. Although the definition of weight recurrence is still up for debate, with arbitrary thresholds showing a wide variety of results, patients with significant weight recurrence are potential candidates for revision surgery which makes it important to identify such high-risk patients. Weight recurrence is multifactorial and associated with lifestyle, hormonal, genetic, metabolic factors, and the type of bariatric procedure. Literature has shown that around 25% of patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) will show inadequate weight loss (non-response) or weight recurrence in the long term. A recent retrospective study showed that patients undergoing Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) more often have weight recurrence than patients undergoing RYGB. However, this recent study did not adjust for confounding by indication, even though there may be underlying factors why some patients receive SG or RYGB, which makes it prone to bias as it does not enable fair comparison by balancing out the measured confounders on average between treatment groups. In addition, studies that compare the results of weight recurrence between RYGB and SG remain scarce in the literature, in particular among patients initially achieving adequate weight loss. More evidence is imperative for surgeons to consider the risks of weight recurrence depending on the type of primary bariatric procedure, particularly for high-risk patients.

Therefore, this nationwide study will compare patients undergoing primary RYGB or SG on the extent of weight recurrence up to 5 years of follow-up after initial adequate weight loss at 1 year and assess the associated effect on remission of comorbidities.

Results

Participants

Sixteen (n = 16) adult participants (4 men, 12 women) with weight regain after bariatric surgery participated. The mean BMI was 46, with on average a 36% weight regain from their nadir. According to most participants (n = 13), their weight regain started between 1 and 5 years (mean 2.6 years) after surgery. Some (n = 3) could not remember when weight regain started. Table 1 displays participant characteristics and Fig. 2 shows changes in BMI trajectories from time of bariatric surgery to the interview. All participants underwent gastric bypass between 2004 and 2016. Three participants had undergone previous bariatric surgeries (sleeve gastrectomy n = 1, gastric banding n = 2), but due to complications of the first procedure, gastric bypass was performed at a later stage. Participants differed regarding occupational status, marital status, and ethnicity; 31% (n = 5) originated from outside Europe.

Theme 1: Loss of Control and Focus

Most participants perceived the process of weight regain as a slow and accompanied gradual loss of control and focus. Participants were unprepared for weight regain and had expected to maintain a lower long-term weight. Participants perceived weight regain as stressful, shameful, and frustrating. They expressed hopelessness and discouragement. Meanwhile, support from healthcare professionals and family members was perceived as scarce.

### Comparability of weight loss reporting after gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy using BOLD data 2008–2011 [^114jwxcG]. Obesity Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Weight loss after bariatric surgery is commonly reported as either a percentage of initial body weight (%IBW) or 100% minus %IBW which is a percentage of total weight loss (%TWL). These are basically equivalent expressions. Weight loss is also reported as %EWL or as a percentage of excess body mass index loss (%EBMIL). These last two expressions incorporate the concepts of ideal body weight and BMI = 25 as reference points. More straightforward but less commonly used is absolute weight loss. This study compares these various measures using the Bariatric Outcomes Longitudinal Database (BOLD).

Methods

BOLD data, 2008–2011, was accessed for outcomes on 239,659 gastric bypass (GB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) patients with approval of the Surgical Review Corporation. The outcome data was converted into %TWL, %EWL, and %EBMIL. %EBMIL was varied by changing the reference BMI from 1 to 25 kg/m(2). The post operation data was analyzed for both procedures. Variation coefficients (VC) were compared using different measurements on the same data pool. We assumed that the lesser the variation, the more reliable the measure is, and therefore, we made use of the VC to compare the different reporting methods.

Results

There were 164,247 patients who remained after removal of errors and missing data. Demographics are as follows: 78.1% female, 73.1% white, 12.5% black, 8.71% Hispanic, 81.6% GB, 18.4% SG, mean age of 44.8 years, height of 167.0 cm, weight of 132.0 kg, and BMI of 47.1 kg/m(2). GB patients had 26.8%TWL at 6 months (VC = 21.5) and 34.2%TWL at 12 months (VC = 27.0). %EWL was 54.7 at 6 months (VC = 27.3) and 69.4 at 12 months (VC = 30.9). Varying the reference BMI for %EBMIL showed the lowest VC to be 0–2 kg/m(2) for GB up to 12 months post operation. SG patients had 24.0%TWL at 6 months (VC = 25.4) and 29.5 at 12 months (VC = 30.5). %EWL was 50.0% at 6 months (VC = 31.4) and 60.2% at 12 months (VC = 34.5). Varying the reference BMI for %EBMIL showed that the lowest VC occurred when the reference weight was chosen as 0 kg/m(2) for both GB and SG. %TWL or, equivalently, %IBW had the lowest variation coefficient and therefore is the more accurate measure of weight loss following bariatric surgery.

Conclusions

For ease and accuracy of comparison, the percentage of initial body weight or percentage of total weight loss should be used for the expression of weight loss after surgery.

### Sleeve gastrectomy outcomes in patients with BMI between 30 and 35–3 years of follow-up [^111pY8in]. Obesity Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m 2, is a chronic, serious, and costly disease. It is associated with an increased risk of several comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and some types of cancer. Obesity's rate in the world has nearly doubled since 1980s especially in developing countries. The World Health Organization declared obesity as an epidemic disease affecting more than 500 million adults worldwide. Also, the percentage of children with obesity is increasing rapidly especially in low- and middle-income countries, reaching 40 million in 2012.

Class I obesity is the beginning of health deterioration and organ failure as result of progressive fat accumulation. Surgery in mildly obese patients not only seeks to improve esthetic appearance, certainly of great importance because of the psychological and social impact of obesity on people who suffers from it, but also is a way to prevent progression of the long list of comorbidities.

Different international guidelines suggest that candidates to bariatric and metabolic surgery are only those patients with BMI over 40 (morbid obesity), BMI over 35 (severe obesity), and, at least, two obesity-related comorbidities and inability to achieve a healthy weight loss sustained for at least a year with prior weight loss efforts.

Moreover, it has been shown that bariatric surgery is safe and effective in patients with BMI between 30 and 35 kg/m², and international associations currently support this indication.

According to Chilean "Comprehensive obesity treatment program", in order to indicate surgery, a multidisciplinary team must evaluate BMI (≥ 35 with comorbidities or ≥ 40), comorbidities, food habits, age, patient expectations, adherence to the program, support network, and absence of contraindications. However, exceptions to these indication criteria could be done if the patient's case is discussed and bariatric surgery is approved and supported by the committee.

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a restrictive procedure where about 80% of the stomach are removed, producing an extra hormonal regulation that helps patients to improve their eating habits without significant anatomical-functional modification.

The aim of this study is to describe medium-term outcomes in patients with BMI between 30 and 35 kg/m 2 submitted to LSG in terms of weight loss and comorbidity improvements over 3 years of postoperative follow-up.

### Early postoperative weight loss predicts maximal weight loss after sleeve gastrectomy and roux-en-Y gastric bypass [^111Qmig1]. Surgical Endoscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Association of early postoperative WLV with maximal and 2-year %WL

Next, we examined the relative importance of weight loss during specific time intervals in the early postoperative period in relation to the maximal %WL achieved. In order to determine this, WLV during the 0–6 weeks, 6 weeks to 3 months, and 3–6 months postoperative time periods was used in linear regression analyses. We observed procedure-specific temporal differences in the strength of association between postoperative WLV and maximal %WL (Fig. 4). In the SG group, WLV during the 0–6 weeks and 6 weeks to 3 months postoperative periods predicted 18 and 21% of the variability in maximal %WL respectively, increasing to 26% for the 3–6 month period (Table 3). Whereas in the RYGBP group, WLV during the 0–6 week period and 6 weeks to 3 months period accounted for only 12 and 10% of the variability in maximal %WL, respectively, increasing markedly to 32% for the 3–6 month period (Table 3). Early postoperative WLV associations with 2-year %WL were comparable with those for maximal %WL (Table 4).

### Improvement of health-related quality of life after roux-en-Y gastric bypass related to weight loss [^1171PvFT]. Obesity Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with a higher weight loss had a better HRQOL; total scores of RAND-36 and IWQOL-lite were all significantly positively associated with %TWL. The effect of weight loss on HRQOL has been evaluated in several studies with various questionnaires; however, the expected outcome had not been as clear as in our study. In addition, TWL was 31.1% at 24 months in our population, which might explain the greater association of weight loss and HRQOL. Other studies had much smaller populations and generally used percentage excess weight loss as a weight loss parameter. The higher number of patients in our study and the use of %TWL might have influenced the results.

Our results show that the variation in effect of bariatric surgery on HRQOL which was described recently can at least in part be explained by the diversity in questionnaires used to assess HRQOL. Change in HRQOL was the highest in the IWQOL-lite scales, ranging from 23 to 47%. For RAND-36, mean change ranged from 5 to 57%. The correlations between %TWL and ΔHRQOL were also the highest in the IWQOL-lite scales at 15 and 24 months follow-up. And RAND-36 MHS was not significantly associated with ΔHRQOL at 15 months. To avoid influence of baseline HRQOL on outcome, we calculated a ΔHRQOL.

In our study population maximum weight loss was achieved at an average of 15 months; therefore, we chose to use 15 and 24 months to evaluate HRQOL. The large sample size enabled us to identify even small effects of weight loss on HRQOL. In previous research, there was deterioration in HRQOL seen, which was explained by weight regain. However, due to the strict follow-up protocol, our study population had undergone no weight regain (yet); weight was still declining or remained stable in all patients at 24 months. Looking at previous research, it is very interesting to further investigate HRQOL and identify other factors which could influence the stabilization of HRQOL.

Only RYGB patients were included in this analysis to ensure accurate data analysis without the bias of difference in weight loss. Because of the increase in the number of patients receiving other types of surgery, such as gastric sleeve, future research should focus on the effect of gastric sleeve surgery on HRQOL.

### Weight regain and insufficient weight loss after bariatric surgery: definitions, prevalence, mechanisms, predictors, prevention and management strategies, and knowledge gaps-a scoping review [^112mLAcu]. Obesity Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Definition/s of WR and IWL after BS

In order to answer the first research question, there is a need to have a clear differentiation between two types of weight loss failure: IWL and WR. Insufficient weight loss is defined as excess weight loss percentage (EWL%) of < 50% 18 months post-BS. WR is defined as progressive weight regain that occurs after achievement of an initial successful weight loss (defined as EWL > 50%). The existing inconsistency, multiplicity, and lack of a standardized definition of WR (Table 1) lead to poor reporting and understanding of the clinical significance of WR. For example, the use of 5 continuous and 8 dichotomous measures among 1406 patients reported WR rates that ranged between 44 and 87% five years post Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) [8]. Moreover, the percentage of maximum weight lost had the strongest association with the progression of T2D and hypertension, reduced quality of life, and reduced satisfaction with surgery. Others observed a 16–37% WR five years after BS, where the three WR definitions examined were found to be associated with deterioration in quality of life; however, no associations were found with other comorbidities. Therefore, more research is required to assess the extent of clinically significant WR that would indicate when an intervention is required and guide the type of intervention. As for IWL, despite its distinct definition, it has been much less assessed, being only informally referred to in association with WR.

### Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or one-anastomosis gastric bypass? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials [^112dbHrw]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

Nevertheless, the past decades have seen the emergence of alternative and promising techniques. For instance, SG, proposed by Gagner in 1998, has rapidly gained in popularity. Its technical simplicity, the lower incidence of surgical complications, and the fact that the procedure can later be converted to RYGB in case of insufficient weight loss ensures its attractiveness. Second, OAGB, developed by Rutledge in 1997, consists of the creation of a gastric pouch with a single gastro‐jejunal latero‐lateral anastomosis. It is considered as efficient as RYGB, easier to perform, and less likely to cause morbidity and mortality. However, numerous authors have suggested that this technique is responsible for more bile reflux and, owing to the lack of available high‐quality evidence as of yet, this procedure is not yet widely accepted.

Weight‐loss performance is one of the key decisional factors in the choice of the primary surgical procedure, although several other variables must be considered, such as the risk of complications, metabolic comorbidities, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta‐analysis to summarize the most recent randomized‐controlled trials (RCTs) comparing RYGB with OAGB and SG in terms of weight‐loss outcomes and remission of type 2 diabetes, which constitute the main outcomes of interest for decision‐making when choosing a surgical procedure.

### Weight regain following sleeve gastrectomy-a systematic review [^1159ftTa]. Obesity Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is a commonly performed bariatric procedure. Weight regain following SG is a significant issue. Yet the defining, reporting and understanding of this phenomenon remains largely neglected. Systematic review was performed to locate articles reporting the definition, rate and/or cause of weight regain in patients at least 2 years post-SG. A range of definitions employed to describe weight regain were identified in the literature. Rates of regain ranged from 5.7% at 2 years to 75.6% at 6 years. Proposed causes of weight regain included initial sleeve size, sleeve dilation, increased ghrelin levels, inadequate follow-up support and maladaptive lifestyle behaviours. Bariatric literature would benefit from standardising definitions used to report weight regain and its rate in clinical series. Larger prospective studies are required to further understand mechanisms of weight regain following SG.

### Physiological adaptations to weight loss and factors favouring weight regain [^114RWGFx]. International Journal of Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

Interestingly, findings from a study of 104 obese and/or overweight individuals showed that, after diet-induced weight reduction, those who regained⩾10% of the lost weight appeared to have consistently higher baseline (fasting) leptin levels and lower baseline (fasting) ghrelin levels 6 months later versus those that maintained body weight. Because leptin and ghrelin are satiety and orexigenic signals, respectively, it may be expected that individuals who regain lost weight would have lower levels of leptin and higher levels of ghrelin. However, the findings appear to be counterintuitive and suggest that weight regain is associated with a disruption in the sensitivity to these hormones.

Following gastric bypass surgery, levels of ghrelin are extremely low, while GLP-1 and PYY are elevated, which should attenuate appetite. These findings raise the possibility that the gastric bypass procedure reduces weight, at least in part, by altering the production and/or release of these mediators of appetite. Interestingly, among individuals who underwent gastric bypass, plasma ghrelin levels did not oscillate in relation to meals and were much lower than those of normal-weight controls and matched obese controls, after substantial weight loss resulting from a 6-month dietary programme. However, recent studies in rodents have indicated that weight loss following sleeve gastrectomy is not mediated by changes in ghrelin or GLP-1, or through the melanocortin (MC)-4 receptor in the hypothalamus. Instead, as shown by a knockout mouse study, the mechanism of weight loss in sleeve gastrectomy appears to involve the nuclear bile acid receptor, farnesoid X receptor. Note that the observation that gut hormones such as ghrelin and GLP-1 are not involved in the mechanism of weight loss with sleeve gastrectomy does not mean that they are not important mediators of body weight. Indeed, a rationally designed monomeric peptide has been shown to reduce body weight and diabetic complications in rodents by acting as an agonist at three metabolically related peptide hormone receptors: the GLP-1, gastric inhibitory polypeptide and glucagon receptors.

### Seven-year trajectories of body weight, quality of life and comorbidities following roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy [^112pZwH8]. International Journal of Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We compared 7-year outcomes after SG and RYGB for severe obesity under real-world conditions at two Norwegian hospitals. With high follow-up rates, the groups were balanced for important baseline characteristics with the exception of educational level. The hospital committed to RYGB performed a lower number of operations annually compared to the hospital conducting SG. With these limitations, short-term weight loss was considerable and similar after both procedures, but with a gradual weight regain from 1 to 2 years being more prominent after SG. QOL, assessed at obesity-specific, generic and overall levels, was similar in both groups at all timepoints. Long-term outcome for T2D, dyslipidemia, OSA and GERD favored RYGB, whereas early complications were less frequent after SG, but required longer in hospital stay.

At 7-year follow-up, the differences in modeled mean %TWL and %EBMIL were 3.9 and 10.1, respectively, both in favor of RYGB but with small effect-sizes. These numbers are close to the thresholds for clinically relevant differences of ± 5% TWL and ± 9% EWL defined in other studies. Similarly, 7-year results from the SLEEVEPASS study showed a statistically significant difference in %EWL of 8.7 in favor of RYGB. Two other comparable RCTs, the SM-BOSS and a smaller French study, also reported differences favoring RYGB at 5 years in terms of %EBMIL, %TWL or %EWL. A large unmatched registry study for the United States reported 6.2–8.1% higher TWL for RYGB compared to SG. Together, accepting these thresholds for equivalence, our real-world results support the conclusion that SG and RYGB yield comparable clinical benefit in terms of weight loss, tending to favor RYGB in the long term. The ongoing Swedish BEST study specifies a non-inferiority margin of 5% difference in %TWL to balance the increased complication rate after RYGB compared to SG, also in accordance with our results.

### Weight-related outcomes after revisional bariatric surgery in patients with non-response after sleeve gastrectomy-a systematic review [^115jSWCY]. Obesity Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The acknowledgement of obesity as a chronic disease in 2013 by the American Medical Association (AMA) was a key milestone in history of bariatric surgery. Revisional bariatric surgery as a second-line treatment in patients with primary or secondary non-response in terms of weight loss became increasingly shaped by the comprehension of the chronic character of obesity. It is of importance to evaluate the treatment results in detail, to identify an eventual technical failure of the primary procedure, and to consider second-line treatment.

Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has gained popularity during the last decade and relegated gastric bypass (GBP) from its status as the most frequently performed procedure for treatment of obesity and related diseases. The reasons for this development are diverse; SG is considered technically more straightforward, patients explicitly request this type of procedure, and it offers the opportunity to escalate the therapeutic effects by proceeding with a plus-operation.

With increasing numbers of procedures performed globally, reports about drawbacks of SG became more frequent. Reflux, oesophagitis, and development of Barrett mucosa are common indications for revisional surgery. Conversion from SG to GBP is a current surgical approach with seemingly robust scientific footing. Even other procedure-related complications, such as stricture or twisting of the sleeve, chronic fistulation, and intra-thoracic herniation, are rectifiable by GBP. This procedure appears to be the omnipotent remedy when it comes to resolution of sleeve-related issues. Hence, it is not surprising that GBP is even regarded to be the preferable approach to treat primary or secondary non-response as well as relapse or persistence of obesity-related comorbidity after previous SG. In addition, alternative approaches have recently been raising attention: re-sleeve gastrectomy (re-SG), conversion to one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB), duodenal switch with biliopancreatic diversion (DS), or single anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass (SADI). So far, there is a lack of evidence to support decision-making and the surgical approach is often rather based on local or individual protocols than on evidence-based guidelines.

This systematic review of the literature aimed at assessing and comparing postoperative weight-related outcomes after various bariatric surgical revisional procedures after primary sleeve gastrectomy. Based on these data, we attempted to propose a treatment strategy and identify areas for future research in this field.

### Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or one-anastomosis gastric bypass? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials [^112fXKV9]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

The second part of our meta‐analysis aimed at comparing RYGB with the emerging OAGB. To this end, we pooled five RCTs comparing OAGB with RYGB. Owing to the low number of RCTs, only EWL (percentage) could be pooled for the weight outcome. We showed that EWL (percentage) did not differ between OAGB and RYGB at 6 months. However, OAGB allowed for a statistically significant, more important EWL (percentage) after 1 year (4 RCTs, MD: −10.82, 95% CI: −18.02 to −3.62, I 2: 68%, p = 0.003). This finding was confirmed by a recent systematic review and meta‐analysis of observational and interventional studies totalizing 12,445 patients. Magouliotis et al. found greater EWL (percentage) after OAGB at 1 year (weighted MD [WMD]: −6.02, 95% CI: −8.84 to −3.20, p < 0.0001), 2 years (WMD: −7.33, 95% CI: −10.08 to −4.58, p < 0.0001), and 5 years (WMD: −12.82, 95% CI: −20.27 to −5.37, p = 0.0007). Another systematic review and meta‐analysis also documented greater EWL (percentage) after OAGB at 1 and 2 years. The network meta‐analysis also demonstrated that OAGB offers the greater weight loss compared with RYGB or SG. This finding may be explained by the longer bypass limb created in the OAGB procedure. However, this may also lead to nutritional deficiencies, and future trials comparing the two techniques should assess this outcome in longer follow‐up periods. We would like to also highlight the low number of RCTs in the field.

### Early postoperative weight loss predicts weight loss up to 5 years after roux-En-Y gastric bypass, banded roux-En-Y gastric bypass, and sleeve gastrectomy [^117QRDVZ]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for patients with severe obesity, yet approximately 20% of patients experience weight loss lower than 50% of percentage excess weight loss (%EWL), or lower than 20–25% of percentage total weight loss (%TWL) 1–2 years post-surgery. Lower weight loss may result in a continuance or recurrence of medical and psychological comorbidities, higher cancer incidence, cardiovascular events, cardiovascular deaths, and impaired health-related quality of life. It is therefore essential to predict which groups of patients suffer from lower weight loss to increase weight loss through additional pre- or postoperative interventions.

Previous research showed that predictors of lower weight loss at 5 years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery include higher preoperative BMI kg/m 2 and waist circumference, absence of laparoscopic surgery, higher age, unhealthy eating behavior, and psychological factors, such as low cognitive function, personality, and psychiatric disorders. Other previous research showed associations between early postoperative weight loss and nadir postoperative weight loss. However, these studies all had relative short- to medium-term weight loss outcomes (12 to 36 months). As obesity is a chronic disease, and as patients tend to regain weight from 2 years after surgery onwards, longer-term treatment outcomes of bariatric surgery are most meaningful. To our knowledge, only one small (n = 130) retrospective study examined the association between early postoperative weight loss and long-term weight loss (i.e. 7 years after surgery), and found no relationship. Furthermore, this study only examined weight loss after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) surgery. As weight loss variance differs between surgery types, weight loss after other types of surgery should also be examined.

The aim of this study was to explore whether patients in the lowest weight loss quartile at 3 months after RYGB, SG, or banded RYGB (BRYGB) surgery were more likely to have lower weight loss trajectories than other patients up to 5-year follow-up. In addition, differences in patient characteristics were compared between patients in the lowest weight loss quartile group at 3 months and other quartile groups.

### Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or one-anastomosis gastric bypass? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials [^114zBasS]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Obesity represents a serious medical and public health challenge and carries a global economic burden estimated to be of $1.72 trillion. Over the past decade, the prevalence has not stopped increasing worldwide, contributing to the development of numerous diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, and joint diseases. By 2050, it is estimated that 50% of the female population and 60% of the male population will suffer from obesity.

Therapeutic management of obesity includes lifestyle changes such as the adoption of an appropriate balanced diet, physical exercise, and the use of pharmacological drugs such as orlistat. For refractory cases, bariatric surgery can be proposed. However, patients have to meet some criteria established by the National Health System (NHS) or other equivalent supervising organizations: BMI ≥ 40 kg/m 2 or BMI ≥ 35 kg/m 2 potentially associated with an obesity‐related comorbidity, a failure of conservative management, a willingness to be followed over the long term after the procedure, and no health problems contraindicating general anesthesia. Many surgical procedures have been developed to obtain adequate weight loss: gastric banding, Roux‐en‐Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG), biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch, and one‐anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). Cesar Roux, a Swiss surgeon, was the first to perform a Y loop in 1892 to treat gastric outlet obstruction due to carcinoma or peptic ulcer disease. The procedure was adapted in 1967 by Mason, who associated the restrictive effect of the gastric pouch to the reduced bowel absorption of the Roux‐en‐Y reconstruction and created the first surgical procedure to treat obesity. RYGB is nowadays considered to be the gold standard of bariatric procedures, allowing patients to reach efficient weight loss and a resolution of obesity‐related comorbidities.

### Patterns of weight loss response following gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy [^1154utdk]. Obesity Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the health benefits of bariatric surgery (BS) extend beyond WL, better understanding of the WL response may help improve the outcomes of BS. In this context, we aimed to assess patterns within the variability of weight loss (WL) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG).

Methods

WL data from 658 subjects that underwent RYGB (n = 464) or SG (n = 194) as first BS were analyzed. Based on excess WL (EWL), subjects were categorized as good WL responders (EWL ≥ 50% at nadir weight and throughout follow-up), primarily poor WL responders (1-PWL:EWL < 50% at nadir weight and thereafter), and secondarily poor WL responders (2-PWL:EWL ≥ 50% at nadir weight, but < 50% at last follow-up visit). Predictors associated with different WL outcomes were ascertained using regression analysis.

Results

Median follow-up was 55.7 months. Nadir EWL ranged 12.4–143.6%; last follow-up visit EWL ranged -22.1–143.6% and weight regain (WR) ranged 0–64.1 kg. Good WL was found in 75.7 of the cohort. 1-PWL response (4.7%) was characterized by lesser WL but similar WR as compared to good WL and was associated with larger BMI and diabetes prior to surgery. 2-PWL response (19.6%) was characterized by larger WR as compared to the other groups and was more common following SG. Lesser percentage of medical appointments kept was associated with 1-PWL and 2-PWL.

Conclusion

Our data show the high inter-individual variability of the WL response at mid-term after RYGB and SG and that poor WL after BS could be illustrated by two different patterns, characterized either by sustained limited WL (1-PWL), or pronounced weight regain (2-PWL).

TWL (percentage) between RYGB and SG

TWL (percentage) after RYGB and SG was reported in six RCTs. One of them did not document standard deviation, leaving five articles for the meta‐analysis (Supporting Information Table S7). TWL (percentage) was similar between both procedures at 1 month (2 studies, 158 patients, MD: 0.74, 95% CI: −1.39 to 2.88, I 2: 72%, p = 0.5; Table 1, Figure 1A). However, RYGB showed a better TWL (percentage) after 3 months (2 studies, 131 patients, MD: 2.41, 95% CI: 0.46 to 4.36, I 2: 76%, p = 0.02; Table 1, Figure 1B), 6 months (2 studies, 69 patients, MD: 3.83, 95% CI: 2.46 to 5.21, I 2: 5%, p < 0.00001; Table 1, Figure 1C), 1 year (3 studies, 180 patients, MD: 6.35, 95% CI: 4.69 to 8.01, I 2: 0%, p < 0.00001; Table 1, Figure 1D), and 5 years (2 studies, 128 patients, MD: 3.90, 95% CI: 1.21 to 6.59, I 2: 0%, p = 0.005; Table 1, Figure 1E).

### The role of endoscopy in the bariatric surgery patient [^115WKHF2]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

Bariatric surgery patient overview — body mass index (BMI) thresholds, epidemiology, indications, and care model — is summarized as follows: Body mass index is calculated as weight/height² (kg/m²) and is used to classify adults as overweight (BMI 25.0–29.9) and obese (BMI ≥ 30.0); in 2010, 68% of U.S. adults older than 20 years were overweight or obese, 36% were frankly obese, and 6% had a BMI ≥ 40, with projections that by 2030, 40% of adults will be obese. Bariatric surgery is endorsed as an appropriate therapy in carefully selected individuals with severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40 or those with a BMI ≥ 30 and significant comorbid conditions) when dietary, behavioral, and pharmacotherapy interventions have failed; in such patients, surgery results in significant and durable weight loss and improvement in weight-related comorbidities. Procedures cause weight loss via gastric volume restriction or malabsorption or a combination of the 2 with associated hormonal changes; these interventions should be offered only as components of a multidisciplinary weight management team approach, and in the modern era sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has supplanted laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) as the most commonly used restrictive procedure.

### Body composition differences between excess weight loss ≥ 50% and… [^111bGe4w]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The relationship between weight loss and body composition is undefined after bariatric surgery. The objective of this study was to compare body composition changes in patients with excess weight loss ≥ 50% (EWL ≥ 50) and < 50% at 12 months post-operatively (EWL < 50).

Methods

A prospective cohort study was completed on patients undergoing bariatric surgery at two tertiary hospitals between 2017 and 2021. Body composition was measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry immediately before surgery, and at 1, 6, and 12 months post-operatively. Body mass index (BMI), fat mass (FM), lean body mass (LBM), and skeletal muscle index (SMI) trajectories were analysed between patients with EWL ≥ 50% and EWL < 50%.

Results

Thirty-seven patients were included in this series (EWL ≥ 50% n = 25, EWL < 50% n = 12), comprising of both primary and revisional bariatric surgery cases, undergoing a sleeve gastrectomy (62.2%), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (32.4%), or one anastomosis gastric bypass (5.4%). The EWL ≥ 50% group demonstrated a more optimal mean FM-to-LBM loss ratio than the EWL < 50% group. EWL ≥ 50% patients lost 2.0 kg more FM than EWL < 50% patients for each 1 kg of LBM lost. EWL ≥ 50% was also associated with an increase in mean SMI% over 12 months (5.5 vs. 2.4%; p < 0.0009). Across the whole cohort, the first month after surgery accounted for 67.4% of the total LBM reduction that occurred during the 12-month post-operative period.

Conclusion

This data suggests EWL ≥ 50% is associated with a more optimal body composition outcome than EWL < 50%. LBM reduction occurs predominantly in the early post-operative period.

### Study on weight loss outcomes after bariatric surgery to determine a metric least influenced by preoperative BMI [^1138Awwg]. International Journal of Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Percentage excess weight loss (%EWL) and percentage total weight loss (%TWL) are used for reporting outcomes after bariatric surgery. However, they are not ideal for comparing outcomes on populations of varied initial body mass index (BMI). This study aimed to validate a recently introduced metric - percentage alterable weight loss (%AWL), after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB).

Methods

Analysis of weight data of all patients who had undergone LSG and LRYGB until the end of the year 2021. Outcomes for both procedures were analyzed separately. The patients were divided into quartile subgroups Q1 (lowest BMI) to Q4 (highest BMI) and weight loss up to 5 years postoperatively was compared using %EWL, %TWL and %AWL metrics. An intermediary metric was also tested for its effect on the weight loss patterns for both procedures.

Results

The cohort included 1020 LSG and 322 LRYGB patients, with initial mean BMI of 43.5 ± 7.5 and 41.9 ± 8.3kg/m 2, respectively. %EWL significantly favors lower BMI subgroups for both procedures. %TWL is ideal for comparing weight loss during the first 6 months but it then favors higher BMI subgroups beyond 6 months. %AWL with reference BMI of 13kg/m 2 seems the best metric for medium-term comparison of weight loss for LRYGB and an intermediary metric based on BMI 8kg/m 2 provides the best fit for medium-term comparison for LSG.

Conclusions

%TWL is least influenced by initial BMI during short-term follow-up after LSG and LRYGB. For medium-term comparison, %AWL is best suited for LRYGB while an intermediary metric is found to provide the best fit for LSG.

### Should this patient have weight loss surgery? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^115eXBUg]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Obesity is an important public health priority in the United States. One third of U.S. adults are obese and therefore can expect higher rates of diabetes mellitus, other obesity-related comorbidities, and mortality. In 2013, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the Obesity Society, and the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery issued a guideline that recommended weight loss (bariatric) surgery for all patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 or higher and for those with a BMI of 35 kg/m2 or greater in the presence of at least 1 obesity-related comorbidity. Among the 3 most commonly performed surgeries, the amount of excess weight reduction ranges from 49% for laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding to 76% for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. In accredited centers, perioperative mortality averages 0.3%. In this Beyond the Guidelines, 2 experts in obesity management, a bariatric surgeon and a general internist, discuss the role of weight loss surgery versus dietary and lifestyle modification, both in general and for a specific patient who is eligible for surgery. Ethnic and age-related variability in the effects of obesity on mortality, as well as potential long-term benefits and risks of weight loss surgery for patient subgroups, are discussed.

### Converting a sleeve gastrectomy to a gastric bypass for weight loss failure-is It worth It? [^112wZrur]. Obesity Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is gaining popularity and has become the procedure of choice for many bariatric surgeons. Long-term weight loss failure is not uncommon. The preferred revisional procedure for these patients is still under debate.

Objective

The objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic gastric bypass as a revisional surgery for sleeve gastrectomy patients with weight loss failure.

Setting

The study was done at a bariatric surgery center in a university hospital.

Methods

We reviewed our prospectively collected database and identified all patients who underwent conversion of a sleeve gastrectomy to a gastric bypass for weight loss failure. Data on patient demographics, baseline characteristics, and outcomes of bariatric surgery were retrieved.

Results

Twenty-three patients with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 41.6 kg/m2 (range 34.1–50.1 kg/m2) underwent conversion to a gastric bypass. Four patients underwent a gastric band prior to the sleeve gastrectomy, and two patients underwent a re-sleeve gastrectomy prior to conversion to a gastric bypass. At a mean follow-up of 24 months (range 9–46 months), the average body mass index (BMI) decreased to 33.8 kg/m2 and the excess body mass index loss (EBMIL) was 42.6%. Diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea resolved or improved in 44.4, 45.5, 50, and 50% of the patients, respectively. Three patients developed early postop complications (13%), while late complications occurred in four patients (17%).

Conclusion

Converting a sleeve gastrectomy to a gastric bypass for weight loss failure is safe, yet weight loss benefit is limited.

### Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or one-anastomosis gastric bypass? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials [^115fE4mm]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

This study aimed to determine which bariatric procedure allows patients to obtain the best weight‐loss outcomes and a remission of type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Databases were searched for randomized‐controlled trials comparing Roux‐en‐Y gastric bypass (RYGB) with sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or one‐anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). The mean difference (MD) or the relative risk was determined.

Results

Twenty‐five randomized‐controlled trials were analyzed. Excess weight loss (EWL, percentage) was greater for RYGB patients at 3 years (MD: 11.93, p < 0.00001) and 5 years (MD: 13.11, p = 0.0004). Higher excess BMI loss (percentage) was found in RYGB at 1 year (MD: 11.66, p = 0.01). Total weight loss (percentage) was greater for RYGB patients after 3 months (MD: 2.41, p = 0.02), 6 months (MD: 3.83, p < 0.00001), 1 year (MD: 6.35, p < 0.00001), and 5 years (MD: 3.90, p = 0.005). No difference in terms of remission of type 2 diabetes was seen between RYGB and SG. EWL was significantly more important after OAGB than after RYGB after 1 year (MD: −10.82, p = 0.003).

Conclusions

RYGB is more efficient than SG in the midterm. OAGB offers greater EWL than RYGB after 1 year, but further evidence is needed to confirm this result.

### Adaptation of the by-band randomized clinical trial to by-band-sleeve to include a new intervention and maintain relevance of the study to practice [^115Md3XD]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The proposal to adapt the trial was discussed at a special session of the British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society annual meeting in January 2014. Those present supported it, and additional centres were recruited. The independent trial steering and data monitoring committees supported the adaptation.

At the time when the trial was first designed there was little consensus regarding sleeve gastrectomy itself and how it should be performed and followed up. By the time of the review, best practice guidelines had been published and the fourth international consensus summit for sleeve gastrectomy had taken place 19, 20. Meetings confirmed that the procedure was safe, and agreed standards for its conduct were documented.

The proposal for adaptation to a three‐group trial was reviewed and accepted by the funder. The original research question, (1) below, was expanded in the three‐group trial to answer three questions based on co‐primary outcomes:
Does gastric bypass lead to better quality of life and at least as good weight loss as gastric band (original question)?
Does sleeve gastrectomy lead to better quality of life and at least as good weight loss as gastric band (new question)?
Does sleeve gastrectomy lead to better quality of life and at least as good weight loss as gastric bypass (new question)?

When calculating the sample size for the adapted design, the same assumptions as for the original calculations were used 10. Because the number of hypotheses was increased threefold, the significance levels were adjusted from 5 to 2 per cent for the two‐sided statistical tests of superiority and from 2.5 to 1 per cent for the one‐sided statistical tests of non‐inferiority. Under these assumptions, the revised total sample size for a trial with equal allocation across the three treatment groups was 1341 (447 per group) (Fig. 1).

By‐Band‐Sleeve trial design

The formal proposal for the adaptation was submitted at the same time as the request to progress from the pilot to the main trial. Approval and additional funding to support the adaptation was granted in October 2014.

### Impact of preoperative weight loss on postoperative weight loss revealed from a large nationwide quality registry [^115uZsvz]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Weight loss before bariatric surgery is not mandatory, but questions remain as to whether preoperative weight loss has an impact on weight loss after surgery. Most studies have small sample sizes. The objective was to evaluate the relationship between preoperative and successful postoperative weight loss defined as ≥ 25% total weight loss (TWL) at 1 and 2 years after primary bariatric surgery with regard to the obesity-related comorbidities.

Materials and Methods

Data were extracted from a large nationwide quality registry of patients who underwent a sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or gastric bypass (GBP) between January 2015 and January 2018. Patients with completed screening and preoperative and postoperative data were included. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed for each technique and follow-up years separately.

Results

In total, 8751 were included in the analysis. Patients with preoperative weight loss were more likely to achieve ≥ 25% postoperative TWL in both procedures. Patients with higher preoperative weight loss of 5–10% had an increased likelihood for achieving 25% TWL compared to 0–5%, OR 1.79 (CI (1.42–2.25), p < 0.001) vs 1.25 (CI (1.08–1.46), p < 0.004) for the GBP group for year 2 postoperative. This was the same for the SG group at year 2, OR 1.30 (CI (1.03–1.64), p < 0.029) vs 1.14 (CI (0.94–1.38), p < 0.198).

Conclusion

Patients with preoperative weight loss were more likely to achieve ≥ 25% postoperative TWL at 1 and 2 years after surgery in both procedures; moreover, the extent of preoperative weight loss contributes to the significance and odds of this success.

### Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or one-anastomosis gastric bypass? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials [^1129hs5P]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to determine which bariatric procedure allows patients to obtain the best weight-loss outcomes and a remission of type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Databases were searched for randomized-controlled trials comparing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) with sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). The mean difference (MD) or the relative risk was determined.

Results

Twenty-five randomized-controlled trials were analyzed. Excess weight loss (EWL, percentage) was greater for RYGB patients at 3 years (MD: 11.93, p < 0.00001) and 5 years (MD: 13.11, p = 0.0004). Higher excess BMI loss (percentage) was found in RYGB at 1 year (MD: 11.66, p = 0.01). Total weight loss (percentage) was greater for RYGB patients after 3 months (MD: 2.41, p = 0.02), 6 months (MD: 3.83, p < 0.00001), 1 year (MD: 6.35, p < 0.00001), and 5 years (MD: 3.90, p = 0.005). No difference in terms of remission of type 2 diabetes was seen between RYGB and SG. EWL was significantly more important after OAGB than after RYGB after 1 year (MD: -10.82, p = 0.003).

Conclusions

RYGB is more efficient than SG in the midterm. OAGB offers greater EWL than RYGB after 1 year, but further evidence is needed to confirm this result.

### Surgical approaches to the treatment of obesity [^112jGrvH]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Bariatric surgery, through its efficacy and improved safety, is emerging as an important and broadly available treatment for people with severe and complex obesity that has not responded adequately to other therapy. Established procedures, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and adjustable gastric banding, account for more than 80% of bariatric surgical procedures globally. Sleeve gastrectomy has emerged as a stand-alone procedure. Truly malabsoptive procedures, such as biliopancreatic diversion and its duodenal switch variant, have a diminishing role as primary procedures, but remain an option for patients who do not respond adequately to less disruptive procedures. The procedures vary considerably in their postoperative morbidity and mortality; pattern and extent of weight loss; nature and severity of long-term complications; and nutritional requirements and risks. There is no perfect procedure — an informed risk and benefit assessment should be made by each patient. Gastroenterologists also need to be familiar with the risks and benefits of current and emerging procedures as they are likely to be increasingly involved in the integrated care of these patients.

### Updated panel report: best practices for the surgical treatment of obesity [^116akCBH]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Medium credibility.

Endoluminal gastroplasty and transoral gastric volume reduction as intervention for weight management (TRIM) trial — adult obesity outcomes are reported with twelve-month results showing a mean weight loss of 11 kg, BMI reduction of − 4 kg/m2, and percent excess weight loss of 27.7. Half of patients achieved greater than 30% excess weight loss; however, many regained the weight as the plications came undone. Initial data from 22 patients demonstrate no major adverse events, mean BMI loss of 7.3 kg/m2, and mean percentage of total body weight loss of 18.7 ± 10.7 kg at 1 year. Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is a feasible and promising procedure to treat obesity, and the device manufacturer is currently seeking FDA approval for an obesity treatment indication while the ASMBS is waiting to discuss any formal endorsement until more data emerge.

### Current controversies in metabolic surgery for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^116kkJUm]. Obesity Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents the most common liver disease, and it is expected to become the leading cause of end-stage liver disease in the near future. Bariatric operations have beneficial effects on NAFLD, inducing histological resolution of liver damage through weight loss-dependent and weight loss-independent mechanisms. Due to lack of randomized controlled trials, no specific guidelines have been established so far. Yet there is growing evidence that NAFLD will eventually become a formal indication for metabolic surgery. Data regarding the choice of procedure are conflicting, although gastric bypass seems to be slightly superior to sleeve gastrectomy. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the ongoing research regarding the role of metabolic surgery in NAFLD management.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the perioperative nutrition, metabolic, and nonsurgical support of patients undergoing bariatric procedures-2019 update: cosponsored by American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology, the obesity society, American society for metabolic&bariatric surgery, Obesity Medicine Association, and American society of anesthesiologists- [^112X2tSg]. Endocrine Practice (2019). High credibility.

Re-operative bariatric surgery — classification, outcomes, and conversion strategies are outlined: Re-operations that result in a new or different type of procedure are considered conversions; operations intended to resolve a complication or anatomic defect are called corrective procedures; and those that attempt to restore normal anatomy are called reversals. In addition to providing additional therapy for weight loss, re-operative procedures have been shown to improve metabolic outcomes, especially diabetes improvement and remission rates. Among high-volume bariatric surgery centers, only 3% of patients having a sleeve gastrectomy (SG) required re-operations. Conversions of laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or SG can be performed in 1 or two stages, and retrospective data suggest a higher leak rate with a single-stage approach, particularly with conversion to SG.

### Eight year follow-up after gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy in a Brazilian cohort: weight trajectory and health outcomes [^112FoRFH]. Obesity Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) being the most commonly performed bariatric surgery today, studies with over 5 years of follow-up show that patients undergoing SG have inferior weight loss compared to those undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The aim of this study was to examine differences in weight loss and the prevalence of weight regain between SG and RYGB up to 8 years after surgery.

Methods

Retrospective study including adult patients undergoing SG or RYGB between 2015 and 2018 at a tertiary center in Brazil. We evaluate the weight trajectory and pre- and postoperative behavior of type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Differences betwen variables were tested using Student t-test, Mann-Whitney U, Pearson's chi-square or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. The level of significance adopted was p < 0,005.

Results

Among 591 patients (40 ± 10 years; baseline body mass index 41.7 [IQR 39.1–45]; 83% women), 327 underwent RYGB (55%) and 264 SG (45%). Preoperatively, 14% had T2D, 40% hypertension, and 53% dyslipidemia. The mean total percentage of weight loss was higher in the RYGB group after 8 years: 32% compared to 19% after SG (difference 13%, p < 0.004). At 8 years, weight regain was also lower in RYGB (23%) compared to SG (39%) (p < 0.001). At 5 years postoperatively, the remission rates for T2D, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were 63%, 42%, and 51%, respectively, among the patients who remained in follow-up.

Conclusions

Patients undergoing RYGB showed greater weight loss and less weight regain 8 years after bariatric surgery compared to those undergoing SG.

### Predictability of first-year weight loss in laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy [^112FgqFe]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Bariatric surgery is a significant investment for the patient and weight loss team. In some cases, this includes a requirement for pre-operative weight loss despite the lack of evidence for a correlation with successful outcomes. We sought to determine whether weight loss on a short, immediate pre-operative diet, as well as across the medical weight loss program, would correlate with 1-year outcomes of patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG).

Methods

All patients having a LSG between March 2013 and March 2016 were reviewed. Demographics and biometrics [weight, body mass index (BMI)] were collected at initial, day of surgery and follow-up (2 weeks, 6 weeks, 4 months, and 1 year). Pre-operative weight loss was determined both cumulative (initial to day of surgery) and for the pre-operative diet (2 weeks). Weight loss and percent excess weight loss (%EWL) were calculated and correlated at all time points.

Results

A total of 127 patients were reviewed for this study. The mean %EWL at 1-year follow-up was 47 ± 18%. Weight loss achieved on a 2-week pre-operative diet did not correlate with weight outcomes at 1-year follow-up (r = 0.134, p = 0.40); however, cumulative pre-operative weight loss had a modest correlation (r = 0.443, p < 0.01). Post-operative %EWL at 4 months had the best correlation with longer term weight loss (r = 0.730, p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Pre-operative performance is not a good predictor for 1-year outcomes in LSG. Better correlation was observed in %EWL at post-surgery visits. Following the patient's trajectory post-operatively may provide a window for intervention to improve weight loss.

### Long-term weight loss and attendance outcomes following metabolic and bariatric surgery: an evaluation of the Cleveland clinic behavioral rating system [^114Db3Fn]. Obesity Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

International guidelines on metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) recommend that all patients who are referred for MBS undergo a psychological evaluation prior to the procedure to identify any potential vulnerabilities and areas of concern that may impact treatment outcomes and long-term adherence, as well as to enable appropriate postoperative monitoring. The guidelines also outline what elements should be included in this psychological assessment. However, the specific implementation of these guidelines varies between institutions, and a variety of tools are available for assessing multiple domains of concern.

The Cleveland Clinic has developed a comprehensive instrument for evaluating the psychological state of individuals seeking MBS, known as the Cleveland Clinic Behavioral Rating System (CCBRS). The goal of the CCBRS is to provide a succinct summary of the patient's strengths and areas for improvement, with a particular emphasis on assessing their "readiness" for the procedure, instead of delivering a final decision on whether they meet the necessary requirements. This system consists of nine discrete domains, including eight psychosocial domains (consent, expectations, social support, adherence, coping/stressors, mental health, substance use/abuse/dependence, eating behaviors), and an overall impression domain.

Although the CCBRS was not originally designed for the prediction of postoperative weight loss or attendance to follow-up, it has been investigated in prior studies, showing varying outcomes. The CCBRS was found to be a useful instrument for the psychosocial assessment among 389 patients undergoing MBS (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy, and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding) in the United States. In this study, the CCBRS predicted the duration of hospital stay, but did not predict postoperative weight loss up to 1 year after MBS. Another study in the United States included 179 patients and illustrated that the domains "social support", "coping", and "overall impression" were associated with better attendance to follow-up, while only the domain "social support" had a significant association with weight loss 2 years after MBS. In contrast, a recent study by the same author solely focused on the CCBRS domain "social support" and found no association with postoperative weight loss or attendance at 2-year follow-up. Researchers advised further research should assess the predictive utility of the tool for longer term postoperative weight loss. The CCBRS was implemented in the Dutch guideline for Bariatric psychology to facilitate structured psychodiagnostic screening aimed at identifying risk factors that may impede optimal weight loss outcomes or may elevate the likelihood of postoperative psychological complications.

### Definitions of long-term weight regain and their associations with clinical outcomes [^112MEAuJ]. Obesity Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence and clinical significance of weight regain after bariatric surgery remains largely unclear due to the lack of a standardized definition of significant weight regain. The development of a clinically relevant definition of weight regain requires a better understanding of its clinical significance.

Objectives

To assess rates of weight regain 5 years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG), applying six definitions and investigating their association with clinical outcomes.

Methods

Patients were followed up until 5 years after surgery and weight regain was calculated. Regression techniques were used to assess the association of weight regain with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and the presence of comorbidities.

Results

A total of 868 patients participated in the study, with a mean age of 46.6 (± 10.4) years, of which 79% were female. The average preoperative BMI was 44.8 (± 5.9) kg/m 2 and the total maximum weight loss was 32% (± 8%). Eighty-seven percent experienced any regain. Significant weight regain rates ranged from 16 to 37% depending on the definition. Three weight regain definitions were associated with deterioration in physical HRQoL (p < 0.05), while associations between definitions of weight regain and the presence of comorbidities 5 years after surgery were not significant.

Conclusion

These results indicate that identifying one single categorical definition of clinically significant weight regain is difficult. Additional research into the clinical significance of weight regain is needed to inform the development of a standardized definition that includes all dimensions of surgery success: weight, HRQoL, and comorbidity remission.

### Weight loss after bariatric surgery in obese adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116sJMQN]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Of adolescents in the United States, 20% have obesity and current treatment options prioritize intensive lifestyle interventions that are largely ineffective. Bariatric surgery is increasingly being offered to obese adolescent patients; however, large-scale effectiveness data is lacking. We used MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases, and a manual search of references to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on overall weight loss after gastric band, gastric sleeve, and gastric bypass in obese adolescent patients (age ≤ 19) and young adults (age ≤ 21) in separate analyses. We provided estimates of absolute change in body mass index (BMI, kg/m 2) and percent excess weight loss across 4 postoperative time points (6, 12, 24, and 36 mo) for each surgical subgroup. Study quality was assessed using a 10 category scoring system. Data were extracted from 24 studies with 4 having multiple surgical subgroups (1 with 3, and 3 with 2 subgroups), totaling 29 surgical subgroup populations (gastric band: 16, gastric sleeve: 5, gastric bypass: 8), and 1928 patients (gastric band: 1010, gastric sleeve: 139, gastric bypass: 779). Mean preoperative BMI (kg/m 2) was 45.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 44.7, 46.3) in gastric band, 48.8 (95%CI: 44.9, 52.8) in gastric sleeve, and 53.3 (95%CI: 50.2, 56.4) in gastric bypass patients. The short-term weight loss, measured as mean (95%CI) absolute change in BMI (kg/m 2) at 6 months, was -5.4 (-3.0, -7.8) after gastric band, -11.5 (-8.8, -14.2) after gastric sleeve, and -18.8 (-10.9, -26.6) after gastric bypass. Weight loss at 36 months, measured as mean (95%CI) absolute change in BMI (kg/m 2) was -10.3 (-7.0, -13.7) after gastric band, -13.0 (-11.0, -15.0) after gastric sleeve, and -15.0 (-13.5, -16.5) after gastric bypass. Bariatric surgery in obese adolescent patients is effective in achieving short-term and sustained weight loss at 36 months; however, long-term data remains necessary to better understand its long-term efficacy.

### Mid-long-term revisional surgery after sleeve gastrectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Sgb1B]. Obesity Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to make a meta-analysis regarding mid-long-term outcomes (≥ 3-year follow-up) after sleeve gastrectomy (SG), focusing on incidence, reasons, and results of revisional surgery. PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched and 32 studies were included. The overall revision rate was 10.4%, but for patients with ≥ 10-year follow-up, the rate was 22.6%. European studies had a higher revision rate (14.4%) than other studies. The most common reason for revision was failure in weight loss, and the most frequent revisional procedure was gastric bypass. Revisional surgery was favorable for weight reduction and comorbidity resolution. In conclusion, revision rate is not rare after SG, especially when looking at long-term follow-up. Bariatric surgeons and patients need to fully understand and deal with the need for revision after SG.

Surgical Technique

The technique of performing a SG (Fig. 1) was similar in the three bariatric centers participating in this study and will briefly be described in this chapter. After creating a capnoperitoneum with 12–15mmHg, the lesser sac was entered and opened from the pylorus to the angle of His at the greater curvature of the stomach while preserving the gastro-epiploic arcade. The sleeve's blood supply is ensured by the right and the left gastric arteries. The left crus of the hiatus was visualized to detect undiagnosed hiatal hernias. Any hiatal hernias detected during this step would have been treated with hiatoplasty at this point. However, in this series, none of the patients had any hiatal hernia detected intraoperatively. Then, a 14–16mm (42–48 French) bougie was inserted to guide and standardize the resection of the stomach using five to seven stapler magazines. The starting point was at about 6cm distance from the pylorus and stapling ended at the angle of His to resect the entire fundus. Belsey's fat pad was removed to increase the vision to the angle of His. The staple line was oversewn by a running suture.

Fig. 1
Sleeve gastrectomy

The technique of performing a SG common then has only changed slightly up until now. The differences are that today, we use a slightly smaller bougie size of 12mm (36 French) and start the resection slightly closer to the antrum (2–3cm from the pylorus). The complete resection of the entire fundus was performed then and is still done today.

Weight Loss

Weight and BMI (body mass Index) at the time of the SG (as well as at the time of the conversion in converted patients) were gathered from operation protocols. Patients were asked for their nadir weight (including point in time when it was reached) after SG (and after conversion, if applicable). Data on patients' 10-year postoperative weight was published in the above-mentioned publication for the same cohort. As before, weight regain was defined as weight gain of > 10kg from nadir weight. Patients' current weight 15 years after SG was determined by weighing them in our walk-in clinic for standardized values from verified scales.

Conversion to Other Bariatric-Metabolic Procedures

All operation protocols and electronic patients' charts were studied to gather information about the reason for the conversion, body weight, status of AMP, etc.

Weight and BMI at the time of the conversion in the entire group of converted patients were 112.0 ± 24.6kg and 38.4 ± 6.2kg/m 2 after a median period of 48 months. After a follow-up of 186 months, the non-converted group was able to reach a weight, BMI, and TWL of 93.0 ± 22.1kg/m 2, 34.3 ± 6.9kg/m 2, and 31.5 ± 12.6%. The weight, BMI, and TWL of the converted group was 91.6 ± 19.3kg/m 2, 31.5 ± 5.5kg/m 2, and 32.9 ± 15.1%. A detailed history of weight in patients converted mainly due to reflux or weight regain is highlighted in Table 2. To highlight weight changes over time, data from our previous publication based on a 10-year follow-up was added to Table 2. The history of weight in non-converted patients over the period of 15 years is highlighted in Fig. 3.

Percentage of Total Weight Lost

Patients who had each procedure showed considerable weight loss 1 year after surgery (SG, −22.8% [95% CI, −23.1% to −22.5%]; RYGB, −29.1% [95% CI, −29.3% to −28.8%]); typically, weight regain then occurred. The groups maintained a mean body weight well below the baseline at 5 years (SG, −16.1% [95% CI, −17.3% to −14.8%]; RYGB, −24.1% [95% CI, −25.0% to −23.3%]). Typically, the RYGB group reflected 6.2% to 8.1% more total body weight loss than the SG group at each point (Figure 1; Table 2). This represents a 10.2-kg difference (95% CI, 8.3–12.1 kg; P < .001) in weight loss between RYGB and SG at 5 years.

### Synopsis of the 2020 U.S. VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of adult overweight and obesity [^117FbnqQ]. Military Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Metabolic/bariatric surgery — age-related outcomes show higher complications and mortality in older adults in selected studies while weight loss benefits may be similar in those ≥ 65 years. One study reported serious morbidity with RYGB 3.4% in younger and 5.7% in older people; with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy 2.2% in younger and 4% in older, and 30-day mortality with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy 0.07% in younger and 0.29% in older. An SR of nine observational studies including 4,025 under age 60 and 366 age 60 or older found higher early post-surgical complications in those age ≥ 60 undergoing RYGB (OR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.07 to 3.3) and higher mortality (1.6% vs 0.3%; OR: 4.83; 95% CI: 1.25 to 15.31). Three SR studies (793 younger; 148 older) suggested less weight loss in those ≥ 60 (MD: -5.86; 95% CI: -9.15 to -2.56), but data comparing those older or younger than 65 years reported weight loss benefits were similar, and "The benefits of weight loss and remission of obesity-related comorbidities appear similar for people ≥ 65 years compared to those who are younger". The Work Group decided upon a "Neither for nor against" recommendation.

3 METABOLIC BARIATRIC SURGERY

Metabolic Bariatric surgery (MBS) remains the gold standard intervention for long‐term weight loss and management of obesity. It results in a mean peak weight loss between 30% and 35% and long‐term weight loss of approximately 25%. Between 20 and 35% of patients, however, experience suboptimal weight loss and previous analyses indicate that weight loss outcomes are dependent on the choice of surgery, age, initial BMI, ethnic origin, presence of eating disorders, metabolic factors and compliance with post‐surgical dietary guidance.

The latest International Federation for Surgery for Obesity and Metabolic Disorders (IFSO) report estimate suggests at least half a million bariatric procedures were performed worldwide in 2023, with the most being performed in the United States and Brazil. Data from the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) show an increase in bariatric procedures performed, with 100,000 more procedures performed in 2022 than 10 years prior.

3.1 Types ofprocedure

Multiple bariatric procedures exist, and the most widely described types are (see Figure 1):
Sleeve gastrectomy
Roux‐en‐y gastric bypass (RYGB)
Adjustable gastric band
One‐anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB)
Biliopancreatic diversion

FIGURE 1
Metabolic Bariatric surgery procedures: A Sleeve gastrectomy B Roux‐en‐Y gastric bypass C biliopancreatic diversion; D Adjustable gastric banding. Adapted from American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery.

By far the most common procedure performed worldwide is the sleeve gastrectomy, which now comprises approximately 60% of all bariatric surgical procedures. RYGB is the next most common type, and 9 out of every 10 bariatric procedures will be one of these two types. The remainder are divided equally between OAGB (approximately 4.3%) and other less common procedures.

### Argon plasma coagulation prior to endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty for weight loss [^114pnoYF]. VideoGIE (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Endoscopic bariatric therapies provide an effective and minimally invasive approach to obesity that augments the available treatment options beyond surgery, medication, and lifestyle modifications. Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) provides transoral endoscopic gastric volume reduction resulting in a sleeve-like anatomy similar to, but not identical to, that of sleeve gastrectomy. ESG uses full-thickness endoscopic suturing (OverStitch; Apollo Endosurgery, Austin, Tex, USA) to approximate the mucosal surfaces for creation of gastroplasty, thus relying on the suture stability to maintain the integrity of the plications. Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty integrity correlates with better weight loss outcomes over time. The expected mean percentage of total body weight loss (TBWL) following ESG is 13.7% ± 6.8%, 15.0% ± 7.7%, and 14.8% ± 8.5% at 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively. However, several reports demonstrate evidence of suture dehiscence between 8 months and 2 years after ESG, regardless of the suturing technique, suturing pattern, or number of sutures used.

### Long-term follow-up after bariatric surgery… [^111qUfxX]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Findings Of 7371 clinical studies reviewed, 29 studies met inclusion criteria. All gastric bypass studies and sleeve gastrectomy studies had 95% confidence intervals for the reported mean, median, or both exceeding 50% excess weight loss. This amount of excess weight loss occurred in 31% of gastric band studies. The mean sample-size–weighted percentage of excess weight loss for gastric bypass was 65. 7% vs
45. 0% for gastric band. Conclusions and Relevance Very few bariatric surgery studies report long-term results with sufficient patient follow-up to minimize biased results. Gastric bypass has better outcomes than gastric band procedures for long-term weight loss, type 2 diabetes control and remission, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.

Insufficient evidence exists regarding long-term outcomes for gastric sleeve resections. Original research reports of cohorts from randomized clinical trials and observational studies with at least 50 adult patients, with a minimum body mass index of 35, who were undergoing gastric bypass, gastric band, or sleeve gastrectomy were included for weight loss outcomes. Twenty-nine clinical studies were included in this review, reporting on the following: weight loss, type. Twenty-four studies reported weight loss outcomes. Most expressed mean weight loss as %EWL, followed by change in BMI and change in absolute weight.

Of these, 16 included sufficient information to calculate 95% confidence intervals. Point estimates of the mean or median %EWL, without 95% confidence intervals, were provided for the remaining 7 studies. Eleven gastric bypass, 13 gastric band, and 2 sleeve gastrectomy studies with weight loss outcomes met inclusion criteria. Seventy-eight percent of gastric bypass, 75% of gastric band, and 50% of sleeve gastrectomy studies reporting mean %EWL provided standard deviations, enabling calculation of confidence intervals. Gastric bypass resulted in greater weight loss than the gastric band. All gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy cohorts had 95% confidence intervals of the reported mean or median exceeding 50% excess weight loss. This only occurred in 31% of gastric band cohorts.

The sample-size–weighted mean excess weight loss was 65. 7% after gastric bypass compared with
45. 0% after gastric band. The sample-size–weighted mean excess weight loss after sleeve gastrectomy was 64. 5%. Gastric band studies reporting more than 50% excess weight loss by median, means, and 95% confidence intervals included 2 RCTs20, 21 and 2 case series. 31, 33 The RCTs had shorter follow-up than the case series. The remaining 9 studies had median or mean excess weight loss and 95% confidence intervals that were less than 50% excess weight loss. 7, 8, 17–19, 22, 24, 25, 32, 36 Four gastric band studies did not provide either standard deviations needed to calculate confidence intervals20, 33 or the 5% and 95% range7, 24 for median weight loss. Two case series studies described sleeve gastrectomy outcomes.

### Effect of sleeve gastrectomy vs roux-en-Y gastric bypass on… [^115VL7a3]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Question Is there a difference in weight loss between laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in patients with morbid obesity. Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 217 adults with morbid obesity, percentage excess body mass index loss in patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy compared with gastric bypass was 61. 1% vs
68. 3% after 5 years, a difference that was not statistically significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Interventions Patients were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was weight loss, expressed as percentage excess body mass index loss. Exploratory end points were changes in comorbidities and adverse events. Results Among the 217 patients 205 completed the trial.

Excess BMI loss was not significantly different at 5 years: for sleeve gastrectomy, 61. 1%, vs Roux-en-Y gastric bypass,
68. 3%. Gastric reflux remission was observed more frequently after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass than after sleeve gastrectomy. Gastric reflux worsened more often after sleeve gastrectomy than after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The number of patients with reoperations or interventions was 16/101 after sleeve gastrectomy and 23/104 after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with morbid obesity, there was no significant difference in excess BMI loss between laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass at 5 years of follow-up after surgery. Trial Registration clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT00356213.

The primary end point of the study was weight loss, defined as percentage excess BMI loss, over a 5-year period. Weight was measured at each visit. Overall, both treatments significantly reduced percentage excess BMI loss over the observation period, with significant overall differences between the groups without adjustment for multiple comparisons. However, in the primary analysis that adjusted for multiple comparisons, there were no statistically significant differences in percentage excess BMI loss for sleeve gastrectomy compared with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, respectively, at 1 year for a linear decrease in excess BMI loss over the follow-up period for both treatment groups. A percentage excess BMI loss greater than 75% was observed in 31. 7% vs
40. 4%, respectively. A percentage excess BMI loss less than 25% was observed in 9. 9% of sleeve gastrectomy patients and
3. 8% of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients. Mean BMI decreased significantly from baseline to 5 years after operation. There was no significant difference in BMI at 5 years between the interventions.

### Sleeve gastrectomy vs intensive lifestyle modification for patients with BMI 30 to less than 35… [^111YxKkD]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Question What are the outcomes and safety of sleeve gastrectomy compared with intensive nonoperative obesity treatment in patients with class 1 obesity. Findings In this matched cohort study including 1216 patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy and 2432 controls who underwent intensive lifestyle treatment, surgery was associated with greater weight loss after the intervention, lower incidence of diabetes, and a higher rate of pharmacological diabetes remission, but a higher risk for self-harm and substance use disorder. Interventions Sleeve gastrectomy or intensive lifestyle treatment. Main Outcomes and Measures Outcomes included weight loss after intervention, changes in metabolic comorbidities, substance use disorders, self-harm, and major cardiovascular events retrieved from the National Patient Register, Prescribed Drug Register, and Cause of Death Register as well as the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry and the Itrim health database.

Data were analyzed from December 1, 2021 until May 31, 2022. Surgery patients had greater 1-year weight loss compared with controls. Surgery patients were followed up clinically at the surgery department at approximately 6 weeks, 1 year, and 2 years after operation. Individuals underwent a 3-month dietary weight-loss phase facilitated by a low- or very-low-calorie diet followed by a 9-month weight maintenance phase. 14 The choice of a low-calorie or very-low-calorie diet was based on baseline BMI, personal preference, and contraindication status. After the weight-loss phase, patients entered a 9-month weight maintenance program including exercise and dietary advice.

Safety outcomes included early postoperative complications and revision surgery for the surgical cohort, use of gastric acid–suppressing agents, and psychiatric disorders for both groups. For the early postoperative complications, patients with a BMI of 35 or greater who underwent sleeve gastrectomy in Sweden during the same period were included for comparison. The majority of patients in both groups were women. Median follow-up time was 5. 1 years in the sleeve group and
5. 1 years in the lifestyle modification group.

Patients in the sleeve group experienced higher weight loss at 1 year compared with the lifestyle group in the surgery group vs 12. 8% of total weight loss, and median length of stay 2 days. During the 30 days after surgery, 33 of 1216 sleeve patients were readmitted to hospital. During follow-up, 22 patients underwent revision surgery. Weight regain and gastroesophageal reflux were the most common contributing factors for revision, followed by malnutrition or stenosis and surgical complication manifesting as leakage.

### Effect of sleeve gastrectomy vs roux-en-Y gastric bypass on weight loss and quality of life… [^117ApqFF]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

The primary end point was percentage excess weight loss at 5 years. Secondary predefined follow-up time points were 7, 10, 15, and 20 years, with included 7-year secondary end points of QoL and morbidity. Results Of 240 patients, 182 completed the 7-year follow-up. The mean %EWL was 47% after LSG and 55% after LRYGB. The mean DSQoL total score at 7 years was 0. 50 after LSG and
0. 49 after LRYGB, and the median HRQoL total score was 0. 88 after LSG and
0. 87 after LRYGB. Greater weight loss was associated with better DSQoL.

Exclusion criteria were BMI greater than 60, significant eating or psychiatric disorder, active alcohol or substance abuse, active gastric ulcer disease, severe gastroesophageal reflux disease with a large hiatal hernia, and previous bariatric surgery. The objective of this 7-year secondary analysis was to assess %EWL equivalence after LSG and LRYGB in patients with morbid obesity. In addition, QoL outcomes were compared between procedures and with those of an age-standardized and sex-standardized general population, and long-term QoL association with weight loss outcomes was determined. Remission of obesity-related comorbidities was reported at the 5-year follow-up; these data are not reported at 7 years, with next follow-up scheduled at 10 years. In this 7-year follow-up study focusing on weight loss and QoL, the %EWL and the improvement of DSQoL and HRQoL were assessed preoperatively and at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years after surgery.

Based on the predefined margins for equivalence, the 2 groups were not equivalent at 7 years as the whole confidence interval is not within the margins. Although weight loss after LRYGB was statistically greater compared with LSG, the difference was not clinically relevant with respect to the predefined 95% CIs and equivalence margins. The %EWL at each follow-up point for both procedures is shown in Figure 2A. At baseline, the mean DSQoL total score was 0. 10 after LSG and
0. 12 after LRYGB. There were no significant differences in any of the Moorehead-Ardelt QoL dimensions between the 2 procedures at 7 years. Quiz Ref IDPercentage excess weight loss was associated with the DSQoL score; greater weight loss resulted in superior DSQoL.

For the first 5 years after the procedures, HRQoL stayed higher compared with baseline, but decreased close to baseline at 7 years, with no significant difference in HRQoL compared with baseline. Significant and sustained %EWL was achieved both after LSG and LRYGB in this 7-year follow-up of the SLEEVEPASS RCT with a high follow-up rate. The 2 procedures did not meet criteria for equivalence at 7 years. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass again resulted in slightly greater %EWL compared with LSG, but owing to the prespecified equivalence margins resulting in a very wide confidence interval for the difference, the difference cannot be interpreted as clinically relevant. There was no difference in long-term QoL between the procedures and bariatric surgery was associated with significant long-term DSQoL improvement.

In this 10-year follow-up of a randomized clinical trial including 240 patients, both LSG and LRYGB resulted in good and sustainable weight loss. The estimated mean percentage excess weight loss was somewhat lower after LSG than LRYGB with no statistically significant difference in remission of type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, or prevalence of Barrett esophagus; esophagitis was more prevalent after LSG, and hypertension remission was superior after LRYGB. Meaning Both procedures resulted in good and sustainable weight loss at 10 years; reflux was more prevalent after LSG, but the cumulative incidence of Barrett esophagus was similar after both procedures and markedly lower than in previous trials. Importance Long-term results from randomized clinical trials comparing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with laparoscopic Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass are limited. Interventions LSG or LRYGB.

Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was 5-year percentage excess weight loss. This current analysis focused on 10-year outcomes with special reference to reflux and BE. Results. Median %EWL was 43. 5% after LSG and
50. 7% after LRYGB. Mean estimate %EWL was not equivalent between the procedures; %EWL was 8. 4 higher in LRYGB. Conclusions and Relevance At 10 years, %EWL was greater after LRYGB and the procedures were not equivalent for weight loss, but both LSG and LRYGB resulted in good and sustainable weight loss. Esophagitis was more prevalent after LSG, but the cumulative incidence of BE was markedly lower than in previous trials and similar after both procedures. treatment for patients with severe obesity in terms of long-term and substantial weight loss, remission of obesity-related comorbidities, improvement of quality of life, and longer life expectancy.

4–11 Recent studies have also shown a high incidence of worsening of de novo gastroesophageal reflux, esophagitis, and Barrett esophagus after LSG. 12–15. LRYGB resulted in somewhat greater weight loss, but based on prespecified equivalence margins, this difference was not clinically significant. The current article provides 10-year outcomes and, to our knowledge, this is the largest RCT with the longest follow-up comparing LSG and LRYGB. In addition to weight loss and remission of obesity-related comorbidities, this 10-year follow-up also focuses on the controversial issues of long-term GERD symptoms, endoscopic esophagitis, and BE after LSG compared with LRYGB. The primary end point of the trial was weight loss defined by percentage excess weight loss, calculated as / × 10018 and predefined to be assessed at 5-year follow-up.

5 Prespecified secondary outcomes included remission of obesity-related comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, QOL, overall morbidity, and mortality. Additional post hoc outcomes added in the study protocol to be assessed at 10 years included GERD symptoms assessed by a health-related GERD-QOL questionnaire, 19 use of proton pump inhibitors, upper gastrointestinal endoscopic findings of esophagitis, and BE. In addition, the prevalence of percentage total weight loss less than 5% was assessed and weight regain was evaluated as percentage of maximum weight lost: /, which may best associate with most clinical outcomes. 20.
