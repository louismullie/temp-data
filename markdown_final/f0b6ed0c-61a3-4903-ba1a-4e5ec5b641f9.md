## Question

Polymyalgia rheumatica prednisone dosing

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about prednisone dosing for polymyalgia rheumatica, including initial dose, tapering, relapse management, and steroid-sparing options, with explicit self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the guideline-backed initial dose range and how to individualize within it. Then, I should verify the practical "default" starting dose and why it's reasonable. Next, I will review the tapering strategy and monitoring cadence. After that, I need to check relapse management and when to escalate therapy. Finally, I will examine steroid-sparing agents, special populations, and safety monitoring, and close with a concise, clinically actionable summary anchored to the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the guideline framework so I don't jump to conclusions: the 2015 EULAR/ACR recommendations advise using the minimum effective glucocorticoid dose within a prednisone-equivalent range of 12.5–25 mg daily, discouraging initial doses ≤ 7.5 mg and strongly recommending against doses > 30 mg, with dose selection individualized to relapse risk and comorbidity burden, which sets the guardrails for initial therapy [^116BYTxr] [^1164jTZr] [^116oGXni].

> Wait, let me verify the practical "default" starting dose because clinicians often ask for a single number. The FDA labeling lists 15 mg prednisone orally daily for adults with PMR, and this aligns with the lower-to-mid portion of the guideline range and with common practice to start at 15–20 mg, balancing efficacy and toxicity, so 15 mg is a reasonable default while still allowing upward titration toward 20–25 mg if symptoms are severe or relapse risk is high [^115dEd6d] [^116BYTxr].

> Hold on, I should verify the rationale for avoiding extremes: doses ≤ 7.5 mg are often inadequate to control PMR activity, whereas doses ≥ 30 mg increase adverse effects without added benefit, so the 12.5–25 mg window operationalizes the principle of using the lowest effective dose tailored to disease severity and patient risk profile [^116BYTxr] [^1164jTZr] [^116oGXni].

> Next, I should review tapering strategy and make sure I'm precise: the EULAR/ACR guidance recommends tapering to 10 mg prednisone equivalent within 4–8 weeks after initial control, then reducing by 1 mg every 4 weeks once remission is maintained, with flexibility for alternate-day decrements (for example, 10/7.5 mg) if 1 mg tablets are not available, and with individualized adjustments based on symptoms and labs. This cadence balances relapse prevention with cumulative steroid exposure [^114kF4bm] [^114vQBFm] [^117MpuQN].

> I need to ensure monitoring is aligned with tapering: follow-up every 4–8 weeks in year one, then every 8–12 weeks in year two, with closer visits during active tapering or relapse, and surveillance for steroid toxicities and relapse risk factors such as high ESR/CRP and peripheral inflammatory arthritis, which helps anticipate who may need slower tapers or steroid-sparing therapy [^1147C16e] [^113N8fb9] [^1171DBFu] [^114eEYzp].

> Let me consider relapse management carefully: if symptoms recur during taper, increase back to the pre-relapse dose and then taper more gradually over 4–8 weeks toward the dose at which relapse occurred, reassessing the diagnosis if response is atypical or if multiple relapses occur, because persistent flares may signal misdiagnosis or a need for adjunctive therapy [^114kF4bm] [^114vQBFm] [^111ZQCkd].

> I should double-check steroid-sparing options and their evidence: methotrexate 7.5–10 mg weekly can modestly reduce relapse and cumulative steroid exposure and is reasonable to add early in patients at high relapse risk or with steroid toxicities. IL-6 blockade is supported for glucocorticoid-dependent PMR, with randomized data showing sarilumab 200 mg every 2 weeks significantly improves sustained remission and reduces cumulative steroid dose, and tocilizumab also reduces disease activity and steroid requirements in active, glucocorticoid-dependent PMR. Importantly, TNF-α inhibitors are not recommended due to lack of benefit [^114xuhad] [^117MNVmQ] [^112ZebQ6] [^1179Q5rm] [^116neQYf].

> But wait, what about special populations and formulations? I should verify those nuances: in older adults or those with high comorbidity risk, favor the lower end of the 12.5–25 mg range and consider intramuscular methylprednisolone as an alternative in selected cases. Modified-release prednisone taken in the evening has shown signals of improved morning stiffness and IL-6 modulation in small studies, though noninferiority was not formally proven, so it may be considered in select patients. Obesity may necessitate careful symptom assessment because pain perception and steroid kinetics can differ, potentially influencing taper decisions even when inflammatory markers are similar [^116BYTxr] [^117SV1Co] [^113pF4hc] [^112v3skq] [^1157FUdm].

> I need to ensure comprehensive safety monitoring is explicit: at baseline, obtain inflammatory markers, CBC, glucose, renal and hepatic function, bone profile, and urinalysis. During therapy, track blood pressure, weight, glycemia, bone health, and infection risk, and implement universal osteoporosis prophylaxis with calcium, vitamin D, and pharmacologic therapy per risk, alongside patient education on adrenal insufficiency and withdrawal symptoms during slow tapers near physiologic doses [^113N8fb9] [^112dFDht] [^112zPiSU].

> Let me reconsider the practical clinical summary to ensure internal consistency: start prednisone 15 mg daily for most adults with PMR, adjust within 12.5–25 mg based on severity and risk, taper to 10 mg by 4–8 weeks if controlled, then decrease by 1 mg every 4 weeks while monitoring closely, manage relapses by returning to the pre-relapse dose and tapering more slowly, and add methotrexate or an IL-6 inhibitor in relapsing or glucocorticoid-dependent disease, while maintaining vigilant toxicity surveillance and individualized follow-up [^111NEYE2] [^116BYTxr] [^114kF4bm] [^112ZebQ6] [^1179Q5rm].

The standard initial prednisone dose for polymyalgia rheumatica is **12.5–25 mg daily** [^116BYTxr] [^1164jTZr], with 15 mg daily as the most common starting dose [^115dEd6d]. Doses below 12.5 mg are often ineffective, and doses above 30 mg are not recommended due to increased toxicity without added benefit [^115dEd6d] [^1164jTZr]. The dose should be individualized based on disease severity, relapse risk, and comorbidities [^114eEYzp] [^112aVWq9], and once remission is achieved, taper by 1 mg every 4 weeks [^114kF4bm] [^114vQBFm] as tolerated.

---

## Recommended initial prednisone dose

- **Standard initial dose**: 12.5–25 mg prednisone (or equivalent) daily [^116BYTxr] [^1164jTZr] [^111UWJ9h].
- **Most common starting dose**: 15 mg daily [^111NEYE2] [^111qc8FF].
- **Dose below 12.5 mg**: Conditionally discouraged due to insufficient efficacy [^112yA2Yr] [^115dEd6d].
- **Dose above 30 mg**: Strongly discouraged due to increased toxicity without additional benefit [^116oGXni] [^1164jTZr].

---

## Factors influencing initial dose selection

Several factors should guide the **initial prednisone dose**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on initial dose** |
|-|-|
| Disease severity | Higher severity may warrant doses toward the upper end of the range (20–25 mg) [^112yA2Yr] [^115Pi6JQ] |
| Relapse risk | Higher risk may justify higher initial doses (20–25 mg) [^1164jTZr] [^116pt6Em] |
| Comorbidities | Lower doses (12.5–15 mg) preferred in patients with diabetes, osteoporosis, or cardiovascular disease [^112aVWq9] [^112yA2Yr] |
| Age | Older patients may require lower doses due to increased susceptibility to side effects [^111JMGz5] [^114eEYzp] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the recommended dose range

Evidence supports a **12.5–25 mg** range, balancing efficacy and safety. Doses below 12.5 mg are often inadequate, whereas doses above 30 mg increase toxicity without added benefit [^116BYTxr] [^1164jTZr]. Most patients respond to 15–20 mg, with higher doses reserved for severe disease or high relapse risk [^115dEd6d] [^114eEYzp].

---

## Tapering strategy

Once remission is achieved, taper prednisone by **1 mg every 4 weeks** [^114kF4bm] [^114vQBFm] as tolerated, with slower tapering if relapse occurs [^116BYTxr]. Individualize the taper to disease activity, laboratory markers, and adverse events [^114kF4bm] [^114vQBFm].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with different initial doses

- **Lower doses (10–15 mg)**: Fewer side effects but higher relapse risk.
- **Higher doses (20–25 mg)**: Lower relapse risk but more side effects.
- **Optimal balance**: 15–20 mg provides effective control with manageable side effects for most patients [^115dEd6d] [^112yA2Yr].

---

## Management of inadequate response

If there is an inadequate response to the initial dose:

- **Confirm diagnosis**: Rule out mimics (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, malignancy) [^111UWJ9h] [^116jSL9c].
- **Increase dose**: Up to 25 mg if not already at the upper range [^116BYTxr] [^1164jTZr].
- **Add methotrexate**: Consider early addition for high relapse risk or prolonged therapy [^114xuhad] [^115hN5Wc].
- **Consider IL-6 inhibitors**: Tocilizumab or sarilumab for refractory or relapsing disease [^1179Q5rm] [^112ZebQ6].

---

## Side effects and risks associated with prednisone therapy

Prednisone therapy carries **significant risks**, especially at higher doses or with prolonged use:

- **Osteoporosis**: Increased fracture risk; monitor bone density and provide prophylaxis [^112dFDht] [^115PHWi9].
- **Hypertension and hyperglycemia**: Monitor blood pressure and glucose regularly [^112zPiSU].
- **Infections**: Higher susceptibility; monitor for infections [^notfound].
- **Adrenal suppression**: Risk increases with prolonged use; taper slowly [^112zPiSU].

---

## Alternative glucocorticoid regimens

Alternative regimens include **intramuscular methylprednisolone** (120 mg every 3 weeks) [^117SV1Co] [^116SWYSq], which may reduce cumulative glucocorticoid exposure and side effects, and **modified-release prednisone** (evening dosing) [^113pF4hc], which may improve morning stiffness and reduce cytokine levels, though further studies are needed [^116FGeir].

---

## Current research and controversies

Current research and controversies include **biologic therapies**, with IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab, sarilumab) showing promise for refractory or relapsing PMR [^1179Q5rm] [^112ZebQ6], and **glucocorticoid-sparing agents**, where methotrexate remains the most studied, though its role is still debated [^117MNVmQ] [^116LVv6B].

---

The standard initial prednisone dose for PMR is **12.5–25 mg daily**, with 15 mg daily most commonly used. Individualize dosing based on disease severity, relapse risk, and comorbidities, and taper by 1 mg every 4 weeks once remission is achieved.

### Discontinuation of therapies in polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis [^114tpSji]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids are highly effective in treating polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis, but their use is associated with numerous adverse events. Therefore, it is important to use them for the shortest period of time possible. The published evidence suggests that discontinuation of GC is feasible in a substantial number of patients with polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis after an adequate period of treatment, provided that glucocorticoids are tapered gradually. Recurrences are relatively infrequent in polymyalgia rheumatica and somewhat more common in giant cell arteritis. Immunosuppressive agents may be used in patients with frequently relapsing or recurring disease to decrease exposure to glucocorticoids.

EULAR/ACR 2015 polymyalgia rheumatica — glucocorticoid initiation, dosing, and tapering are specified as follows: The panel conditionally recommends using the minimum effective GC dose within a range of 12.5–25 mg prednisone equivalent daily as the initial treatment of PMR and discourages conditionally the use of initial doses ≤ 7.5 mg while strongly recommending against the use of initial doses > 30 mg/day. The panel strongly recommends individualizing dose tapering schedules and suggests initial tapering to 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent within 4–8 weeks, relapse therapy by increasing to the pre-relapse dose then decreasing gradually within 4–8 weeks, and once remission is achieved tapering daily oral prednisolone by 1 mg every 4 weeks (or by 1.25 mg decrements using schedules such as 10/7.5 mg alternate days) until discontinuation. The panel conditionally recommends considering intramuscular methylprednisolone as an alternative to oral GCs, noting one clinical trial used a starting dose of 120 mg methylprednisolone i.m. every 3 weeks, and conditionally recommends using a single rather than divided daily doses of oral GCs, with exceptions for special situations such as prominent night pain while tapering GCs.

### Polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis: rapid evidence review [^115kUxZe]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis are inflammatory conditions that occur predominantly in people 50 years and older, with peak incidence at 70 to 75 years of age. Polymyalgia rheumatica is more common and typically presents with constitutional symptoms, proximal muscle pain, and elevated inflammatory markers. Diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica is clinical, consisting of at least two weeks of proximal muscle pain, constitutional symptoms, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein. Treatment of polymyalgia rheumatica includes moderate-dose glucocorticoids with a prolonged taper. Giant cell arteritis, also known as temporal arteritis, usually presents with new-onset headache, visual disturbances or changes, constitutional symptoms, scalp tenderness, and temporal artery symptoms. Inflammatory markers are markedly elevated. Temporal arterial biopsy should be used for diagnosis. However, color duplex ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography may be helpful when biopsy is negative or unavailable. All patients with suspected giant cell arteritis should receive empiric high-dose glucocorticoids because the condition may lead to blindness if untreated. Tocilizumab is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for giant cell arteritis and should be considered in addition to glucocorticoids for initial therapy. Polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis respond quickly to appropriate dosing of glucocorticoids but typically require prolonged treatment and have high rates of relapse; therefore, monitoring for glucocorticoid-related adverse effects and symptoms of relapse is necessary. Methotrexate may be considered as an adjunct to glucocorticoids in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica or giant cell arteritis who are at high risk of relapse.

Polymyalgia rheumatica — methotrexate (MTX) with glucocorticoids (GCs) may be co-administered with oral or i.m. GCs, with evidence from four randomized controlled trials and one retrospective study of MTX plus oral GCs using initial prednisone 15 to 25 mg/day; however, randomized trials enrolled a small total sample (n = 194), a reduction in GC-related adverse events with MTX has not been demonstrated, and the panel nevertheless felt that earlier discontinuation of GC and a lower cumulative GC dose in MTX users decreases the likelihood of GC-related side effects, with studies showing moderate to high quality of evidence for benefit in remission, relapse rate, discontinuation of GC, and cumulative GC dose while very low quality evidence also indicated no benefit for some outcomes.

### What is the best treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica? [^115dEd6d]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Background: Polymyalgia rheumatica is characterized by myalgias and morning stiffness in the shoulder and pelvic girdles and neck, in addition to low-grade fever, fatigue, and weight loss. The syndrome is usually treated with long-term corticosteroids, although other agents have also been used. However, there has been no review of the evidence for current treatments. Hernández-Rodríguez and colleagues analyzed previously published studies to determine the best treatment regimen for patients with polymyalgia rheumatica. Less than 1 percent of patients required prednisone or prednisolone at starting dosages above 15 mg per day to control symptoms. Relapses were more common if the initial dosage was 10 mg per day, whereas more than 15 mg per day had a greater risk of steroid-related adverse effects without additional benefit. Up to 50 percent of patients were able to discontinue steroid use within two years when the initial prednisone dosage was 10 to 20 mg per day.

Fewer relapses occurred when steroid use was tapered slowly. Intra-articular methylprednisolone showed some benefit, but the authors believed it should be reserved for patients at high risk of glucocorticoid-related adverse effects or when polymyalgia rheumatica was limited to the shoulder girdle. Oral and intramuscular methotrexate in a dosage of 10 mg per week had steroid-sparing effects and decreased relapse rates when added to prednisone therapy. Adding infliximab to prednisone showed no benefit in newly diagnosed patients with polymyalgia rheumatica. Azathioprine added to prednisolone modestly reduced the total cumulative steroid dose required, but the results were difficult to evaluate because of the small number of patients using this approach.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that the current evidence suggests using prednisone or its equivalent at a starting dosage of 15 mg per day to control polymyalgia rheumatica activity in most patients. Slow tapering of steroid use is associated with fewer relapses and overall faster cessation of corticosteroid therapy. Of the steroid-sparing agents that were tested in this study, oral or intramuscular methotrexate added in dosages of at least 10 mg per week to prednisone therapy reduced the overall glucocorticoid requirement.

### Trajectory analysis of glucocorticoid treatment highlights issues in the current tapering strategy for polymyalgia rheumatica [^112th2zs]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we identified four longitudinal GC treatment patterns in patients with PMR. While the majority of patients exhibited controlled CRP levels, a considerable proportion did not achieve an adequate reduction in GC dose, resulting in a high incidence of GC-related toxicities. Consequently, the use of GC-sparing agents should be considered not only for patients requiring high GC doses but also for those unable to discontinue GC even at low doses. The evidence presented in this study has provided a profile of patients across the spectrum, from the low-dose to the high-dose groups, who may be eligible for GC-sparing agents.

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) — burden and need for guidance are highlighted by wide variations in treatment and substantial glucocorticoid (GC) challenges: there are wide variations in GC dosages, tapering strategies, use of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and duration of treatment; up to 29–45% of patients with PMR do not adequately respond to GCs within 3–4 weeks, GC side effects are frequently observed, occurring in around 50% of patients, and relapses and long-term GC dependency are common, supporting well considered, international recommendations to standardize practice and improve patient care.

### Modified-release prednisone for polymyalgia rheumatica: a multicentre, randomised, active-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study [^11164Dyu]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses

The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of MR prednisone administered in the evening versus IR prednisone administered in the morning, with regard to the percentage of complete responders at week 4 (primary end point). Complete response was defined as ≥ 70% improvement from baseline in PMR VAS, duration of morning stiffness and CRP (or CRP < 2×ULN)). The primary end point was analysed using logistic regression with treatment as a factor and baseline PMR VAS score, duration of morning stiffness and CRP as covariates. Non-inferiority was concluded if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI was above −15%.

The primary analysis was performed using the per protocol population (PPP) with sensitivity analysis performed using the full analysis population (FAP; all randomised patients who received ≥ 1 dose of study treatment). Assuming a complete response rate of 69%in the comparator arm at week 4, an expected treatment difference of 0%, a non-inferiority bound of −15%, 80% power and a two-sided α of 0.05, a sample size of 300 patients in the PPP (∼400 randomised patients) was required. Further methodology can be found in the online supplementary material.

### Tocilizumab beneficial for adults with persistent… [^114GBfkH]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Is tocilizumab effective for improving symptoms or reducing prednisone requirements in adults with active polymyalgia rheumatica despite ongoing glucocorticoid therapy. Bottom Line The study found that intravenous tocilizumab every four weeks for 24 weeks significantly reduced symptoms of active PMR in adults despite ongoing prednisone therapy, resulting in a greater percentage of patients with reduced prednisone requirements. Eligible patients included those who responded to 12 to 25 mg per day of prednisone to attain a CRP level of less than 10 mg per L or an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of less than 20 mm per hour but subsequently developed glucocorticoid dependency with worsening disease activity after tapering to a prednisone dosage of less than 10 mg per day.

Patients randomly received an intravenous infusion of tocilizumab every four weeks for 24 weeks or matched placebo. The primary outcome was a composite of disease activity, defined as a PMR activity score computed using the CRP level of less than 10, and a prednisone dosage of 5 mg per day or less or a prednisone dosage decrease of at least 10 mg vs. baseline. At weeks 12, 16, and 20, prednisone dosages greater than 10 mg per day were tapered by 5 mg. For patients who were already taking prednisone dosages of 10 mg per day or less and whose disease activity scores were less than 10, the prednisone dosage was decreased by 2 mg every two weeks. Individuals masked to treatment group assignment assessed outcomes.

Complete follow-up occurred for all patients at 24 weeks. Using intention-to-treat analysis, at 24 weeks the primary end point occurred significantly more often in patients treated with tocilizumab than in patients treated with placebo. No significant group differences occurred in adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation.

### Polymyalgia rheumatica [^111UWJ9h]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Polymyalgia rheumatica is an inflammatory disease that affects the shoulder, the pelvic girdles, and the neck, usually in individuals older than 50 years. Increases in acute phase reactants are typical of polymyalgia rheumatica. The disorder might present as an isolated condition or in association with giant cell arteritis. Several diseases, including inflammatory rheumatic and autoimmune diseases, infections, and malignancies can mimic polymyalgia rheumatica. Imaging techniques have identified the presence of bursitis in more than half of patients with active disease. Vascular uptake on PET scans is seen in some patients. A dose of 12.5–25.0 mg prednisolone daily or equivalent leads to rapid improvement of symptoms in most patients with isolated disease. However, relapses are common when prednisolone is tapered. Methotrexate might be used in patients who relapse. The effectiveness of biological therapies, such as anti-interleukin 6, in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica that is refractory to glucocorticoids requires further investigation. Most population-based studies indicate that mortality is not increased in patients with isolated disease.

### 2015 recommendations for the management of polymyalgia rheumatica: a European League Against Rheumatism / American College of Rheumatology collaborative initiative [^117MpuQN]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Polymyalgia rheumatica — glucocorticoid (GC) tapering principles state that equivalent objectives may be achieved by alternative tapering schedules; for example, a patient starting at a high prednisone dose (eg, 25 mg/day) may taper faster initially, whereas with a lower initial dose (eg, 12.5 mg/day) the initial dose may be kept longer before reducing. The group suggested prednisone should be tapered by 1 mg/4 weeks or similar once remission is achieved, noted that 1 mg tablets are not available in all countries, and acknowledged alternate-day reductions (eg, 10/7.5 mg on alternate days) are common clinical practice, while not fixing a schedule.

### Polymyalgia rheumatica [^116jSL9c]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Polymyalgia rheumatica is a chronic, inflammatory disorder of unknown cause that affects people over age 50 years. Classic symptoms include pain and long-term morning stiffness of the neck, shoulders, hips, upper arms, and thighs. Although markers of inflammation are often raised, no specific laboratory test exists for the disorder and the diagnosis is based on clinical assessment. Provisional classification criteria were published in April, 2012, by a collaborative initiative of the European League Against Rheumatism and the American College of Rheumatology. Several other disorders can mimic polymyalgia rheumatica. In particular, clinical manifestations can be difficult to differentiate from other forms of inflammatory arthritis such as spondyloarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Imaging studies such as ultrasonography and MRI typically show a predominantly periarticular inflammatory process. A subset of patients has an associated inflammatory vasculopathy affecting large arteries (giant cell arteritis). The standard treatment is low-dose glucocorticoids, which provide symptomatic relief for most patients. However, disease relapses are common, and treatment with glucocorticoids is associated with substantial morbidity. Improved understanding of disease pathogenesis might allow for more targeted immunotherapy.

Regarding medical management for polymyalgia rheumatica, more specifically with respect to corticosteroids, tapering, ACR/EULAR 2015 guidelines recommend to follow an individualized corticosteroid tapering schedule, predicated to regular monitoring of patient disease activity, laboratory markers and adverse events. Consider following the following principles of corticosteroid dose tapering:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Initial tapering|- Taper dose to an oral dose of 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent within 4–8 weeks|
|Treatment of relapse|- Increase oral prednisone to the pre-relapse dose and decrease it gradually to the dose at which the relapse occurred|
|Tapering once remission is achieved following initial and relapse therapies|- Taper daily oral prednisone by 1 mg every 4 weeks until discontinuation, as long as remission is maintained.|

### Evidence on treat to target strategies in polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis: a systematic literature review [^1157uyvF]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To inform an international task force about current evidence on Treat to Target (T2T) strategies in PMR and GCA.

Methods

A systematic literature research (SLR) was conducted in Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, clinicaltrials.gov from their inception date to May 2022, and in the EULAR/ACR abstract database (2019–2021). Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and non-randomised interventional studies published in English and answering at least one of the eleven PICO questions on T2T strategies, treatment targets and outcomes, framed by the taskforce, were identified. Study selection process, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently by two investigators.

Results

Of 7809 screened abstracts, 397 were selected for detailed review and 76 manuscripts were finally included (31 RCTs, eight subgroup/exploratory analyses of RCTs and 37 non-randomised interventional studies). No study comparing a T2T strategy against standard of care was identified. In PMR RCTs, the most frequently applied outcomes concerned treatment (90.9% of RCTs), particularly the cumulative glucocorticoids (GC) dose and GC tapering, followed by clinical, laboratory and safety outcomes (63.3% each). Conversely, the most commonly reported outcomes in RCTs in GCA were prevention of relapses (72.2%), remission as well as treatment-related and safety outcomes (67.0% each).

Conclusions

This SLR provides evidence and highlights the knowledge gaps on T2T strategies in PMR and GCA, informing the task force developing T2T recommendations for these diseases.

EULAR/ACR 2015 polymyalgia rheumatica — adjunctive and alternative therapies are addressed as follows: The panel strongly recommends against the use of NSAIDs in patients with PMR, with the exception of possible short-term use of NSAIDs and/or analgesics in patients with pain related to comorbid conditions. The panel conditionally recommends considering early introduction of methotrexate (MTX) in addition to GCs, particularly in patients at a high risk for relapse and/or prolonged therapy as well as in cases with risk factors, comorbidities and/or concomitant medications where GC-related adverse events are more likely to occur, and MTX has been used at oral doses of 7.5–10 mg/week in clinical trials. The panel strongly recommends against the use of TNF-α blocking agents for treatment of PMR, conditionally recommends considering an individualized exercise program aimed at the maintenance of muscle mass and function and reducing risk of falls (specifically in older persons on long-term GCs and frail patients), and strongly recommends against the use of the Chinese herbal preparations Yanghe and Biqi capsules in PMR patients.

An intramuscular option has been studied: In one randomized controlled trial, 120 mg methylprednisolone intramuscular (i.m.) injection was used every 3 weeks as a starting dose. As an adjunct, Methotrexate (MTX) has been used at doses of 7.5–10 mg/week in clinical trials, and the algorithm advises, Consider MTX if at high risk for side effects/ relapse and/or prolonged therapy. Following improvement, the algorithm specifies Gradual tapering of glucocorticoids and ultimately to Taper prednisone until discontinuation. Baseline factors associated with higher risk of relapse/prolonged therapy include high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (> 40 mm/hour) and peripheral inflammatory arthritis.

### Tocilizumab is effective against polymyalgia rheumatica: experience in 13 intractable cases [^113y447i]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is the second most common inflammatory rheumatic disease after rheumatoid arthritis, and affects older people. Despite their side effects, glucocorticoids are still the only known effective treatment, and low-dose prednisolone is normally sufficient for controlling the disease. However, when PMR recurs during prednisolone tapering, physicians are sometimes reluctant to increase prednisolone doses because of the side effects. Since interleukin 6 has been reported to play an important role in PMR, we assessed the effectiveness and safety of tocilizumab as an alternative therapeutic option for intractable PMR.

### Symptom severity and glucocorticoid dosing in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica and obesity [^112v3skq]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is an inflammatory disorder of the elderly characterized by girdle pain and stiffness. Obesity has an influence on disease activity and outcome in rheumatic diseases like osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. We aimed to investigate the relationship between high BMI and the severity and outcome of PMR, which is incompletely understood.

Methods

In a post hoc analysis, 83 patients with recent-onset PMR were studied over 6 months using clinical examination, laboratory evaluation, and girdle ultrasound (US). The modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (mHAQ), 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), and PMR visual analog scale (VAS) scores, as well as prednisone therapy data, were recorded. Patients were grouped according to their BMI.

Results

At baseline, the 12 patients with obesity had significantly more shoulder pain (P = 0.03), global pain (P = 0.03), PMR VAS (P < 0.01), and fatigue (P = 0.03); higher mHAQ (P = 0.01); and lower SF-36 physical component summary (P = 0.048) and SF-36 pain index (P < 0.001). The mean initial prednisone dose was similar among groups, but patients with obesity received a lower dose/kg (1.9 [SD 0.7] mg vs 2.2 [SD 0.7] mg; P < 0.01). At 6 months, patients with obesity were being treated with higher mean daily prednisone doses (8.5 [SD 3.2] mg/d vs 6.2 [SD 5.2] mg/d; P = 0.02), and 40% of them were receiving higher daily prednisone doses than the standard protocol compared with 14% patients without obesity (P = 0.048). Clinical features, laboratory results, and US results were similar between patients with and without obesity.

Conclusion

Obesity affects both symptom severity and prednisone utilization in patients with PMR. The reason for this may relate to different subjective pain perception rather than increased inflammation in patients with obesity. BMI should be considered when interpreting symptoms in patients with PMR and deciding their prednisone doses.

### Glucocorticoid treatment of polymyalgia rheumatica [^114M6j8Q]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids are the mainstay of treatment in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). Moreover, lower serum cortisol levels have been reported in patients with PMR, suggesting an important role of impaired hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in the pathogenesis of the disease. Therefore, a good response to glucocorticoids has been recognised as a feature of PMR, even if disagreement remains concerning an exact starting dose, duration of treatment and schedule of administration. The role of glucocorticoids in the pathogenesis of PMR, as well as the available evidence concerning different schedules of glucocorticoid treatment, including administration according to circadian rhythms, are discussed.

### Polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis: diagnosis and management [^113ptbCD]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There have been advances in the diagnosis and treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA) and polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR).

Recent Findings

Themes in PMR and GCA include classification criteria, ultrasound imaging of temporal and axillary arteries replacing biopsies for diagnosis of GCA, faster diagnosis and treatment with rapid access clinics for suspected GCA, and expanding treatment options with the goal of rapid suppression of inflammation and sparing steroids.

Summary

Treatment is aimed at suppressing inflammation quickly in both GCA and PMR. Randomized trials have demonstrated success in reducing glucocorticoids when adding advanced therapies such as interleukin 6 (IL6) inhibitors. Other treatments including Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (especially a phase 3 trial of upadacitinib at 15mg daily and secukinumab (an IL17 inhibitor) are being tested. Some uncontrolled GCA protocols are limiting glucocorticoids to initial IV pulse therapy only or rapid tapering of oral glucocorticoids with upfront treatment with tocilizumab. There is uncertainty of who should have an advanced therapy and how long to use it for and what order to consider advanced therapies when treatment fails. In PMR, studies are performed when patients cannot taper glucocorticoids effectively, whereas in GCA, advanced therapies are started with disease onset or with recurrent GCA.

### Standardised nomenclature for glucocorticoid dosages and glucocorticoid treatment regimens: current questions and tentative answers in rheumatology [^116Md2Bg]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

In rheumatology and other medical specialties there is a discrepancy between the widespread use and the imprecise designation of glucocorticoid treatment regimens. Verbal descriptions of glucocorticoid treatment regimens used in various phases of diseases vary between countries and institutions. Given this background, a workshop under the auspices of the EULAR Standing Committee on International Clinical Studies including Therapeutic Trials was held to discuss this issue and to seek a consensus on nomenclature for glucocorticoid treatment. This report summarises the panel's discussion and recognises that answers derived from consensus conferences are not definitive. Nevertheless, recommendations on glucocorticoid treatment are presented that (1) reflect current and best knowledge available and (2) take into account current clinical practice. A question-answer rationale presentation style has been chosen to convey the messages, to summarise the meeting in a readable format, and to avoid dogmatism.

### Modified-release prednisone for polymyalgia rheumatica: a multicentre, randomised, active-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study [^116FGeir]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, the complete response rate at week 4 was numerically greater with MR prednisone (53.8%) than with IR prednisone (40.9%). Non-inferiority of MR prednisone versus IR prednisone was not proven for the primary end point; however, even with only 48 patients in the PPP (vs the 300 planned), the point estimate was clearly in favour of MR prednisone and the lower 95% confidence limit was only marginally below (−15.82%) the decided non-inferiority threshold of −15%. Sensitivity analysis on the FAP supported the trend in favour of MR prednisone, and secondary efficacy results were encouraging, showing a clear consistent trend for a stronger effect of MR prednisone compared with IR prednisone. Of note, evening MR prednisone was associated with significantly greater reductions in IL-6 levels than morning IR prednisone, suggesting a more effective downregulation of night cytokine synthesis. These results are similar to findings in the CAPRA studies in RA. Consistent with the CAPRA-1 study, we observed no significant difference between MR prednisone and IR prednisone on other inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR).

The study experienced a higher than expected screen failure rate (50%), primarily due to patients demonstrating lower CRP values not fulfilling the strict inclusion criteria when referred. It appears that in suspected PMR, primary care practitioners are willing to refer GC-naïve only patients with mild elevation or normal levels of inflammatory markers. However, it is likely that this population may contain predominantly non-inflammatory PMR mimics.

The CAPRA studies have already confirmed that optimising the timing of GC administration improves the benefit:risk ratio of low-dose GC treatment in RA, and the open-label extension of the CAPRA-1 studyand other publicationsconfirmed positive long-term effects. A recent clinical experimental study further supports the use of chronotherapy in PMR. Although the formal criteria of non-inferiority were not met, our study showed a clear trend for a favourable clinical effect of MR prednisone over IR prednisone in patients with PMR. Further confirmation should be sought from a large clinical trial in patients with PMR, with careful consideration of inclusion and response criteria, based on the present study experience.

Objective

An unmet need exists for glucocorticoid-sparing treatments for patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). The antibody-drug conjugate ABBV-154 comprises adalimumab conjugated to a glucocorticoid receptor modulator. We evaluated ABBV-154 versus placebo in patients with glucocorticoid-dependent PMR.

Methods

In this phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study, eligible patients had confirmed PMR, glucocorticoid response and two or more unequivocal PMR flares while tapering glucocorticoids and still on ≥ 5 mg daily prednisone equivalent. Randomized patients received subcutaneous placebo or ABBV-154 40, 150, or 340 mg once every other week. The primary efficacy endpoint was time to flare. The sponsor voluntarily terminated the study early.

Results

Overall, 181 patients were randomized (placebo, n = 50; ABBV-154: 40 mg, n = 42; 150 mg, n = 45; 340 mg, n = 44), and 67.4% completed study drug at week 24. Time to flare was longer for patients receiving ABBV-154 than those receiving placebo, with Kaplan-Meier estimate of 24-week flare-free rate being lower for placebo. The hazard ratios of ABBV-154 versus placebo were 0.49 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27–0.88), P = 0.017 for 40 mg; 0.44 (95% CI, 0.25–0.79), P = 0.006 for 150 mg; 0.20 (95% CI, 0.09–0.42), P < 0.001 for 340 mg. Incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events were similar between groups, and the most common across ABBV-154 cohorts was COVID-19 (16.0%).

Conclusion

Treatment effects were observed for ABBV-154 cohorts compared with placebo for time to flare. ABBV-154 was generally well tolerated. Due to early study termination, results should be interpreted with caution.

### Modified-release prednisone for polymyalgia rheumatica: a multicentre, randomised, active-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study [^113pF4hc]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of modified-release (MR) versus immediate-release (IR) prednisone in newly diagnosed glucocorticoid (GC)-naïve patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR).

Methods

Patients were randomised to double-blind MR prednisone (taken at approximately 22:00) or IR prednisone (taken in the morning), 15mg/day for 4weeks. The primary end point was complete response rate (≥ 70% reduction in PMR visual analogue scale, duration of morning stiffness and C reactive protein (CRP) (or CRP < 2× upper limit of normal (ULN))) at week 4. Non-inferiority was decided if the lower 95% confidence limit (MR vs IR prednisone) was above -15%. 400 patients were planned but only 62 were enrolled due to difficulties in recruiting GC-naïve patients with PMR with CRP ≥ 2×ULN.

Results

The percentage of complete responders at week 4 was numerically greater for MR prednisone (53.8%) than for IR prednisone (40.9%). Non-inferiority of MR versus IR prednisone was not proven in the primary analysis on the per protocol population (N = 48; treatment difference: 12.22%; 95% CI -15.82% to 40.25%). However, sensitivity analysis on the full analysis population showed an evident trend favouring MR prednisone (N = 62; treatment difference: 15.56%; 95% CI -9.16% to 40.28%). Adverse events were generally mild and transient with no unexpected safety observations.

Conclusions

The study showed a clear trend for favourable short-term efficacy of MR prednisone versus IR prednisone in early treatment of PMR. Further studies are warranted.

Treatment

Oral GCs

The cornerstone in the treatment of PMR is oral GCs. All PMR symptoms usually respond promptly to GCs. The recommended daily starting prednisolone dose in PMR is 12.5–25 mg according to the most recent ACR/EULAR recommendation. This recommendation is based on consensus, as dose‐finding studies have been limited, with partly conflicting evidence. A starting dose of 20 mg is superior to 10 mg but at a cost of more adverse events. The choice within the interval of 12.5–25 mg should consider inflammatory activity, risk of relapse and risk of GC toxicity due to comorbidities such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease. The prednisolone dose should be gradually tapered by about 2.5 mg per month down to 10 mg per day, after which slower tapering continues. In patients with typical clinical presentation and clinical findings for PMR, prompt response to treatment provides additional support for the diagnosis. Similarly, a poor response to initiated treatment should lead to reconsideration of possible differential diagnoses, especially other rheumatic diseases or malignancy. GC treatment should be accompanied by supportive measures to minimize long‐term toxicity such as osteoporosis.

Overall, the prognosis for PMR is good and usually, the disease heals in a couple of years, during which GC must be taken to control the disease and its symptoms. Some patients have a more complicated course with some residual inflammation during treatment and recurrence of symptoms when trying to reduce the prednisolone dose. There are no validated guidelines on the optimal duration of GC therapy in PMR and data available in studies are not consistent. In a study by Healey, only 30% of patients were able to stop GC therapy and remain asymptomatic within 2 years of follow‐up while only 2% were able to stop GC completely within 6 months. In a meta‐analysis by Floris et al. including 21 studies eligible for analysis, 77%, 51% and 25% were still on GC after 1, 2 and 5 years from diagnosis.

### Tocilizumab is effective against polymyalgia rheumatica: experience in 13 intractable cases [^116BQajF]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

When tocilizumab is initiated for patients with relapsed PMR, we recommend that tocilizumab be added without simultaneously increasing glucocorticoid doses, in order to ascertain whether tocilizumab is effective against the relapsed PMR. During tocilizumab treatment, it is somewhat difficult to recognise relapses of PMR early because inflammatory responses are masked by tocilizumab. When remission of PMR is obtained with tocilizumab, inflammatory response is completely suppressed in most cases (eg, CRP < 0.01 mg/dL). On the other hand, when PMR does not remit or is about to relapse during tocilizumab treatment, CRP levels are slightly increased, even though they remain within normal limits. Besides laboratory data, patients' symptoms and clinical examinations are important in identifying the relapse. As long as remission is maintained with tocilizumab, we may reduce the dose of tocilizumab or lengthen the infusion interval. Because of the lack of consistent evidence, however, it still remains unclear when to start tapering the tocilizumab dose, how to taper it, and when to discontinue it. In the present study, we tapered daily prednisolone by 1.3 mg every 4 weeks on average, which is faster than the suggested tapering rate for prednisone (1 mg decrements per 4 weeks) in the 2015 recommendations by EULAR and ACR.

### Trajectory analysis of glucocorticoid treatment highlights issues in the current tapering strategy for polymyalgia rheumatica [^113nMpb6]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

The GC-related toxicities in the low-dose group appeared to be at a similar level to those in the intermediate-dose group, which is consistent with the occurrence of toxicity even at low doses. A previous meta-analysis reported that long-term GC use occurred in 51% of patients with PMR at 2 years and 25% at 5 years. Insufficient dose reduction in the study patients may lead to prolonged GC use and a further increase in cumulative GC doses.

The strength of this study lies in its identification of longitudinal GC dose patterns in patients with PMR using GBTM, which highlights trajectory-based patient populations and their characteristics, as well as those who may benefit from additional interventions. The GBTM in this study identified a group of patients with a high incidence of GC-related toxicities even at low and intermediate GC doses, as well as patients who are refractory to high GC doses. The intermediate-dose and high-dose groups should be considered for GC-sparing agents in the early phase of treatment. The low-dose group may be considered for GC-sparing agents after distinguishing it from the rapidly declining group based on whether or not the patients achieve early GC-free status. The cumulative incidence of immunosuppressant administration was low, barely surpassing 10% even in the high-dose group, consistent with a previous study. In a US cohort study, MTX was administered in approximately 20% of patients and anti-IL-6 agents were used in less than 3% of patients from 1 to 2 years after initiation of GC treatment. PMR guidelines recommend the use of MTX in patients with relapses, poor response to GC or GC-related toxicities. However, MTX use is not covered by insurance for PMR and it should be administered with caution in older patients due to high risk of adverse events. Given that the efficacy and safety profile of MTX remains unclear for PMR, the results of a phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (PMR MODE) evaluating the efficacy and safety of early MTX useare awaited. Monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-6 receptor α chain, tocilizumab and sarilumab have been reported to be effective in refractory PMR, with sarilumab receiving Food and Drug Administration approval in March 2023. While further studies on the efficacy and safety of DMARDs including MTX and IL-6 inhibitors for PMR are needed from a precision medicine perspective, this study suggests a potential PMR population requiring GC-sparing strategies.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-mediated polymyalgia rheumatica versus primary polymyalgia rheumatica: comparison of disease characteristics and treatment requirement [^117KTHPN]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Treatment requirements for PMR were evaluated in the 15 patients with ICI-PMR and the 37 patients with primary PMR from the main cohort. Four patients with ICI-PMR (27%) could be managed without any oral glucocorticoid treatment. Two of these patients received an intramuscular depot and/or local injection of glucocorticoids, whereas the other two patients received no glucocorticoids at all for their ICI-PMR. Among the 37 patients with primary PMR, three patients were excluded from the analysis due to limited follow-up data. Four out of 37 patients (10.8%) were not treated with oral glucocorticoids: two patients were managed with intramuscular injections of glucocorticoids; and two patients refused any glucocorticoid treatment.

Next, glucocorticoid requirements were evaluated in the remaining patients with ICI-PMR (n = 11) and primary PMR (n = 30), who had been monitored after initiation of oral glucocorticoid treatment. The median prednisolone starting dose (or equivalent glucocorticoid dose) in the primary PMR group was 15 mg/day, and 7.5 mg/day in the ICI-PMR group. The effective prednisolone dose (i.e. the highest dose necessary to induce a remission) did not exceed 10 mg/day in seven out of 11 patients with ICI-PMR (64%). Moreover, the four patients receiving prednisolone > 10 mg/day (max. 15 mg/day) did so for a relatively short period, namely: 2 days, 16 days, 24 days and 30 days, respectively. The height of the prednisolone dose at most time points during follow-up was typically lower in the ICI-PMR group, when compared with the primary PMR group (Fig. 2A). Consequently, patients with ICI-PMR received a lower cumulative glucocorticoid dose than those with primary PMR (Fig. 2B).

Briefly, eligible patients were those with ≥ 50 years of age between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2019 diagnosed with PMR (online supplemental table S1), with a subsequent visit for PMR between 30 and 365 days after the initial diagnosis, and with a first GC prescription of 5– < 30 mg prednisolone equivalent per day (online supplemental table S2)within 180 days after the initial PMR diagnosis date. GC doses of 30 mg prednisolone equivalent per day or more were used to exclude patients with diseases other than PMR as part of a post hoc criterion. The cohort entry date, defined as the date of the first GC prescription, was set as day 0 and was required to occur between 1 January 2010, and 450 days before the end of data collection at each medical institution. All patients were required to have continuous enrolment in the database for at least 180 days prior to cohort entry and to have a record of CRP > 10 mg/L and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) > 30 mm/h within 30 days prior to cohort entry. In this study, the inclusion criteria of the previous study requiring CRP levels and/or ESR results within 90–365 days after cohort entry were not applied to perform trajectory modelling based on GC treatment in clinical practice. Patients with a prescription for GCs ≥ 7.5 mg/day and medications within 180 days prior to cohort entry, or those with defined baseline conditions including autoimmune diseases, diseases requiring high-dose GCs such as malignant diseases during the period from 180 days prior to cohort entry through the end of follow-up, were excluded from this study. Patients who had test results for rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) and tested positive for either at any time from before cohort entry through the end of follow-up period were also excluded. Detailed criteria are shown in online supplemental table S1.

CRP level over time and events of increase or decrease in GC dose

The median CRP levels promptly decreased in the rapidly declining, low-dose and intermediate-dose groups, falling to 4.8–6.8 mg/L at week 2 and 2.3–4.9 mg/L at week 4 (online supplemental figure S3 and table S9). In the high-dose group, the median CRP level gradually decreased to 10.3 mg/L at week 2 and 6.0 mg/L at week 4, and was relatively well controlled, ranging from 1.6 to 6.9 mg/L after week 8. CRP levels in the rapidly declining group often exceeded 10 mg/L after week 16, though this was measured in less than 20% of patients in this group.

The incidence rates of increase in daily GC dose were higher in the high-dose (2.9, [95% CI, 2.4 to 3.4] person-year) and low-dose (1.9, [95% CI, 1.7 to 2.1] person-year) groups compared with the rapidly declining (0.8, [95% CI, 0.6 to 1.1] person-year) and intermediate-dose (1.3, [95% CI, 1.2 to 1.5] person-year) groups (figure 3A and online supplemental table S10). In contrast, the incidence rates of decrease in daily GC dose increased along with the trajectory of GC dose.

### Management guidelines and outcome measures in polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) [^114i8MNu]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a common inflammatory rheumatic disease of the elderly that is subject to wide variations in clinical practice and is managed both in the primary and secondary care settings by general practitioners, rheumatologists and non-rheumatologists. Considerable uncertainty exists relating to diagnosis, management and outcome in patients with PMR. The guidelines presented here seek to improve outcomes for PMR patients by outlining a process to ensure more accurate diagnosis and timely specialist referral. The guidelines are directed to promote more conservative treatment and to ensure early bone protection in order to reduce the common morbidity of osteoporotic fractures. Furthermore, these guidelines specify the goals of treatment, including clinical and patient-based outcomes, and provide advice concerning monitoring for disease activity and complications.

### Long-term follow-up of polymyalgia rheumatica patients treated with methotrexate and steroids [^116LVv6B]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

A series of patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) who received the steroid-sparing combination therapy, prednisone and methotrexate (MTX), underwent a long-term follow-up study at five years to investigate possible reductions of steroid-related side effects. Additional end-points were the number of patients still in need of steroid treatment, the cumulative steroid dose, and the number of flare-ups of PMR.

Patients and Methods

Fifty-seven PMR patients who were enrolled in a double-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial on the efficacy of MTX added to standard steroid treatment were reviewed after 5 years. Information was collected on the patients' previous health conditions or causes of death through a standardized questionnaire by direct visit, chart review, or interviews with relatives.

Results

After 6 years from initiation of therapy, MTX-treated patients had lower ESR (17.1 ± 9.7 mm/h vs. 26.8 ± 22.9 mm/h, p = 0.08) and CRP (2.7 ± 2.3 mg/L vs. 10.2 ± 16.4 mg/L, p = 0.04). 31% MTX-treated patients were still on steroids in comparison with 39.3% controls. The mean cumulative dosage of prednisone in MTX-treated patients was 2.6 ± 3.8 g in comparison with 3.2 ± 4.1 g for controls (p = 0.6). PMR flare-ups were seen in 30.8% of MTX-treated patients and in 44.4% of controls (p = 0.39). During the follow-up, 58 and 55 side effects were observed in MTX-treated patients and in controls, respectively.

Conclusions

MTX-treated patients showed slightly less residual inflammation than controls, with the same incidence of steroid-related side effects. PMR is not a benign condition, as often reported, since one third of patients need steroid treatment for more than 6 years.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Study design and treatment

AIM‐PMR (study M20‐370; NCT04972968) was a phase 2, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, dose‐ranging study conducted September 9, 2021, to July 24, 2023, across 70 centers in Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States. The sponsor voluntarily terminated the study on April 27, 2023, after review of interim data and determining that ABBV‐154 did not demonstrate an adequately differentiated benefit‐risk profile compared with available therapies. Development of ABBV‐154 was discontinued based on the totality of data reviewed from studies on PMR, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn disease. The study was terminated before the planned primary analysis, which would have occurred after all patients had completed the week 24 visit or withdrawn from the study.

Per the study protocol, patients were randomized to treatment arms in a 2:1:1:1 ratio of placebo administered subcutaneously (SC) or ABBV‐154 SC once every other week in 40‐mg, 150‐mg, or 340‐mg doses. All patients received study drug in combination with an identical glucocorticoid taper (see Supplementary Table 1). The protocol was amended (February 2022) to a randomization ratio of 1:1:1:1 for each treatment arm, thereby decreasing the number of patients randomized to placebo. At baseline, patients received the same dose of oral prednisone/prednisolone (5–15 mg/day, rounded to the nearest milligram [provided by the sponsor]) as they had received immediately before the baseline visit. Beginning at week 3, all patients tapered glucocorticoid per identical schedules (Supplementary Table 1), based on the baseline glucocorticoid dose, to reach 0 mg/day by week 24. Patients remained off glucocorticoids unless a confirmed PMR flare occurred. Study visits occurred at baseline, week 1, week 2, and every other week for 52 weeks (per protocol), with a safety follow‐up visit performed approximately 70 days after the last study drug dose.

The independent ethics committee or institutional review board at each study site reviewed and approved the study protocol, informed consent forms, and recruitment materials before patient enrollment. The study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference for Harmonisation guidelines, applicable regulations, and the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent before screening or undergoing any study‐specific procedures.

### Infliximab plus prednisone or placebo plus prednisone for the initial treatment of polymyalgia rheumatica: a randomized trial [^116c4MdE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

A reliable alternative to steroids for treating polymyalgia rheumatica has not yet been identified. Although infliximab has been used occasionally in steroid-resistant cases, its efficacy has not been demonstrated in a controlled study.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of prednisone plus infliximab with that of prednisone plus placebo in patients with newly diagnosed polymyalgia rheumatica.

Design

Randomized, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

7 rheumatology clinics in Italy.

Patients

51 patients with newly diagnosed polymyalgia rheumatica. Patients with associated giant cell arteritis and those who had been previously treated with steroids or biological or immunosuppressive agents were excluded.

Intervention

Initial therapy with oral prednisone tapered from 15 mg/d to 0 mg/d over 16 weeks according to a standard protocol, plus infusions of placebo or infliximab, 3 mg/kg of body weight, at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, and 22.

Measurements

The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of patients without relapse or recurrence through week 52. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients no longer taking prednisone, the number of relapses and recurrences, the duration of prednisone therapy, and the cumulative prednisone dose.

Results

Four patients (3 in the infliximab group and 1 in the placebo group) did not complete the trial. The proportion of patients who were free of relapse and recurrence at 52 weeks did not differ between groups (6 of 20 patients [30%] in the infliximab group vs. 10 of 27 patients [37%] in the placebo group; adjusted risk difference, -3 percentage points [95% CI, -31 to 24 percentage points]; P = 0.80). In a sensitivity analysis that included dropouts, the best-case scenario yielded a difference of 5 percentage points (CI, -21 to 31 percentage points) between the groups. The secondary outcomes at weeks 22 and 52 did not differ between the groups.

Limitations

The study had a small sample and a short follow-up. A low dosage of infliximab was used, and the prednisone dosage was rapidly tapered.

Conclusions

Although too small to be definitive, the trial provides evidence that adding infliximab to prednisone for treating newly diagnosed polymyalgia rheumatica is of no benefit and may be harmful. If there is benefit, it is unlikely to be large. Australian Clinical Trials Registry number: ACTRN012606000205538.

### Methotrexate treatment in large vessel vasculitis and polymyalgia rheumatica [^115HjxWp]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

In large vessel vasculitis, including giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis, as well as in polymyalgia rheumatica, glucocorticoid therapy is the treatment of choice. However, there are two situations/questions for additional immunosuppressive therapies in these diseases: (i) therapy resistance to glucocorticoid mono-therapy; (ii) situations which call for sparing of glucocorticoids such as in complications of glucocorticoid therapy. This review summarises the current scientific debate on the effects of methotrexate in these diseases. Methotrexate at 10–15 mg/week appears to have a modest and delayed effect in GCA and PMR in reducing relapse rate and lowering the cumulative dose of glucocorticoid therapy. However, superiority of combination therapy in reducing the incidence of glucocorticoid-related complications has not been shown yet. The effects of higher doses and long-time effects as well as the efficacy in patients with glucocorticoid-resistance and complications are unclear. Methotrexate may thus be considered as adjunctive therapy to glucocorticoid therapy in glucocorticoid-resistance or complications. Further attempts should be made for a better identification of patients with glucocorticoid-refractory courses and a more precise formulation of guidelines on indication, optimal dosing and duration.

Patients and eligibility criteria

Enrolled patients (aged ≥ 50 years) met the 2012 EULAR/ACR provisional classification criteria for PMRand had a confirmed PMR diagnosis. Eligible patients must have experienced a clinical response to glucocorticoids following PMR diagnosis and must have had two or more episodes of unequivocal PMR flare while attempting to taper glucocorticoids (prednisone dose ≥ 5 mg/day or equivalent at the time of flare and the most recent flare within 24 weeks of baseline). Unequivocal PMR flare was defined as clinical signs and symptoms of PMR (shoulder and/or hip girdle pain with inflammatory stiffness, neck pain with inflammatory stiffness, or new or worsened limited range of motion in the hips and/or shoulders) resulting in increased glucocorticoid dose. Inflammatory stiffness associated with flares was determined by the expert clinical judgments of the investigators based on patient‐reported symptoms and findings on physical examination; however, the study protocol did not specify any assessment of specific markers of inflammation. Patients must not have exhibited any clinical signs or symptoms of PMR within two weeks of baseline. They must have received a stable glucocorticoid dose (prednisone 5–15 mg/day or equivalent) for two or more weeks before baseline and must not have been treated with a prior TNF antagonist. Patients with giant cell arteritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory arthritis not due to PMR, or a positive test for anticitrullinated protein were ineligible.

RESULTS

Patients

Overall, 235 patients were screened; 181 patients were randomized and dosed (placebo, n = 50; ABBV‐154: 40 mg, n = 42; 150 mg, n = 45; 340 mg, n = 44) (Figure 1). Furthermore, 67.4% of patients completed study drug to week 24; the most common reason for study drug discontinuation was termination of the study by the sponsor (n = 40 [22.1%]). In total, 19.3% of patients completed study drug to week 52, with termination of the study by the sponsor remaining the most common reason for discontinuation from study drug for 112 (61.9%) patients.

Patient disposition during the double‐blind treatment period (full analysis set).

The mean overall age (69.4 years) of patients was relatively balanced between treatment groups (Table 1). Most patients were female (64.6%) and White (87.8%). The median overall duration of PMR was 1.6 years; 59.6% of patients reported their most recent flare within ≤ 12 weeks of baseline. Most patients (61.3%) had received glucocorticoid treatment for PMR more than one year before baseline, and the median glucocorticoid dose was 10 mg/day at baseline.

### Rheumatology: what you may have missed in 2023 [^115PHWi9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Many patients with rheumatologic conditions receive care from physicians other than rheumatologists. Here we note key findings from 6 studies in rheumatology published in 2023 that offer valuable insights for internal medicine specialists and subspecialists outside of rheumatology. The first study investigated the effect of low-dose glucocorticoids on patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) over 2 years and challenged existing perceptions about the risks of glucocorticoids in this setting. The second study focused on the updated guideline for preventing and treating glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. With the chronic and widespread use of glucocorticoids, the American College of Rheumatology emphasized the importance of assessing fracture risk and initiating pharmacologic therapy when appropriate. The third study explored the potential use of methotrexate in treating inflammatory hand osteoarthritis, suggesting a novel approach to managing this challenging and common condition. The results of the fourth article we highlight suggest that sarilumab has promise as an adjunct treatment of polymyalgia rheumatica relapse during glucocorticoid dosage tapering. The fifth study evaluated sublingual cyclobenzaprine for fibromyalgia treatment, noting both potential benefits and risks. Finally, the sixth article is a systematic review and meta-analysis that assessed the therapeutic equivalence of biosimilars and reference biologics in the treatment of patients with RA. Knowledge of this recent literature will be useful to clinicians regardless of specialty who care for patients with these commonly encountered conditions.

### Recognition and management of polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis [^113s5jgk]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Polymyalgia rheumatica affects proximal muscles and joints, causing disability in older adults. Giant cell arteritis affects medium and large arteries and can result in blindness. These conditions overlap significantly, often occurring together. Despite the similarities, each has distinct symptoms, corticosteroid dosing requirements, and prognosis. The hallmark of both conditions is inflammation. Polymyalgia rheumatica primarily affects the shoulders, neck, and hips with prominent bilateral pain. Systemic findings such as fatigue and weight loss are common, and there is no definitive diagnostic test. Moderate-dose corticosteroid therapy with a slow taper rapidly resolves symptoms. Management of patients responding to treatment can occur in the primary care setting, if there is no concomitant giant cell arteritis. The clinical presentation of giant cell arteritis varies widely, from new-onset headache and constitutional symptoms, to jaw claudication, to less common isolated visual changes and upper extremity claudication. Treatment requires higher dosages of corticosteroids and urgent referral to a rheumatologist. Relapse is common in both diseases. Surveillance is important, as is monitoring for long-term complications of corticosteroid use. Osteoporosis management and gastrointestinal ulcer prophylaxis should be initiated. The primary care physician's coordination of care with a rheumatologist and with other subspecialists, if needed, is essential in the management of giant cell arteritis.

Introduction

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is an inflammatory rheumatic disease that affects adults aged ≥ 50 years and causes severe pain and stiffness in the shoulders, neck and pelvic girdle. Systemic glucocorticoids (GCs) are the first-line treatment for PMR. The initial GC dose for PMR varies among patients, usually ranging from 12.5 to 25 mg/day of prednisolone equivalents. In clinical practice, the GC dose is determined based on disease activity and the risk of GC-related toxicities.

GC treatment typically provides rapid symptom relief. The dose is then reduced, maintained or increased depending on disease activity, with the goal of discontinuation. However, some patients demonstrate refractory or incomplete disease control, and others experience relapse after GC reduction or discontinuation, leading to prolonged treatment. Risk factors for relapse include female sex, high levels of inflammatory markers, high GC dose and rapid dose reduction. Disease relapse often necessitates long-term GC use.

Prolonged GC treatment in patients with PMR is a significant concern, as cumulative GC doses result in GC-related toxicities. The ageing population is increasing in developed countries, and patients with PMR are predominantly individuals aged ≥ 70 years. Therefore, the management of the older patients, who are vulnerable to GC-related toxicities, is particularly important. Appropriate initial dosing, gradual dose reduction and use of GC-sparing agents may help mitigate the risks of GC-related toxicities. Although the risk benefit should be taken into consideration, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate (MTX), are often used as GC-sparing agents. Recently, interleukin (IL)−6 targeting therapies, which play a key role in the pathophysiology of PMR, have shown efficacy.

However, few studies have classified patients with PMR into clinically meaningful groups based on GC dosing patterns over time. Group-based trajectory modelling (GBTM), which identifies groups with similar longitudinal outcome patterns, is suitable for analysing dynamic GC dose trajectories. Characterising the patient profiles in each trajectory group could guide healthcare providers in deciding when to initiate GC-sparing interventions.

In this study, we hypothesised that patients with PMR could be classified according to GC treatment patterns. We applied GBTM to classify patients into groups based on longitudinal GC dose trajectories. We then characterised each group's patient profile by analysing C-reactive protein (CRP) levels over 52 weeks, the use of immunosuppressants and the incidence of GC-related toxicities to identify those in need of GC-sparing agents.

INTRODUCTION

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is an inflammatory rheumatic disease characterized by shoulder, neck, and hip pain and morning stiffness.EULAR and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) treatment guidelines for PMR recommend oral glucocorticoids (prednisone or equivalent) for the shortest effective duration with individualized dose‐tapering after achieving remission. Unfortunately, glucocorticoid reduction can lead to PMR flares, resulting in continued long‐term glucocorticoid use and potential glucocorticoid‐associated morbidity. In one meta‐analysis (> 2,000 patients), glucocorticoid usage was 77%, 51%, and 25% at one, two, and five years, respectively. In a registry study of 16,703 patients with PMR in the United States, 64% were still receiving glucocorticoids beyond one year. Higher mean cumulative glucocorticoid doses are associated with adverse events (AEs) such as osteoporosis (P < 0.0001), fragility fractures (P < 0.0001), and arterial hypertension (P = 0.01), especially in patients receiving glucocorticoids for more than two years. Long‐term glucocorticoid use has been associated with development of hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and other metabolic effects.

Although interleukin‐6 receptor antagonists (sarilumab or tocilizumab) or methotrexate are used to treat patients with PMR, glucocorticoids remain the primary treatment option. Thus, an unmet need exists for glucocorticoid‐sparing treatments for PMR, but PMR pathophysiology remains poorly defined, making identifying potential therapeutic targets a challenge.

ABBV‐154 is a novel antibody‐drug conjugate (ADC) comprising adalimumab (a human monoclonal anti–tumor necrosis factor [TNF]) antibody) conjugated to a proprietary glucocorticoid receptor modulator (GRM payload; an agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor that stimulates anti‐inflammatory glucocorticoid‐like effects). By delivering the GRM payload to cells expressing transmembrane TNF, including activated immune cells, ABBV‐154 was designed to reduce systemic glucocorticoid exposure and risks of related side effects. ABBV‐154 has been evaluated for PMR, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn disease in phase 2 clinical trials. Although elevated levels of TNF were reported in symptomatic patients with PMR, studies of anti‐TNF treatments have yielded mixed results, leaving the role of TNF in the disease pathology unclear. Therefore, the primary mechanism of action of ABBV‐154 is expected via the anti‐inflammatory effects of the intracellular GRM payload.

### Modified-release prednisone for polymyalgia rheumatica: a multicentre, randomised, active-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study [^1157FUdm]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Secondary end points

A clear consistent trend for a larger favourable effect of MR prednisone compared with IR prednisone was observed for all secondary end points (except CRP and ESR) at weeks 1 and 4 (table 2). The percentage of responders (patients with ≥ 70% improvement from baseline) was also greater for MR prednisone than for IR prednisone at weeks 1 and 4 for all secondary end points (see online supplementary table S2). Clinically significant mean reductions and treatment differences of more than 10 points in favour of MR prednisone were observed for PMR VAS, global pain VAS and shoulder pain VAS (table 2). MR prednisone was markedly more effective than IR prednisone in reducing morning stiffness duration from as early as week 1 (mean reduction of 326 vs 160 min, table 2), which was supported by the percentage of responders (44% vs 17%, online supplementary table S2).

Table 2
Secondary efficacy results (full analysis population)

MR prednisone indicated good efficacy in reducing IL-6 levels compared with IR prednisone at week 4 (decrease from baseline of −37.4 vs −29.8 pg/mL, table 2). Notable reductions in CRP and ESR were observed in both treatment groups, with a larger decrease for IR prednisone (although we noted that baseline CRP values were higher in the IR prednisone group, and mean CRP values at week 4 were lower for MR prednisone (8.4 mg/L) than for IR prednisone (17.9 mg/L)).

Safety

The AEs reported during the study are presented in online supplementary table S3. While more patients experienced AEs in the MR prednisone group (19 (59%); 8 (25%) related) than the IR prednisone group (9 (30%); 3 (10%) related), this was not driven by any specific AEs and the majority of subjects in both treatment groups experienced non-related AEs. Two patients experienced serious AEs (pancytopenia and temporal arteritis), which were not treatment-related. Three patients prematurely discontinued due to AEs: upper abdominal pain in the MR prednisone group and temporal arteritis and burning sensation in the IR prednisone group (figure 1).

### Trajectory analysis of glucocorticoid treatment highlights issues in the current tapering strategy for polymyalgia rheumatica [^116YroHy]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

The patient characteristics in the rapidly declining and low-dose groups shared common features, including low CRP levels, a higher proportion of older patients and more comorbidities at baseline. Both groups started with an observed median GC dose of 10 mg/day. However, the rapidly declining group experienced a relatively rapid reduction in GC dose to a median of 3.7 mg/day at week 4 and 0 mg/day at week 8, while the low-dose group reduced the GC dose to 8 mg/day at week 4 and 6.8 mg/day at week 8. These groups can be considered to have low disease activity, given the relatively low baseline CRP levels; however, they may be regarded as being at high risk for GC-related toxicities. Notably, the low-dose group had higher cumulative GC doses and more GC-related toxicities compared with the rapidl -declining group. This suggests that the low-dose group may include patients who require long-term GC treatment, and appropriate additional interventions, such as GC-sparing agents, may be necessary to reduce GC-related toxicities. The proportion of patients in the rapidly declining group who achieved a GC dose of 0 mg/day was 19% in this study, compared with just 3% of patients who achieved GC-free remission in a previous study. This difference may be attributed to the variations in the definition of outcomes, specifically the presence or absence of criteria regarding inflammatory markers (CRP value < 3.0 mg/L, ESR value < 15 mm/h). This reveals that patients treated with an initial low GC dose may either achieve a GC-free status or require prolonged GC administration, which would be distinguished by differences in the trajectory of GC tapering.

### Methotrexate and polymyalgia rheumatica therapy… [^113E6jEs]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Polymyalgia rheumatica, a syndrome characterized by proximal muscle pain and stiffness in older persons, generally is treated with prednisone. Dosages of 15 to 25 mg of prednisone per day can reduce inflammation considerably, although many patients relapse when therapy is tapered. Long-term steroid treatment has been recommended by several studies, but this can result in multiple side effects, including osteoporosis, hypertension, cataracts, and hyperglycemia. Seventy-two patients with polymyalgia rheumatica and no contraindications to prednisone or methotrexate were given prednisone at a daily dosage of 25 mg for four weeks, tapering to 17. 5 mg,
12. 5 mg, 7. 5 mg, 5 mg, and
2. 5 mg during the following five four-week periods.
3. Patients were assessed regularly during the 76 weeks of the study.

Medications were withdrawn from patients if there was a significant decrease in their leukocyte or platelet count or a significant increase in their serum creatinine or transaminase levels. The authors conclude that using prednisone and methotrexate together to treat polymyalgia rheumatica can decrease the number of flare-ups and reduce the total dosage of prednisone required to achieve and maintain remission. Considering the potential adverse effects of long-term prednisone therapy, this would be advantageous to all patients, especially those who cannot tolerate high doses of prednisone. Further studies are needed to determine whether methotrexate is effective as an induction therapy for polymyalgia rheumatica, and whether it can lower the initial dose of prednisone needed for treatment and control. Also, the absence of increased steroid morbidity in the higher-dose prednisone plus placebo group makes the clinical significance of this minimal prednisone dose reduction unclear.

Lastly, the lack of difference in disease flare-ups during the first 24 weeks when all participants were taking prednisone, and the occurrence of flare-ups in the methotrexate group after prednisone was withdrawn, seems to demonstrate that this effectiveness was caused by prednisone alone rather than the combination. Perhaps the continuation of the lowest effective dose of prednisone would be the best and simplest treatment. Stone concludes that methotrexate may be useful for patients who do not tolerate even low doses of glucocorticoids, but the combination requires further study. — r. s.

Associations between patient characteristics and GC treatment patterns

The proportion of females was similar among groups (54.4%–59.6%) (table 1). The median age was 81.0 years (IQR, 76.0–86.0) in the rapidly declining group, 79.0 (IQR, 73.0–86.0) in the low-dose group, 78.0 years (IQR, 72.0–83.0) in the intermediate-dose group and 75.5 years (IQR, 69.0–84.5) in the high-dose group. The proportion of patients aged ≥ 80 years was higher in the rapidly declining (58.1%), low-dose (46.7%), and intermediate-dose (44.2%) groups than in the high-dose group (28.8%). In particular, the proportion of patients aged ≥ 90 years was higher in the rapidly declining and low-dose groups (16.3% and 13.2%, respectively) than in the intermediate-dose and high-dose groups (2.7% and 1.9%, respectively) (figure 2A). The median CRP level at baseline was 48.2 mg/L (IQR, 20.4–93.4) in the rapidly declining group, 50.0 mg/L (IQR, 23.3–83.9) in the low-dose group, 69.4 mg/L (IQR, 35.0–113.5) in the intermediate-dose group, and 102.5 mg/L (IQR, 48.3–141.4) in the high-dose group, with levels increasing with the GC dose (figure 2B). The OR for T3 in the high-dose group was 2.43 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11 to 5.33), supporting the higher CRP level in this group (table 2).

### Risk of fracture among patients with polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis: a population-based study [^113EGbeM]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The finding that fracture risk in PMR and GCA is similar is surprising given that considerably lower dose glucocorticoids are recommended for PMR than for GCA. If the UK guidelines for typical dosing and duration of glucocorticoid are followed, a patient with PMR would be expected to receive half the cumulative dose of steroids as compared to the cumulative dose a patient with GCA would be expected to receive (2817.5 mg over 15 months compared with 5705 mg over 18 months). Relatively little is known about 'real life' steroid use in PMR and GCA; however, our findings demonstrate that, PMR is, in practice, treated for a longer duration than GCA. Furthermore, in PMR, which is more likely to be treated exclusively by primary care physicians than secondary care specialists (especially in the UK where our study was based), daily doses are also likely to be higher than those recommended; in a UK survey of 1249 randomly selected General Practitioners, over 40% reported initiating doses of 30 mg of prednisolone or more, in excess of the EULAR/ACR recommended starting dose of between 15 and 25 mg.

### Modified-release prednisone for polymyalgia rheumatica: a multicentre, randomised, active-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study [^115Pi6JQ]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a common inflammatory rheumatic disease of older peoplecharacterised by new-onset bilateral shoulder and/or hip girdle pain with pronounced stiffness and an acute phase response. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are the mainstay of treatment and rapidly improve PMR symptoms; an initial flexible minimum effective GC dose of 12.5–25 mg prednisone (recognising demographics, comorbidities, comedications, GC risk factors and disease severity) is recommended by the 2015 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) / American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines.

Patients with inflammatory conditions such as PMR typically show circadian variations in clinical symptoms related to altered concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, melatonin and cortisol, with key symptoms usually most severe in the early morning. Modified-release (MR) prednisone has been developed to optimise oral GC treatment strategies with respect to circadian rhythms of inflammation by releasing prednisone ∼4 hours after the administration of the tablet in the late evening. The CAPRA (Circadian Administration of Prednisone in Rheumatoid Arthritis) studies confirmed that optimising the timing of GC administration improves the benefit:risk ratio of long-term, low-dose GC treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Preliminary studies in PMR suggest that MR prednisone may also have benefits in this inflammatory condition.

This randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group, non-inferiority phase III clinical study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of evening MR prednisone compared with morning administration of immediate-release (IR) prednisone in newly diagnosed patients initiating GC treatment for PMR.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for polymyalgia rheumatica, more specifically with respect to indications for referral, ACR/EULAR 2015 guidelines recommend to consider referring patients with PMR for specialist evaluation, particularly in the following situations:

- patients with atypical presentation (such as peripheral inflammatory arthritis, systemic symptoms, low inflammatory markers, age < 60 years)

- high risk or occurrence of therapy-related side effects

- PMR refractory to corticosteroid therapy

- occurrence of relapses or need for prolonged therapy.

Supportive therapies

Prolonged use of GC is an important contributing factor to several comorbidities in patients with rheumatic diseases including systemic vasculitis, PMR and GCA. The determination of a safe dose in patients with long‐term GC exposure in patients with rheumatic disease is debatable. However, a task force group by the EULAR agreed on a GC dose for long‐term treatment with a low level of harm. According to the task force, a daily dose of 5 mg prednisolone or equivalent is associated with a low level of harm, whereas a daily dose of 10 mg or more is associated with an elevated risk of harm. At a daily dose of 5–10 mg, patient characteristics and the level of comorbidities should be taken into consideration in determining the level of harm. It is therefore recommended that all patients with PMR should receive early in their disease course other supportive therapies, such as calcium/vitamin D and bisphosphonates to prevent osteoporosis.

### Sarilumab (Kevzara) [^1126cBot]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 Polymyalgia Rheumatica

The efficacy and safety of KEVZARA in PMR were assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week, multicenter study (Study 3) (NCT03600818) in adults with PMR diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology/European Union League against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria. Patients had at least one episode of unequivocal PMR flare while attempting to taper corticosteroids.

In Study 3, patients with active PMR were randomized to receive KEVZARA 200 mg every two weeks with a pre-defined 14-week taper of prednisone (n = 60) or placebo every two weeks with a pre-defined 52-week taper of prednisone (n = 58). One participant was randomized but not treated in the KEVZARA 200 mg arm. Patients experiencing a disease flare or unable to adhere to the assigned prednisone tapering schedule could receive corticosteroids as rescue therapy.

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with sustained remission at Week 52. Sustained remission was defined as achievement of disease remission no later than Week 12, absence of disease flare from Week 12 through Week 52, sustained reduction of CRP (to < 10 mg/L) from Week 12 through Week 52, and successful adherence to prednisone taper from Week 12 through Week 52. An additional endpoint was total cumulative corticosteroid dose over 52 weeks.

Clinical Response

The proportion of participants achieving sustained remission at Week 52 was higher in the KEVZARA arm compared to the placebo arm; this difference was statistically significant. At 52 weeks, a higher proportion of patients in the KEVZARA arm achieved each component of the sustained remission endpoint compared to the placebo. An analysis was conducted that removed all acute phase reactants (CRP and ESR) criteria from the definition of the sustained remission, given sarilumab's direct impact on acute phase reactants. The results of this analysis were consistent with the primary analysis (see Table 8).

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112zPiSU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Glucocorticoids should only be tapered if the underlying disease no longer requires glucocorticoid therapy. In general, glucocorticoid taper can be faster and in larger decrements if the total daily glucocorticoid dose is high (eg, greater than 30 mg of prednisone). As the total daily glucocorticoid dose is approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent (greater than equivalent of 15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone, see Table 1), the taper should be slower and with smaller decrements (Table 4). In certain patients with glucocorticoid-induced complications, such as uncontrolled hypertension and hyperglycemia, glucocorticoid-induced psychosis, or herpetic keratitis, a more rapid glucocorticoid taper towards physiologic daily dose equivalent may be required. The pre-test probability of adrenal atrophy and concurrent adrenal insufficiency is high for patients taking long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses; adrenal function testing is unnecessary until a physiologic glucocorticoid dose is achieved.

Table 4.
Suggested tapering regimen depending on glucocorticoid dose

HPA recovery is possible once the glucocorticoid therapy has been tapered to a near-physiologic daily dose (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). At this time, taper or assessment for HPA recovery could be performed unless glucocorticoids at this dose are required for control of the underlying condition (for example transplant, or polymyalgia rheumatica).

It is helpful to consider the likelihood of adrenal insufficiency and the risk of underlying disease flare before planning further tapering. It is also important to consider the underlying comorbidities and evaluate concurrent drugs that could impact glucocorticoid metabolism and overall glucocorticoid exposure. Although lacking systematic evidence, empirically, the patient's previous history of success or failure of glucocorticoid taper may also help design the most effective glucocorticoid taper. Additional factors that may impact the risk of adrenal insufficiency include inter-individual variability of glucocorticoid pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. A study examining oral and intravenous methylprednisolone found that 20% of individuals demonstrated increased clearance of methylprednisolone. In general, older individuals have reduced drug clearance, despite a small sample size in these studies, data suggest a considerable and multifactorial inter-individual variability in what would be considered a physiological glucocorticoid dose.

R 2.3 — We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome that may occur during glucocorticoid taper. When glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is severe, glucocorticoid dose can be temporarily increased to the most recent one that was tolerated, and the duration of glucocorticoid taper could be increased. (Good clinical practice)

Therapy for polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) varies widely in clinical practice as international recommendations for PMR treatment are not currently available. In this paper, we report the 2015 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommendations for the management of PMR. We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology as a framework for the project. Accordingly, the direction and strength of the recommendations are based on the quality of evidence, the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, patients' and clinicians' values and preferences, and resource use. Eight overarching principles and nine specific recommendations were developed covering several aspects of PMR, including basic and follow-up investigations of patients under treatment, risk factor assessment, medical access for patients and specialist referral, treatment strategies such as initial glucocorticoid (GC) doses and subsequent tapering regimens, use of intramuscular GCs and disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), as well as the roles of non-steroidal anti-rheumatic drugs and non-pharmacological interventions. These recommendations will inform primary, secondary and tertiary care physicians about an international consensus on the management of PMR. These recommendations should serve to inform clinicians about best practices in the care of patients with PMR.

The mean (95% CI) treatment difference (ABBV‐154 − placebo) showed that cumulative glucocorticoid dose by week 24 was higher for patients receiving placebo than ABBV‐154 (ABBV‐154 40 mg, −88.7 mg [95% CI, −208.0 to 30.7]; P = 0.144; ABBV‐154 150 mg, −164.8 mg [95% CI, −283.6 to −45.9]; P = 0.007; ABBV‐154 340 mg, −182.6 mg [95% CI, −300.5 to −64.6]; P = 0.003) (Figure 4A). Also, the mean (95% CI) treatment difference for change from baseline in daily glucocorticoid dose at week 24 supported that patients receiving placebo experienced smaller reductions in glucocorticoid use than those receiving ABBV‐154 (ABBV‐154 40 mg, −1.6 [95% CI, −3.1 to −0.1]; P = 0.039; ABBV‐154 150 mg, −2.7 [95% CI, −4.2 to −1.2]; P < 0.001; ABBV‐154 340 mg, −3.0 [95% CI, −4.5 to −1.5]; P < 0.001) (Figure 4B).

### Sarilumab for relapse of polymyalgia rheumatica during glucocorticoid taper [^112ZebQ6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

More than half of patients with polymyalgia rheumatica have a relapse during tapering of glucocorticoid therapy. Previous studies have suggested that interleukin-6 blockade may be clinically useful in the treatment of polymyalgia rheumatica. Sarilumab, a human monoclonal antibody, binds interleukin-6 receptor α and efficiently blocks the interleukin-6 pathway.

Methods

In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive 52 weeks of a twice-monthly subcutaneous injection of either sarilumab (at a dose of 200 mg) plus a 14-week prednisone taper or placebo plus a 52-week prednisone taper. The primary outcome at 52 weeks was sustained remission, which was defined as the resolution of signs and symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica by week 12 and sustained normalization of the C-reactive protein level, absence of disease flare, and adherence to the prednisone taper from weeks 12 through 52.

Results

A total of 118 patients underwent randomization (60 to receive sarilumab and 58 to receive placebo). At week 52, sustained remission occurred in 28% (17 of 60 patients) in the sarilumab group and in 10% (6 of 58 patients) in the placebo group (difference, 18 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 4 to 32; P = 0.02). The median cumulative glucocorticoid dose at 52 weeks was significantly lower in the sarilumab group than in the placebo group (777 mg vs. 2044 mg; P < 0.001). The most common adverse events with sarilumab as compared with placebo were neutropenia (15% vs. 0%), arthralgia (15% vs. 5%), and diarrhea (12% vs. 2%). More treatment-related discontinuations were observed in the sarilumab group than in the placebo group (12% vs. 7%).

Conclusions

Sarilumab showed significant efficacy in achieving sustained remission and reducing the cumulative glucocorticoid dose in patients with a relapse of polymyalgia rheumatica during glucocorticoid tapering.

Injectable GC

Intramuscular methylprednisolone (i.m. MP) has been compared to oral GC in the treatment of PMR regarding efficacy and safety. In a study by Dasgupta et al. 60 patients were randomized in 1:1 fashion to 120 mg i.m. MP each for 3 weeks or prednisolone (initial dose 15 mg/day tapered according to a predefined schedule). The remission rate after a 12‐week double‐blind phase of the study was similar in the two groups but the cumulative mean GC dose in the i.m. MP group after 96 weeks was 56% of that in the oral GC group. The i.m. MP group had less events of all known GC long‐term unwanted effects. Intramuscular MP is probably a suitable alternative to oral GC in elderly patients with multiple medications as well as in patients who experience a problem following the tapering schedule of oral GC and in patients a with compliance problem, but further larger studies are needed.

Disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics

Due to the toxicity of long‐term GC therapy, there is clearly a need for GC‐sparing strategies in patients with PMR. However, disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), which have had major success in the treatment of RA and several other rheumatic disorders, have not been extensively studied in PMR (Table 2).

Table 2
Pharmaceutical agents that have been used successfully in the treatment of PMR, and their evidence base

There is some evidence for a benefit of methotrexate (MTX) in patients with PMR. In a double‐blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT), a lower risk of relapse and a greater chance of GC discontinuation was demonstrated in patients with new‐onset PMR taking MTX in addition to a regular GC regimen compared to the comparison group taking GC + placebo. Similar results were obtained in other studies, including a smaller, open‐label trial. In these studies, weekly doses of 7.5–10 mg of MTX were used. Higher doses have not been investigated, and the efficacy of MTX in long‐standing, relapsing PMR has not been systematically evaluated.

Although the observed median initial GC dose was 10 mg/day in both the rapidly declining and low-dose groups, it was reduced to 3.7 mg/day at week 4 and 0 mg/day at week 8 in the rapidly declining group. In contrast, the low-dose group had a reduction to 8.0 mg/day at week 4 and to 6.8 mg/day at week 8, indicating a difference in the rate of early dose reduction (online supplemental table S8). The low-dose, intermediate-dose and high-dose groups showed a gradual reduction in GC dose over time. At week 52, the median daily GC doses were 3.0 mg/day, 4.0 mg/day and 7.5 mg/day, respectively. In contrast, the rapidly declining group maintained a GC dose of 0 mg/day after week 8. The 52 week cumulative GC doses were higher in the low-dose, intermediate-dose and high-dose groups (1918.5–4073.5 mg) compared with the rapidly declining group (366.5 mg) (figure 1C).

### Interleukin-6: a promising target for the treatment of polymyalgia rheumatica or giant cell arteritis? [^115vFVb5]. RMD Open (2016). Low credibility.

The first-line treatment for PMR is GC, and EULAR/ACR recommend its use at the minimum effective daily dose, ranging from 12.5 to 25 mg prednisone as the initial treatment.GCs are also the treatment of choice for GCA, with a starting dose of 0.7 mg/kg for patients without ocular symptoms. Despite its efficacy, GC therapy is associated with well-described adverse events. Indeed, it has been estimated that up to 65–86% of patients with PMR and GCA, respectively, develop GC-related adverse events. In addition, after a mean follow-up of 104 weeks, 46% of patients with GCA experience relapse. Some patients with PMR may need low-dose GC for several years. Alternatives to GC have thus been evaluated both in PMR and GCA but remain unsatisfactory. Methotrexate (MTX) is recommended as a steroid-sparing agent for patients with PMR at high risk of relapse and/or prolonged therapy, experiencing GC-related events or with comorbidities, limiting the use of this drug class. However, the results of MTX therapy in PMR are still a subject of debate. The role of MTX in GCA is limited, because this drug showed only modest efficacy in improving outcomes. Antitumour necrosis factor (TNF)α agents did not prove to be effective in PMRand failed to demonstrate efficacy in patients with GCA. Thus, in these different clinical settings, alternatives to GC are still required.

### Effect of tocilizumab on disease activity in patients with active polymyalgia rheumatica receiving glucocorticoid therapy: a randomized clinical trial [^1179Q5rm]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Few treatments are available for patients with glucocorticoid-dependent polymyalgia rheumatica. IL-6 antagonists may reduce disease activity in patients with active glucocorticoid-dependent polymyalgia rheumatica.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of tocilizumab vs placebo in patients with glucocorticoid-dependent polymyalgia rheumatica.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial enrolled 101 patients with polymyalgia rheumatica at 17 hospitals in France from February 2017 to October 2019. Final follow-up occurred in November 2020. Inclusion criteria were persistent disease activity (polymyalgia rheumatica activity score computed using the C-reactive protein level [CRP PMR-AS] > 10) and prednisone dose greater than or equal to 10 mg per day.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous tocilizumab (8 mg/kg; n = 51) or placebo (n = 50) every 4 weeks for 24 weeks, combined with predefined standardized tapering of oral prednisone.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy end point was CRP PMR-AS less than 10 (range, 0–100; higher values indicate greater activity; no minimal clinically important difference defined) combined with either prednisone dose less than or equal to 5 mg per day or a decrease in prednisone dose greater than or equal to 10 mg from baseline at week 24. There were 11 secondary outcomes assessed at week 24 included in this report, including disease activity (measured by CRP PMR-AS) and the proportion of patients no longer taking prednisone.

Results

Of the 101 randomized patients (mean age, 67.2 years; 68 [67.3%] women), 100 (99%) received at least 1 infusion and 100 completed the trial. The primary end point was achieved in 67.3% of patients in the tocilizumab group and 31.4% of patients in the placebo group (adjusted difference, 36.0% [95% CI, 19.4%-52.6%]; adjusted relative risk, 2.3 [95% CI, 1.5–3.6]; P < .001). Of 11 reported secondary end points at 24 weeks, 7 showed significant differences favoring tocilizumab, including mean CRP PMR-AS score (7.5 [95% CI, 5.4–9.6] vs 14.9 [95% CI, 11.4–18.4]; adjusted difference, -7.5 [95% CI, -11.2 to -3.8]; P < .001) and the percentage of patients no longer receiving prednisone (49.0% vs 19.6%; adjusted difference, 29.3% [95% CI, 18.9%-39.7%]; adjusted relative risk, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.8–3.5]; P < .001). The most frequent adverse events were infections, experienced by 23 patients (46.9%) in the tocilizumab group and 20 (39.2%) in the placebo group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with active polymyalgia rheumatica despite prednisone therapy, tocilizumab, compared with placebo, resulted in a significantly greater percentage of patients with a CRP PMR-AS less than 10 with reduced prednisone requirements at week 24. Further research is needed to confirm efficacy and to determine the balance of potential benefits and harms.

### Polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis: a systematic review [^115LYpJv]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and giant cell arteritis (GCA) are related inflammatory disorders occurring in persons aged 50 years and older. Diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are heterogeneous in clinical practice.

Objective

To summarize current evidence regarding optimal methods for diagnosing and treating PMR and GCA.

Evidence Review

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched from their inception dates to March 30, 2016. Screening by 2 authors resulted in 6626 abstracts, of which 50 articles met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool or American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association methodology.

Findings

Twenty randomized clinical trials for therapy (n = 1016 participants) and 30 imaging studies for diagnosis and/or assessing response to therapy (n = 2080 participants) were included. The diagnosis of PMR is based on clinical features such as new-onset bilateral shoulder pain, including subdeltoid bursitis, muscle or joint stiffness, and functional impairment. Headache and visual disturbances including loss of vision are characteristic of GCA. Constitutional symptoms and elevated inflammatory markers (> 90%) are common in both diseases. Ultrasound imaging enables detection of bilateral subdeltoid bursitis in 69% of PMR patients. In GCA, temporal artery biopsy remains the standard for definitive diagnosis. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of large vessels revealing inflammation-induced wall thickening support the diagnosis of GCA (specificity 78%-100% for ultrasound and 73%-97% for MRI). Glucocorticoids remain the primary treatment, but the optimal initial dose and tapering treatment regimens are unknown. According to consensus-based recommendations, initial therapy for PMR is prednisone, 12.5 to 25 mg/day or equivalent, and 40 to 60 mg/day for GCA, followed by individualized tapering regimens in both diseases. Adjunctive methotrexate may reduce cumulative glucocorticoid dosage by 20% to 44% and relapses by 36% to 54% in both PMR and GCA. Use of tocilizumab as additional treatment with prednisone showed a 2- to 4-fold increase in remission rates of GCA in a randomized clinical trial (N = 30).

Conclusions and Relevance

Diagnosis of PMR/GCA is made by clinical features and elevated inflammatory markers. In PMR, ultrasound imaging may improve diagnostic accuracy. In GCA, temporal artery biopsy may not be required in patients with typical disease features accompanied by characteristic ultrasound or MRI findings. Consensus-based recommendations suggest glucocorticoids as the most effective therapy for PMR/GCA. Methotrexate may be added to glucocorticoids in patients at risk for relapse and in those with glucocorticoid-related adverse effects or need for prolonged glucocorticoid therapy.

Polymyalgia rheumatica — methotrexate (MTX) use (Recommendation 7) states that the panel conditionally recommends considering early introduction of MTX in addition to GCs, particularly for patients at high risk of relapse and/or prolonged therapy and in cases with risk factors, comorbidities and/or concomitant medications where GC-related adverse events are more likely; MTX may also be considered during follow-up in patients with a relapse, without a significant response to GC or experiencing GC-related adverse events. In clinical trials, MTX has been used at oral doses of 7.5–10 mg/week, and in practice may be considered for example in female patients with high initial erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (> 40 mm/hour), peripheral inflammatory arthritis and/or comorbidities that may be exacerbated by GC therapy.

### Advances in the treatment of polymyalgia rheumatica [^115d2KSi]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a common inflammatory disorder affecting individuals over 50. The cornerstone of PMR treatment remains oral glucocorticoids (GCs), with initial doses tailored to the risk of relapse and comorbidities. However, relapses occur in up to 76% of cases, and long-term GC use is associated with significant toxicity, affecting up to 85% of patients. Conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), such as methotrexate, offer limited benefits, while recent evidence supports the use of biologics, such as tocilizumab and sarilumab, in reducing GC dependency and achieving remission. Emerging treatments, including JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib) and B-cell depletion (rituximab), show promise but require further validation. The treat-to-target (T2T) strategy is advocated for achieving sustained remission and minimizing adverse effects. New treatment options requiring rheumatological expertise are emerging, highlighting the need for specialized management, early referral, improved imaging use, and standardized definitions of remission and relapse to enhance patient care and outcomes.

### Modified-release prednisone for polymyalgia rheumatica: a multicentre, randomised, active-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study [^1167yAvJ]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Setting, patients and treatments

The study (EudraCT number 2011–002353–57) was conducted between March 2013 and March 2014 at 41 secondary care centres across nine European countries. Patients aged ≥ 50 years, newly diagnosed with PMR and previously untreated with GCs for PMR, were eligible for inclusion. According to the 2012 EULAR/ACR provisional classification criteria for PMR, the diagnosis had to be confirmed by all of the following at screening: (1) new-onset bilateral shoulder pain with/without hip girdle pain; (2) a PMR visual analogue scale (VAS) score ≥ 50 (0–100 scale); (3) duration of morning stiffness > 45 min and (4) acute phase response shown by elevated C reactive protein (CRP; ≥ 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)). Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to MR or IR prednisone for 4 weeks, and received 15 mg IR prednisone/placebo between 5:00 and 9:00 and 15 mg MR prednisone/placebo at 22:00 ± 30 min. No rescue medication was used, and other medications for the treatment of PMR, including analgesics and coanalgesics, were prohibited during the study.

Study assessments

Every morning and evening, patients completed an electronic diary (Log Pad, PHT Corporation), recording how their PMR had affected them (PMR VAS), their overall pain (global pain VAS), pain in their arms and shoulders (shoulder pain VAS), their overall level of fatigue/tiredness (fatigue VAS), duration of morning stiffness and time of medication intake. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), CRP and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were measured at baseline, week 1 (CRP/ESR only) and week 4. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the study.

### Sarilumab in relapsing polymyalgia rheumatica: patient-reported outcomes from a phase 3, double-blind, randomised controlled trial [^116Rppzy]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Sarilumab is approved for adult patients with polymyalgia rheumatica who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids or who cannot tolerate corticosteroid taper. We aimed to evaluate the effect of sarilumab on patient-reported outcomes.

Methods

This phase 3, double-blind, randomised controlled trial was done in 60 centres in 17 countries. Eligible patients were adults aged 50 years or older who had at least one episode of disease flare during a glucocorticoid taper (at a dose of ≥ 7.5 mg per day or prednisone dose equivalent) within 12 weeks before screening and had a history of at least 8 weeks of glucocorticoid treatment (≥ 10 mg per day or prednisone dose equivalent). All the patients had symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate > 30 mm/h or a C-reactive protein concentration of at least 10 mg/L within 12 weeks before screening. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either subcutaneous sarilumab 200 mg once every 2 weeks with a 14-week glucocorticoid taper or matching placebo with a 52-week glucocorticoid taper. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The patient-reported outcomes measured were Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), Patient Global Assessment of Health Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Pain VAS, Short Form Health Survey (SF-36 v2), EuroQoL 5-Dimensions 3-Levels (EQ-5D including the descriptive system and the VAS), and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F). Patient-reported outcomes were analysed until week 52 as changes from baseline. Post-hoc analyses included proportions of patients reporting improvements of at least minimum clinically important difference and scores of at least normative values. p values were nominal. Analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. There was no involvement of people with lived experience at any stage of the study. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03600818.

Findings

Between Oct 9, 2018, and July 15, 2020, 118 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive sarilumab (n = 60) or placebo (n = 58). Of these, 117 patients received treatment (59 in the sarilumab group and 58 in the placebo group). One patient assigned to the sarilumab group did not receive treatment. Mean age was 68.9 years (SD 8.1). 82 (69%) of 118 patients were female and 36 (31%) were male, and 98 (83%) were White. At baseline, moderate-to-severe fatigue was reported by 43 (73%) of 59 patients in the sarilumab group and 43 (74%) of 58 patients in the placebo group. At week 52, patients in the sarilumab group reported greater improvements than patients in the placebo group in SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS; least-squares mean [LSM] change 7.65 vs 2.87, p = 0.020) and Mental Component Summary (MCS; 3.04 vs -1.71, p = 0.030) scores, and in five of eight domains. Sarilumab showed greater improvements in EQ-5D utility index (0.11 vs -0.02, p = 0.034) and VAS scores (8.37 vs -0.46, p = 0.084), FACIT-F (7.91 vs 4.17, p = 0.060), HAQ-DI (-0.39 vs -0.15, p = 0.054), Pain VAS (-20.57 vs -12.04, p = 0.20), and Patient Global Assessment VAS (-15.01 vs -6.08, p = 0.13). More patients in the sarilumab group than in the placebo group reported improvements of minimum clinically important difference or greater in SF-36 PCS scores (odds ratio 3.46 [95% CI 1.16–10.62], p = 0.020). More than 50% of patients in the sarilumab group reported scores of at least normative values for SF-36 MCS and four domain scores, whereas this was not the case for any domain in the placebo group.

Interpretation

Patients with relapsing polymyalgia rheumatica have impaired health-related quality of life. The use of sarilumab 200 mg once every 2 weeks with a 14-week glucocorticoid taper led to clinically important improvements in health-related quality of life and patient-reported outcomes versus placebo with a 52-week glucocorticoid taper. Improvements were highest in patients with most severe disease. These findings provide support for the use of sarilumab in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica whose disease activity and health-related quality of life is not adequately managed by glucocorticoid monotherapy according to treat-to-target principles.

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) management — individualized exercise: The panel conditionally recommends considering an individualized exercise program for PMR patients aimed at the maintenance of muscle mass and function, and reducing risk of falls. The panel also agreed on recommending an individualized exercise program in view of its benefit for maintaining muscle mass and function and reducing risk of falls, especially in older persons on long-term glucocorticoids (GCs) as well as in frail patients, noting the absence of studies of non-pharmacological therapies in PMR and insufficient clinical experience for a specific recommendation.

### Prednisone plus methotrexate for polymyalgia rheumatica: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^117Nvrez]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Steroids are the standard treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica. The efficacy of the candidate drug methotrexate has not yet been demonstrated in controlled studies.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of prednisone plus methotrexate and prednisone alone in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica.

Design

Multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

5 Italian rheumatology clinics.

Patients

72 patients with newly diagnosed polymyalgia rheumatica.

Measurements

The proportion of patients no longer taking prednisone, the number of flare-ups, and the cumulative prednisone dose after 76 weeks.

Intervention

Prednisone dosage (25 mg/d) was tapered to 0 mg/d within 24 weeks and was adjusted if flare-ups occurred. Oral methotrexate (10 mg) or placebo, with folinic acid supplementation (7.5 mg), was given weekly for 48 weeks.

Results

Twenty-eight of 32 patients in the methotrexate group and 16 of 30 patients in the placebo group were no longer taking prednisone at 76 weeks (P = 0.003). The risk difference was 34 percentage points (95% CI, 11 to 53 percentage points). Similar results were obtained after adjustment for C-reactive protein level and duration of symptoms in a multivariate model. Fifteen of 32 patients in the methotrexate group and 22 of 30 patients in the placebo group had at least 1 flare-up by the end of follow-up (P = 0.04). The median prednisone dose was 2.1 g in the methotrexate group and 2.97 g in the placebo group (P = 0.03). The rate and severity of adverse events were similar.

Limitations

Follow-up was short, and a high dose of folinic acid and a relatively high starting dosage of prednisone were used. Ten of 72 patients (14%) discontinued treatment or were lost to follow-up.

Conclusions

Prednisone plus methotrexate is associated with shorter prednisone treatment and steroid sparing. It may be useful in patients at high risk for steroid-related toxicity.
