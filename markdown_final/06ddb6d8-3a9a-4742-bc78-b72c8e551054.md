## Question

Metformin starting dose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the metformin starting dose and titration strategy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled starting doses for immediate-release versus extended-release formulations. Then, I should verify pediatric-specific dosing. Next, I will review titration increments and timing. After that, I need to check renal function thresholds and dose adjustments. I will then examine special populations and tolerability strategies. Finally, I should confirm monitoring, safety considerations, and reconcile any apparent discrepancies across sources before summarizing a practical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the adult immediate-release metformin starting dose, because that anchors most monotherapy initiations. The FDA labeling consistently recommends 500 mg twice daily with meals or 850 mg once daily with a meal, with gradual increases to improve gastrointestinal tolerability, which aligns with core prescribing information and multiple FDA entries for tablets and oral solution, so I can be confident in stating 500 mg BID or 850 mg once daily as the labeled starting options [^11191Ab1] [^114WZ1T7] [^1163MDvu] [^111WMSK4].

> Wait, let me verify the extended-release starting dose, since many patients benefit from once-daily regimens. The FDA labeling for metformin ER indicates 500 mg once daily with the evening meal, with weekly 500 mg increments up to 2000 mg once daily, and if control is still inadequate at 2000 mg once daily, a trial of 1000 mg twice daily can be considered, which matches multiple ER product labels and clinical pharmacology reviews [^112DPzep] [^114Jj99n] [^116jFWFU] [^1116yPHF].

> I need to check pediatric dosing next, because the maximum dose and titration differ from adults. For children 10 years and older, the labeled starting dose is 500 mg twice daily with meals, titrated by 500 mg weekly to a maximum of 2000 mg/day in divided doses, and importantly, ER safety and effectiveness in pediatrics are not established on some ER labels, so I should be cautious about extrapolating ER to children without confirming local labeling or guidelines [^11191Ab1] [^111WMSK4] [^112DPzep].

> Hold on, I should verify the titration cadence and targets to avoid underdosing. Typical increments are 500 mg weekly for IR and ER, with some IR regimens allowing 850 mg every 2 weeks, aiming for a therapeutic range where clinically meaningful effects are usually observed at or above 1500 mg/day, and with adult IR maxima up to 2550 mg/day in divided doses and ER maxima at 2000 mg/day; this pattern is consistent across FDA sources and supported by dose–response data showing greater HbA1c reductions with higher doses within the therapeutic window [^11191Ab1] [^114WZ1T7] [^112DPzep] [^116vrtAK].

> Next, I should review renal function thresholds, because this is where errors commonly occur. I need to ensure I state this precisely: do not initiate metformin if eGFR is below 45 mL/min/1.73 m², and it is contraindicated if eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m²; if eGFR later falls below 30, discontinue, and if eGFR is 30–45 in a patient already on therapy, assess benefit–risk and consider dose reduction, with some guidance suggesting 1000 mg/day cap in that range, which aligns with FDA labeling and endocrine society guidance [^11191Ab1] [^1179HMBx] [^115o4kEZ] [^114CVt1N].

> Let me consider special populations and tolerability strategies, because these often determine whether a patient can reach an effective dose. In older adults, slower titration, attention to GI side effects, and periodic B12 monitoring are prudent; ER formulations can improve tolerability and adherence, and if GI intolerance persists, dose reduction, switching to ER, or considering alternatives is reasonable; for patients with higher baseline A1C, earlier combination therapy may be warranted per contemporary algorithms to overcome therapeutic inertia [^116to9HE] [^113GFUmb] [^117WzJKy] [^112dHfyA].

> I should double-check monitoring and safety logistics to ensure the plan is complete. Baseline and periodic renal function assessment is required, metformin should be held around iodinated contrast when eGFR is 30–60 or in higher-risk contexts with reassessment of renal function 48 hours later before restarting, and long-term B12 monitoring is advised; these steps are consistently reflected in FDA labeling and endocrine guidelines and should be embedded in the prescription workflow [^11191Ab1] [^1179HMBx] [^116to9HE].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on insulin or a sulfonylurea when metformin is added; do I need to adjust other agents preemptively. I should confirm that when adding metformin to insulin, some labels suggest continuing the current insulin dose and then reducing insulin by about 10–25% if fasting glucose falls below roughly 120 mg/dL, with individualized adjustments thereafter, which helps mitigate hypoglycemia risk during combination therapy [^116jFWFU].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the ER maximum was uniformly 2550 mg/day like IR; hold on, I should verify and correct that. The adult ER maximum is 2000 mg/day, whereas the adult IR maximum is 2550 mg/day in divided doses, so I need to ensure I do not inadvertently apply the IR ceiling to ER regimens, and if a patient on ER at 2000 mg once daily is not at goal, a trial of 1000 mg twice daily ER is reasonable before declaring failure [^112DPzep] [^114Jj99n] [^116jFWFU].

> Let me synthesize a practical recommendation, keeping the formulation-specific nuances in mind. For most treatment-naïve adults with preserved renal function, start metformin 500 mg twice daily with meals for IR or 500 mg once daily with the evening meal for ER, titrate by 500 mg weekly based on tolerance and glycemic response toward 1500–2000 mg/day, recognizing that many patients require at least 1500 mg/day for clinically meaningful A1C reduction, and individualize the ceiling to 2550 mg/day for IR or 2000 mg/day for ER as needed and tolerated, with renal function checks before initiation and at least annually or as clinically indicated [^11191Ab1] [^112DPzep] [^114WZ1T7] [^116vrtAK].

> I should confirm pediatric guidance succinctly to avoid overgeneralization. For children 10 years and older, start 500 mg twice daily with meals and increase by 500 mg weekly to a maximum of 2000 mg/day in divided doses, noting again that ER pediatric safety and effectiveness are not established on some labels, so IR is the standard starting point unless local policy or specialist guidance supports otherwise [^11191Ab1] [^111WMSK4] [^112DPzep].

> Finally, I need to ensure the renal and procedural caveats are explicit in the care plan. Hold metformin peri-contrast when indicated based on eGFR and risk factors, reassess renal function 48 hours post-procedure before restarting, and discontinue if eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m²; these steps, together with B12 monitoring and attention to GI tolerability, mitigate the principal safety concerns while allowing dose optimization for efficacy [^11191Ab1] [^1179HMBx] [^116to9HE].

The recommended starting dose of metformin is **500 mg twice daily with meals** [^11191Ab1] or **850 mg once daily with a meal** [^114WZ1T7] to minimize gastrointestinal side effects. If needed, increase the dose by 500 mg weekly or 850 mg every 2 weeks to a maximum of 2,550 mg/day in divided doses [^11191Ab1]; doses above 2,000 mg/day are better tolerated when given three times daily with meals [^114WZ1T7]. For patients with renal impairment, **do not initiate if eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m²** [^11191Ab1] and stop if eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^1179HMBx]. Adjust the dose based on tolerance and glycemic response, and consider extended-release formulations to improve adherence and reduce GI effects [^111WRzTZ] [^116to9HE].

## Recommended starting dose

- **Standard initial dose**: 500 mg orally twice daily with meals or 850 mg once daily with a meal [^11191Ab1] [^114WZ1T7].
- **Purpose**: Start low and titrate gradually to reduce gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort) [^113GFUmb] [^111uUo5w].
- **Alternative**: Extended-release (ER) 500 mg once daily with the evening meal; titrate by 500 mg weekly to a maximum of 2,000 mg once daily [^112DPzep] [^114Jj99n].

---

## Dose titration and maximum dose

- **Titration**: Increase by 500 mg weekly or 850 mg every 2 weeks based on glycemic control and tolerability [^11191Ab1] [^114WZ1T7].
- **Maximum dose**: 2,550 mg/day for immediate-release (IR); 2,000 mg/day for ER [^11191Ab1] [^112DPzep].
- **Higher doses**: Doses above 2,000 mg/day are better tolerated when divided three times daily with meals [^11191Ab1] [^114WZ1T7].

---

## Special considerations

### Renal impairment

Before starting, **assess renal function (eGFR)** [^11191Ab1] and monitor periodically [^11191Ab1]. Do not initiate if **eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m²** [^11191Ab1] [^1179HMBx]; if eGFR later falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², discontinue [^11191Ab1] [^1116BJCG].

---

### Hepatic impairment

Use with caution in hepatic impairment due to **lactic acidosis risk** [^116to9HE]; no specific dose adjustment is provided [^notfound].

---

### Elderly patients

Start low and titrate slowly, with close monitoring for gastrointestinal intolerance and renal function [^116to9HE] [^111L3rL8].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting starting dose

Evidence shows that **starting at 500 mg twice daily or 850 mg once daily** with gradual titration improves tolerability and adherence, reducing gastrointestinal side effects and improving long-term persistence [^113GFUmb] [^114WZ1T7]. ER formulations further improve adherence and reduce gastrointestinal adverse effects compared with IR [^111WRzTZ] [^114ZqDW7].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing starting dose

- **Age**: Older adults may require lower starting doses and slower titration due to reduced renal function and higher susceptibility to side effects [^116to9HE] [^114GFxRB].
- **Comorbidities**: Renal, hepatic, or cardiovascular conditions may necessitate dose adjustments or alternative therapies [^1179HMBx] [^114CVt1N].
- **Concomitant medications**: Drugs affecting renal function or gastrointestinal motility may influence metformin dosing and tolerability [^1128WWDT] [^115G6YgZ].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Glycemic control**: Monitor fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or HbA1c every 3 months to assess efficacy and adjust dose [^1164cFxF].
- **Renal function**: Monitor eGFR at least annually, or more frequently in patients with impaired renal function [^116to9HE].
- **Vitamin B12**: Consider periodic monitoring for deficiency with long-term use [^116to9HE] [^1179HMBx].

### Metformin hydrochloride [^114WZ1T7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Short-term administration of metformin hydrochloride may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually well-controlled on diet alone.

Recommended Dosing Schedule

Adults – In general, clinically significant responses are not seen at doses below 1500 mg per day. However, a lower recommended starting dose and gradually increased dosage is advised to minimize gastrointestinal symptoms.

The usual starting dose of metformin hydrochloride is 500 mg twice a day or 850 mg once a day, given with meals. Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg weekly or 850 mg every 2 weeks, up to a total of 2000 mg per day, given in divided doses. Patients can also be titrated from 500 mg twice a day to 850 mg twice a day after 2 weeks. For those patients requiring additional glycemic control, metformin hydrochloride may be given to a maximum daily dose of 2550 mg per day. Doses above 2000 mg may be better tolerated given three times a day with meals.

If higher doses of metformin are required, metformin hydrochloride should be used at total daily doses up to 2550 mg administered in divided daily doses, as described above. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Studies .)

Pediatrics – The usual starting dose of metformin hydrochloride is 500 mg twice a day, given with meals. Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg weekly up to a maximum of 2000 mg per day, given in divided doses.

Q5. In patients with T2DM who are intolerant of and/or fail to achieve HbA1c goals on high‐dose metformin (≥ 1500 mg/day), should treatment be switched to a combination regimen with low‐ or moderate‐dose metformin (≤ 1000 mg/day)?

Recommendation 5: In patients with T2DM who are intolerant of and/or fail to achieve HbA1c goals on high‐dose metformin (≥ 1500 mg/day), a triple combination of low‐ or intermediate‐dose metformin (≤ 1000 mg/day), DPP‐4i, and SGLT2i is recommended to improve glycaemic control and/or tolerability (Grade A; strong recommendation [agreement rate: 94%]).

Explanation 5: When used for treating T2DM, metformin is generally started at a low dose (500 mg/day) and titrated gradually to a maximum of 2550 mg/day. Its glucose‐lowering effects are dose‐dependent within the range of 500–2000 mg/day. However, many patients are unable to tolerate high‐dose metformin due to significant gastrointestinal side effects. Evidence from several randomized controlled trials showed that, in patients with T2DM who were intolerant of or had poor glycaemic control (HbA1c 8.0%–11.0%) on high‐dose metformin (≥ 1500 mg/day), a triple‐combination FDC containing low‐ or intermediate‐dose metformin (≤ 1000 mg/day), DPP‐4i, and SGLT2i reduced HbA1c levels by 1.45%–1.73% and increased glycaemic goal achievement rates to 27.5%–54% with good safety and tolerability.

### Dose distribution and up-titration patterns of metformin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes [^115VDXye]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

While the patterns and consequences of intensification of T2DM therapy have been well characterized globally, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 studies examining up‐titration of metformin in the real‐world clinical setting are lacking. The Summary of Product Characteristics from the European Medicines Agency recommends a starting dose of 500 or 850 mg metformin 2‐3 times daily, with a maximum daily dose of 3000 mg, 9, 17 but studies of intensification after metformin monotherapy generally do not report the final titrated dose of metformin before adding on or switching therapies. 11, 18, 19 Since metformin has demonstrated efficacy at lowering HbA1c when given at 1500‐2000 mg/day, 20 the question remains whether metformin treatment sometimes fails because of inadequate dose optimization. The objective of this study was thus to assess the dose distribution of metformin monotherapy, as well as the patterns and predictors of up‐titration following initiation of metformin, among people with T2DM in the United Kingdom.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^111WRzTZ]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Metformin — adults and adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): Metformin alone should be considered in adults with PCOS and a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 for anthropometric and metabolic outcomes including insulin resistance, glucose, and lipid profiles; metformin alone could be considered in adolescents at risk of or with PCOS for cycle regulation, acknowledging limited evidence; and metformin alone may be considered in adults with PCOS and BMI < 25 kg/ m2, acknowledging limited evidence. Where metformin is prescribed the following need to be considered: shared decision making needs to consider feasibility and effectiveness of active lifestyle intervention and women should be informed that metformin and active lifestyle intervention have similar efficacy; mild adverse effects, including gastrointestinal side-effects are generally dose dependent and self-limiting; starting at a low dose, with 500mg increments 1–2 weekly and extended-release preparations may minimize side effects and improve adherence; suggested maximum daily dose is 2.5 g in adults and 2g in adolescents; use appears safe long-term, based on use in other populations, however indications for ongoing requirement needs to be considered; and use may be associated with low vitamin B12 levels, where monitoring should be considered.

### Metformin er 750 mg (metformin) [^112DPzep]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Recommended Dosing Schedule

Adults

In general, clinically significant responses are not seen at doses below 1500 mg per day. However, a lower recommended starting dose and gradually increased dosage is advised to minimize gastrointestinal symptoms.

The usual starting dose of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP is 500 mg once daily with the evening meal. Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg weekly, up to a maximum of 2000 mg once daily with the evening meal. If glycemic control is not achieved on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP 2000 mg once daily, a trial of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP 1000 mg twice daily should be considered. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Studies .)

In a randomized trial, patients currently treated with metformin hydrochloride tablets were switched to metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Results of this trial suggest that patients receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets treatment may be safely switched to metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily at the same total daily dose, up to 2000 mg once daily. Following a switch from metformin hydrochloride tablets to metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, glycemic control should be closely monitored and dosage adjustments made accordingly (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Studies).

Pediatrics

Safety and effectiveness of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP in pediatric patients have not been established.

Recommendations for Use in Renal Impairment

Assess renal function prior to initiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and periodically thereafter.

Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2.

Initiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with an eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2 is not recommended.

In patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit risk of continuing therapy.

Discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if the patients eGFR later falls below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2 (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).

Discontinuation for Iodinated Contrast Imaging Procedures

Discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast.

### Metformin for the prevention of antipsychotic-induced weight gain: guideline development and consensus validation [^112cxekB]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Health Question 3: What Dose of Metformin Should be Used for the Prevention of AIWG?

The doses used in studies evaluating metformin for the prevention of AIWG ranged from 500 mg/day to 2 g/day. Titration protocols were not always reported, but where available, doses were increased at weekly increments as tolerated. To our knowledge, there are no dose finding studies for AIWG and time-to-effect is uncertain. Without intervention, the time taken for AIWG to plateau is also uncertain and may differ between antipsychotics. The manufacturer recommends initiating metformin at a dose of 500 mg bd and increasing at weekly increments. Discussion at the consensus and endocrinology meetings among clinicians who routinely prescribe metformin in clinics for prevention and/or treatment of weight gain revealed variation in practice, with some sites opting for fortnightly dose titration and others increasing over 6–12 weeks. Doses above 2 g/day are not commonly used in practice for this indication. The final algorithm recommends weekly titration until a dose of 1 g/day and fortnightly titration thereafter as tolerated. Dose reductions are required in renal impairment and this criterion is included in the algorithm. This good practice recommendation incorporates data from the literature, licensing recommendations, and feedback from clinical practice. (Good Practice Recommendation).

Key Health Question 4: When Should Metformin be Stopped When it is Prescribed for the Prevention of AIWG?

According to the license, metformin should be discontinued if lactic acidosis is suspected or risks for lactic acidosis are present, temporarily prior to or at the time of the administration of iodinated contrast agents or if estimated glomerular filtration rate drops below 30 mL/min. We also recommend that metformin is discontinued if BMI is below 20 or if the antipsychotic medicine is discontinued. (Good Practice Recommendation)

Metformin should be avoided where there is harmful use of alcoholeg, Alcohol User Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score of 8 or more.(Good Practice Recommendation)

Per the Summary of Product Characteristics from the European Medicines Agency, the minimum recommended starting dose of 500 mg metformin two times daily translates to 1000 mg/day. 9 However, in the current study, 72% of new users were initiated at doses lower than this value, and 69% remained at this dose level 6 and 12 months later. Even among new users with suboptimal glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥ 53 mmol/mol (7.0%)), 61% remained below this dose level at 12 months. Furthermore, 54% of prevalent users of metformin were receiving less than this minimum recommended daily dose. This may explain why only 51% of prevalent metformin users had met the standard HbA1C target of < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%), even after a median disease duration of 3.1 years.

The reasons for the low rates of up‐titration are speculative, but may include contraindications, intolerance and discontinuation. The NICE guidelines state that metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated in 15% of diabetes patients. 7 Contraindications include renal dysfunction and recent cardiovascular events, both of which are common among people with T2DM. 30 We investigated the effects of excluding patients with renal dysfunction, defined as eGFR < 30 (0.5% of new users and 1.0% of prevalent users) and found no change in the results. Intolerance of metformin may manifest as lactacidosis or gastrointestinal side effects, which sometimes lead to discontinuation. 20 Our analysis showed that discontinuation was the most frequent treatment pattern (among patterns involving a change) observed in the year after initiating metformin monotherapy, suggesting that many subjects were intolerant of metformin.

### Dose distribution and up-titration patterns of metformin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113FraVS]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, this study of UK adults with T2DM showed that dosing of metformin monotherapy is often suboptimal and that up‐titration is infrequent. Metformin dosing and up‐titration were highly dependent on HbA1c levels, but remained suboptimal even in subjects with HbA1c levels above the recommended targets. Given the popularity of metformin as a first‐line treatment for T2DM, and its demonstrated efficacy at the recommended doses, providers should be encouraged to optimize the metformin dose, and patients should be made aware of the impact of tolerability and adherence issues on glycaemic control.

1 INTRODUCTION

Clinical practice guidelines recommend that hyperglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) be controlled through a comprehensive management strategy including lifestyle modification and, as needed, pharmacotherapy. 1, 2 While glycaemic treatment targets are individualized based on patient‐specific considerations, a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) concentration of < 53 mmol/mol (< 7.0%) is considered a typical treatment target for most patients with T2D, and anti‐hyperglycaemic agents (AHAs) are usually initiated and intensified in a stepped‐care fashion, based on glycaemic response relative to this goal. Because of its favourable efficacy, safety and cost, metformin is the first‐line AHA for most patients with T2D. It is typically initiated at 500‐1000 mg/d, with dose escalations occurring as required, based on HbA1c re‐assessments, up to doses of 2000 to 2500 mg/d. 2 If dose uptitration of metformin monotherapy does not result in HbA1c goal attainment, one or more other AHAs are added.

This stepped‐care approach can substantially delay HbA1c goal attainment in patients who ultimately require two or more AHAs for optimal glycaemic control. A recent analysis of observational data in the United Kingdom indicated that only 25% of patients with T2D with HbA1c ≥ 53 mmol/mol (≥ 7.0%) received treatment intensification within 12 months. 3 Further, the likelihood of attaining glycaemic control was significantly lower for patients with delayed intensification. More aggressive approaches may therefore be considered in patients who are well above their HbA1c goal. Clinical practice guidelines recommend that initial treatment with two AHAs be considered for patients presenting with an HbA1c level well above target. For example, HbA1c thresholds for initiation of dual therapy of 58 mmol/mol (7.5%) and 75 mmol/mol (9.0%) have been recommended by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes, respectively. 1, 2 However, practice recommendations do not yet provide guidance regarding an optimal approach to treatment intensification for patients who are well above their HbA1c target on metformin monotherapy at a sub‐maximal dose. For some such patients, it may be reasonable to consider initiation of a second AHA in parallel with, instead of following, metformin dose escalation.

Conclusion

The evidence from this study can potentially be used to support better targeting of second-line T2DM therapy. The choice of which drug to offer after metformin should be based on the individual person's phenotypic characteristics (including gender, age, BMI, eGFR and duration of T2DM), considering their treatment goals, extent of hyperglycaemia, comorbidities and the beneficial and adverse effects of each class of drug to select the right drug for the right patient.

1 INTRODUCTION

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by a combination of insulin insensitivity in muscle and liver and suboptimal insulin production by pancreatic β‐cells. 1 These insulin‐related defects result in elevated blood glucose, or hyperglycaemia, which in turn has detrimental effects on the vasculature, leading to both macrovascular complications (eg coronary artery disease) and microvascular complications (eg diabetic retinopathy). 2 The primary aim of treating T2DM is to control blood glucose levels, with the goal of preventing these vascular complications.

The International Diabetes Federation estimates that 8.8% of adults worldwide have diabetes; this number ranges from 3.8% in Africa to 11.5% in North America and the Caribbean. 3 As of 2014, 5.3% of people aged 16 or older in the United Kingdom had T2DM. 4 International guidelines including those from the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes, 5 the International Diabetes Federation 6 and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 7 recommend metformin as the initial antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy. Both the US Food and Drug Administration 8 and the European Medicines Agency 9 note the need to up‐titrate metformin, that is, to gradually increase the dose, over the first several weeks. In the NICE guidance, treatment with metformin is considered successful if, after dose optimization, the patient's glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is maintained at or below the desired level (typically 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) or 53 mmol/mol (7.0%)). 7 If HbA1c levels are not maintained on metformin, intensification of therapy by adding a second drug or switching to another drug is recommended. Intensification occurs in over 50% of patients in the United Kingdom. 10

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes with metformin hydrochloride or any other pharmacologic agent. Dosage of metformin hydrochloride must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance, while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily doses. The maximum recommended daily dose of metformin hydrochloride is 2550 mg in adults and 2000 mg in pediatric patients (10 to 16 years of age).

Metformin hydrochloride should be given in divided doses with meals. Metformin hydrochloride should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation, both to reduce gastrointestinal side effects and to permit identification of the minimum dose required for adequate glycemic control of the patient.

During treatment initiation and dose titration (see Recommended Dosing Schedule), fasting plasma glucose should be used to determine the therapeutic response to metformin hydrochloride and identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, glycosylated hemoglobin should be measured at intervals of approximately three months. The therapeutic goal should be to decrease both fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels to normal or near normal by using the lowest effective dose of metformin hydrochloride, either when used as monotherapy or in combination with sulfonylurea or insulin. Monitoring of blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin will also permit detection of primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication, and secondary failure, i.e., loss of an adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness.

### Efficacy and safety of metformin in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in older adults: a systematic review for the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^114GFxRB]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) is a prevalent chronic disease worldwide. Around 9% of adults have DM2, increasing to more than 20% of those aged 65 years or older. DM2 and its complications are an important cause of morbidity, and people with DM2 have substantially reduced life expectancy. Duration of DM2 and degree of metabolic control are important factors determining the prognosis for people with DM2. However, the use of drugs for managing DM2 has been associated with preventable drug-related causes of admission to emergency units in older populations.

Metformin is one of the most widely prescribed first and second line oral glucose-lowering drugs. While it has low risk for hypoglycaemia, the risk for gastrointestinal effects is higher and it is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency. Renal function declines with age and, therefore, should be monitored closely in older adults who are prescribed metformin. Clinical guidelines (in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia) have advised that the use of metformin is contraindicated, or that lower doses be used, depending on renal function. The use of metformin has also been associated with a higher risk of lactic acidosis but this has not been widely reported.

Currently, there is little empirical data about patient safety and effectiveness data on to the use of oral antidiabetics including metformin among older adults. Evidence-based clinical guidelines for the treatment of DM2 have acknowledged the lack of direct evidence in older people. STOPP/START criteria version 2 considered metformin as a potentially inappropriate medication for older people with severe renal failure. Inappropriate prescribing may involve the prescription of a wrong dose, the lack of a clear indication or the lack of evidence-base, among others.

The objectives of this systematic review (SR) are:
to identify and collect existing literature on the risks and benefits of use of metformin in the treatment of DM2 in older adults,
to assess the quality of the evidence identified, and develop recommendations when to discontinue or to adjust the dose of metformin in the treatment of DM2 in older adults.

This evidence was used to develop recommendations on discontinuation or dose adjustment of metformin in older people for the management of DM2 in order to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing. These recommendations will be used in the electronic decision support tool of the "Polypharmacy in chronic diseases: Reduction of Inappropriate Medication and Adverse drug events in elderly populations by electronic Decision Support" (PRIMA-eDS) project.

### Metformin hydrochloride extended release (metformin HCl ER) [^1116yPHF]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Short-term administration of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually well-controlled on diet alone.

Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets must be swallowed whole and never crushed or chewed. Occasionally, the inactive ingredients of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets will be eliminated in the feces as a soft, hydrated mass. (See Patient Information printed below.)

Recommended Dosing Schedule

Adults - In general, clinically significant responses are not seen at doses below 1500 mg per day. However, a lower recommended starting dose and gradually increased dosage is advised to minimize gastrointestinal symptoms.

The usual starting dose of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets is 500 mg once daily with the evening meal. Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg weekly, up to a maximum of 2000 mg once daily with the evening meal. If glycemic control is not achieved on metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets 2000 mg once daily, a trial of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets 1000 mg twice daily should be considered. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Studies.)

In a randomized trial, patients currently treated with metformin hydrochloride tablets were switched to metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets. Results of this trial suggest that patients receiving metformin hydrochloride tablet treatment may be safely switched to metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets once daily at the same total daily dose, up to 2000 mg once daily. Following a switch from metformin hydrochloride tablets to metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets, glycemic control should be closely monitored and dosage adjustments made accordingly (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Studies).

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^115AZs6Y]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric obesity — metformin use and effectiveness: Metformin dosing is described as immediate- or extended-release with a recommended starting dose of 500 mg, once or twice daily, with gradual increases up to a maximum total daily dose of 2500 mg; adverse effects are dose-dependent (bloating, nausea, flatulence, diarrhea) and lactic acidosis is a serious but very rare pediatric complication. Metformin has not been approved as a weight-loss drug, and in adults with obesity showed modest (< 5%, or 1 BMI unit) weight reduction when used as an adjunct to lifestyle with effectiveness inconsistent across populations; pediatric effectiveness is similarly conflicting. In a randomized study of 39 teens 13 to 18 years of age in a lifestyle program, metformin hydrochloride XR 2000 mg or placebo once daily for 48 weeks led to approximately 1 kg/m^2 BMI reduction among adolescents taking metformin compared with a slight BMI increase in the lifestyle-only group. Another randomized study of 100 children 6 to 12 years of age with severe obesity (mean BMI 34.6 kg/m^2) showed approximately 1 kg/m^2 BMI reduction at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily for 6 months, with gastrointestinal symptoms limiting the tolerated maximum dose in nearly 20% and no additional BMI reduction beyond 6 months. Across 16 metformin studies meeting inclusion, about two-thirds showed modest BMI reduction and one-third showed no benefit; given the modest and inconsistent effectiveness, metformin may be considered as an adjunct to intensive health behavior and lifestyle treatment and when other indications for metformin are present.

### Metformin – the gold standard in type 2 diabetes: what does the evidence tell us? [^117H2PAq]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Metformin is a cornerstone of oral antidiabetic treatment. Recent joint American and European guidelines recommend instituting metformin therapy along with lifestyle modification at the time type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is diagnosed. Metformin acts to reduce hepatic gluconeogenesis and improve glucose uptake, and it may exert protective effects on pancreatic islet cells. Although metformin therapy produces substantial reductions in HbA1c, it does not produce body weight gain, is not associated with substantial risk for hypoglycaemia and has neutral to positive effects on lipids and blood pressure. The major adverse events associated with metformin are gastrointestinal. T2DM progresses even with initially effective monotherapy, and most patients will therefore receive combination therapy. When selecting agents to coadminister with metformin, a physician must consider efficacy in glycaemic control, safety, tolerability and any effects that may compromise overall efficacy (e.g. effects on body weight, lipids or blood pressure). In this regard, incretin-based therapies have characteristics that make them particularly suitable for add-on therapy with metformin.

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from 1950 to June 2010. Abstracts of identified articles were reviewed by two reviewers, and full texts were examined by two reviewers (J. A.H. and R. A.). For inclusion, trials were required to fulfill the following criteria: 1) be a randomized controlled design; 2) report data on participants with diabetes; 3) have a patient follow-up of at least 12 weeks; 4) have a treatment group of metformin monotherapy, or metformin as an add-on therapy; 5) have a placebo or background treatment comparator group; 6) randomize patients to a fixed dose of metformin; 7) blind patients to oral medications; 8) use the same metformin dose for each patient in the trial; and 9) use the same fixed dose of any other oral glucose-lowering medication used in combination with metformin in both the metformin and comparator arms.

### Quantifying the effect of metformin treatment and dose on glycemic control [^115bSq8g]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Metformin's known benefit in reducing cardiovascular mortality, as well as its neutral effects on body weight and low risk of hypoglycemia, has led to wide recommendations for routine prescribing. However, until now, it has not been clear how different patients may respond to treatment. By separately examining the effect of metformin treatment in various groups of patients, depending on their previous antidiabetes medication, we are providing a tool to assist decisions on treatment combinations and optimal doses.

This review demonstrates that metformin treatment can be used to reduce HbA 1c in all patients with type 2 diabetes regardless of prior antihyperglycemic medication or insulin treatment. Use of higher doses of metformin resulted in modestly higher decreases in HbA 1c compared with lower doses. Metformin use in type 1 diabetes may not, however, reduce HbA 1c. Despite this, there may be other indications for treating type 1 diabetic patients with metformin because a reduction in insulin dose required in the metformin arm of these trials was observed consistent with metformin's role as an insulin sensitizer.

Randomization and interventions.

We randomly assigned participants in a 1:1 randomization ratio to receive metformin hydrochloride or placebo, twice daily with meals. Investigators assigned consecutive code numbers to participants from prespecified lists stratified by race/ethnicity, sex, and degree of pubertal development. The CRC Pharmaceutical Development Section used permuted blocks with stratification to generate allocations that translated code numbers into study group assignments by using a pseudo-random number program and prepared identically appearing placebo and metformin (U.S.P. Grade; SST Corporation, Clifton, NJ) capsules (250 mg/capsule). Pharmacy personnel not involved with the conduct of the study dispensed study capsules in containers that differed only by participant code number. No participant, investigator, or other medical or nursing staff interacting with participants was aware of study group assignments during the trial.

Once baseline assessments were completed, subject's study medication dose was progressively increased according to a prespecified algorithm over a 3-week period, starting with 500 mg twice daily and increasing to a maximum dose of 1,000 mg twice daily. The typical adult maximum dose was selected as the goal because the weight of the severely obese participants to be enrolled (Table 1) was anticipated to be similar to that of adults. We decreased the dose by 250 mg/dose for 1 week when participants reported difficulty tolerating study medication and then attempted to increase it. Study medication dose was progressively lowered by 250 mg/day if a prescribed dosage could not be tolerated after a 7-day trial. Once a tolerated dose was found, attempts were made to increase the dosage prescribed. Study medication was discontinued if 250 mg/day was not tolerated. A daily chewable multivitamin (Flintstones Complete) containing 6 μg cyanocobalamin was also prescribed. After conclusion of the randomized phase, participants were prescribed increasing doses of commercially available metformin in two divided doses with a maximum dose of 2,000 mg/day plus a daily multivitamin for an additional 6 months.

### Continuing metformin when starting insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes: a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial [^111rRgfy]. Diabetic Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

To test the effect of continuing metformin on weight gain and glycaemic control in patients with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes who need to start insulin.

Methods

Patients with Type 2 diabetes on maximum tolerated oral agents referred for insulin conversion were recruited from hospital diabetes clinics into a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial. The 183 participants received metformin or placebo, titrated up to 2 g a day or maximum tolerated dose, with insulin started according to local practice. The main outcome measures were weight change over 12 months, HbA1c, insulin dose, frequency of hypoglycaemia, treatment satisfaction, and well-being.

Results

Over 12 months, metformin was associated with less weight gain than placebo [mean 6.1 kg vs. 7.6 kg; adjusted difference 1.5 kg (95% confidence interval 0.2–2.9); P = 0.02], a greater reduction in HbA1c[1.5% vs. 1.3%; adjusted difference 0.5% (0.1–0.9); P = 0.02] and a lower insulin requirement [62 units vs. 86; adjusted difference 25 units (15–34); P < 0.001], but also more hypoglycaemia [relative risk of any episode 1.24 (1.02–1.1); P = 0.03]. Treatment satisfaction improved more in patients on metformin than on placebo (P < 0.001), as did the positive well-being score (P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Metformin decreases weight gain, lowers insulin requirement, and improves glycaemic control, and should be continued in patients with Type 2 diabetes who transfer to insulin.

New users initiated metformin at > 0 mg to ≤ 500 mg (25%), > 500 mg to ≤ 1000 mg (47%), > 1000 mg to ≤ 1500 mg (17%) or > 1500 mg to ≤ 2000 mg (12%) daily (Figure 1 A). This distribution did not vary over time (Figure 1 A), but varied substantially at initiation by HbA1c: 48% of subjects with HbA1c ≥ 75 mmol/mol (9.0%) received an initial daily dose of > 1000 mg, but only 14% of subjects with HbA1c < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) did so (Figure 1 B). Given this variation by HbA1c level, we assessed whether the dose distribution differed over time in subjects who had not attained HbA1c targets of < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) and < 64 mmol/mol (8.0%) (Figure 1 C). In the subset of subjects with HbA1c ≥ 53 mmol/mol (7.0%), 39% received a metformin dose > 1000 mg at both 6 months and 12 months (compared to 31% of subjects in the combined study population at the same time points). In the subset of subjects with HbA1c ≥ 64 mmol/mol (8.0%), 48% received a metformin dose > 1000 mg at 6 months and 50% did so at 12 months.

### Optimizing metformin therapy in practice: tailoring therapy in specific patient groups to improve tolerability, efficacy and outcomes [^111L3rL8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Metformin is the first-line medication for type 2 diabetes. It is effective and safe, provided some caution is taken in specific populations. In patients with chronic kidney disease, metformin may provide long-term benefits, and it is a first-line therapy for diabetes, but the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) must be assessed regularly, to minimize the risk for metformin accumulation. When eGFR is 30–60mL/min/1.73m 2, the dose should be reconsidered, and sick-days education provided. Metformin should be discontinued when eGFR falls below 30mL/min/1.73m 2. Metformin accumulation may increase the risk for lactic acidosis if concomitant risk factors for hyperlactataemia (liver or respiratory insufficiency, sepsis, acute heart failure) are present; in these conditions, metformin is contraindicated, even although the available evidence is reassuring. Patients on metformin often complain of gastrointestinal side effects (mainly diarrhoea and nausea) during therapy initiation, but they may sometimes occur after years of stable therapy. These usually resolve if the dose is carefully titrated, or by switching to the extended-release formulation. Patients with obesity may benefit from the significant, although modest, metformin-associated weight loss and appetite reduction. During pregnancy, metformin is associated with a reduction of pregnancy complications, especially in obese women, but some concern remains, because metformin crosses the placenta, and it is associated with a significantly lower mean birth weight than insulin. In the elderly, gastrointestinal tolerability and renal function must be reassessed more often. Vitamin B-12 should be screened regularly in long-time metformin users because metformin may induce clinical vitamin B-12 deficiency.

### Dose distribution and up-titration patterns of metformin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113iJ1Eh]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

To assess the dose distribution among users of metformin monotherapy as well as the patterns of up-titration following initiation of therapy in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Materials and Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of adults with T2DM in the United Kingdom (UK). Metformin dose distribution was assessed at 0, 6 and 12 months in people initiating metformin monotherapy (new users) and cross-sectionally in people with ongoing metformin monotherapy (prevalent users). Patterns and predictors of up-titration were also analysed in new users. Dose distributions and treatment patterns were assessed descriptively; predictors of up-titration were determined using multivariable logistic regressions.

Results

Totals of 6174 new users and 8733 prevalent users were included. New users initiated metformin at > 0 mg to ≤ 500 mg (25%), > 500 mg to ≤ 1000 mg (47%), > 1000 mg to ≤ 1500 mg (17%) or > 1500 mg to ≤ 2000 mg (12%) daily. This distribution did not vary over time. Prevalent users of metformin received doses of > 0 mg to ≤ 500 mg (14%), > 500 mg to ≤ 1000 mg (40%), > 1000 mg to ≤ 1500 mg (15%), > 1500 mg to ≤ 2000 mg (29%) or > 2000 mg (1%) daily. Among new users of metformin, 6.7% and 10.8% had been up-titrated at 6 and 12 months, respectively, despite the majority having glycated haemoglobin > 53 mmol/mol. Predictors of up-titration included younger age and higher HbA1c.

Conclusions

A majority of T2DM patients taking metformin received a dose ≤ 1000 mg/day. Up-titration of metformin is infrequent in the first year postinitiation.

### Dose distribution and up-titration patterns of metformin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes [^116XTpfp]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This study showed that dosing of metformin monotherapy in people with T2DM in the United Kingdom is influenced by HbA1c levels, and in prevalent users, also by duration of disease. Up‐titration was infrequent in the first year postinitiation and was dependent on subject's age and HbA1c levels.

Metformin is widely prescribed for T2DM globally, particularly in Western countries. 13, 15, 23, 24, 25 Metformin lowers blood glucose levels by reducing the amount of glucose produced and released by the liver, and by increasing insulin sensitivity. 26 A major advantage of this therapy is weight stability or modest weight loss, in contrast to many other antihyperglycaemic medications. It may also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease outcomes. 27, 28 A recent US study found that up‐titration of metformin was as effective as adding a second T2DM drug in terms of the probability of glycaemic control after 6 months. 29 Despite these positive features of metformin therapy, optimization of the metformin dose appears to be infrequent.

The median time to up‐titration in the current study was around 175 days, regardless of HbA1c level. This suggests that up‐titration, if it happens, generally happens within the first 6 months of treatment. This is in accordance with international guidelines that recommend dose optimization over the first several weeks. 7, 8, 9 Studies of time to treatment intensification, that is, switching to another drug or adding a second drug, indicate that < 40% of people on metformin monotherapy intensify their treatment within the first year, 11, 18 with median times to initiation of second‐line therapy of 2‐2.3 years, 18, 19 suggesting there is a sufficiently long lag time between metformin initiation and the time to intensification during which to up‐titrate metformin. In most of our study population, however, this had not been done.

### Rosiglitazone maleate and metformin hydrochloride (Avandamet) [^111hL7VK]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Prior to prescribing AVANDAMET, refer to Indications and Usage (1) for appropriate patient selection.

2.1 Starting Dose

AVANDAMET is generally given in divided doses with meals.

All patients should start the rosiglitazone component of AVANDAMET at the lowest recommended dose. Further increases in the dose of rosiglitazone should be accompanied by careful monitoring for adverse events related to fluid retention [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

If therapy with a combination tablet containing rosiglitazone and metformin is considered appropriate for a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus, then the selection of the dose of AVANDAMET should be based on the patient's current doses of rosiglitazone and/or metformin.

To switch to AVANDAMET for patients currently treated with metformin, the usual starting dose of AVANDAMET is 4 mg rosiglitazone (total daily dose) plus the dose of metformin already being taken (see Table 1).

To switch to AVANDAMET for patients currently treated with rosiglitazone, the usual starting dose of AVANDAMET is 1,000 mg metformin (total daily dose) plus the dose of rosiglitazone already being taken (see Table 1).

When switching from combination therapy of rosiglitazone plus metformin as separate tablets, the usual starting dose of AVANDAMET is the dose of rosiglitazone and metformin already being taken.

aFor patients on doses of metformin between 1,000 and 2,000 mg/day, initiation of AVANDAMET requires individualization of therapy.

2.2 Dose Titration

AVANDAMET is generally given in divided doses with meals, with gradual dose escalation. This reduces gastrointestinal side effects (largely due to metformin) and permits determination of the minimum effective dose for the individual patient.

Sufficient time should be given to assess adequacy of therapeutic response. FPG should be used initially to determine the therapeutic response to AVANDAMET. If additional glycemic control is needed, the daily dose of AVANDAMET may be increased by increments of 4 mg rosiglitazone and/or 500 mg metformin.

After an increase in metformin dosage, dose titration is recommended if patients are not adequately controlled after 1 to 2 weeks. After an increase in rosiglitazone dosage, dose titration is recommended if patients are not adequately controlled after 8 to 12 weeks.

2.3 Maximum Dose

The maximum recommended total daily dose of AVANDAMET is 8 mg rosiglitazone (taken as 4 mg twice daily) and 2,000 mg metformin (taken as 1,000 mg twice daily).

Older adults with type 2 diabetes — metformin use, renal thresholds, monitoring, and tolerability are outlined: Metformin may be used safely in some people with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, and lower doses may be used in those with an eGFR 30–45 mL/min/1.73 m2, with eGFR monitored every 3 to 6 months in those at risk for decline in kidney function; it is contraindicated in advanced renal insufficiency and should be used with caution in hypoperfusion, hypoxemia, impaired hepatic function, or heart failure due to lactic acidosis risk; metformin may be temporarily discontinued before iodinated-contrast procedures, during hospitalizations, and when acute illness may compromise renal or liver function; the daily dose should be slowly increased to minimize gastrointestinal side effects, reduction or elimination may be needed for persistent gastrointestinal side effects, and monitoring for vitamin B12 deficiency should be considered for long-term use; an extended-release formulation may be used as an alternative to immediate-release in older adults with difficulties maintaining medication plans or with gastrointestinal effects.

### Personalizing guidelines for diabetes management: twilight or dawn of the expert? [^111PKqb5]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This opinion article on the management of type 2 diabetes considers the old and new format of guidelines and critical changes in the character of such guidelines. We highlight limitations of the guidelines and make recommendations for how treatment can be more personalised.

Discussion

Published guidelines for the management of adult-onset non-insulin requiring diabetes have adopted a formulaic approach to patient management that can be overseen centrally and delivered by personnel with limited training. Recently, guidelines have taken a patient-centered, multiple risk-factor approach. Importantly, local funding issues are considered, but drive the final action and not the decision-making process. The nature of the disease can be determined by laboratory tests, including screening for diabetes-associated autoantibodies. The strategy remains step-up, with intensification of drug or insulin dose. As with past guidelines, there is an assumption that in each patient with type 2 diabetes, metformin is used initially, but targets and therapies then veer in different directions to create a matrix of options based on the features and responses of each individual. Factors to consider include: (A)ge, (B)ody weight, (C)omplications and co-morbidities, Diabetes (D)uration and (E)xpense, but also patient preference and patient response.

Summary

Guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes have important limitations and a patient-centered, multiple target, multiple therapy approach is proposed.

### Metformin hydrochloride er (metformin hydrochloride) [^111FRBWX]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes with metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP or any other pharmacologic agent. Dosage of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance, while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose. The maximum recommended daily dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP is 2550 mg in adults and 2000 mg in pediatric patients (10–16 years of age); the maximum recommended daily dose of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP in adults is 2000 mg.

Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP should be given in divided doses with meals while metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP should generally be given once daily with the evening meal. Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation, both to reduce gastrointestinal side effects and to permit identification of the minimum dose required for adequate glycemic control of the patient. During treatment initiation and dose titration (see Recommended Dosing Schedule), fasting plasma glucose should be used to determine the therapeutic response to metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP and identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, glycosylated hemoglobin should be measured at intervals of approximately three months. The therapeutic goal should be to decrease both fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels to normal or near normal by using the lowest effective dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP, either when used as monotherapy or in combination with sulfonylurea or insulin.

### Understanding and overcoming metformin gastrointestinal intolerance [^113GFUmb]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Metformin is the most widely prescribed drug for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and the first-line pharmacological option as supported by multiple international guidelines, yet a rather large proportion of patients cannot tolerate metformin in adequate amounts because of its associated gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs). GI AEs typically encountered with metformin therapy include diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, indigestion, vomiting and abdominal discomfort, with diarrhoea and nausea being the most common. Although starting at a low dose and titrating slowly may help prevent some GI AEs associated with metformin, some patients are unable to tolerate metformin at all and it may also be difficult to convince patients to start metformin again after a bout of GI AEs. Despite this clinical importance, the underlying mechanisms of the GI intolerance associated with metformin are poorly known. In the present review, we discuss: the epidemiology of metformin-associated GI intolerance and its underlying mechanisms; genotype variability and associated factors affecting metformin GI intolerance, such as comorbidities, co-medications and bariatric surgery; clinical consequences and therapeutic strategies to overcome metformin GI intolerance. These strategies include appropriate titration of immediate-release metformin, use of extended-release metformin, the promise of delayed-release metformin and gut microbiome modulators, as well as alternative pharmacological therapies when metformin cannot be tolerated at all. Given the available data, all efforts should be made to maintain metformin before considering a shift to another drug therapy.

### Dose distribution and up-titration patterns of metformin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes [^117EW81D]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aims

To assess the dose distribution among users of metformin monotherapy as well as the patterns of up‐titration following initiation of therapy in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Materials and Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of adults with T2DM in the United Kingdom (UK). Metformin dose distribution was assessed at 0, 6 and 12 months in people initiating metformin monotherapy (new users) and cross‐sectionally in people with ongoing metformin monotherapy (prevalent users). Patterns and predictors of up‐titration were also analysed in new users. Dose distributions and treatment patterns were assessed descriptively; predictors of up‐titration were determined using multivariable logistic regressions.

Results

Totals of 6174 new users and 8733 prevalent users were included. New users initiated metformin at > 0 mg to ≤ 500 mg (25%), > 500 mg to ≤ 1000 mg (47%), > 1000 mg to ≤ 1500 mg (17%) or > 1500 mg to ≤ 2000 mg (12%) daily. This distribution did not vary over time. Prevalent users of metformin received doses of > 0 mg to ≤ 500 mg (14%), > 500 mg to ≤ 1000 mg (40%), > 1000 mg to ≤ 1500 mg (15%), > 1500 mg to ≤ 2000 mg (29%) or > 2000 mg (1%) daily. Among new users of metformin, 6.7% and 10.8% had been up‐titrated at 6 and 12 months, respectively, despite the majority having glycated haemoglobin > 53 mmol/mol. Predictors of up‐titration included younger age and higher HbA1c.

Conclusions

A majority of T2DM patients taking metformin received a dose ≤ 1000 mg/day. Up‐titration of metformin is infrequent in the first year postinitiation.

Type 2 diabetes — metformin renal use parameters and monitoring: Metformin should not be used in persons with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and should not be initiated if eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2; however, once started it can continue in persons with stable eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, with reduction in total daily dose prudent when eGFR is between 30 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. Metformin is sometimes associated with anorexia and weight loss and may cause gastrointestinal adverse effects, and longer-term use may be associated with vitamin B12 deficiency for which B12 levels should be monitored periodically. When metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, acceptable alternatives include GLP-1 RAs, SGLT2is, DPP-4 inhibitors, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Individualize the starting dosage based on the patient's current regimen. (2.1)
Given orally twice daily with food. (2.1)
Adjust the dosage based on effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dosage of 25 mg alogliptin and 2000 mg metformin HCl. (2.1)
Prior to initiation, assess renal function with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). (2.2)
Do not use in patients with eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.
KAZANO may need to be discontinued at time of, or prior to, iodinated contrast imaging procedures. (2.3)

2.1	Recommended Dosage

Individualize the starting dosage of KAZANO based on the patient's current regimen.
KAZANO should be taken orally twice daily with food with gradual dose escalation to reduce the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects due to metformin. Do not split tablets.
Adjust the dosage based on effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 25 mg alogliptin and 2000 mg metformin hydrochloride (HCl).

2.2 Recommendations for Use in Renal Impairment

Assess renal function prior to initiation of KAZANO and periodically thereafter.

KAZANO is contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

KAZANO is not recommended in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 59 mL/min/1.73 m2because these patients require a lower daily dosage of alogliptin than what is available in the fixed combination KAZANO product.

Kazano requires no dose adjustment in patients with an eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73 m2or greater.

2.3 Discontinuation for Iodinated Contrast Imaging Procedures

Discontinue KAZANO at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure; restart KAZANO if renal function is stable [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^116Ytq72]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Step 2: addition of a second medication.

If lifestyle intervention and the maximal tolerated dose of metformin fail to achieve or sustain the glycemic goals, another medication should be added within 2–3 months of the initiation of therapy or at any time when the target A1C level is not achieved. Another medication may also be necessary if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated. The consensus regarding the second medication added to metformin was to choose either insulin or a sulfonylurea (Fig. 2). As discussed above, the A1C level will determine in part which agent is selected next, with consideration given to the more effective glycemia-lowering agent, insulin, for patients with an A1C level of > 8.5% or with symptoms secondary to ehyperglycemia. Insulin can be initiated with a basal (intermediate- or long-acting) insulin (see Fig. 1 for suggested initial insulin regimens). However, many newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients will usually respond to oral medications, even if symptoms of ehyperglycemia are present.

Step 3: further adjustments.

If lifestyle, metformin, and sulfonylurea or basal insulin do not result in achievement of target glycemia, the next step should be to start, or intensify, insulin therapy (Fig. 1). Intensification of insulin therapy usually consists of additional injections that might include a short- or rapid-acting insulin given before selected meals to reduce postprandial glucose excursions (Fig. 1). When insulin injections are started, insulin secretagogues (sulfonylurea or glinides) should be discontinued, or tapered and then discontinued, since they are not considered to be synergistic. Although addition of a third oral agent can be considered, especially if the A1C level is close to target (A1C < 8.0%), this approach is usually not preferred, as it is no more effective in lowering glycemia, and is more costly, than initiating or intensifying insulin.

### Quantifying the effect of metformin treatment and dose on glycemic control [^116vrtAK]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Metformin is the first-line oral medication recommended for glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. We reviewed the literature to quantify the effect of metformin treatment on glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels in all types of diabetes and examine the impact of differing doses on glycemic control.

Research Design and Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched from 1950 to June 2010 for trials of at least 12 weeks' duration in which diabetic patients were treated with either metformin monotherapy or as an add-on therapy. Data on change in HbA(1c) were pooled in a meta-analysis. Data from dose-comparison trials were separately pooled.

Results

A total of 35 trials were identified for the main analysis and 7 for the dose-comparison analysis. Metformin monotherapy lowered HbA(1c) by 1.12% (95% CI 0.92–1.32; I(2) = 80%) versus placebo, metformin added to oral therapy lowered HbA(1c) by 0.95% (0.77–1.13; I(2) = 77%) versus placebo added to oral therapy, and metformin added to insulin therapy lowered HbA(1c) by 0.60% (0.30–0.91; I(2) = 79.8%) versus insulin only. There was a significantly greater reduction in HbA(1c) using higher doses of metformin compared with lower doses of metformin with no significant increase in side effects.

Conclusions

Evidence supports the effectiveness of metformin therapy in a clinically important lowering of HbA(1c) used as monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutic agents. There is potential for using higher doses of metformin to maximize glycemic control in diabetic patients without increasing gastrointestinal effects.

The recommended starting dosage of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients who need 5 mg of saxagliptin and who are not currently treated with metformin HCl is one saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablet containing 5 mg saxagliptin and 500 mg metformin HCl extended-release once daily with gradual dose escalation to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects due to metformin HCl.

In patients treated with metformin HCl, the recommended starting dosage of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should provide metformin HCl at the dose already being taken, or the nearest therapeutically appropriate dose. Following a switch from metformin HCl immediate-release to saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, closely monitor glycemic control and adjust the dosage accordingly.

Patients who need 2.5 mg saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCl extended-release may be treated with saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets 2.5 mg/1,000 mg. Patients who need 2.5 mg saxagliptin who are either metformin HCl naive or who require a dose of metformin HCl higher than 1,000 mg should use the individual components.

Gradually titrate the dosage of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, as needed, after assessing therapeutic response and tolerability, up to a maximum recommended dosage of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets (5 mg for saxagliptin and 2,000 mg for metformin HCl extended-release orally once daily).

Inform patients that saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets must be swallowed whole and never crushed, cut, or chewed. Occasionally, the inactive ingredients of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets will be eliminated in the feces as a soft, hydrated mass that may resemble the original tablet.

If a dose is missed, advise patients not to take an extra dose. Resume treatment with the next dose.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^115TcJLY]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Initial drug therapy.

It is generally agreed that metformin, if not contraindicated and if tolerated, is the preferred and most cost-effective first agent (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs.). It is initiated at, or soon after, diagnosis, especially in patients in whom lifestyle intervention alone has not achieved, or is unlikely to achieve, HbA 1c goals. Because of frequent gastrointestinal side effects, it should be started at a low dose with gradual titration. Patients with a high baseline HbA 1c (e.g. ≥ 9.0%) have a low probability of achieving a near-normal target with monotherapy. It may therefore be justified to start directly with a combination of two noninsulin agents or with insulin itself in this circumstance. If a patient presents with significant hyperglycemic symptoms and/or has dramatically elevated plasma glucose concentrations (e.g. > 16.7–19.4 mmol/L [> 300–350 mg/dL]) or HbA 1c (e.g. ≥ 10.0–12.0%), insulin therapy should be strongly considered from the outset. Such treatment is mandatory when catabolic features are exhibited or, of course, if ketonuria is demonstrated, the latter reflecting profound insulin deficiency. Importantly, unless there is evidence of type 1 diabetes, once symptoms are relieved, glucotoxicity resolved, and the metabolic state stabilized, it may be possible to taper insulin partially or entirely, transferring to noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents, perhaps in combination.

### Sitagliptin and metformin hydrochloride (Zituvimet) [^115UgsqG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosage

Take ZITUVIMET orally twice daily with meals.
Individualize the dosage of ZITUVIMET on the basis of the patient's current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability.
The maximum recommended daily dose is 100 mg of sitagliptin and 2,000 mg of metformin hydrochloride (HCl).
Do not split or divide ZITUVIMET tablets.
The recommended starting dose in patients not currently treated with metformin is 50 mg sitagliptin and 500 mg metformin HCl twice daily, with gradual dose escalation recommended to reduce gastrointestinal side effects associated with metformin.
The starting dose in patients already treated with metformin should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) and the dose of metformin already being taken. For patients taking metformin HCl 850 mg twice daily, the recommended starting dose of ZITUVIMET is 50 mg sitagliptin and 1,000 mg metformin HCl twice daily.

2.2 Recommendations for Use in Renal Impairment

Assess renal function prior to initiation of ZITUVIMET and periodically thereafter.
ZITUVIMET is contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
ZITUVIMET is not recommended in patients with an eGFR between 30 and less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2because these patients require a lower dosage of sitagliptin than what is available in the fixed combination ZITUVIMET product.

2.3 Discontinuation for Iodinated Contrast Imaging Procedures

Discontinue ZITUVIMET at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure; restart ZITUVIMET if renal function is stable [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Synthesis of Results

Efficacy Outcomes

Mean Change in FPG

Ten studies (n = 2855) reported either change in FPG or start-and-finish FPG concentrations over 33 separate groups. Of these, two groups were intermediate measurements of the same participants, so 31 groups (n = 2499) were included in meta-analysis (9 met-IR, 15 met-XR, 7 met-DR). When summary measures were calculated using comparable dosages (1000–1500 mg), there was no significant difference between the efficacy of met-IR, met-XR or met-DR in changing FPG (p = 0.928, Fig. 1); met-IR, − 22.90 ± 21.70 mg/dl (1.30 ± 1.20 mmol/l): met-XR, − 21.90 ± 9.90 mg/dl (1.2 ± 0.6 mmol/l); met-DR, − 20.00 ± 5.60 mg/dl (1.10 ± 0.30 mmol/l).

Fig. 1
Effect of metformin formulations (met-XR, met-IR and met-DR) upon mean fasting plasma glucose concentrations (mg/dl) measured at the start and at the end of the study. Metformin doses range between 600 mg per day to 2000 mg. Summary measures expressed as doses between 1000 and 1500 mg per day. Mean difference and 95% confidence intervals

All 33 groups were included in meta-regression (10 met-IR, 16 met-XR, 7 met-DR, n = 2855). Met-IR was only reported at two doses, so meta-regression could not reasonably be performed. There was significant dose-dependency of change in FPG for both met-DR and met-XR. For every 1000 mg dose, FPG decreased by 0.90 ± 0.40 mmol/l (15.60 ± 7.70 mg/dl; p < 0.05) with met-XR and 1.00 ± 0.40 mmol/l (18.1 ± 6.4 mg/dl; p < 0.01) with met-XR (Fig. 2).

Glyburide and Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP Use in Patients with Inadequate Glycemic Control on Diet and Exercise

Recommended starting dose: 1.25 mg/250 mg once or twice daily with meals

For patients with type 2 diabetes whose hyperglycemia cannot be satisfactorily managed with diet and exercise alone, the recommended starting dose of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets USP is 1.25 mg/250 mg once a day with a meal. As initial therapy in patients with baseline HbA1c > 9% or an FPG > 200 mg/dL, a starting dose of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets USP 1.25 mg/250 mg twice daily with the morning and evening meals may be used. Dosage increases should be made in increments of 1.25 mg/250 mg per day every two weeks up to the minimum effective dose necessary to achieve adequate control of blood glucose. In clinical trials of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets USP as initial therapy, there was no experience with total daily doses greater than 10 mg/2000 mg per day. Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets USP 5 mg/500 mg should not be used as initial therapy due to an increased risk of hypoglycemia.

### Metformin action: concentrations matter [^112iTgjn]. Cell Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Metformin has been used for nearly a century and is now the most widely prescribed oral anti-diabetic agent worldwide. Yet how metformin acts remains only partially understood and controversial. One key reason may be that almost all previous studies were conducted with supra-pharmacological concentrations (doses) of metformin, 10–100 times higher than maximally achievable therapeutic concentrations found in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Metformin: an old but still the best treatment for type 2 diabetes [^112Jt9qU]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

The management of T2DM requires aggressive treatment to achieve glycemic and cardiovascular risk factor goals. In this setting, metformin, an old and widely accepted first line agent, stands out not only for its antihyperglycemic properties but also for its effects beyond glycemic control such as improvements in endothelial dysfunction, hemostasis and oxidative stress, insulin resistance, lipid profiles, and fat redistribution. These properties may have contributed to the decrease of adverse cardiovascular outcomes otherwise not attributable to metformin's mere antihyperglycemic effects. Several other classes of oral antidiabetic agents have been recently launched, introducing the need to evaluate the role of metformin as initial therapy and in combination with these newer drugs. There is increasing evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies supporting its anti-proliferative role in cancer and possibly a neuroprotective effect. Metformin's negligible risk of hypoglycemia in monotherapy and few drug interactions of clinical relevance give this drug a high safety profile. The tolerability of metformin may be improved by using an appropiate dose titration, starting with low doses, so that side-effects can be minimized or by switching to an extended release form. We reviewed the role of metformin in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and describe the additional benefits beyond its glycemic effect. We also discuss its potential role for a variety of insulin resistant and pre-diabetic states, obesity, metabolic abnormalities associated with HIV disease, gestational diabetes, cancer, and neuroprotection.

Key messages

- Optimising metformin therapy is hindered by multiple daily dosing and persistent gastrointestinal side effects in some patients.

- Extended release metformin is associated with better tolerability and is preferred by patients when given the choice.

- Better compliance will lead to fewer long-term complications and better health outcomes.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^117WzJKy]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

Glucose-centric algorithm for glycemic control (persons without established or high ASCVD/HF/stroke/TIA/CKD risk) — initial therapy and escalation: Metformin should be initiated if there is no contraindication (eg, eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2) and started at a low dose titrated over a few weeks to the maximally tolerated dose. Given T2D progression, many will need a second antihyperglycemic medication to reach targets, which usually occurs within 3 months. Agents such as GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i are associated with low risk of hypoglycemia unless combined with insulin or sulfonylureas. Patients often present with > 1 treatment-shaping factor; in those with overweight/obesity and a weight-loss goal, oral GLP-1 RA, GLP-1 RA, or SGLT2i are preferred options. For cost/access constraints, a TZD, SU, or glinide would be more economical. Patients with symptomatic hyperglycemia and/or an A1C > 10% should start basal insulin; basal can be initiated with or without a GLP-1 RA, and some may need simultaneous bolus insulin.

Q11. When using a triple regimen of metformin + DPP‐4i + SGLT2i, should FDCs formulation be preferred?

Recommendation 11: FDCs can simplify treatment and improve adherence, but they lack dosing flexibility and should be discontinued if one component is not tolerated.FDCs of metformin + DPP‐4i + SGLT2i are recommended with careful consideration of their advantages and limitations. Available options include (1) triple FDCs (metformin + DPP‐4i + SGLT2i), (2) dual FDCs (metformin + DPP‐4i) plus SGLT2i, and (3) dual FDCs (metformin + SGLT2i) plus DPP‐4i. (Grade A; strong recommendation [agreement rate: 100%]).

Explanation 11: FDCs combine two or more medications with different mechanisms of action at fixed doses in a single tablet. FDCs have advantages of greater efficacy and lower risk of adverse events than high‐dose monotherapy, simplifying treatment, improving adherence, reducing therapeutic inertia, especially in patients with delayed initiation of combination therapy. FDCs are also cost‐effective. Potential disadvantages include limited dose adjustment flexibility of single medication and difficulty in attributing adverse events to a specific medication. In clinical practice, these advantages and limitations should be carefully considered to ensure the safe and effective use of FDCs. Table 3 summarizes currently approved dual and triple FDCs of metformin + DPP‐4i + SGLT2i in China.

### Pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride (actoplus Met) [^1151tJnx]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

General

The use of antihyperglycemic therapy in the management of type 2 diabetes should be individualized on the basis of effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of pioglitazone 45 mg and metformin 2550 mg.

Dosage Recommendations

Selecting the starting dose of ACTOPLUS MET should be based on the patient's current regimen of pioglitazone and/or metformin. After initiation of ACTOPLUS MET or with dose increase, patients should be carefully monitored for adverse events related to fluid retention (see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS, Pioglitazone hydrochloride). ACTOPLUS MET should be given in divided daily doses with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects associated with metformin.

Starting dose for patients inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy

Based on the usual starting dose of pioglitazone (15–30 mg daily), ACTOPLUS MET may be initiated at either the 15 mg/500 mg or 15 mg/850 mg tablet strength once or twice daily, and gradually titrated after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response.

Starting dose for patients who initially responded to pioglitazone monotherapy and require additional glycemic control

Based on the usual starting doses of metformin (500 mg twice daily or 850 mg daily), ACTOPLUS MET may be initiated at either the 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg tablet strength once daily, and gradually titrated after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response.

Starting dose for patients switching from combination therapy of pioglitazone plus metformin as separate tablets

ACTOPLUS MET may be initiated with either the 15 mg/500 mg or 15 mg/850 mg tablet strengths based on the dose of pioglitazone and metformin already being taken.

No studies have been performed specifically examining the safety and efficacy of ACTOPLUS MET in patients previously treated with other oral hypoglycemic agents and switched to ACTOPLUS MET. Any change in therapy of type 2 diabetes should be undertaken with care and appropriate monitoring as changes in glycemic control can occur.

Sufficient time should be given to assess adequacy of therapeutic response. Ideally, the response to therapy should be evaluated using A1C, which is a better indicator of long-term glycemic control than FPG alone. A1C reflects glycemia over the past two to three months. In clinical use, it is recommended that patients be treated with ACTOPLUS MET for a period of time adequate to evaluate change in A1C (8–12 weeks) unless glycemic control as measured by FPG deteriorates.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Participants

Eligible participants were insulin-naïve adults (18–80 years) with type 2 diabetes treated for ≥ 3 months with ≥ 1,500 mg/day metformin and A1C values of 7.0–10.0% or with metformin and sulfonylurea (less than or equal to half of the maximum approved dose) and A1C values of 7.0–8.5%.

Trial design and interventions

The trial was conducted in 202 office- or hospital-based sites in Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the U.K. and the U.S. between 3 March 2009 and 19 April 2010. Protocol amendments occurring after the study start are summarized in the. Protocol, amendments, and informed consent documents were approved by independent local ethics committees and implemented according to good clinical practice and the Declaration of Helsinki.

This 38-week, open-label trial comprised a 12-week run-in followed by a 26-week, randomized, two-armed, parallel-group period for participants not achieving < 7% A1C. At run-in start, sulfonylurea was discontinued (in approximately one-third of participants), and liraglutide was initiated in 0.6-mg/day weekly increments to a final 1.8-mg/day dose (Fig. 1 A). The metformin dose remained unchanged.

### Medication safety and chronic kidney disease in older adults prescribed metformin: a cross-sectional analysis [^112oJKFf]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Medication safety in older adults is a growing concern, particularly in those with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although new CKD estimating equations such as the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula are available, pharmacists tasked with the delivery of medications tend to use the older Cockcroft-Gault formula to estimate CKD according to pharmaceutical manufacturer recommendations. Metformin is an effective medication commonly prescribed to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, but its use is potentially limited in adults ≥ 65 years of age due to increased prevalence of CKD. The American Geriatrics Society recently recommended using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to guide metformin use in older adults with diabetes: metformin should not be used when eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and lower dosages are recommended for eGFR 30–60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, with more frequent kidney function monitoring. Current U.S. drug labeling includes "renal impairment" (defined as "serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL [133 μmol/L] [males] or 1.4 mg/dL [124 μmol/L] [females] or an abnormal creatinine clearance") as a contraindication to using metformin. Additional precautions for older adults recommend "conservative" dosing, and to only start metformin in adults ≥ 80 years of age if creatinine clearance is normal. A black box warning was issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regarding the increased risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis with older age as well as impaired kidney function, though metformin-associated lactic acidosis is a rare complication. Thus, older adults are at higher risk of developing adverse events when using metformin due to underlying impaired kidney function.

### Randomized trial of metformin with anti-tuberculosis drugs for early sputum conversion in adults with pulmonary tuberculosis [^1161qHxh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

A higher frequency of mild nausea and vomiting that subsided after a week was encountered in the metformin arm. As metformin is known to cause gastrointestinal adverse events, it is suggested that a loading dose be given for a week before the full dose is started.

Limitations of our study include use of a single dose of metformin as adjuvant therapy with ATT. The smaller dose used here may have failed to detect any association with time to sputum culture conversion. Higher doses could influence the time to culture conversion. Second, as metformin is pitched as host-directed adjuvant therapy to ATT, estimating inflammatory markers and its effect on structural (computed tomography scan) and functional changes (pulmonary function test) in the lung could have been studied in a larger group.

In conclusion, this study showed that adding 1g of metformin to the standard ATT for 8 weeks did not shorten the time to sputum culture conversion in adult sputum-positive PTB patients. However, it was associated with faster resolution of the cavity on chest X-ray and reduced plasma inflammatory markers, which may result in fewer post-TB sequelae. Adjunctive therapy with host-modulating agents such as metformin should be useful in shortening the duration of TB treatment if a balance can be struck between the antimicrobial effect and host inflammation that can mitigate TB sequelae.

Glipizide and Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets in Patients with Inadequate Glycemic Control on a Sulfonylurea and/or Metformin

For patients not adequately controlled on either glipizide (or another sulfonylurea) or metformin alone, the recommended starting dose of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets is 2.5 mg/500 mg or 5 mg/500 mg twice daily with the morning and evening meals. In order to avoid hypoglycemia, the starting dose of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should not exceed the daily doses of glipizide or metformin already being taken. The daily dose should be titrated in increments of no more than 5 mg/500 mg up to the minimum effective dose to achieve adequate control of blood glucose or to a maximum dose of 20 mg/2000 mg per day.

Patients previously treated with combination therapy of glipizide (or another sulfonylurea) plus metformin may be switched to glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets 2.5 mg/500 mg or 5 mg/500 mg; the starting dose should not exceed the daily dose of glipizide (or equivalent dose of another sulfonylurea) and metformin already being taken. The decision to switch to the nearest equivalent dose or to titrate should be based on clinical judgment. Patients should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia following such a switch and the dose of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be titrated as described above to achieve adequate control of blood glucose.

For patients not adequately controlled on either glyburide (or another sulfonylurea) or metformin alone, the recommended starting dose of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets USP is 2.5 mg/500 mg or 5 mg/500 mg twice daily with the morning and evening meals. In order to avoid hypoglycemia, the starting dose of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets USP should not exceed the daily doses of glyburide or metformin already being taken. The daily dose should be titrated in increments of no more than 5 mg/500 mg up to the minimum effective dose to achieve adequate control of blood glucose or to a maximum dose of 20 mg/2000 mg per day.

For patients previously treated with combination therapy of glyburide (or another sulfonylurea) plus metformin, if switched to glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets USP, the starting dose should not exceed the daily dose of glyburide (or equivalent dose of another sulfonylurea) and metformin already being taken. Patients should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia following such a switch and the dose of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets USP should be titrated as described above to achieve adequate control of blood glucose.

Addition of Thiazolidinediones to Glyburide and Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP Therapy

For patients not adequately controlled on glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets USP, a thiazolidinedione can be added to glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets USP therapy. When a thiazolidinedione is added to glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets USP therapy, the current dose of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets USP can be continued and the thiazolidinedione initiated at its recommended starting dose. For patients needing additional glycemic control, the dose of the thiazolidinedione can be increased based on its recommended titration schedule. The increased glycemic control attainable with glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets USP plus a thiazolidinedione may increase the potential for hypoglycemia at any time of day. In patients who develop hypoglycemia when receiving glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets USP and a thiazolidinedione, consideration should be given to reducing the dose of the glyburide component of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets USP. As clinically warranted, adjustment of the dosages of the other components of the antidiabetic regimen should also be considered.

### Pioglitazone and metformin [^1138yrJP]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

2.1 Recommendations for All Patients

Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be taken with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects associated with metformin.

If therapy with a combination tablet containing pioglitazone and metformin is considered appropriate the recommended starting dose is:

- 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability,
- for patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class I or Class II congestive heart failure: 15 mg/500 mg or 15 mg/850 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability,
- **For patients inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy**: 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg once or twice daily (depending on the dose of metformin already being taken) and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability,
- **For patients inadequately controlled on pioglitazone monotherapy**: 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability,
- for patients who are changing from combination therapy of pioglitazone plus metformin as separate tablets: Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be taken at doses that are as close as possible to the dose of pioglitazone and metformin already being taken.

Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets may be titrated up to a maximum daily dose of 45 mg of pioglitazone and 2550 mg of metformin.

Metformin doses above 2000 mg may be better tolerated given 3 times a day.

After initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets or with dose increase, monitor patients carefully for adverse reactions related to fluid retention such as weight gain, edema, and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. Liver tests (serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) should be obtained prior to initiating pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets. Routine periodic monitoring of liver tests during treatment with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets are not recommended in patients without liver disease. Patients who have liver test abnormalities prior to initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets or who are found to have abnormal liver tests while taking pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be managed as described under Warnings and Precautions [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].

### A review of insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes: is there a place for adjunctive metformin? [^111R5rUg]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Trial Evidence of Metformin in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes

Initial small uncontrolled studies of metformin in type 1 diabetics reported a reduction in insulin dose by almost 25% and a modest reduction in weight, with a variable effect on glycemia and lipids. Metformin was compared to placebo as an adjunct to CSII in 62 T1D patients and resulted in a significant reduction in the total daily insulin dose, basal insulin dose, total and LDL cholesterol after 6 months. There was no change in HbA1c or risk of hypoglycemia, but there was an increased incidence of gastrointestinal side effects. Lund et al. evaluated the effect of metformin versus placebo in 100 patients and found no improvement in HbA1c over 1 year. There was, however, a sustained reduction in weight and insulin dose. Forty percent of participants reported gastrointestinal side effects, but very few discontinued treatment. Hypoglycemia incidence, including severe hypoglycemia, was greater with metformin than placebo. In their meta-analysis of five trials, Pang and Narendran (2008) reported a small but significant reduction in HbA1c (−0.27%), moderate reduction in insulin dose and improvement in total cholesterol, but no benefit in weight with metformin in type 1 diabetics who had BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2 or had insulin resistance (insulin dose > 0.9 U/kg).

The systematic review of nine trials by Vella et al. found a decrease in insulin dose (5.7–10.1 U/day in 6 of 7 studies), HbA1c (0.6–0.9% in 4 of 7 studies), weight (1.7–6 kg in 3 of 6 studies) and total cholesterol (0.3–0.41 mmol/l in 3 of 7 studies). In the five randomized, double-blind trials that had adequate data for combined effect estimates, metformin use in adolescents and adults resulted in a significant reduction in insulin dose requirements (6.6 U/day, p < 0.001) and weight reduction in some trials, but no consistent evidence for HbA1c reduction (absolute reduction 0.11%, p 0.42). Metformin was well tolerated, gastrointestinal side effects were minimal, and there was a slight increased trend towards hypoglycemia.

### Safety and feasibility trial protocol of metformin in infants after perinatal brain injury [^116FcQUz]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Intervention

Infants are a unique population for drug dosing due to rapid changes in body composition, expression and function of metabolic liver enzymes, and renal drug clearance. These factors lead to, compared with older children and adults, different behaviours of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. The selection of the appropriate drug dose is a critical component of a successful neonatal trial, as underdosing could lead to insufficient drug-to-target exposure and lack of efficacy, while overdosing could lead to toxicity. Therefore, members of our study team established a first-of-its-kind neonatal model of metformin pharmacokinetics (PK) to facilitate the design of a drug dosing scheme that will maximise the likelihood of efficacy while minimising the risk of toxicity. We performed physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling to identify an appropriate starting dose and scaled a published and qualified adult PBPK model of metformin to an infant population of 3-month-olds, with subsequent use for dose determination. Virtual children were created using appropriate anatomy and physiology, and, particularly with metformin for which MATE1, PMAT, OCT1 and OCT2 play a key role in clearance, the ontogeny of these transporters was incorporated. To evaluate the ability of the scaled adult model to predict paediatric PK, a clinical trial in 9-year-olds for whom PK was assessed empirically was recapitulated; the mean (n = 4) observed plasma concentration time profiles was within the 90th prediction interval. To establish the target dose for the proposed study, the steady state area under the curve (AUC) following daily oral metformin dosing (1000 mg/m 2 metformin-HCL) in a population of 8–20-year-olds for whom metformin was found to be efficacious for neuroprotection was simulated. This AUC was used to derive a weight-normalised metformin dose, in the fed and fasted states, that would achieve the target exposure at steady state in a group of 100 virtual 3-month-olds. To achieve the same exposure as in Ayoub et al, a dose of 32 mg/kg metformin-HCl would be required.

### Dose distribution and up-titration patterns of metformin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes [^115NZzDK]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Inadequate dosing of metformin limits its therapeutic efficacy. In an ethnically diverse sample of 128 T2DM patients in the United Kingdom, a lack of titration of oral antihyperglycaemic agents was identified as one of several reasons for HbA1c levels being > 86 mmol/mol (10.0%). 31 However, reduced efficacy may also stem from nonadherence to an optimized treatment regimen. Previous studies have found that adherence to metformin is lower than to other oral antihyperglycaemic therapies 32, 33 and that poor adherence to metformin is associated with poor glycaemic control. 31, 32 Thus, both clinical inertia on the part of physicians and nonadherent patient behaviours may contribute to treatment failure on metformin monotherapy. Based on our finding that up‐titration rates increased significantly across the range of HbA1c values from < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) to ≥ 75 mmol/mol (9.0%), physicians are attuned to the need to optimize the metformin dose to attain glycaemic control. They may also need to be reminded that the extended‐release formulation of metformin can reduce gastrointestinal side effects 34 and increase patient adherence. 35

4.1 Limitations

This analysis was subject to the typical limitations of electronic health data, most notably the potential for miscoding, misdiagnosis and underdiagnosis in the CPRD database. Secondly, although the database captures prescription information, prescription fills, physician instructions and medication‐taking behaviour are not recorded. As a result, the prescription data alone cannot fully explain treatment adherence. In addition, the data available in the CPRD database do not allow us to reliably track fixed‐dose combinations or determine whether the highest dose a subject had been prescribed was their true "maximum tolerable" dose of metformin. Tolerability issues due to metformin therapy, such as gastrointestinal events, were not captured (ie not available), although renal function was recorded as the eGFR and was the focus of the sensitivity analysis described above. Thirdly, most CPRD data were collected from primary care physicians and do not include diagnoses made and treatment used during hospitalizations or by specialists. As a result, serious comorbid conditions that required inpatient services or specialist care, or prescriptions written by specialists, may not have been recorded. Finally, the requirement that all subjects have an HbA1c measurement available within 6 months prior to their index date and have reliable metformin dose information available at the index date biased the population towards a well‐documented data set and limits the generalizability of the findings to the T2DM population as a whole.

### Triaging and initial treatment in the patient with suspected type 2 diabetes [^114ngiEQ]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Initial insulin titration protocol — suspected type 2 diabetes (T2D) directs early testing and stepwise therapy as follows: Order pancreatic autoantibodies at diagnosis and if + add MDI. Is patient already on MDI? If yes: Stop short-acting insulin; ensure initial long-acting dose is optimized (0.5 units/kg); and start metformin, to be titrated to 2000 mg daily, and check BG 2x daily (fasting, post-prandial). If no: Is HbA1c ≥ 8.5% OR ketosis present; if yes: Start long-acting (LA) insulin (0.5 units/kg) and start metformin, to be titrated to 2000 mg daily; if no: Start metformin, to be titrated to 2000 mg daily over 4 weeks. Use post-prandial glucoses to guide changes in eating, adding medications, etc. Reassess: Is patient on maximally tolerated dose metformin? If yes: Increase LA insulin by 5–10 units if FBG ≥ 126 mg/dl; if no: Continue to increase metformin and increase LA insulin by 5–10 units if FBG ≥ 200 mg/dl. If difficulty tolerating metformin, try extended release or consider switching to pioglitazone 30 mg daily.

Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets in Patients with Inadequate Glycemic Control on a Sulfonylurea and/or Metformin

For patients not adequately controlled on either glipizide (or another sulfonylurea) or metformin alone, the recommended starting dose of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets are 2.5 mg/500 mg or 5 mg/500 mg twice daily with the morning and evening meals. In order to avoid hypoglycemia, the starting dose of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should not exceed the daily doses of glipizide or metformin already being taken. The daily dose should be titrated in increments of no more than 5 mg/500 mg up to the minimum effective dose to achieve adequate control of blood glucose or to a maximum dose of 20 mg/2000 mg per day.

Patients previously treated with combination therapy of glipizide (or another sulfonylurea) plus metformin may be switched to Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets 2.5 mg/500 mg or 5 mg/500 mg; the starting dose should not exceed the daily dose of glipizide (or equivalent dose of another sulfonylurea) and metformin already being taken. The decision to switch to the nearest equivalent dose or to titrate should be based on clinical judgment. Patients should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia following such a switch and the dose of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should be titrated as described above to achieve adequate control of blood glucose.

### ITC commentary on metformin clinical drug-drug interaction study design that enables an efficacy-and safety-based dose adjustment decision [^115G6YgZ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Metformin drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies are conducted during development of drugs that inhibit organic cation transporters and/or multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins (OCTs/MATEs). Monitoring solely changes in systemic exposure, the typical DDI study endpoint appears inadequate for metformin, which is metabolically stable, has poor passive membrane permeability, and undergoes transporter-mediated tissue distribution and clearance. Evaluation of renal clearance, antihyperglycemic effects, and potentially lactate as an exploratory safety marker, can support rational metformin dose adjustment. The proposed DDI study design aims to adequately inform metformin dosing during comedication.

Concomitant Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP and Oral Sulfonylurea Therapy in Adult Patients

If patients have not responded to 4 weeks of the maximum dose of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets monotherapy, consideration should be given to gradual addition of an oral sulfonylurea while continuing metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP at the maximum dose, even if prior primary or secondary failure to a sulfonylurea has occurred. Clinical and pharmacokinetic drug- drug interaction data are currently available only for metformin plus glyburide (glibenclamide).

With concomitant metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and sulfonylurea therapy, the desired control of blood glucose may be obtained by adjusting the dose of each drug. In a clinical trial of patients with type 2 diabetes and prior failure on glyburide, patients started on metformin hydrochloride tablets 500 mg and glyburide 20 mg were titrated to 1000/20 mg, 1500/20 mg, 2000/20 mg or 2500/20 mg of metformin hydrochloride tablets and glyburide, respectively, to reach the goal of glycemic control as measured by FPG, HbA1c and plasma glucose response (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Studies). However, attempts should be made to identify the minimum effective dose of each drug to achieve this goal. With concomitant metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP and sulfonylurea therapy, the risk of hypoglycemia associated with sulfonylurea therapy continues and may be increased. Appropriate precautions should be taken. (See Package Insert of the respective sulfonylurea.)

If patients have not satisfactorily responded to 1 to 3 months of concomitant therapy with the maximum dose of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tabletsand the maximum dose of an oral sulfonylurea, consider therapeutic alternatives including switching to insulin with or without metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Study design and data source

This was a retrospective cohort study of people with T2DM in the United Kingdom. Data were obtained from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) database, which contains over 4 million active participant records (and over 11 million overall) drawn from approximately 650 primary care practices. 21 The CPRD database contains anonymized longitudinal primary care medical records focusing on participant‐specific diagnoses, laboratory measurements and prescription data, many of which are linked to nonprimary care data including hospitalizations and mortality data. Data from 1 January 2012 through 31 December 2017 were accessed for the analyses of the subjects described below. Because the data were anonymized, approval by an ethics committee was not required; however, the study conformed to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and access to CPRD data is subject to protocol approval by an Independent Scientific Advisory Committee (ISAC).

Type 2 diabetes — antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy principles and initial therapy: The goal of antihyperglycemic treatment is to achieve clinical and laboratory targets with minimal adverse effects and reduce diabetes-related complications, and minimizing the risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain and maximizing cardiovascular and renal benefits should be priorities. As monotherapy, most noninsulin agents reduce A1C by 0.5% to 2.0%. Metformin is often the preferred initial therapy for most persons with new-onset type 2 diabetes and, once initiated, should be continued as long as it is tolerated and not contraindicated; it can be used in combination with virtually all other antihyperglycemic agents, including insulin, when monotherapy does not reach the glycemic target.

### Tolerability, safety and pharmacodynamics of oral, small-molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist danuglipron for type 2 diabetes: a 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study comparing different dose-escalation schemes [^114kjMJR]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the tolerability, safety and pharmacodynamics of different dose-escalation schemes of the oral small-molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist danuglipron.

Materials and Methods

This Phase 2a, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study randomly assigned adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) treated with metformin to placebo or danuglipron (low [5-mg] or high [10-mg] starting dose, with 1- or 2-week dose-escalation steps, to target doses of 80, 120 or 200mg twice daily [BID]) and adults with obesity without diabetes to placebo or danuglipron 200mg BID.

Results

Participants with T2D (n = 123, mean glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] 8.19%) or obesity without diabetes (n = 28, mean body mass index 37.3kg/m 2) were randomly assigned and treated. Discontinuation from study medication occurred in 27.3% to 72.7% of participants across danuglipron groups versus 16.7% to 18.8% for placebo, most often due to adverse events. Nausea (20.0%-47.6% of participants across danuglipron groups vs. 12.5% for placebo) and vomiting (18.2%-40.9% danuglipron vs. 12.5% placebo, respectively) were most commonly reported in participants with T2D. Gastrointestinal adverse events were generally related to danuglipron target dose and were not substantially affected by starting dose. In participants with T2D, least squares mean changes from baseline in HbA1c (-1.04% to -1.57% across danuglipron groups vs. -0.32% for placebo), fasting plasma glucose (-23.34mg/dL to -53.94mg/dL danuglipron vs. -13.09mg/dL placebo) and body weight (-1.93 to -5.38kg danuglipron vs. -0.42kg placebo) at Week 12 were generally statistically significant for danuglipron compared with placebo (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Danuglipron resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA1c, FPG and body weight over 12weeks, in the setting of higher discontinuation rates and incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events with higher target doses.

Run-In

Eligible volunteers in the adult and pediatric medication protocols will participate in a 3-week run-in period prior to randomization. They will be instructed by study staff in proper injection technique and will receive 3 weeks of placebo tablets and, for the adult medication protocol, 3 weeks of placebo injections. Pediatric participants already taking metformin will continue on their prestudy metformin dose during the run-in period. Final eligibility will be determined based on demonstrated compliance with medication use and attendance at scheduled study visits. Randomization and baseline study procedures (hyperglycemic clamp and OGTT) will occur after successful completion of the run-in. The surgical protocol has no run-in. In all study arms, after completing the baseline measurements, participants will receive instruction in lifestyle modification, including individualized instruction on weight loss, exercise, and diet.

Active Treatment (Medication Studies)

During their period of active and follow-up treatment, participants will be seen every three months. Adult participants randomized to metformin monotherapy or placebo will be double-blinded for scientific reasons and to minimize dropout of participants assigned to placebo. Adult participants receiving liraglutide plus metformin or insulin glargine followed by metformin will not be masked to the intervention. Similarly, pediatric participants will not be masked to the intervention.

Metformin use is the same in all treatment groups assigned to use it. For minimization of gastrointestinal side effects, patients naive to metformin will be titrated over a maximum of 8 weeks from a starting dose of 500 mg once daily to a maximum dose of 1,000 mg b.i.d. Pediatric participants already on metformin, but on a lower dose, will similarly have their dose titrated to a maximum dose of 1,000 mg b.i.d. Participants will remain on the maximum tolerated dose of metformin throughout the study. If unable to tolerate metformin, they will continue in the study but will not take the medication and will be included in the intention-to-treat analyses.

Adverse effects of metformin

Gastrointestinal

The most common side effects of metformin are nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort. Many patients (20–30%) report experiencing at least one of these side effects. The gastrointestinal side effects will be less impactful if metformin is taken with a meal and the dose is titrated gradually. Metformin therapy could be initiated at a low dose of 500 mg twice daily and increased by 500 mg daily every 1–2 weeks until the patient reaches the maximum tolerated dose. For those that are unable to tolerate the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects associated with the standard immediate-release formulation, extended-release tablets are available. While most patients either tolerate the side effects or switch to the slow-release option, approximately 5% discontinue the drug due to severe GI distress. The exact mechanisms of action which result in the common GI side effects are currently unknown. Possible mechanisms may be related to high concentrations of metformin within the GI tract, an increase in serotonin within GI cells, or metformin's effect on the gut microbiome, leading to opportunistic infections. Furthermore, it has been proposed that an individual's unique microbiome might influence metformin tolerance. Metformin's relationship with the gut microbiome continues to be a topic of scientific interest.

Lactic acidosis

While the association between metformin and lactic acidosis is notably less significant compared with other biguanides, there is still a slight risk of developing lactic acidosis while taking metformin. Lactic acidosis affects 3–10 per 100,000 persons per year in patients taking metformin. Originally, it was thought that people with renal impairment could not take metformin due to an increased risk of developing this potentially lethal side effect. However, in 2016, the FDA deemed the drug safe for people with mild-to-moderate kidney impairment. Most current evidence suggests that even in patients with contraindications such as in renal, hepatic, or cardiac failure, lactic acidosis associated with metformin use is considered extremely rare.

Vitamin B12 deficiency

Malabsorption of vitamin B12 is also linked to metformin use. Several studies have found low vitamin B12 levels in patients taking metformin. The major concern with this side effect is its possible association with irreversible neurological consequences. Low levels of vitamin B12 could potentially lead to an increased prevalence of peripheral neuropathy. As a precaution, regular testing of vitamin B12 levels in patients taking metformin has been suggested. In patients with low levels of vitamin B12, an oral supplement may be recommended.

Recommendations for implementation: hypoglycaemia

We recommend considering reducing the dose of insulin/SUs/meglitinides when initiating SGLT-2 inhibitors to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (Grade 1C).
We recommend that when initiating SGLT-2 inhibitors in people taking SUs (e.g. gliclazide) or meglitinides (e.g. repaglinide) when the HbA1c < 58 mmol/mol AND eGFR > 45 mL/min/1.73m 2, consider reducing dose of SU or meglitinide by 50% to reduce risk of hypoglycaemia (Grade 1C).
We recommend that when starting SGLT-2 inhibitors in people taking insulin when the HbA1c < 58 mmol/mol AND eGFR > 45 mL/min/1.73m 2, consider reducing the insulin dose by 20% to avoid hypoglycaemia (Grade 1C).
We recommend that when starting SGLT-2 inhibitors in people taking only metformin ± pioglitazone ± DPP-4i/gliptins or GLP-1RA therapy, no dosage adjustment is necessary (Grade 1C).

Rationale

SGLT-2 inhibitors are effective drugs at reducing hyperglycaemia when they are used in people with preserved kidney function (e.g. eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73m 2), however, their glycaemic effectiveness reduces as the eGFR declines. Where a treatment for DM carries a risk of hypoglycaemia (such as SUs and insulin use), the addition of an SGLT-2 inhibitor may potentiate that risk, particularly if baseline glycaemic control is reasonable at the time of initiation of treatment. There is no evidence that SGLT-2 inhibitors cause significant hypoglycaemia on their own or in addition with DM medicines that are not associated with hypoglycaemia.
