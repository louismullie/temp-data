## Question

Woke up for a elevated WBC

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to interpret and manage an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count discovered in the morning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and verifying the differential. Then, I should categorize likely etiologies into physiologic, infectious, inflammatory, hematologic, and medication-related causes. Next, I will prioritize immediate safety checks and decide when to repeat testing versus escalate to smear, cultures, or imaging. After that, I should outline a staged workup based on severity and persistence. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a practical decision algorithm with clear thresholds and actions, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and its composition, because I need to ensure we are not reacting to a spurious result or a transient physiologic shift. I should verify the exact WBC value, the differential (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils), and whether there are any instrument flags suggesting a manual review is needed; if nucleated red blood cells are present, I must correct the automated WBC count downward to avoid a falsely elevated leukocyte count [^fd966ca3]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — if the elevation is mild and the patient is asymptomatic, repeating the CBC with differential within 24–48 hours is reasonable to exclude laboratory variability or a transient stress response, especially given diurnal variation in neutrophil counts and the rapid mobilization of marginated pools that can double WBC within hours [^8517e656].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis in categories, and I need to ensure I do not anchor prematurely on infection. Common nonmalignant causes include physiologic stress (exercise, trauma, surgery, emotional stress), medications (notably corticosteroids, lithium, beta-agonists, colony-stimulating factors), asplenia, smoking, obesity, and chronic inflammatory conditions; hematologic malignancies such as leukemias and lymphomas are less common but must be considered when cytopenias, blasts, dysplasia, or organomegaly are present [^8517e656] [^63420681]. Wait, let me verify the steroid effect magnitude — recent data show mean WBC increases of about 0.3, 1.7, and 4.84 × 10⁹/L at 48 hours with low, medium, and high glucocorticoid doses, respectively, so a modest rise after steroids is expected, but larger or earlier rises should prompt evaluation for other causes [^45531bf5] [^c5ec430c].

> I will now examine the immediate safety priorities, because I need to ensure we do not miss sepsis or acute hematologic emergencies. If the patient is febrile, hemodynamically unstable, or has concerning features (e.g., blasts on smear, pancytopenia, severe cytopenias, organomegaly), I should act urgently with blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotics if infection is suspected, and hematology consultation; otherwise, in stable, afebrile patients, I can proceed with a more measured evaluation [^8517e656] [^63420681]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not over-relying on WBC to diagnose sepsis — WBC has limited diagnostic value for sepsis, so I must integrate vitals, lactate, and clinical context rather than the WBC alone [^d56b3c34].

> For a staged workup, let me think about severity and persistence. If the WBC is only mildly elevated (about 11–15 × 10⁹/L) and the patient is asymptomatic, I should repeat the CBC with differential in 24–48 hours and reassess; if it normalizes, no further workup is needed. If it remains elevated or rises, I should obtain a peripheral smear to evaluate morphology, left shift, blasts, dysplasia, and eosinophilia, and add inflammatory markers (CRP/ESR) and targeted labs based on history (e.g., cultures, thyroid function, rheumatologic serologies) [^8517e656] [^2580cc30]. I should double-check that smear review is indicated when WBC exceeds roughly 20,000/mcL or when cytopenias or concerning symptoms coexist, as this increases the likelihood of hematologic disease and guides next steps [^019e472e].

> If the WBC is moderately to markedly elevated (generally above 15–20 × 10⁹/L) or persists beyond a week, I need to ensure a more comprehensive evaluation. I should order a peripheral smear with manual differential, inflammatory markers, and consider bone marrow evaluation if blasts are present, cytopenias coexist, or there are constitutional symptoms or organomegaly; flow cytometry and molecular testing may be needed to distinguish reactive from clonal lymphoproliferative or myeloid disorders [^2580cc30] [^63420681]. But wait, what if the morphology shows a leukemoid reaction pattern with toxic granulations and no blasts? In that case, I should pivot toward infection or inflammation and pursue targeted infectious workup rather than assuming malignancy [^2580cc30].

> I should confirm medication and lifestyle contributors before labeling the process as idiopathic. I need to ask explicitly about recent corticosteroids, lithium, beta-agonists, smoking, and strenuous exercise, and I should correlate with the timing of steroid initiation because the expected steroid-associated rise peaks around 48 hours; unexpected timing or magnitude should trigger evaluation for alternative causes rather than attributing everything to steroids [^45531bf5] [^c5ec430c]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not missing a chronic inflammatory condition — reviewing systems for autoimmune symptoms, GI disease, or chronic infections is essential because these can sustain a reactive leukocytosis [^8517e656].

> Special populations require tailored thresholds and actions, so I need to check age, pregnancy, and comorbidities. In pregnancy, physiologic leukocytosis is common, so higher cutoffs are acceptable; in pediatrics, age-specific normal ranges apply and WBC patterns can help distinguish viral from bacterial disease, for example lymphocytosis with pertussis in infants or neutrophilia with a left shift in appendicitis; in older adults, clonal myeloid neoplasms are more prevalent, so a lower threshold for smear and marrow evaluation is reasonable [^8517e656] [^88cb9d16] [^efabb391] [^019e472e]. I should double-check for diurnal variation in neutrophils as well, because morning samples may be higher and repeating later in the day can clarify whether the elevation is persistent or physiologic [^3d057456].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision algorithm, and I will sanity-check each branch. If the WBC is less than 15 × 10⁹/L and the patient is asymptomatic, repeat in 24–48 hours; if it normalizes, stop. If it remains elevated or rises, obtain a smear and CRP/ESR and proceed based on findings. If the WBC is 15–25 × 10⁹/L or persists beyond a week, add smear, inflammatory markers, and targeted infectious or inflammatory testing; consider marrow if blasts, cytopenias, or concerning features are present. If the WBC exceeds 25 × 10⁹/L or there are blasts, cytopenias, or organomegaly, proceed to hematology referral, marrow evaluation, and appropriate molecular testing without delay [^8517e656] [^2580cc30] [^019e472e]. I should confirm that this staged approach aligns with primary care and hematology guidance, which emphasize confirming the count, reviewing the smear, and escalating based on persistence, magnitude, and cytopenias [^8517e656] [^63420681].

> Finally, I need to ensure patient counseling and follow-up are explicit. I should explain that mild, transient leukocytosis is common and often reactive, but persistent or very high counts warrant evaluation to exclude infection, inflammation, or hematologic disease; I will provide clear return precautions for fever, weight loss, night sweats, bruising, or fatigue and arrange timely reassessment if the abnormality persists [^8517e656] [^63420681]. Hold on, I should verify that the plan is documented and communicated, including the rationale for repeating versus escalating, so that we avoid unnecessary anxiety while maintaining vigilance for serious disease.

Waking up with an elevated WBC is most often due to **stress, infection, or medications** (especially corticosteroids) [^8517e656] [^45531bf5]. Confirm with a **repeat CBC and differential** [^8517e656], review symptoms, and check for infection, inflammation, or medication use [^63420681]. If the elevation persists or is > 20,000/µL, obtain a peripheral smear [^019e472e] and consider hematology referral to exclude malignancy [^8517e656]. Most cases are reactive and resolve with treatment of the underlying cause, but persistent or unexplained leukocytosis needs further evaluation [^63420681].

---

## Physiological and benign causes

Several **physiological or benign factors** can cause transient leukocytosis, especially in the morning:

- **Diurnal variation**: WBC counts naturally fluctuate, with higher levels in the morning and lower in the evening [^notfound].

- **Stress or exercise**: Emotional stress, anxiety, or recent physical activity can acutely elevate WBC counts [^8517e656].

- **Medications**: Corticosteroids, lithium, beta-agonists, and epinephrine can cause leukocytosis [^45531bf5] [^46c774fa].

- **Smoking**: Chronic smoking is associated with elevated WBC counts [^8517e656].

---

## Pathological causes

Persistent or significantly elevated WBC counts may indicate **underlying pathology**:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Infectious | - Bacterial infections (e.g. pneumonia, urinary tract infection, appendicitis) [^8517e656] [^d374e9c0] <br/> - Viral infections (e.g. influenza, COVID-19) [^8517e656] [^09c582d5] <br/> - Fungal infections (e.g. histoplasmosis) [^notfound] |
| Inflammatory | - Rheumatoid arthritis <br/> - Systemic lupus erythematosus <br/> - Inflammatory bowel disease [^f9699201] |
| Hematologic malignancies | - Leukemia (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia) [^ad2eafd3] [^bffd5e63] [^e624aa06] <br/> - Lymphoma [^7f8f2914] <br/> - Myeloproliferative neoplasms [^2580cc30] |
| Other medical conditions | - Asplenia <br/> - Obesity <br/> - Chronic kidney disease <br/> - Myocardial infarction [^5ab1b99c] |

---

## Clinical evaluation

When evaluating a patient with an elevated WBC count, the following steps are recommended:

- **Confirm the elevation**: Repeat a complete blood count (CBC) with differential to verify persistent leukocytosis [^8517e656].

- **Review clinical history**: Assess for recent infections, stress, exercise, medication use, and symptoms such as fever, fatigue, weight loss, or night sweats [^63420681].

- **Physical examination**: Look for signs of infection, inflammation, or organomegaly (enlarged lymph nodes, spleen, or liver) [^8517e656].

- **Laboratory tests**: Consider inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR), blood cultures, and specific tests based on clinical suspicion (e.g. autoimmune panel, infectious disease screening) [^f9699201].

- **Peripheral blood smear**: Evaluate for abnormal cell morphology, blasts, or dysplasia if leukocytosis is persistent or significantly elevated [^2580cc30].

- **Bone marrow biopsy**: Indicated if hematologic malignancy is suspected or if leukocytosis is accompanied by cytopenias or abnormal smear findings [^2580cc30].

---

## Clinical significance and implications

The clinical significance of an elevated WBC count depends on the **underlying cause**. Reactive leukocytosis from infection or inflammation typically resolves with treatment of the underlying condition, whereas persistent leukocytosis, especially with abnormal cell morphology, may indicate hematologic malignancy and requires further evaluation and management [^8517e656] [^2580cc30].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **identified cause**:

- **Infection**: Appropriate antimicrobial therapy and supportive care [^d56b3c34].

- **Inflammatory conditions**: Immunosuppressive therapy, corticosteroids, or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) as indicated [^5f6bd18c].

- **Hematologic malignancies**: Chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or stem cell transplantation based on the specific diagnosis and patient factors [^notfound].

- **Medication-induced leukocytosis**: Adjust or discontinue the offending medication if clinically feasible [^notfound].

---

Waking up with an elevated WBC count is common and often due to **benign factors** such as diurnal variation, stress, or medications [^8517e656]. Persistent or significantly elevated counts warrant further evaluation to identify and treat underlying causes, including infection, inflammation, or hematologic malignancy [^63420681].

### Evaluation of patients with leukocytosis [^8517e656]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

An elevated white blood cell count has many potential etiologies, including malignant and nonmalignant causes. It is important to use age- and pregnancy-specific normal ranges for the white blood cell count. A repeat complete blood count with peripheral smear may provide helpful information, such as types and maturity of white blood cells, uniformity of white blood cells, and toxic granulations. The leukocyte differential may show eosinophilia in parasitic or allergic conditions, or it may reveal lymphocytosis in childhood viral illnesses. Leukocytosis is a common sign of infection, particularly bacterial, and should prompt physicians to identify other signs and symptoms of infection. The peripheral white blood cell count can double within hours after certain stimuli because of the large bone marrow storage and intravascularly marginated pools of neutrophils. Stressors capable of causing an acute leukocytosis include surgery, exercise, trauma, and emotional stress. Other nonmalignant etiologies of leukocytosis include certain medications, asplenia, smoking, obesity, and chronic inflammatory conditions. Symptoms suggestive of a hematologic malignancy include fever, weight loss, bruising, or fatigue. If malignancy cannot be excluded or another more likely cause is not suspected, referral to a hematologist/oncologist is indicated.

### Why does my patient have leukocytosis? [^63420681]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in medicine, and one of the most frequent reasons for hematologic consultation. Effective evaluation of leukocytosis requires an attentive history, careful physical examination, meticulous review of the complete blood count and peripheral blood smear, judicious application of laboratory and radiologic testing, and thoughtful analysis. Definitive diagnosis may require bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging studies, and specialized molecular tests. The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis includes physiologic responses to a broad range of infectious and inflammatory processes, as well as numerous primary hematologic disorders such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

### Malignant or benign leukocytosis [^2580cc30]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis, or elevated WBC count, is a commonly encountered laboratory finding. Distinguishing malignant from benign leukocytosis is a critical step in the care of a patient, which initiates a vastly different decision tree. Confirmation of the complete blood cell count and the WBC differential is the first step. Examination of the PB smear is essential to confirming the automated blood cell differential or affirming the manual differential performed on the PB smear. Next is separation of the leukocytosis into a myeloid versus a lymphoid process. Distinguishing a reactive lymphoid proliferation from a lymphoproliferative disorder requires examination of lymphocyte morphology for pleomorphic lymphocytes versus a monomorphic population, with the latter favoring a lymphoproliferative neoplasm. Samples suspicious for lymphoproliferative disorders can be confirmed and characterized by flow cytometry, with molecular studies initiated in select cases; precursor lymphoid neoplasms (lymphoblasts) should trigger a BM examination. Myeloid leukocytosis triggers a differential diagnosis of myeloid leukemoid reactions versus myeloid malignancies. The manual differential is key, along with correct enumeration of blasts and blast equivalents, immature granulocytes, basophils, and eosinophils and identifying dysplasia to identify myeloid malignancies. Confirmation and characterization of myeloid malignancies should be performed with a BM examination and the appropriate ancillary studies. Myeloid leukemoid reactions commonly result from infections and show activated neutrophil changes on morphology; these should prompt evaluation for infection. Other causes of reactive myeloid leukocytoses are also discussed herein.

### Clinical decision support to improve CBC and differential ordering [^ea84ce92]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Complete blood count and differential (CBC diff) is a common laboratory test that may be overused or misordered, particularly in an inpatient setting. We assessed the ability of a clinical decision support (CDS) alert to decrease unnecessary orders for CBC diff and analyzed its impact in the laboratory.

Methods

We designed 3 CDS alerts to provide guidance to providers ordering CBC diff on inpatients at frequencies of daily, greater than once daily, or as needed.

Results

The 3 alerts were highly effective in reducing orders for CBC diff at the frequencies targeted by the alert. Overall, test volume for CBC diff decreased by 32% (mean of 5257 tests per month) after implementation of the alerts, with a corresponding decrease of 22% in manual differentials performed (mean of 898 per month). Turnaround time for manual differentials decreased by a mean of 41.5 minutes, with a mean decrease of up to 90 minutes during peak morning hours.

Conclusions

The 3 CDS alerts successfully decreased inpatient orders for CBC diff and improved the quality of patient care by decreasing turnaround time for manual differentials.

### Morning granulocytopenia in two patients with connective-tissue disease treated with oral corticosteroids [^3d057456]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

The authors report two cases of morning granulocytopenia: a 73-year-old female with a long-standing, active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and a non-tuberculous mycobacteria (Mycobacterium avium) pulmonary infection, and a 55-year-old female with longstanding systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). After admission, the patients' peripheral neutrophil counts decreased with no associated symptoms. In both cases, The authors identified diurnal variation in peripheral blood neutrophil counts in blood samples collected at 3-h intervals. The white cell count (WCC) in the first case rose from 2500 cells/μl (neutrophils: 1512 cells/μl) at 08:00 to 6100 cells/μl (neutrophils: 5185 cells/μl) at 14:00, and from 2200 cells/μl (neutrophils: 319 cells/μl) at 06:00 to 2900 cells/μl (neutrophils: 2291 cells/μl) at 12:00 in the second case. These cases are educational because necessary treatments would be stopped when morning granulocytopenia is not recognised. Morning granulocytopenia should be noted in the differential diagnosis in cases of incidentally found, asymptomatic granulocytopenia.

### Cutoff value for correcting white blood cell count for nucleated red blood cells: what is it? Why is it important? [^fd966ca3]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) are normally observed in the peripheral blood of neonates and during pregnancy. Under other conditions, the presence of nucleated RBCs in circulating blood indicates disorder in the blood-producing mechanism. The increased presence of nucleated RBCs, however, falsely elevates the leukocyte count, as measured by most automated hematology analyzers, warranting a manual correction of the leukocyte count. For a long time, cutoff values for correcting white blood cell (WBC) count for the presence of nucleated RBCs have been used regularly, particularly in developing countries. However, because those values are largely subjective, they can vary widely between laboratories worldwide. These varied cutoff values include 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50; it appears that the numbers 5 and 10 are the most common values used in corrections; the reasons require further elucidation. In this article, we discuss the merits of correcting the WBC count for nucleated RBCs at certain cutoff points.

Results

Q.1: In patients with suspected complicated IBD, which are the appropriate biochemical investigations that should be performed?

Statement 1.1

In clinical practice, the diagnosis of CD and UC is based on a set of modalities including clinical, biochemical, endoscopic, radiological, and histological diagnostics rather than a single reference standard (QoE low C).

Statement 1.2

In assessing an acute abdomen in patients with IBD, laboratory tests including full blood count, electrolytes, liver enzymes, inflammatory biomarkers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum albumin and pre-albumin (to assess nutritional status and degree of inflammation) are mandatory (QoE moderate B).

Statement 1.3

In case of a suspected IBD flare, infectious causes should be ruled out, especially Clostridium difficile and Cytomegalovirus (QoE low C).

Recommendation

We recommend assessing Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis disease activity in the urgent clinical situation by performing the following laboratory tests: a full blood count, including hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count; serum C-reactive protein level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; serum electrolytes; liver enzymes level; serum albumin; renal function; and fecal calprotectin level, when it is possible. It is mandatory to exclude any infectious diseases by performing blood-, stool cultures, and toxin test for Clostridium difficile (strong recommendation based on a moderate level of evidence 1B).

Summary of evidence and discussion

In assessing a patient with acute abdominal pain in the emergency room, the main laboratory tests requested are full blood count (20.1%), electrolytes (19.1%), cardiac enzymes (19.0%), and liver function tests (11.5%).

In differentiating the cause underlying acute abdominal pain, the diagnostic accuracy values of C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC) can be elevated.

IBD disease activity will usually impact laboratory tests results with anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, hypoalbuminemia, and increased inflammatory markers. In addition, therapies may cause abnormalities in liver enzymes, leukocytes, and kidney function. Consequently, for patients with IBD admitted to the emergency room for evaluation, laboratory tests should always include full blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, liver enzymes, and lipase.

### Elevation in white blood cell count after corticosteroid use in noninfected hospitalized patients [^dad85a13]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

In interpreting WBC counts, physicians should consider recent initiation of steroids and their dosage. While increases of as much as 4.84 × 10⁹ cells may be seen 48 h after initiating large doses, larger increases, increases following a daily dose of 320 mg or less of hydrocortisone equivalent, and increases greater than 1 × 10⁹ cells occurring within 24 h post‐steroid initiation should trigger concern for other causes of leukocytosis.

### Marked elevation of cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count: an unusual case of Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis, differential diagnosis, and a brief review of current epidemiology and treatment recommendations [^2df9e50e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of bacterial meningitis is rarely a difficult diagnostic dilemma when a patient presents with fever, headache, neck stiffness, and altered mental status. Unfortunately for the practicing clinician, patients are rarely that straightforward. Patients who are elderly, very young, or immuno-compromised often present with subtle findings, making the correct diagnosis a challenge. In addition, patients being treated with antibiotics may be misleading in their clinical presentation, leading to a missed diagnosis of meningitis. Only when one considers the diagnosis or obtains a sample of cerebrospinal fluid is the correct diagnosis made. Although the clinical scenario may suggest meningitis, it is the cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count that establishes the definitive diagnosis. Despite the advent of systemic antibiotics over 50 years ago, bacterial meningitis continues to cause considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. The following case report details a woman diagnosed with Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis with an extremely high cerebrospinal white blood cell count. Although this is typically thought to be caused by abscesses or malignancy, meningitis alone may cause such an elevation. In addition, a brief review of the current epidemiology and treatment regimens for meningitis is discussed.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of emergency department patients with suspected appendicitis: approved by ACEP board of directors February 1, 2023 [^d374e9c0]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Laboratory tests in acute appendicitis — Elevated white blood cell (WBC) count (> 10,000/mm³) showed a positive likelihood ratio of 1.59 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.46, and in meta-analysis had a positive likelihood ratio of 2.47 (95% CI 2.06 to 2.95) with a negative likelihood ratio of 0.25 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.36); values increased for WBC greater than 15,000/mm³ with a positive likelihood ratio of 3.47 (95% CI 1.6 to 7.8). Another Class III study reported for elevated WBC count (> 10,000/mm³) a positive likelihood ratio of 2.7 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.5. For a C-reactive protein level of 10 mg/L, the positive likelihood ratio was 4.24 (95% CI 1.16 to 5.53) and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.11 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.25), and the combination of a WBC count of 10,000/mm³ and a C-reactive protein of 8 mg/L yielded a negative likelihood ratio of 0.03 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.14) and a positive likelihood ratio of 23.32 (95% CI 6.87 to 84.79). Whereas neither the WBC count nor the C-reactive protein level consistently diagnoses or excludes appendicitis when used alone, the combination of C-reactive protein and WBC count is more helpful.

### The use of white blood cell count and left shift in the diagnosis of appendicitis in children [^efabb391]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The use of white blood cell (WBC) count and left shift in the diagnosis of appendicitis in pediatric patients is unproven. It is commonly thought that children with appendicitis have an elevated WBC count with a left shift; however, most data supporting this belief stem from studies conducted on appendicitis in adults, not children. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the value of WBC count and differential in the diagnosis of appendicitis in children presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute abdominal pain.

Methods

Seven hundred twenty-two pediatric ED patients with a primary complaint of nontraumatic abdominal pain were identified by prospective and retrospective methods. White blood cell count with differential was performed on patients with history and physical examination findings that were felt to warrant laboratory investigation. Results of WBC counts were determined as low, normal, or high, with or without a left shift, based on normal age-related values per laboratory protocol for pediatric patients.

Results

The diagnosis of appendicitis was made in 10.2% of all patients presenting to the ED with acute abdominal pain. Thirty percent of toddlers (1–3.9 years) with high WBC counts had appendicitis, whereas 0% of toddlers with low WBC counts and 4.8% of toddlers with normal WBC counts had appendicitis (chi = 6.5, P = 0.04). A normal WBC count did not rule out appendicitis in toddlers; however, the negative predictive value (NPV) for normal or low WBC count was high (NPV = 95.6%). In the child age group (4–11.9 years), high WBC count was both sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of appendicitis in children (sensitivity = 71%, specificity = 72%), and the NPV for normal or low WBC count was high (NPV = 89.5%). Lastly, 43.9% of adolescents (12–19 years) with high WBC counts had appendicitis, whereas 0% of adolescents with low WBC counts and 8.3% of adolescents with normal WBC counts had appendicitis (chi = 37.3, P < 0.001). The NPV for a low or normal WBC count was also high in the adolescent group (NPV = 91.9%). Left shift was also strongly associated with appendicitis. Among toddlers, 40% of patients with a left shift had appendicitis, whereas 1.8% of toddlers without a left shift had appendicitis (chi = 25.7, P < 0.001, NPV = 98.2%). Similarly, left shift was strongly associated with appendicitis in children and adolescents. Among children, 54.3% of patients with a left shift had appendicitis, whereas 5.4% of children without a left shift had appendicitis (chi = 67.8, P < 0.001, NPV = 90.5%). Among adolescents, 53.5% of patients with a left shift had appendicitis, whereas 6.1% of adolescents without a left shift had appendicitis (chi = 72.3, P < 0.001, NPV = 93.9%). In patients with a left shift, 51.2% had appendicitis, whereas 3.7% of patients without a left shift had appendicitis (chi = 226.2; P < 0.001, NPV = 96.3%). In all patients with appendicitis, elevated WBC counts had a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 80%. Using left shift alone as an indicator for appendicitis was associated with a sensitivity of 59% and a specificity of 90%. However, when a high WBC count and left shift were combined, the sensitivity climbed to 80%, and specificity remained at 79%. The sensitivity fell to 47% when both a high WBC count and left shift were analyzed, and specificity climbed to 94%. The positive likelihood ratio for a high WBC count and left shift was 9.8.

Conclusions

The determination of WBC count and differential is useful in the diagnosis of appendicitis in children presenting to the ED with nontraumatic acute abdominal pain, regardless of age. High WBC counts and left shift are independently, strongly associated with appendicitis in children aged 1 to 19 years. In fact, for this subset of patients older than 4 years, the most common diagnosis in the setting of an elevated WBC count was appendicitis. The presence of an increased WBC count or left shift carries with it a high sensitivity (79%), and the presence of both high WBC count and left shift has the highest specificity (94%). These values are, therefore, helpful in the diagnosis and exclusion of appendicitis. Although not absolute, the WBC count and left shift can be helpful in the diagnosis and exclusion of appendicitis.

### Clinical value of total white blood cells and neutrophil counts in patients with suspected appendicitis: retrospective study [^0b4001ba]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the most common abdominal emergencies. Although patients with AA often present with a characteristic symptom complex and physical findings, atypical presentations are common. Missed or delayed diagnosis can lead to increased rates of perforation and morbidity. The clinical diagnosis of AA is difficult, and management errors are frequent, with rates of negative explorations reaching 20% to 30%. Despite the wide use of imaging techniques, appendicitis remains a challenging diagnosis.

Patients with suspected appendicitis are mainly managed on the basis of their disease history and physical examination; the value of laboratory examinations is controversial. Some works have assessed the diagnostic accuracy of different inflammatory markers in appendicitis with heterogeneous designs and results including: total white blood cells (WBCs), granulocytes, C-reactive protein, leukocyte elastase activity, D-lactate, phospholipase A2 and interleukine-6. Studies have shown inconsistent information regarding the use of WBCs count and differential in AA diagnosis. Although most studies show an association between elevated WBCs count in appendicitis diagnosis, its significance varies greatly. Another question that has been raised is whether a normal WBCs count and differential can adequately rule out a diagnosis of appendicitis. There have been reports of high negative predictive values (NPVs > 90%) for normal WBCs count and differential.

The aim of this retrospective study was to assess diagnostic value of total WBCs and neutrophils counts in patients who underwent appendectomy due to suspicious of AA. Using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves, sensitivity, specificity, NPV, positive predictive value (PPV), and likelihood ratios (LR) were calculated by correlating the preoperative WBCs and neutrophil counts with histological diagnosis. In addition, this study will attempt to determine cutoff point for WBCs and neutrophils counts with best sensitivity and specificity for determination of acute appendicitis.

### Biomarkers for diagnosing serious bacterial infections in older outpatients: a systematic review [^bd1f5d31]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The limited evidence of moderate quality suggests that an elevated PCT may be helpful for diagnosing bacteraemia, a positive urine dipstick may be helpful in diagnosing UTI. Although an elevated WBC count has limited utility in diagnosing intra-abdominal infections, it may have utility, along with elevated WBC differentials, in differentiating bacterial infections from other acute illness. Further studies of high quality are urgently needed in this area.

### The complete blood count: a practical tool for the pediatrician [^eec1e953]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Every child should have a baseline hematology evaluation with hemoglobin and hematocrit levels starting at age 12 months, or younger if clinically indicated. Although history and physical examination provide key information needed to diagnose blood disorders, the addition of a complete blood count (CBC) with differential count and reticulocyte count allows the clinician to narrow the differential diagnosis and tailor the subsequent evaluation. The interpretation of CBC results is a skill that requires practice. Every clinician can learn to identify possible diagnoses before consulting a specialist. This review provides a step-by-step approach for CBC interpretation with tools to help the clinician diagnose and interpret the most common blood disorders seen in the general pediatric clinic or inpatient setting.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Complete blood count (CBC) in suspected ABA — A complete blood count (CBC) with differential generally should be performed on initial evaluation of children with suspected ABA; the peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count is often, but not always, elevated, is higher on average with adjacent osteomyelitis infection than without and may be higher when ABA is caused by S. aureus or streptococcal species than K. kingae, but substantial overlap precludes the use of a specific diagnostic cut-off value; WBC does not differ on average between confirmed and presumed ABA cases; CBC on admission also is not useful in distinguishing ABA from Lyme arthritis; and while WBC is often higher in ABA than transient nonbacterial synovitis, substantial overlap precludes diagnostic value in distinguishing these entities.

### Abdominal attacks and treatment in hereditary angioedema with C1-inhibitor deficiency [^da93b1bf]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

White blood cell (WBC) count is often used in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain and was collected in patients with primary abdominal attacks in the ecallantide development program. Interestingly, WBC count was elevated in ~25% of attacks and was more likely to be elevated in attacks rated as severe. This finding is in agreement with several published case reports of abdominal HAE attacks and therefore suggests that elevated WBC count is not a reliable measure to include or exclude HAE in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain. Indeed, Ohsawa et al. recently reported significant leukocytosis with neutrophilia, as well as increased levels of hematocrit and low C-reactive protein (CRP) in HAE patients with severe abdominal pain, when compared with laboratory values when patients were not experiencing an attack.

To date, there is no reliable marker to define abdominal angioedema upon presentation of symptoms. Even in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of HAE, a diagnosis of an abdominal attack depends upon clinical judgment and the demonstrated efficacy of specific treatments. In undiagnosed patients, once HAE is suspected, blood tests can be used to confirm the diagnosis but these results will not be available for diagnosis and treatment in the initial emergency setting. The initial screening test is C4 blood levels, which will be low in HAE patients at baseline and even lower during an acute attack. However, a reduced C4 level during an attack does not identify the presence or absence of angioedema. The C4 test is inexpensive, common to most hospital laboratories, and typically has a high sensitivity and specificity, with at least 95% of HAE-C1INH patients showing a reduced C4 level during remission and virtually 100% showing reduced C4 during an attack. If the C4 is low, an abnormal functional C1-INH test would confirm the diagnosis of HAE. The endoscopic and computerized tomography (CT) appearance of abdominal angioedema has been previously reported and although nonspecific, in the right clinical setting of association with skin swelling and a family history, can suggest the diagnosis. Typical observations associated with abdominal angioedema include small bowel mucosal thickening, thumb printing of the bowel wall and ascites.

### Don't miss the diagnosis of sepsis! [^d56b3c34]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is amongst the most common reasons for admission to ICUs throughout the world. The early detection and timely administration of appropriate antibiotics are the most important factors in improving the outcome of patients with sepsis. However, the initial signs and symptoms of sepsis are frequently non-specific, leading to a delay in diagnosis. Furthermore, the diagnostic characteristics of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) are not useful in distinguishing infectious from non-infectious causes of SIRS. An elevated white blood count, neutrophilia or eosinopenia are frequently used to diagnose bacterial sepsis; however, these variables have low diagnostic value.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^0035915f]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

The current study shows that patients who present with abdominal pain with no vomiting, guarding or raised white cell count are unlikely to have significant intra abdominal pathology and therefore can be considered for early discharge back to the community. Abnormal liver function test was helpful to point out the possibility of biliary colic, so was microscopic hematuria that may reflect urinary tract pathology.

Complaints of acute abdominal pain are common emergency department presentations. Many of these conditions prove to be benign and self-limiting illness, which has no clear explanation. Tenderness and peritonism in the right iliac fossa are not specific for appendicitis but may help to narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with right iliac fossa pain. However high WBC counts and left shift are strongly associated with appendicitis in children aged 1 to 19 years indeed for children older than 4 years with lower abdominal pain; the most common diagnosis in the setting of an elevated WBC count is acute appendicitis.

In females of childbearing age, the presence or absence of bilateral tenderness pain migration and vomiting may help to differentiate acute appendicitis from acute pelvic inflammatory disease where patients tend to have raised white cells count and demonstrate signs of peritonism, which can make the differentiation between the two diagnoses on clinical grounds difficult. Mesenteric adenitis is very difficult to diagnose clinically and commonly patients undergo treatment for presumed appendicitis.

Imaging such as ultrasound is helpful for detection of the cause of lower abdominal pain; in clinical centers where CT scan is routinely performed it reduces the rate of both negative appendicectomy and perforated appendicitis, whoever CT scanning has significant radiation dose for children and young adults and its not always practical or available. On the other hand elderly patients can have atypical presentations; vascular events are more common in this population, and a wide differential diagnosis needs to be considered.

### An update on polymyalgia rheumatica [^5f6bd18c]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

There is no gold standard for diagnosing PMR, and unlike many other rheumatic syndromes, there are no specific clinical manifestations, serology or other laboratory findings in PMR. As a result, diagnosis of PMR can be challenging with a considerable number of conditions in the list of differential diagnoses. However, in daily practice, the diagnosis of PMR relies mainly on the following combination of principles: new‐onset symptoms of both morning stiffness and pain in the shoulder and pelvis girdle in a person aged 50 years or older, evidence of systemic inflammation with a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and or CRP, no other disease that would explain the clinical presentation better and finally abrupt response to GCs. In some diagnostic criteria, there are other specific requirements, such as a 2‐week duration of symptoms or negative tests for rheumatoid factors or antinuclear antibodies.

The diagnosis of PMR should be considered clinically. The typical case is an elderly woman with early morning bilateral shoulder pain and stiffness. Similar symptoms often occur in the pelvic girdle. Typically, the symptoms ease during the day. Systemic manifestations such as fever, fatigue, loss of appetite and weight loss may occur in about a third of the patients. In addition, there is almost always an elevation of inflammatory parameters, especially ESR and/or CRP. Other inflammatory parameters can be elevated as white blood cell or platelet count and sometimes liver enzymes or alkaline phosphatase may be elevated as a sign of systemic inflammation. On clinical examination, tenderness with deep palpation of the muscles around the shoulders and thighs is often noted. In addition, there is usually restricted mobility in the shoulders, without muscle atrophy or weakness. Occasional signs of synovitis in the shoulders, wrist joints and the knees can be seen. PMR can be diagnosed in combination with GCA, especially in those with a cranial phenotype, that is, TA. Although temporal biopsy may be positive in a minority of patients with PMR, it is not included in the currently recommended investigation of the disease, unless there are concomitant cranial GCA symptoms. Finally, in PMR, most patients will respond rapidly and dramatically to GCs and according to some criteria, this response is required for diagnosis.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^b67df6de]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Antithyroid drugs (ATDs) — white blood cell monitoring and agranulocytosis: Recommendation 16 states that a differential WBC count should be obtained during febrile illness and at the onset of pharyngitis in all patients taking antithyroid medication (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence), while Recommendation 17 notes insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine monitoring of WBC counts (no recommendation). Routine monitoring may miss cases because agranulocytosis frequency is quite low (0.2%–0.5%) and often sudden; in 211 patients with ATD-induced agranulocytosis, 21% had a normal WBC count within a week and 53% within 2 weeks before onset. If monitoring is employed, the maximum benefit would be for the first 90 days of therapy. In patients who develop agranulocytosis or other serious side effects while taking methimazole (MMI) or propylthiouracil (PTU), use of the other medication is contraindicated owing to cross-reactivity, though the contraindication to use PTU might be reconsidered in life-threatening thyrotoxicosis (thyroid storm) in a MMI-treated patient who has developed agranulocytosis, especially if the duration of therapy is brief.

Most patients with appendicitis had elevated white blood cell count. It is rarely seen with leukopenic presentation in acute appendicitis. Physicians in the emergency department easily miss these cases that had normal white blood cell count and leukopenic presentation. We presented a case of a 38-year-old man who had right lower quadrant abdominal pain with fever. White blood cell count was only 1800/microL. Computed tomography showed thickening with fluid contained in the lumen of distended appendix, and emergent appendectomy was done. Accurate diagnosis of acute appendicitis is still based on the clinical history and physical examination adjuvant with imaging studies.

### Don't miss the diagnosis of sepsis! [^94da6f26]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The early detection and treatment of sepsis are the most important factors in improving the outcome of patients with this condition. However, many patients admitted to hospital experience a long delay in the diagnosis of sepsis. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for febrile patients to be sent home from the Emergency Department or the physician's office with the diagnosis of 'flu' only to return hours or days later in overt septic shock. The early diagnosis of sepsis may be challenging as many of the signs and symptoms are non-specific. Clinical studies suggest that early diagnosis of sepsis requires a high index of suspicion and comprehensive clinical evaluation together with laboratory tests, including a complete blood count with differential, lactate and procalcitonin levels.

### Biases in electronic health record data due to processes within the healthcare system: retrospective observational study [^2a4ff189]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Laboratory tests serve as biomarkers or proxies for complex biological processes that are difficult to measure directly. For example, after several days, blood cultures might confirm that a patient has a bacterial infection, but an elevated white blood cell count value is a much faster way to assess the patient's state of health. It is the bacteria, not the elevated white blood cell count, which is the cause of the patient's illness; and, if the physician had a way to instantly detect the bacteria, the white blood cell count test might not be necessary. However, in practice, the white blood cell count value is often the best information available. In a similar way, the healthcare process aspects of a white blood cell count test can be proxies for other processes within the healthcare system. For example, early morning tests are much more likely to be done in an inpatient setting than afternoon tests (fig 4 a). Indeed, controlling for the clinical setting explains some, but not all, of the associations between hour of the day and survival (fig 4 b). Countless other factors, such as the schedules of the clinics, doctors, nurses, phlebotomists, lab technicians, and patients might also be playing a role. The point is that the hour of the day of the white blood cell count test is not affecting the patient's health, but it is a readily available variable that encapsulates a great deal of information about the patient's interaction with the healthcare system.

### Pertussis in young infants throughout the world [^88cb9d16]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

DIAGNOSIS OF PERTUSSIS IN YOUNG INFANTS

The initial symptoms of pertussis in young infants (sneezing, coryza, and normal temperature) are such that the primary caregiver rarely considers an impending severe and possible fatal illness. The exposure in young infants is most often to a family member with a cough illness that has not been recognized as pertussis. The definitive diagnosis is by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture of a nasopharyngeal sample (swab or aspirate). In general, PCR is more sensitive than culture.

An important test that should be done on all young infants who might have pertussis is a white blood cell (WBC) count with a differential percentage. Any count of > 10 000 cells/µL with > 50% lymphocytes must be considered as possible pertussis. A WBC count of this magnitude and percentage of lymphocytes should be repeated within 24 hours. A WBC count of > 20 000 cells/µL with > 50% lymphocytes should be considered as a very strong indication that the infant has pertussis.

Some young infants who have transplacentally acquired antibody to PT will not have the elevated leukocyte findings; they will have cough and apnea, however. Because young infants with pertussis can have rapid deterioration, they should be admitted to a hospital where an intensive care unit (ICU) is available.

### MASCC / ISOO clinical practice statement: imaging and clinical laboratory tests in the diagnosis and management of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw [^9a4a5eb2]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Imaging — prediction

Panoramic radiographs and CBCT were suggested to predict the development of MRONJ following a dentoalveolar procedure. Sclerosis of the trabecular bone, thickening of the lamina dura, or widening of the periodontal ligament were more frequently observed in patients who developed MRONJ eventually. Yet, clinicians should be careful with interpreting imaging studies given the known artifacts of panoramic radiographs and CBCT.

Laboratory workup — diagnosis

Considering that the diagnosis is made based primarily on clinical presentation, the role of lab workup is limited.
It is important to review the patient's complete blood count to confirm that the patient is not neutropenic or thrombocytopenic prior to penetrating or manipulating the soft tissue. This is clinically relevant if the MRONJ diagnosis is based on palpation of bone through a fistula, using a hand instrument (periodontal probe). If the neutrophil or platelet count demonstrates that the patient is at risk of infection or bleeding, respectively, the clinical examination should be adjusted accordingly.

Laboratory workup — differential diagnosis

Certain infectious diseases may share clinical features with MRONJ, such as osteomyelitis or bone exposure. Therefore, based on the clinical circumstances and review of systems, other infections should be considered. For example, deep fungal infection (e.g. aspergillosis, mucormycosis), viral infection (e.g. varicella zoster virus reactivation), or bacterial infection (e.g. tuberculosis). In such cases, laboratory workup is driven by the differential diagnosis.

Laboratory workup — monitoring

Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) value indicates inflammation, although the specificity of this test in monitoring MRONJ is low. This test is commonly used in oncologic patients and may be readily available for the clinicians who manage MRONJ. Of note, the literature reports higher CRP levels to correlate with the severity of acute inflammation and larger osteolysis size on a light microscopy study.
Uncontrolled diabetes is associated with delayed wound healing. Therefore, in diabetic MRONJ patients, HbA1C level should be checked over time as it indicates glycemic control.
Reduction in the white blood cell count (WBC) was reported to be associated with the recurrence of MRONJ. Therefore, WBC should be monitored, and if values are low, patients should be followed up closely.
MRONJ-related sepsis is a rare complication that may develop in patients with multiple risk factors. It is an emergency that needs to be monitored and managed according to the standard workflow for sepsis.

Initial workup included a complete blood count (CBC) that showed a normal white blood cell count without anemia or platelet derangements but with a small elevation in eosinophils. While possibly incidental, the elevation was notable given her recent immigration, lack of prior testing or prophylactic treatment, and mother's concern for parasitosis. An abdominal ultrasound was unable to visualize the appendix. Urinalysis showed elevated ketones but was otherwise unremarkable. Based on the elicited history, a stool ova and parasite test was sent and the patient was discharged home with strict return precautions. This course of action was taken as she was low risk for appendicitis based on the Pediatric Appendicitis Risk Calculator (pARC), her pain improved with oral acetaminophen, and the family lived near the hospital and had the ability to return quickly if needed. No abdominal computed tomography (CT) was ordered in favor of watchful waiting. Her pARC score of 14% was based on her sex, age, white blood cell count and neutrophilic percentage, duration of symptoms, maximal tenderness in her right lower abdominal quadrant, positive guarding without pain migration from the periumbilical region or demonstrated pain with walking. The following day, the stool ova and parasite test resulted positive for Dientamoeba fragilis. The patient's family was contacted, and due to her persistent pain, she was prescribed metronidazole 3 times daily for 10 days with appropriate resolution of her symptoms.

Complete blood count (CBC) parameters in pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis — The peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count can be elevated but is in the normal range in most children, and the accuracy of the WBC count for the diagnosis of AHO is less than that of CRP; WBC count may be higher on average with MRSA etiology and in complicated cases, yet WBC counts overlap considerably among these etiologies and scenarios and do not provide discriminatory value. The information provided by a CBC can provide important adjunctive information for decision-making for children with suspected or confirmed AHO, and anemia and reactive thrombocytosis may be seen in some children with AHO at presentation.

### Orthopaedic management of gout [^7019efe6]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Laboratory Analysis

The benchmark for diagnosis of gout is the appearance of negatively birefringent needle-shaped crystals in synovial fluid or tophaceous material under polarized light microscopy. This is in contrast to CPPD crystals, which will appear rhomboid shaped and positively birefringent. In addition to crystal analysis, synovial fluid samples should always be sent for cell count with differential, Gram stain and culture. Synovial fluid white blood cell (WBC) counts under 50,000 cells/μL (or mm³) in the presence of MSU crystals are generally not suspicious for septic arthritis. Special attention must be paid even in cases of synovial WBC below this level if patients are immunocompromised and unable to mount the immune response of a high synovial fluid WBC count. In addition, ruptured tophi with overlying skin ulceration should increase suspicion for possible coinfection. Synovial fluid cultures should be followed over time even in patients with low suspicion of infection, and Gram stains have a high positive predictive value but cannot exclude septic arthritis if negative.

In addition to aspiration, other laboratory tests can help confirm a diagnosis of suspected gout. C-reactive protein (CRP) is usually increased during a gout flare and can be quite high, although a high CRP alone is nonspecific. In other words, a high CRP alone does not necessarily mean that septic arthritis is present, whereas a CRP under 100 mg/dL in the setting of a lower synovial fluid WBC count and the presence of MSU crystals is generally consistent with gout. Serum WBC may or may not be elevated during a gout flare depending on the amount of systemic inflammation, and therefore, the test is less useful. Serum urate levels are also less useful as they can be normal during a gout flare, and conversely, many patients with higher serum urate levels do not have gout. Finally, blood cultures should be ordered in patients with signs of sepsis and if positive increase suspicion for septic arthritis.

### Clinical associations with a polygenic predisposition to benign lower white blood cell counts [^bfa1293b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

We examined whether a polygenic predisposition to a lower WBC count was associated with clinically significant endpoints. This predisposition was associated with an increased likelihood of having a WBC count falling outside the reference range and receiving an ICD code specifically noting an outlying value. It was also associated with an increased likelihood that a hematologist would list a low WBC count as a reason for performing a bone marrow biopsy, but a decreased likelihood that that such biopsies identified disease within the bone marrow. Genotype-informed reference ranges also demonstrated that individuals without underlying bone marrow disease were more likely to fall within expected ranges, as compared to those with pathology. Finally, a predisposition to lower a WBC count increased the likelihood of drug-induced leukopenia with treatment using chemotherapeutic or immunosuppressant therapies and increased the likelihood of cessation of azathioprine due to clinical concern for a low WBC count. Collectively, these analyses demonstrate that genetic variation which does not contribute to disease risk, is associated with clinical consequences such as undergoing diagnostic procedures or altering therapeutic regimens.

A broad range of heritable biomarkers, including WBC counts, are measured in clinical settings to guide clinical care. Many of these biomarkers are not direct mediators of disease but fluctuate in response to acute and chronic illness. Thus, they are often used to characterize an illness, which helps establish a differential diagnosis. These biomarkers are paired with clinical reference ranges which are used to standardize the delivery of health care. These reference ranges are typically constructed such that 5% of healthy individuals will have a measure that lies outside of the interval and, thus, are outliers.

The standard clinical approach toward personalizing the interpretation of biomarkers is to serially measure them in individuals when they are healthy in order to define the range of values that they fluctuate in. The limitations of this approach are the costs of repeated measurements, especially if individuals are frequently changing providers. Furthermore, 5% of healthy individuals will have values outside standard population reference ranges, which can lead to uncertainty as to whether they may harbor occult underlying disease. This uncertainty may prompt diagnostic evaluations, and is stressful to patients, as they may be subject to serial lab monitoring with no clearly specified endpoint.

White blood cell count increase

Fifteen studies (1262 cases/5318 non‐cases) reported on white blood cell count increase (Figure 3). The cut‐off values for an increase in white blood cell count varied from 9.5 × 10⁹ cells/L to 11.2 × 10⁹ cells/L, with the exception of one study that used a cut‐off value of 6.4 × 10⁹ cells/L. The median prevalence of COVID‐19 in the 12 single‐gate studies that reported on white blood cell count increase was 36% (IQR 25% to 50%).

Summary ROC plot of tests. 1: white blood cell count (WBC) increase; 2: WBC decrease

Sensitivity in the 15 included studies ranged from 0% to 73%. Fourteen studies had a sensitivity within the range between 0% and 13% and one study reported a sensitivity of 73%. This outlier also was the only study that used the lower cut‐off of 6.4 × 10⁹ cells/L. Specificity ranged from 54% to 96%.

The median specificity was 85%, with the interquartile range from 78% (Q1) to 92% (Q3). The summary estimate of sensitivity following from the HSROC model and corresponding with a specificity of 78%, was 12% (95% CI 4% to 31%).

### Evaluation of patients with leukocytosis… [^46c774fa]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis, often defined as an elevated white blood cell count greater than 11, 000 per mm³ in nonpregnant adults, is a relatively common finding with a wide differential. It is important for clinicians to be able to distinguish malignant from non-malignant etiologies, and to differentiate between the most common nonmalignant causes of leukocytosis. 5 In one study of afebrile postpartum patients, the mean WBC count was 12, 620 per mm³ for women after vaginal deliveries and 12, 710 per mm³ after cesarean deliveries. Differentiation by Type of White Blood Cell Changes in the normal distribution of types of WBCs can indicate specific causes of leukocytosis. For example, with a normal WBC count of 10, 000 per mm³ and an elevated monocyte percentage of 12, the absolute monocyte count is 12% or 0. 12 times the WBC count of 10, 000 per mm³, yielding 1, 200 per mm³, which is abnormally elevated. 9 One study showed an average increase in WBCs of 2, 770 per mm³ peaking on postoperative day 2 after knee or hip arthroplasty. 10 Medications known to increase the WBC count include corticosteroids, lithium, colony-stimulating factors, beta agonists, and epinephrine. During the recovery phase after hemorrhage or hemolysis, a rebound leukocytosis can occur. An elevated WBC count is a suggestive, but not definitive, marker of the presence of significant infection. For example, the sensitivity and specificity of an elevated WBC count in diagnosing acute appendicitis are 62% and 75%, respectively. A history of an elevated WBC count is important, because duration will help determine the likely cause. Leukocytosis lasting hours to days has a different differential diagnosis than a case that persists for weeks to months.

### Clinical associations with a polygenic predisposition to benign lower white blood cell counts [^57ec6b88]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

White blood cell (WBC) counts (the number of WBCs present within a volume of blood) are routinely measured in clinical settings to survey health, ascertain for drug toxicities and identify causes of illness. The counts are evaluated with respect to a reference interval of values expected in a healthy population, and a measurement that falls outside of the interval may prompt investigations to exclude conditions such as infections, diseases of the bone marrow, autoimmune disease, and toxicities due to medications such as chemotherapeutics and immunosuppressants. A low WBC count may also prompt clinical action due to concerns that an individual may have an immunodeficiency that could limit an effective response to infections.

A genetic predisposition toward benign lower WBC counts can impact clinical care. For instance, the rs2814778-CC genotype is common among individuals of African ancestry and is associated with lower WBC counts in the absence of underlying disease. Carriers of this genotype are more likely to undergo diagnostic investigations, including a bone marrow biopsy, and to have medications stopped due to concerns for toxicity –. These actions are driven, in part, by the use of WBC count reference ranges that are not calibrated to this genotype. While the rs2814778-CC genotype is not prevalent among European ancestry (EA) populations, numerous common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with WBC count variation have been identified in this group. Whether a polygenic predisposition toward benign lower WBC counts could have similar clinical consequences in this population is unknown.

We constructed a polygenic score for WBC counts (PGS WBC) which measures the burden of SNPs associated with WBC count that an individual carries. SNPs located near loci associated with clinically significant diseases within the differential diagnosis of a low WBC count were excluded to ensure that the PGS WBC measures benign WBC count variation. We examine a diverse range of clinical outcomes and settings to characterize the consequences of a polygenic predisposition to benign lower WBC counts.

Diagnostic procedures — laboratory tests in the diabetic foot — Consideration should be given to the following tests, but many lack the ability to impart a definitive diagnosis, necessitating clinical correlation. Clinical laboratory tests that may be needed include fasting or random blood glucose, glycohemoglobin (HbA1c), complete blood count (CBC) with or without differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum chemistries, C-reactive protein, alkaline phosphatase, wound and blood cultures, and urinalysis. Caution must be exercised in the interpretation of laboratory tests because several reports have documented the absence of leukocytosis in the presence of severe foot infections, and a common sign of persistent infection is recalcitrant hyperglycemia despite usual antihyperglycemic regimens.

### Elevation in white blood cell count after corticosteroid use in noninfected hospitalized patients [^cff6332d]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Corticosteroids are an essential inpatient treatment of many inflammatory and auto‐immune conditions. While integral to effective treatment, they also have a wide range of side effects, including immune suppression. While on steroids, patients must be closely monitored for complications such as infection.

It is well‐established that corticosteroids cause leukocytosis. Often in clinical practice, physicians confronting leukocytosis must decide if it indicates infection or simply reflects steroid use. In making this decision, physicians should be aware of the expected increase in white blood cells (WBCs) due to steroids.

Existing studies of the WBC response to corticosteroids have been limited by small sample sizes and specialized patient populations (e.g. acute infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]), and have ignored the impact of multiple doses. While they have established that corticosteroids increase WBC count, largely due to neutrophilia, the observed responses are highly variable in both magnitude and timing across doses and populations. To date, there are no large‐scale studies that examine the response by dose and timing of corticosteroids. Additionally, while studies have considered glucocorticoids and leukocytosis in acute infection, there have been no studies of noninfected patients. Such a study is necessary to define the WBC increase attributable to corticosteroids alone. Presumably, increases in WBC greater than this should raise suspicion for infection or other pathology.

Using data from a single, large health system, we aimed to quantify the WBC response to corticosteroids in noninfected patients stratified by dose and observed for up to 4 days of treatment. Our goal is to help clinicians delineate the expected rise in WBC from corticosteroids to help identify potential infections.

### Do serologic and synovial tests help diagnose infection in revision hip arthroplasty with metal-on-metal bearings or corrosion? [^98cae5ae]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) in patients with failed metal-on-metal (MoM) bearings and corrosion reactions in hip arthroplasties can be particularly difficult, because the clinical presentation of adverse local tissue reactions may mimic that of PJI, because it can also occur concurrently with PJI, and because common laboratory tests used to diagnose PJI may be elevated in patients with MoM THAs.

Questions/Purposes

We sought to determine the test properties of the serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), synovial fluid white blood cell (WBC) count, and synovial fluid differential (percent polymorphonuclear cells [PMNs]) in diagnosing PJI in either MoM hips undergoing revision for a variety of indications or in non-MoM hips undergoing revision for either corrosion reaction or full-thickness wear. Additionally, we sought to describe how MoM bearings, metal debris, and corrosion reactions can confound the analysis of the synovial fluid WBC count and affect its diagnostic use for PJI.

Methods

We reviewed 150 revision hips meeting specified inclusion criteria (92 MoM total hips, 19 MoM hip resurfacings, 30 non-MoM bearings with corrosion, and nine full-thickness bearing surface wear with metallosis). In our review, we diagnosed 19 patients as infected using Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria. Mean laboratory values were compared between infected and not infected patients and receiver operator characteristic curves were generated with an area under the curve (AUC) to determine test performance and optimal cutoffs.

Results

After excluding the inaccurate synovial fluid samples, the synovial fluid WBC count (performed accurately in 102 patients) was the best test for the diagnosis of PJI (AUC = 98%, optimal cutoff 4350 WBC/μL) followed by the differential (performed accurately in 102 patients; AUC = 90%, optimal cutoff 85% PMN). The ESR (performed in 131 patients) and CRP (performed in 129 patients) both had good sensitivity (83% and 94%, respectively). Patients meeting MSIS criteria for PJI had higher mean serum ESR, CRP, synovial fluid WBC count, and differential than those not meeting MSIS criteria (p < 0.05 for all). An observer blinded to the MSIS diagnosis of the patient assessed the synovial fluid samples for inaccuracy secondary to metal or cellular debris. Synovial fluid sample "inaccuracy" was defined as the laboratory technician noting the presence of metal or amorpous material, fragmented cells, or clots, or the sample having some defect preventing an automated cell count from being performed. Of the 141 patients who had a synovial fluid sample initially available for review, 47 (33%) had a synovial fluid sample deemed to be inaccurate. A synovial fluid WBC count was still reported; however, 35 of these 47 hips (75%) and 11 of these 35 (31%) were falsely positive for infection.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of PJI is extremely difficult in patients with MoM bearings or corrosion and the synovial fluid WBC count can frequently be falsely positive and should be relied on only if a manual count is done and if a differential can be performed. A more aggressive approach to preoperative evaluation for PJI is recommended in these patients to allow for careful evaluation of the synovial fluid specimen, the integration of synovial fluid culture results, and repeat aspiration if necessary.

### Leukocyte count and coronary heart disease: implications for risk assessment [^5ab1b99c]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Inflammation is a key feature of atherosclerosis and its clinical manifestations. The leukocyte count is a marker of inflammation that is widely available in clinical practice. This paper reviews the available epidemiologic evidence for a relationship between the leukocyte count and coronary heart disease (CHD). Numerous epidemiologic and clinical studies have shown leukocytosis to be an independent predictor of future cardiovascular events, both in healthy individuals free of CHD at baseline and in patients with stable angina, unstable angina, or a history of myocardial infarction. This relationship has been observed in prospective and retrospective cohort studies, as well as in case-control studies. It is strong, consistent, temporal, dose-dependent, and biologically plausible. The relationship persists after adjustment for multiple CHD risk factors, including smoking. Elevated differential cell counts, including eosinophil, neutrophil, and monocyte counts, also predict the future incidence of CHD. Leukocytosis affects CHD through multiple pathologic mechanisms that mediate inflammation, cause proteolytic and oxidative damage to the endothelial cells, plug the microvasculature, induce hypercoagulability, and promote infarct expansion. In summary, leukocytosis has been consistently shown to be an independent risk factor and prognostic indicator of future cardiovascular outcomes, regardless of disease status. The leukocyte count is inexpensive, reliable, easy to interpret, and ordered routinely in inpatient and outpatient settings. However, its diagnostic and prognostic utility in CHD is widely unappreciated. Further studies are needed to assess the true impact of leukocytosis on CHD, compare it with other inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and lipoprotein phospholipase A(2) levels, and promote its use in CHD prediction.

### A new perspective of blood routine test for the prediction and diagnosis of hyperglycemia [^fe0ec6c5]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study found a correlation between hyperglycemia and WBC. The hyperglycemia have higher WBC counts, and the results of univariate analysis also indicate that WBC are one of the predictor indices for hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia triggers an inflammatory response within the body, thereby contributing to the development of various diseases. The impaired glucose metabolism observed in DM patients is frequently accompanied by elevated levels of chronic inflammatory biomarkers, including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-ɑ. These hyperactivated proinflammatory cytokines perpetually stimulate immune cell activation and induce proinflammatory responses. In addition, inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6, are closely linked to insulin resistance, thereby initiating a cascade of pathological reactions. The persistent activation of the inflammatory response results in sustained stimulation of white blood cells, leading not only to an elevated white blood cell count but also to suppression of the anti-inflammatory response. The findings of our study indicated a positive correlation between elevated levels of WBC and blood glucose in patients with hyperglycemia, providing theoretical support for the hypothesis that diabetes promotes cellular-level inflammatory responses. Furthermore, it suggests that elevated WBC levels should be considered as one of the predictor indices for DM prevention.

### A clinically applicable model using blood counts to support the diagnosis of prefibrotic myelofibrosis versus essential thrombocythemia [^6b2f509e]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to distinguish between essential thrombocythemia (ET) and prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis (pre-PMF) using routine blood tests, with a focus on white blood cell (WBC) and platelet (PLT) levels. We evaluated the predicted probability of a pre-PMF diagnosis based on the interaction between WBC and PLT levels using data from a logistic regression model involving 891 patients with ET and 180 patients with pre-PMF. Patients were divided into four groups based on whether their WBC and PLT values were below or above the respective thresholds of 8.85×10⁹/L and 793×10⁹/L. The results showed that patients with low levels of both WBCs and PLTs had the lowest predicted probability of pre-PMF (6%), indicating a profile more typical of ET. When either WBC or PLT levels were elevated, the probability increased to approximately 18%-19%, indicating a potential shift toward pre-PMF features. Notably, patients with elevated levels of both WBCs and PLTs had the highest probability of a pre-PMF diagnosis (26%), which was more than four times higher than that of the low-low group. The association between combined WBC/PLT levels and a pre-PMF diagnosis remained significant (p < 0.001), even when adjusting for serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and splenomegaly. These findings suggest that elevated WBC and PLT levels together can serve as a practical and accessible diagnostic tool for supporting the differential diagnosis of ET or pre-PMF in cases of uncertainty, and for deferring bone marrow biopsy in cases of early disease presenting with isolated thrombocytosis.

### Tuberculous meningitis: pathogenesis, immune responses, diagnostic challenges, and the potential of biomarker-based approaches [^19aa749c]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The methods currently used for diagnosing TBM in children are unreliable. Symptoms and signs of the disease are not specific, and the tests used for diagnosis of the disease are highly invasive and time-consuming. General diagnostic tests, including CSF white cell count (WBC) with differential, total protein, and glucose level measurements, are performed for the diagnosis of meningitis. Typical CSF findings in TBM include increased total protein, decreased CSF-to-serum glucose ratio, and increased total WBC with lymphocytic pleocytosis. Bacterial meningitis is characterized by mild-to-marked elevated total protein, mild-to-marked decreased CSF-to-serum glucose ratio, and increased total WBC with neutrophil predominance. In viral meningitis, there are normal-to-elevated levels of total protein, usually normal CSF-to-serum glucose ratio, and minimal total WBC, with lymphocyte predominance; while fungal meningitis is characterized by elevated total protein, low CSF-to-serum glucose ratio, and minimal total WBC with lymphocyte predominance. Various diagnostic algorithms that take into account the symptoms and signs, in conjunction with results from laboratory and imaging tests, have been suggested for use in classifying individuals suspected of having TBM, at least for research purposes. The clinical management of TBM is challenging due to an incomplete understanding of the immunopathogenesis underlying the disease. Further investigations are required to update and refresh the body of knowledge for management of the disease, including the development of effective TB drugs, host-directed therapies, vaccines, and diagnostics. In the current review, we summarize evidence published in the literature on different diagnostic approaches for TBM in children, the pathogenesis and immunology of TBM, and the recent advances in the search for novel approaches, mainly biomarkers, in the diagnosis of the disease.

### Clinical significance of CBC and WBC morphology in the diagnosis and clinical course of COVID-19 infection [^09c582d5]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the clinical significance of numeric and morphologic peripheral blood (PB) changes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-positive patients in predicting the outcome, as well as to compare these changes between critically ill COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients.

Methods

The study included 90 COVID-19-positive (51 intensive care unit [ICU] and 39 non-ICU) patients and 30 COVID-19-negative ICU patients. We collected CBC parameters (both standard and research) and PB morphologic findings, which were independently scored by two hematopathologists.

Results

All patients with COVID-19 demonstrated striking numeric and morphologic WBC changes, which were different between mild and severe disease states. More severe disease was associated with significant neutrophilia and lymphopenia, which was intensified in critically ill patients. Abnormal WBC morphology, most pronounced in monocytes and lymphocytes, was associated with more mild disease; the changes were lost with disease progression. Between COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative ICU patients, significant differences in morphology-associated research parameters were indicative of changes due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus, including higher RNA content in monocytes, lower RNA content in lymphocytes, and smaller hypogranular neutrophils.

Conclusions

Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 should undergo a comprehensive daily CBC with manual WBC differential to monitor for numerical and morphologic changes predictive of poor outcome and signs of disease progression.

### Sustainable laboratory-driven method to decrease repeat, same-day WBC differentials at a tertiary care center [^efac9b69]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

A CBC with WBC differential is often ordered when a CBC alone would be sufficient for patient care. Performing unnecessary WBC differentials adds to costs in the laboratory. Our objective was to implement a laboratory middleware algorithm to cancel repeat, same-day WBC differentials to achieve lasting improvements in laboratory resource allocation.

Methods

Repeat same-day WBC differentials were first canceled only on intensive care unit samples; after a successful trial period, the algorithm was applied hospital-wide. We retrospectively reviewed CBC with differential orders from pre- and postimplementation periods to estimate the reduction in WBC differentials and potential cost savings.

Results

The algorithm led to a monthly WBC differential cancellation rate of 5.40% for a total of 10,195 canceled WBC differentials during the cumulative postimplementation period (September 25, 2019, to December 31, 2020). Nearly all (99.94%) differentials remained canceled. Most patients only had one WBC differential canceled (range, 1–38). Savings estimates showed savings of $0.99 CAD per canceled differential and 1,060 minutes (17.7 hours) of technologist time.

Conclusions

A middleware algorithm to cancel repeat, same-day WBC differentials is a simple and sustainable way to achieve lasting improvements in laboratory utilization.

### Laboratory tests in adults with monoarticular arthritis: can they rule out a septic joint? [^52f91926]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

It is difficult to differentiate septic arthritis from other causes of monoarticular arthritis solely with a history and physical examination. The clinician must rely on ancillary tests to make a diagnosis, such as the white blood cell count of peripheral blood (WBC), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and the white blood cell count of the joint fluid (jWBC) obtained from arthrocentesis. Although it is known that septic arthritis is associated with abnormalities in these tests, the majority of the data are based on studies in the pediatric population. In addition, although several emergency medicine texts indicate that a jWBC greater than 50,000 cells/mm³ is "positive", it is known that septic arthritis can occur in patients with low jWBCs.

Objectives

To determine whether specific ancillary tests have sufficiently high sensitivities to rule out septic arthritis in adults.

Methods

This was a retrospective consecutive case series of patients from an urban emergency department (ED). Patients at least 18 years old who had septic arthritis confirmed by positive arthrocentesis culture or operative findings were included in the study. WBC greater than 11,000 cells/mm³, ESR greater than 30 mm/hr, and jWBC greater than 50,000 cells/mm³ were considered elevated.

Results

Seventy-three patients met the inclusion criteria. The sensitivities of an elevated WBC, ESR, or jWBC in adults who had septic arthritis were 48%, 96%, and 64%, respectively. There were broad ranges of WBC, ESR, or jWBC among the patients. More than one third of adult patients with septic arthritis had jWBCs less than 50,000 cells/mm³. All patients had an abnormality in at least one of these tests.

Conclusions

The WBC, ESR, and jWBC are extremely variable in adults with septic arthritis. Laboratory tests do not rule out septic arthritis with accuracy.

### Paradigm shift: the copernican revolution in diverticular disease [^2561334e]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Laboratory

CRP and white blood cell (WBC) count are largely used to assess acute inflammatory status due to different causes. The Dutch College of General Practitioners' guideline on diverticulitis recommends CRP testing, even using an in-office device, when specific signs and/or symptoms are present, with concentrations of > 20 mg/L and > 100 mg/L supporting the diagnosis of uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis, respectively. However, data from other studies suggest that perforation is unlikely in acute sigmoid diverticulitis when CRP is < 50 mg/L, whereas only values > 200 mg/L are a strong indicator of perforation. Elevated WBC (> 10,000/dL) showed an 88% sensitivity and 44% specificity for diverticulitis perforation. However, a WBC count > 12,000 was adopted as cutoff for diagnosing acute diverticulitis in several studies. A WBC count > 10,000–15,000/dL, and CRP ≥ 50 mg/L had an OR for diagnosis of acute diverticulitis of 2.53 and 3.78, respectively. A recent study found that a procalcitonin value > 0.1 ng/L has 81% sensitivity and 91% specificity for differentiating complicated and uncomplicated diverticulitis when combined with abdominal CT scans. It has been also found that hyponatremia (< 136 mg/L) was significantly associated with diverticulitis (or appendicitis) perforation in patients older than 50 years. In 2009, Tursi et al published the first study showing increased semi-quantitative levels of fecal calprotectin in patients with either uncomplicated diverticulitis or SUDD, but not in asymptomatic DD, IBS patients or controls. However, the accuracy of fecal calprotectin testing in distinguishing different gastrointestinal diseases has been questioned.

### White blood cell count, especially neutrophil count, as a predictor of hypertension in a Japanese population [^7c151d26]. Hypertension Research (2008). Low credibility.

Although several studies have shown that high WBC count is a risk factor for hypertension, the relationship between WBC count and the incidence of hypertension in Japanese is poorly understood, as are the effects of WBC components on that relationship. Our objective was to verify in a Japanese population whether WBC or differential WBC count predicts hypertension incidence. A total of 9,383 initially hypertension-free subjects (3,356 men and 6,027 women), whose WBC counts were within the normal range (3,000 to < 10,000 cells/mm³), were followed from 1965 to 2004. During this 40-year follow-up, 4,606 subjects developed hypertension. After adjusting for conventional risk factors, including smoking status, we found that elevated WBC count was associated with hypertension incidence in a Cox regression model with both fixed and time-varying covariates for women. For men, elevated WBC count was a significant risk factor for hypertension only in the time-varying Cox-regression covariate. We also observed a significant association between increased neutrophil count and hypertension incidence among women. In a fully adjusted model, the relative risks of hypertension incidence, from the lowest to the highest quartiles of neutrophil count, were 1.00, 1.18, 1.28, and 1.22 in women (p for trend < 0.001). In conclusion, elevated WBC count predicted an increased incidence of hypertension in Japanese, especially among females. Moreover, neutrophils were the major WBC component contributing to the increased risk.

### MASCC / ISOO clinical practice statement: imaging and clinical laboratory tests in the diagnosis and management of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw [^1a4b3329]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). High credibility.

Laboratory workup — monitoring indicates that elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) value indicates inflammation but the specificity of this test for monitoring MRONJ is low; literature reports higher CRP levels correlate with severity of acute inflammation and larger osteolysis size; uncontrolled diabetes is associated with delayed wound healing and, therefore, in diabetic MRONJ patients, HbA1C level should be checked over time; reduction in white blood cell count (WBC) was reported to be associated with recurrence of MRONJ, so WBC should be monitored and if values are low, patients should be followed closely; MRONJ-related sepsis is a rare complication that is an emergency requiring monitoring and management according to the standard workup for sepsis.

### Fever, pancytopenia, and elevated D-dimer in a 95-year-old woman with ehrlichiosis: a case report [^ea500a58]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Cell counts during hospital course. Plots for cell counts are depicted in panels (a) platelet count (reference range 140–440 × 10³/µL), (b) hemoglobin (reference range 12.0–18.0 g/dL), and (c) white blood cell count (reference range 4.0–10.0 × 10³/µL). Hospital day zero on the x-axis denotes laboratory measurements obtained on admission

At this point, the diagnostic approach was framed around finding a unifying reason for new pancytopenia, fever, and elevated D-dimer. The index of suspicion was initially high for SARS-CoV-2 infection given the lymphopenia, fever, and elevated D-dimer along with ongoing wheezing and tachypnea; however, two negative tests made this less likely. In general, pancytopenia can result from infectious etiologies, infiltrative metastases, nutritional deficiencies, autoimmune conditions, hematological malignancies, or drug reactions. The differential diagnosis for elevated D-dimer overlaps with that of pancytopenia and includes malignancy, venous thromboembolism, advanced age, and infection.

Our patient's high fever and acute presentation prompted infectious causes to be considered. In the absence of immunosuppressive medications or active malignancy, her immune status was only compromised by her advanced age. She lacked a significant travel history, and the differential diagnosis for infectious causes of pancytopenia was narrowed to bacterial sepsis versus tick-borne illness. Upon obtaining further history from the patient and her daughter, it was noted that she had been exposed to several dogs at home, and they were known to have ticks.

Given her new thrombocytopenia and leukopenia accompanied by persistent fevers, a peripheral blood smear was ordered, and parasites consistent with Ehrlichia spp. were identified. The elevated D-dimer was multifactorial in the setting of advanced age and systemic infection, but a pulmonary embolus was possible and she intermittently required supplemental oxygen. A computed tomography angiogram of the chest was ordered and revealed right segmental pulmonary emboli. D-dimer (5.37 mg/L) level remained elevated on hospital day two.

### Chronic neutrophilic leukemia: new science and new diagnostic criteria [^91744a32]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Neutrophilic leukocytosis may underlie a wide variety of diseases, both benign and malignant. Furthermore, the clinical and laboratory features of CNL may overlap with these disorders. Given that an accurate diagnosis of CNL requires exclusion of a number of mimickers, it is critical to consider potentially confounding diagnoses such as reactive neutrophilia/leukemoid reaction, CML, CML-N, MPN/MDS (myeloproliferative neoplasms/myelodysplastic syndromes) overlap disorders such as aCML and CMML, as well as other myeloid neoplasms.

Distinguishing CNL from a leukemoid reaction can be challenging given that both may present with significant neutrophilia, bone marrow hypercellularity, normal cytogenetics, and absence of BCR-ABL fusion gene. WBC count may be more modestly elevated in leukemoid reaction, though there have been some reports of WBC counts up to 100 × 10⁹/L in this context. Meticulous history-taking along with a thorough clinical examination to exclude alternate diagnoses, including occult malignancy or infection, and a period of observation is often recommended before formally determining the diagnosis. The demonstration of clonality including identification of a CSF3R mutation or other molecular or cytogenetic abnormality is clearly valuable in aligning the diagnosis in favor of CNL.

CML is invariably associated with a BCR-ABL fusion gene and displays a disproportionally higher percentage of myelocytes. CML also commonly presents with basophilia, thrombocytosis, or eosinophilia. While the absence of the Philadelphia chromosome is implicit to CNL diagnosis, a rare form of CML termed neutrophilic-CML, or CML-N, has been described which shares morphological features of CNL, specifically a prominent neutrophilic proliferation. CML-N, however, is characterized by an uncommon BCR-ABL translocation which results in the transcription of an e19/a2 type BCR-ABL messenger RNA yielding a 230-kD BCR-ABL protein (p230). The clinical correlate is a lower total WBC count, less severe anemia, less prominent splenomegaly, and blastic transformation occurring much later in CML-N patients. The attenuated phenotype and indolent course of CML-N, specifically in patients without additional cytogenetic abnormalities, is now postulated to be due to low p230 mRNA and protein levels. The diagnosis of CNL also requires that molecular testing be negative for defining markers of alternate neoplasms including not only the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene but also rearrangements in PDGFRA/B or FGFR1, characteristic of eosinophilic leukemia.

### Receiver operating characteristic analysis of leukocyte counts in operations for suspected appendicitis [^c21e39e3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Objective

There has been no clear-cut value of the white blood cell (WBC) count in differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis in emergency medicine. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the preoperative WBC counts in 3 groups of patients operated on for a clinical suspicion of acute appendicitis with different findings at appendectomy: uninflamed appendix, uncomplicated acute appendicitis, or complicated acute appendicitis.

Methods

The medical records of 540 patients who underwent appendectomy for suspected acute appendicitis during a 17-month period were retrospectively reviewed. Data for 3 groups of patients were analyzed to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the WBC count in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, and we calculated likelihood ratios for 2 cut-points with either high sensitivity or high specificity. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate the WBC count in relation to the true diagnosis and severity of acute appendicitis.

Results

We were able to identify patients with appendicitis on a statistically significant level using receiver operating characteristic curves of WBC counts (area under the curve = 0.756, P < .001), but the WBC count had no diagnostic value in differentiating between uncomplicated and complicated groups (area under the curve = 0.55, P = 0.086). Likelihood ratio ranged from 1.79 (95% confidence interval, 1.17–2.3) for WBC count of more than 10,500 cells/mm³ to 3.20 (95% confidence interval, 2.72–3.24) for WBC count of more than 14,300 cells/mm³.

Conclusion

White blood cell count is helpful in the diagnosis and exclusion of appendicitis. However, there is no value to differentiate advanced appendicitis.

### Usefulness of white blood cell differential for early diagnosis of surgical wound infection following spinal instrumentation surgery [^74ea7fba]. Spine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Design

The white blood cell (WBC) count and WBC differential were measured prospectively in patients after spinal instrumentation surgery with or without surgical wound infection. OBJECTIVES.: To investigate the usefulness of WBC differential for early diagnosis of surgical wound infection after spinal instrumentation surgery.

Summary Of Background Data

Renewed elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP) or WBC, gallium scan, and CRP/transthyretin mass concentration ratio were reported for early diagnosis of surgical wound infection.

Methods

A total of 39 patients were enrolled in this study: 13 patients who developed wound infection within 2 weeks after spinal instrumentation surgery (infection group) and 26 patients who were comparable with those patients included in the infection group with regard to age, sex, and surgical techniques used (control group). The WBC count and WBC differential were determined before and after surgery.

Results

In both groups, WBC and percentage and number of neutrophils showed nearly same change until postoperative 4 days (day 4). However, in the infection group, these parameters had increased after day 4. In both groups, the percentage and number of lymphocytes decreased to 10% or less and 1,000/microL or less on day 1, respectively. These lymphocyte parameters began to gradually normalize on day 4 and returned to the preoperative level 3 weeks after surgery in the control group. On the other hand, these parameters remained 10% or less and 1,000/muL or less until day 11 in the infection group. In patients with infection, the percentage and number of lymphocytes significantly decreased as early as on day 4.

Conclusion

Lymphopenia represents immunodepression status, thus indicating the increased susceptibility to infection, which may lead to the development of postoperative infection. If lymphopenia is diagnosed as early as possible, surgical wound infection can be treated promptly without removing the instruments.

### Elevation in white blood cell count after corticosteroid use in noninfected hospitalized patients [^01598d18]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Our much larger sample allowed us to examine the interaction between timing and dose effect, which other studies have not considered. This is important because we found large differences by dose and days since steroid initiation. Proper interpretation requires consideration of both factors. Furthermore, the study of a specifically noninfected cohort allows us to define an expected range of WBC response to steroids not related to infection or malignancy.

Our findings should have practical import for clinicians working in hospital medicine. Elevated WBCs are common in the hospital, as are conditions that require treatment with steroids. Whether to initiate a work‐up for the leukocytosis depends on the clinician's judgment, but an important consideration is the expected rise in WBCs following steroid initiation. The dosages we studied are typical of those given in routine hospital care, and our large sample allowed us to estimate changes over time at different dosages. For example, patients with COPD are often treated with 60 mg of prednisone daily. In that case, a subsequent rise in WBC should not be attributed to steroids. In contrast, if a patient received methylprednisolone 125 mg three times daily, the WBC would be expected to rise 4–5 points by 48 h. However, no rise would be expected in the first 24 h. Nor should there be a new spike after 3 or 4 days. Such unexpected rises, either by timing or magnitude, should raise suspicion of a pathological process. Physicians may use clinical factors to further investigate leukocytosis and potential infection including vital sign abnormalities or biomarkers of infection or inflammation such as procalcitonin, C‐reactive protein, or erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

Our study has several limitations. It is from a single health system and may not be generalizable. We did not include infected patients, who may have different responses to steroids. We reported mean increases, but individuals likely have varied responses. We were unable to discern the exact indication for steroid use in our patients due to the nature of the data; however, we tried to assess this by proxy of their comorbidities and control for chronic steroid use by excluding patients with recent outpatient steroid prescription fills. Additionally, we found similar trends in WBC in patients with and without COPD.

### Differentiating dengue from COVID-19: comparison of cases in Colombia [^b7bf75e3]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is common in critically ill patients and generally suggests organic dysfunction or physiological decompensation. In dengue, it coincides with defervescence (approximately 3–5 days) and the onset of hemorrhagic manifestations during severe infection (critical phase of the disease), which constitutes severe dengue. However, in COVID-19 patients, it can occur later in the clinical course with other symptoms of severity. It is speculated that thrombocytopenia can occur by four mechanisms: cytokine storm, direct infection of hematopoietic and bone marrow stromal cells, increased antibodies and immune complexes, and lung injury.

Elevated aminotransferase levels were found in dengue patients. Aminotransferases are enzymes that catalyze transamination reactions and are markers of hepatocellular injury. In dengue, marked elevation constitutes one of the signs of disease severity since the liver is one of the target organs of virus infection, and these tests are routinely requested in patients hospitalized for dengue for clinical follow-up. In COVID-19, aminotransferases may be normal or slightly elevated; however, a marked elevation of these enzymes may constitute a marker of severity in the disease due to a systemic inflammatory response mechanism. Consequently, the dengue and SARS-CoV-2 viruses can affect the liver, and aminotransferase levels could be elevated in both diseases. Initially, they will be elevated mainly in dengue.

Dengue diagnosis is performed in tropical regions through characteristic symptom identification, such as fever, and laboratory findings, such as thrombocytopenia and capillary leakage. Currently, serological tests have been implemented and are used to confirm dengue virus infection. Nevertheless, the similarity in some of the symptoms between dengue and COVID-19, together with the potential cross-reactions in serological tests, could lead to difficulty in diagnosis and is an important issue to be considered. Several studies have reported false-positive dengue serology results in COVID-19 patients. In these patients, dengue virus infection is ruled out after controlled serological tests showing no evidence of seroconversion or persistence of positivity and the exclusion of the diagnosis of dengue by RT-PCR. Therefore, positive results in dengue serology should be carefully interpreted after the consideration of the possibility of COVID-19 patients.

Finally, in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in dengue hyperendemic regions, we recommend the careful evaluation of CBC and aminotransferase values, especially in regards to white blood cell count, platelet count, and NLR, for the evaluation of differential diagnoses during patient work up in the ER, and these values could be helpful in areas with limited resources and laboratory technologies.

### Routine laboratory testing to determine if a patient has COVID-19 [^0ace240c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical pathway

Decisions about patient and isolation pathways for COVID‐19 vary according to health services and settings, available resources, and stages of the epidemic. They will change over time if and when effective treatments and vaccines are identified. The decision points between these pathways vary, but all include points at which knowledge of the accuracy of diagnostic information is needed to be able to inform rational decisions.

Standard workup for individuals suspected of COVID‐19 infection consists of assessing signs and symptoms and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. It is common practice that, when patients enter (either outpatient or admission) the hospital, they will generally have routine laboratory tests done.

Routinely available tests for infection and inflammation may be considered in the investigation of people with possible COVID‐19 infection. For example, many healthcare facilities have access to standard laboratory tests for infection, such as CRP, procalcitonin, measures of anticoagulation, and white blood cell count with leukocyte differentiation. Routine laboratory markers may be used as a triage test, either on their own, or in combination with signs and symptoms. In low‐resource settings, they may sometimes even be the only tests available. In order to function as a triage test or stand‐alone test, a high sensitivity is needed, to prevent infected patients from being sent home or into a general ward with uninfected patients. For a triage test, specificity may be less important, as positive tests will be further investigated. Also, routine laboratory tests may be used to tip the decision to treat the patient as having COVID‐19 or not in case of mixed results from other tests or where a definite diagnosis cannot be made. In that case, knowledge of the sensitivity and specificity in a particular (pre‐tested) patient population may be useful. Routine laboratory tests may also be used in the further diagnostic workup, to predict mild versus severe outcomes, or to monitor treatment response. These aims of testing will not be the focus of this systematic review.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: the clinical utility of bronchoalveolar lavage cellular analysis in interstitial lung disease [^a8263111]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cellular analysis in suspected interstitial lung disease (ILD) — differential count and ancillary testing: Recommendation 2 states, "For patients with suspected ILD who undergo BAL, we recommend that a differential cell count be performed on the BAL fluid. This includes lymphocyte, neutrophil, eosinophil, and mast cell counts". The document adds, "The remaining sample may be used for microbiological, virological, and/or malignant cell cytology laboratory testing, if clinically indicated", and explains that routine analysis helps identify or exclude a predominantly inflammatory cellular pattern that may support a specific ILD or narrow the differential diagnosis when integrated with clinical and radiological findings.

### Elevation in white blood cell count after corticosteroid use in noninfected hospitalized patients [^45531bf5]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

It is widely accepted that corticosteroids cause leukocytosis. Clinicians must decide whether a rise in white blood cell (WBC) count is due to steroids versus other processes like developing infection.

Objective

The objective of this study is to measure the increase in white blood cell count after corticosteroid administration in hospitalized patients without malignancy, infection, or immune dysfunction.

Methods

This is a retrospective cohort study from 2017 to 2018 in a single large healthcare system. We analyzed the trajectory of WBC count stratified by steroid dose. The study included nonsurgical patients admitted with at least two complete blood count measurements. Patients were excluded if they had immunosuppression, infection, malignancy, or steroid use within 2 weeks before admission. The main outcome was mean WBC count by day following corticosteroid administration.

Results

Our sample included 28,425 patients with at least two WBC measurements, 1608 (5.7%) of which received steroids. WBC response peaked at 48h after steroid administration with a mean increase of 2.4×10⁹/L WBCs. In all patients on steroids, across doses, the mean increase was 0.3×10⁹/L WBCs, 1.7×10⁹/L WBCs, and 4.84×10⁹/L WBCs in low, medium, and high dose groups, respectively. For patients not on steroids, the mean WBC count decreased during hospitalization.

Conclusions

When interpreting WBC counts after initiating steroids, increases of up to 4.84×10⁹/L cells may be seen within 48h after high-dose steroids. Larger increases, and any increase after low-dose steroids, suggest other causes of leukocytosis.

### Interpreting complete blood counts soon after birth in newborns at risk for sepsis [^25490e91]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

A complete blood count (CBC) with white blood cell differential is commonly ordered to evaluate newborns at risk for sepsis.

Objectives

To quantify how well components of the CBC predict sepsis in the first 72 hours after birth.

Methods

For this retrospective cross-sectional study we identified 67 623 term and late-preterm (≥ 34 weeks gestation) newborns from 12 northern California Kaiser hospitals and 1 Boston, Massachusetts hospital who had a CBC and blood culture within 1 hour of each other at < 72 hours of age. We compared CBC results among newborns whose blood cultures were and were not positive and quantified discrimination by using receiver operating characteristic curves and likelihood ratios.

Results

Blood cultures of 245 infants (3.6 of 1000 tested newborns) were positive. Mean white blood cell (WBC) counts and mean absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) were lower, and mean proportions of immature neutrophils were higher in newborns with infection; platelet counts did not differ. Discrimination improved with age in the first few hours, especially for WBC counts and ANCs (eg, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for WBC counts was 0.52 at < 1 hour and 0.87 at ≥ 4 hours). Both WBC counts and ANCs were most informative when very low (eg, the likelihood ratio for ANC < 1000 was 115 at ≥ 4 hours). No test was very sensitive; the lowest likelihood ratio (for WBC count ≥ 20 000 at ≥ 4 hours) was 0.16.

Conclusion

Optimal interpretation of the CBC requires using interval likelihood ratios for the newborn's age in hours.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 10 post-travel evaluation [^a19c01e8]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Post-travel evaluation — further laboratory testing — diagnostic testing in returning travelers should be based on the differential diagnosis, and travelers with undifferentiated fever after visiting a malaria-endemic country within the prior year should have malaria testing results available urgently, ideally within a few hours. Conventional testing for malaria should be repeated 2 or 3 times over the first 24–48 hours; nucleic acid amplification tests are more sensitive and do not need to be repeated but are not commonly available in the United States. Blood cultures should be taken, enteric fever is almost always diagnosed by appropriate blood culture, and isolation of Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi or Paratyphi is essential due to increasingly common antimicrobial resistance. Arbovirus infections are best diagnosed by RT-PCR in the acute febrile phase (a dengue rapid antigen test is also reliable); rickettsioses and leptospirosis are typically diagnosed by serology, but acute serology is not highly sensitive or specific; HIV testing should be offered to all febrile patients. When routine testing fails to yield a diagnosis, storing extra tubes of serum or whole blood for paired antibody detection or nucleic acid testing is often helpful, and respiratory specimens for a multiplex PCR respiratory virus panel should be considered in all patients with fever, coryza, and myalgia. A complete blood count with differential can detect anemia, eosinophilia, leukocytosis, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia; thrombocytopenia is often present in dengue, malaria, and acute HIV and the total white cell count is often low or normal in malaria, dengue, and enteric fever. A complete metabolic profile, including creatinine, urea, liver enzymes, blood glucose, and coagulation screen, is frequently useful, and the risk to laboratory workers is very low, so delaying these tests is rarely indicated.

### Incidental neutropenia: an emergency medicine focused approach [^0e507514]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neutropenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1500 cells/microL and may be discovered incidentally in an asymptomatic, afebrile patient.

Objective

This narrative review provides an approach to the afebrile emergency department patient with incidental neutropenia.

Discussion

Neutropenia is an ANC < 1500 cells/microL, with mild neutropenia defined as an ANC ≥ 1000 to < 1500 cells/microL, moderate ≥ 500 to < 1000 cells/microL, severe < 500 cells/microL, and agranulocytosis < 200 cells/microL. Incidental or isolated neutropenia is an ANC < 1500 cells/microL discovered on laboratory testing unrelated to the patient's chief complaint (e.g., chest pain, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, etc.) and not associated with fever or infectious signs and symptoms. There are a variety of etiologies, with inherited forms, dose-dependent drug-induced neutropenia, and infections the most common causes. Testing includes complete blood count with differential and peripheral smear. Management is based on the patient's hemodynamic status, presence of fever, severity of neutropenia, and the peripheral smear. Patients who are critically ill, febrile, have severe neutropenia, or have a concerning peripheral smear (schistocytes, atypical lymphocytes) should undergo hematology consultation. Those with critical illness or fever with neutropenia should receive broad-spectrum antibiotics. Patients who are afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and non-toxic appearing with mild or moderate neutropenia can likely be discharged for repeat testing in one to two weeks.

Conclusion

Understanding the approach to incidental neutropenia can improve patient care. Critically ill or febrile patients should be admitted, but select patients may be discharged.

### Use of the psycheMERGE network to investigate the association between depression polygenic scores and white blood cell count [^8a19fe04]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Mediation Analysis

Two potential pathways between depression PGS, WBC count, and depression diagnosis were assessed using mediation analyses. In the first analysis, median WBC count was modeled as a mediator of the relationship between depression PGS (exposure) and depression diagnosis (outcome). Meta-analysis across all sites revealed that WBC count mediated 2.5% of the association between depression PGS and depression diagnosis (95% CI, 2.2%-20.8%; P = 2.84 × 10⁻⁷⁰) (Table 2; eTable 12 in Supplement 1). When excluding MVP from the meta-analysis, WBC count mediated 0.5% of the association, although this was not a statistically significant association (95% CI, –0.03% to 0.9%; P = 0.06).

Table 2.
White Blood Cell a and Depression Diagnosis Mediation Analysis

Abbreviations: MGB, Mass General Brigham; MSSM, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; MVP, Million Veteran Program; PGS, polygenic scores; VUMC, Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

In the second analysis, depression diagnosis was modeled as a mediator of the association between the depression PGS (exposure) and median WBC count (outcome). Meta-analysis across all sites indicated that depression diagnosis mediated 9.8% of the association between depression PGS and WBC count (95% CI, 8.4%-11.1%; P = 1.78 × 10⁻⁴⁴) (Table 2; eTable 13 in Supplement 1). A depression diagnosis mediated 1.4% of the association when excluding MVP from the meta-analysis (95% CI, –0.6% to 3.4%; P = 0.17).

Depression PGS and WBC-Differential Mediation Analysis

White blood cell counts are calculated from the sum of 5 different cell subtypes: neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils. These cell subtypes can be measured along with the total WBC count using a complete blood count differential laboratory panel. To determine whether specific WBC components accounted for the associations between depression PGS and depression diagnosis, we performed a series of multiple mediator analyses.

When depression PGS was modeled as the exposure and depression diagnosis as the outcome, neutrophils were the only cell type that explained a significant proportion (1.9%; 95% CI, 0.2%-3.1%) of the association between depression PGS and depression diagnosis (eTable 14 in Supplement 1).

### Elimination of instrument-driven reflex manual differential leukocyte counts. optimization of manual blood smear review criteria in a high-volume automated hematology laboratory [^554ecfcd]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Automated peripheral blood leukocyte differential counts (LDCs) are widely accepted in routine practice. However, many laboratories still reflexively perform manual LDCs based solely on abnormal automated results or instrument "flags", before any manual triage step. We describe our transition to a procedure that uses manual methods to validate, rather than to replace, automated LDCs (an approach recommended early in the development of automated methods, but still not used in many clinical laboratories). Manual microscopic scans were performed in lieu of manual LDCs. Each scan that revealed cell types not quantifiable by the instrument triggered a manual LDC. However, if the manual scan simply confirmed the cell types seen on automated LDC, then the automated result was released, even if clinically significant quantitative abnormalities were present. This policy reduced manual LDCs by more than 70% and was validated by a manual retrospective audit. Patient care and laboratory operations can be optimized by using manual microscopic examination as a validation procedure rather than as a reflexive substitute for automated methods. There is no clinical rationale for reflex performance of manual LDCs based solely on instrument warnings.

### The 2013 frank stinchfield award: diagnosis of infection in the early postoperative period after total hip arthroplasty [^1008c173]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) can be difficult in the early postoperative period after total hip arthroplasty (THA) because normal cues from the physical examination often are unreliable, and serological markers commonly used for diagnosis are elevated from the recent surgery.

Questions/Purposes

The purposes of this study were to determine the optimal cutoff values for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), synovial fluid white blood cell (WBC) count, and differential for diagnosing PJI in the early postoperative period after primary THA.

Methods

We reviewed 6033 consecutive primary THAs and identified 73 patients (1.2%) who underwent reoperation for any reason within the first 6 weeks postoperatively. Thirty-six of these patients were infected according to modified Musculoskeletal Infection Society criteria. Mean values for the diagnostic tests were compared between groups and receiver operating characteristic curves generated along with an area under the curve (AUC) to determine test performance and optimal cutoff values to diagnose infection.

Results

The best test for the diagnosis of PJI was the synovial fluid WBC count (AUC = 98%; optimal cutoff value 12,800 cells/μL) followed by the CRP (AUC = 93%; optimal cutoff value 93 mg/L), and synovial fluid differential (AUC = 91%; optimal cutoff value 89% PMN). The mean ESR (infected = 69 mm/hr, not infected = 46 mm/hr), CRP (infected = 192 mg/L, not infected = 30 mg/L), synovial fluid WBC count (infected = 84,954 cells/μL, not infected = 2391 cells/μL), and differential (infected = 91% polymorphonuclear cells [PMN], not infected = 63% PMN) all were significantly higher in the infected group.

Conclusions

Optimal cutoff values for the diagnosis of PJI in the acute postoperative period were higher than those traditionally used for the diagnosis of chronic PJI. The serum CRP is an excellent screening test, whereas the synovial fluid WBC count is more specific.

### The diagnosis and management of recurrent ischemic priapism, priapism in sickle cell patients, and non-ischemic priapism: an AUA / SMSNA guideline [^7928286e]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

AUA/SMSNA guideline — laboratory evaluation in acute ischemic priapism states that optimal blood tests have not been defined and should be selectively ordered based on specific patient risk factors and clinical suspicion; a complete blood count (CBC) may identify elevated white blood cell counts suggesting malignancy. Among men with sickle cell disease (SCD), acute ischemic priapism is associated with lower hemoglobin and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, reticulocyte count, white blood cells, and platelet counts, and platelet and eosinophil counts may also be elevated; however, these laboratory values often will not be used to guide treatment of the acute presentation. Hemoglobin electrophoresis or similar hemoglobinopathy testing may be appropriate in select clinical scenarios, and electrophoresis and other sickle cell testing should be reserved for select clinical scenarios, while a reticulocyte count will assist in determining the status of a patient with SCD and may be incorporated into the workup along with a CBC. Testing for potential substances may have a high rate of false negativity, and given these associated risks, a thorough medication and social history may provide enough information to determine the underlying cause without collection of these studies.

### Elevation in white blood cell count after corticosteroid use in noninfected hospitalized patients [^c5ec430c]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

It is widely accepted that corticosteroids cause leukocytosis. Clinicians must decide whether a rise in white blood cell (WBC) count is due to steroids versus other processes like developing infection.

Objective

The objective of this study is to measure the increase in white blood cell count after corticosteroid administration in hospitalized patients without malignancy, infection, or immune dysfunction.

Methods

This is a retrospective cohort study from 2017 to 2018 in a single large healthcare system. We analyzed the trajectory of WBC count stratified by steroid dose. The study included nonsurgical patients admitted with at least two complete blood count measurements. Patients were excluded if they had immunosuppression, infection, malignancy, or steroid use within 2 weeks before admission. The main outcome was mean WBC count by day following corticosteroid administration.

Results

Our sample included 28,425 patients with at least two WBC measurements, 1608 (5.7%) of which received steroids. WBC response peaked at 48 h after steroid administration with a mean increase of 2.4 × 10⁹/L WBCs. In all patients on steroids, across doses, the mean increase was 0.3 × 10⁹/L WBCs, 1.7 × 10⁹/L WBCs, and 4.84 × 10⁹/L WBCs in low, medium, and high dose groups, respectively. For patients not on steroids, the mean WBC count decreased during hospitalization.

Conclusions

When interpreting WBC counts after initiating steroids, increases of up to 4.84 × 10⁹/L cells may be seen within 48 h after high‐dose steroids. Larger increases, and any increase after low‐dose steroids, suggest other causes of leukocytosis.
