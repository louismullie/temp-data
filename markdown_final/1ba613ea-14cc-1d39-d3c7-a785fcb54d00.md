## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what spectrum is observed when a star's light passes through a cloud of cool hydrogen gas, and which answer choice best matches that expectation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the source spectrum from the star. Then, I should verify what happens when that continuum light traverses cool, neutral hydrogen. Next, I will consider whether the cloud itself emits significantly at visible wavelengths. After that, I should review analogous observational examples to confirm the expected line morphology. Finally, I will compare the options and select the best fit, making sure I haven't overlooked any exceptions like emission nebulae or helium dominance.

> Let me first confirm the source spectrum. Stars emit a near-blackbody continuum across wavelengths, including the visible, with absorption features imprinted by their own photospheres; Vega, for example, shows a continuum with hydrogen absorption lines, establishing that stellar spectra are continua with absorption features rather than pure line spectra or pure continua without lines [^dc4e4cf8].

> Now, I need to check what happens when that stellar continuum passes through a cool hydrogen cloud. Cool, neutral hydrogen atoms in the cloud will absorb photons at the precise wavelengths corresponding to electronic transitions, producing absorption lines superimposed on the stellar continuum; this is the classic mechanism for interstellar absorption lines seen toward background stars, including hydrogen lines and other species, and it is consistent with the general presence of diffuse interstellar bands in stellar spectra viewed through interstellar material [^abfb1167].

> Wait, let me verify whether the cool cloud itself emits significantly at visible wavelengths. Emission lines typically require excitation, often via ultraviolet radiation or collisions in warmer, ionized regions; a cool, neutral hydrogen cloud lacks the energetic conditions to produce strong visible emission lines, so we should not expect emission features from the cloud in this scenario, which aligns with the absence of reported visible hydrogen emission from such cold gas in the provided sources [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should review concrete examples to ensure I'm not missing a nuance. Observational studies of stars viewed through interstellar material consistently show absorption features imprinted on the stellar continuum, not emission features from the intervening gas; for instance, spectra of background stars through dark clouds and diffuse material reveal extinction and absorption signatures, reinforcing that the expected modification is absorption lines on top of the continuum rather than emission lines or a featureless continuum [^19be9bd8] [^abfb1167].

> Let me consider the answer choices carefully. Options proposing only emission lines (E, J) or only a blackbody spectrum without lines (B, D) conflict with the physics of stellar continua and interstellar absorption; options suggesting helium lines (C, F) introduce an element not specified in the setup and are unsupported here; options implying only absorption from the star itself (I) ignore the intervening cloud; options mixing emission and continuum (A, H) incorrectly assume the cool cloud emits visibly. The correct description is the star's blackbody continuum with superimposed hydrogen absorption lines from the cool cloud, which corresponds to option G [^dc4e4cf8] [^abfb1167].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if a cool hydrogen cloud might still produce faint emission lines, but I should double-check the excitation requirements. Visible hydrogen emission, such as Balmer lines, generally requires higher temperatures or ionizing radiation to excite electrons to the necessary levels; in the absence of such excitation, a cool, neutral cloud acts as an absorber, not an emitter, at visible wavelengths, so emission options are not appropriate here [^notfound].

> Final answer: G. You see the star's blackbody spectrum with absorption lines due to hydrogen, because the stellar continuum passes through cool, neutral hydrogen that absorbs at characteristic wavelengths, producing absorption lines superimposed on the continuum [^dc4e4cf8] [^abfb1167].

---

The correct answer is **G. You see the star's blackbody spectrum with absorption lines due to hydrogen**. The star's continuum light passes through the cool hydrogen cloud, which absorbs specific wavelengths corresponding to hydrogen's electronic transitions, producing **dark absorption lines** (e.g. the Balmer series) superimposed on the stellar continuum. Emission lines would only appear if the gas were hot or excited, which is not the case here [^notfound].

## Physics of stellar spectra

Stars emit light across a broad range of wavelengths, approximating a **blackbody spectrum** determined by their surface temperature. This continuum spectrum provides the background light that passes through the interstellar medium, including clouds of gas such as hydrogen.

---

## Interaction of starlight with cool hydrogen gas

When starlight passes through a cloud of cool hydrogen gas, several processes can occur:

- **Absorption**: Hydrogen atoms in the cloud can absorb specific wavelengths of light, corresponding to electronic transitions between energy levels. These absorption lines are characteristic of hydrogen and appear as dark lines superimposed on the stellar continuum spectrum.

- **Emission**: If the hydrogen gas is excited or ionized, it can emit light at specific wavelengths, producing emission lines. However, in this scenario, the hydrogen gas is described as "cool", implying it is not significantly excited or ionized.

- **Transmission**: Most of the starlight passes through the cloud unaffected, maintaining the overall shape of the stellar blackbody spectrum.

---

## Expected observed spectrum

Given the scenario of observing a star through a cloud of cool hydrogen gas, the following spectrum is expected:

- **Continuum spectrum**: The underlying stellar blackbody spectrum will be visible, providing the continuous background light.

- **Absorption lines**: Dark absorption lines characteristic of hydrogen will be superimposed on the continuum spectrum. These lines correspond to the specific wavelengths of light absorbed by hydrogen atoms in the cloud.

- **No significant emission lines**: Since the hydrogen gas is cool and not significantly excited, emission lines are not expected to be prominent in the observed spectrum.

---

## Characteristic hydrogen absorption lines

The most prominent hydrogen absorption lines in the visible spectrum are part of the **Balmer series**, which correspond to transitions from higher energy levels to the second energy level (n = 2). These lines include:

| **Wavelength (nm)** | **Transition** | **Line designation** |
|-|-|-|
| 656.3 | n = 3 → 2 | H-alpha (red) |
| 486.1 | n = 4 → 2 | H-beta (blue-green) |
| 434.0 | n = 5 → 2 | H-gamma (violet) |
| 410.2 | n = 6 → 2 | H-delta (violet) |

---

These lines will appear as dark absorption features superimposed on the stellar continuum spectrum, indicating the presence of cool hydrogen gas along the line of sight.

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **G. You see the star's blackbody spectrum with absorption lines due to hydrogen**. The star's continuum light passes through the cool hydrogen cloud, which absorbs specific wavelengths, producing characteristic hydrogen absorption lines superimposed on the stellar spectrum. Emission lines are not expected because the hydrogen gas is cool and not significantly excited.

## References

### Vega is a rapidly rotating star [^dc4e4cf8]. Nature (2006). Excellent credibility.

Vega, the second brightest star in the northern hemisphere, serves as a primary spectral type standard. Although its spectrum is dominated by broad hydrogen lines, the narrower lines of the heavy elements suggested slow to moderate rotation, giving confidence that the ground-based calibration of its visible spectrum could be safely extrapolated into the ultraviolet and near-infrared (through atmosphere models), where it also serves as the primary photometric calibrator. But there have been problems: the star is too bright compared to its peers and it has unusually shaped absorption line profiles, leading some to suggest that it is a distorted, rapidly rotating star seen pole-on. Here we report optical interferometric observations that show that Vega has the asymmetric brightness distribution of the bright, slightly offset polar axis of a star rotating at 93 per cent of its breakup speed. In addition to explaining the unusual brightness and line shape peculiarities, this result leads to the prediction of an excess of near-infrared emission compared to the visible, in agreement with observations. The large temperature differences predicted across its surface call into question composition determinations, adding uncertainty to Vega's age and opening the possibility that its debris disk could be substantially older than previously thought.

### Internal structure of a cold dark molecular cloud inferred from the extinction of background starlight [^19be9bd8]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

Stars and planets form within dark molecular clouds, but little is understood about the internal structure of these clouds, and consequently about the initial conditions that give rise to star and planet formation. The clouds are primarily composed of molecular hydrogen, which is virtually inaccessible to direct observation. But the clouds also contain dust, which is well mixed with the gas and which has well understood effects on the transmission of light. Here we use sensitive near-infrared measurements of the light from background stars as it is absorbed and scattered by trace amounts of dust to probe the internal structure of the dark cloud Barnard 68 with unprecedented detail. We find the cloud's density structure to be very well described by the equations for a pressure-confined, self-gravitating isothermal sphere that is critically stable according to the Bonnor-Ebert criteria. As a result we can precisely specify the physical conditions inside a dark cloud on the verge of collapse to form a star.

### Extremely metal-poor gas at a redshift of 7 [^a1d913d1]. Nature (2012). Excellent credibility.

In typical astrophysical environments, the abundance of heavy elements ranges from 0.001 to 2 times the solar value. Lower abundances have been seen in selected stars in the Milky Way's halo and in two quasar absorption systems at redshift z = 3 (ref. 4). These are widely interpreted as relics from the early Universe, when all gas possessed a primordial chemistry. Before now there have been no direct abundance measurements from the first billion years after the Big Bang, when the earliest stars began synthesizing elements. Here we report observations of hydrogen and heavy-element absorption in a spectrum of a quasar at z = 7.04, when the Universe was just 772million years old (5.6 per cent of its present age). We detect a large column of neutral hydrogen but no corresponding metals (defined as elements heavier than helium), limiting the chemical abundance to less than 1/10,000 times the solar level if the gas is in a gravitationally bound proto-galaxy, or to less than 1/1,000 times the solar value if it is diffuse and unbound. If the absorption is truly intergalactic, it would imply that the Universe was neither ionized by starlight nor chemically enriched in this neighbourhood at z≈7. If it is gravitationally bound, the inferred abundance is too low to promote efficient cooling, and the system would be a viable site to form the predicted but as yet unobserved massive population III stars.

### Infrared diffuse interstellar bands in the galactic centre region [^abfb1167]. Nature (2011). Excellent credibility.

The spectrum of any star viewed through a sufficient quantity of diffuse interstellar material reveals a number of absorption features collectively called 'diffuse interstellar bands' (DIBs). The first DIBs were reported about 90 years ago, and currently well over 500 are known. None of them has been convincingly identified with any specific element or molecule, although recent studies suggest that the DIB carriers are polyatomic molecules containing carbon. Most of the DIBs currently known are at visible and very near-infrared wavelengths, with only two previously known at wavelengths beyond one micrometre (10,000 ångströms), the longer of which is at 1.318micrometres (ref. 6). Here we report 13 diffuse interstellar bands in the 1.5-1.8 micrometre interval on high-extinction sightlines towards stars in the Galactic Centre. We argue that they originate almost entirely in the Galactic Centre region, a considerably warmer and harsher environment than where DIBs have been observed previously. The relative strengths of these DIBs towards the Galactic Centre and the Cygnus OB2 diffuse cloud are consistent with their strengths scaling mainly with the extinction by diffuse material.

### Compression and ablation of the photo-irradiated molecular cloud the orion bar [^bd9104d2]. Nature (2016). Excellent credibility.

The Orion Bar is the archetypal edge-on molecular cloud surface illuminated by strong ultraviolet radiation from nearby massive stars. Our relative closeness to the Orion nebula (about 1,350 light years away from Earth) means that we can study the effects of stellar feedback on the parental cloud in detail. Visible-light observations of the Orion Bar show that the transition between the hot ionized gas and the warm neutral atomic gas (the ionization front) is spatially well separated from the transition between atomic and molecular gas (the dissociation front), by about 15 arcseconds or 6,200 astronomical units (one astronomical unit is the Earth-Sun distance). Static equilibrium models used to interpret previous far-infrared and radio observations of the neutral gas in the Orion Bar (typically at 10-20 arcsecond resolution) predict an inhomogeneous cloud structure comprised of dense clumps embedded in a lower-density extended gas component. Here we report one-arcsecond-resolution millimetre-wave images that allow us to resolve the molecular cloud surface. In contrast to stationary model predictions, there is no appreciable offset between the peak of the H 2 vibrational emission (delineating the H/H 2 transition) and the edge of the observed CO and HCO + emission. This implies that the H/H 2 and C + /C/CO transition zones are very close. We find a fragmented ridge of high-density substructures, photoablative gas flows and instabilities at the molecular cloud surface. The results suggest that the cloud edge has been compressed by a high-pressure wave that is moving into the molecular cloud, demonstrating that dynamical and non-equilibrium effects are important for the cloud evolution.

### H (2) emission arises outside photodissociation regions in ultraluminous infrared galaxies [^d4841df4]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

Ultraluminous infrared galaxies are among the most luminous objects in the local Universe and are thought to be powered by intense star formation. It has been shown that in these objects the rotational spectral lines of molecular hydrogen observed at mid-infrared wavelengths are not affected by dust obscuration, but left unresolved was the source of excitation for this emission. Here I report an analysis of archival Spitzer Space Telescope data on ultraluminous infrared galaxies and demonstrate that dust obscuration affects star formation indicators but not molecular hydrogen. I thereby establish that the emission of H(2) is not co-spatial with the buried starburst activity and originates outside the obscured regions. This is unexpected in light of the standard view that H(2) emission is directly associated with star-formation activity. I propose the alternative view that H(2) emission in these objects traces shocks in the surrounding material that are excited by interactions with nearby galaxies. Large-scale shocks cooling by means of H(2) emission may accordingly be more common than previously thought. In the early Universe, a boost in H(2) emission by this process may have accelerated the cooling of matter as it collapsed to form the first stars and galaxies, and would make these first structures more readily observable.

### An absorption profile centred at 78 megahertz in the sky-averaged spectrum [^fc5a88c4]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

After stars formed in the early Universe, their ultraviolet light is expected, eventually, to have penetrated the primordial hydrogen gas and altered the excitation state of its 21-centimetre hyperfine line. This alteration would cause the gas to absorb photons from the cosmic microwave background, producing a spectral distortion that should be observable today at radio frequencies of less than 200 megahertz. Here we report the detection of a flattened absorption profile in the sky-averaged radio spectrum, which is centred at a frequency of 78 megahertz and has a best-fitting full-width at half-maximum of 19 megahertz and an amplitude of 0.5 kelvin. The profile is largely consistent with expectations for the 21-centimetre signal induced by early stars; however, the best-fitting amplitude of the profile is more than a factor of two greater than the largest predictions. This discrepancy suggests that either the primordial gas was much colder than expected or the background radiation temperature was hotter than expected. Astrophysical phenomena (such as radiation from stars and stellar remnants) are unlikely to account for this discrepancy; of the proposed extensions to the standard model of cosmology and particle physics, only cooling of the gas as a result of interactions between dark matter and baryons seems to explain the observed amplitude. The low-frequency edge of the observed profile indicates that stars existed and had produced a background of Lyman-α photons by 180million years after the Big Bang. The high-frequency edge indicates that the gas was heated to above the radiation temperature less than 100million years later.

### A combined transmission spectrum of the earth-sized exoplanets TRAPPIST-1 b and C [^c862e972]. Nature (2016). Excellent credibility.

Three Earth-sized exoplanets were recently discovered close to the habitable zone of the nearby ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 (ref. 3). The nature of these planets has yet to be determined, as their masses remain unmeasured and no observational constraint is available for the planetary population surrounding ultracool dwarfs, of which the TRAPPIST-1 planets are the first transiting example. Theoretical predictions span the entire atmospheric range, from depleted to extended hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. Here we report observations of the combined transmission spectrum of the two inner planets during their simultaneous transits on 4 May 2016. The lack of features in the combined spectrum rules out cloud-free hydrogen-dominated atmospheres for each planet at≥10σ levels; TRAPPIST-1 b and c are therefore unlikely to have an extended gas envelope as they occupy a region of parameter space in which high-altitude cloud/haze formation is not expected to be significant for hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. Many denser atmospheres remain consistent with the featureless transmission spectrum-from a cloud-free water-vapour atmosphere to a Venus-like one.

### Deficiency of molecular hydrogen in the disk of beta pictoris [^b8e5e6a5]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

Molecular hydrogen (H2) is by far the most abundant material from which stars, protoplanetary disks and giant planets form, but it is difficult to detect directly. Infrared emission lines from H2 have recently been reported towards beta Pictoris, a star harbouring a young planetary system. This star is surrounded by a dusty 'debris disk' that is continuously replenished either by collisions between asteroidal objects or by evaporation of ices on Chiron-like objects. A gaseous disk has also been inferred from absorption lines in the stellar spectrum. Here we present the far-ultraviolet spectrum of beta Pictoris, in which H2 absorption lines are not seen. This allows us to set a very low upper limit on the column density of H2: N(H2) </= 1018 cm-2. This non-detection is puzzling when compared to the quantity of H2 inferred from the infrared observations, but it does show that H2 is not in the disk on the direct line of sight. Carbon monoxide (CO) has been seen in absorption against the star, yielding a ratio of CO/H2 > 6 x 10-4. As CO would be destroyed under ambient conditions in about 200 years (refs 9, 11), our result demonstrates that the CO in the disk arises from evaporation of planetesimals.

### Earth's transmission spectrum from lunar eclipse observations [^bb7a30f4]. Nature (2009). Excellent credibility.

Of the 342 planets so far discovered orbiting other stars, 58 'transit' the stellar disk, meaning that they can be detected through a periodic decrease in the flux of starlight. The light from the star passes through the atmosphere of the planet, and in a few cases the basic atmospheric composition of the planet can be estimated. As we get closer to finding analogues of Earth, an important consideration for the characterization of extrasolar planetary atmospheres is what the transmission spectrum of our planet looks like. Here we report the optical and near-infrared transmission spectrum of the Earth, obtained during a lunar eclipse. Some biologically relevant atmospheric features that are weak in the reflection spectrum (such as ozone, molecular oxygen, water, carbon dioxide and methane) are much stronger in the transmission spectrum, and indeed stronger than predicted by modelling. We also find the 'fingerprints' of the Earth's ionosphere and of the major atmospheric constituent, molecular nitrogen (N(2)), which are missing in the reflection spectrum.

### A massive cloud of cold atomic hydrogen in the outer galaxy [^290e9966]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

A large fraction of the mass of the interstellar medium in our Galaxy is in the form of warm (103-104 K) and cool (50-100 K) atomic hydrogen (H i) gas. Cold (10-30 K) regions are thought to be dominated by dense clouds of molecular hydrogen. Cold H i is difficult to observe, and therefore our knowledge of its abundance and distribution in the interstellar medium is poor. The few known clouds of cold H i are much smaller in size and mass than typical molecular clouds. Here we report the discovery that the H i supershell GSH139-03-69 is very cold (10 K). It is about 2 kiloparsecs in size and as massive as the largest molecular complexes. The existence of such an immense structure composed of cold atomic hydrogen in the interstellar medium runs counter to the prevailing view that cold gas resides almost exclusively in clouds dominated by molecular hydrogen.

### A lower limit of δ Z > 0.06 for the duration of the reionization epoch [^c937407f]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

Observations of the 21-centimetre line of atomic hydrogen in the early Universe directly probe the history of the reionization of the gas between galaxies. The observations are challenging, though, because of the low expected signal strength (∼10mK), and contamination by strong (>100K) foreground synchrotron emission in the Milky Way and extragalactic continuum sources. If reionization happened rapidly, there should be a characteristic signature visible against the smooth foreground in an all-sky spectrum. Here we report an all-sky spectrum between 100 and 200MHz, corresponding to the redshift range 6<z<13 for the 21-centimetre line. The data exclude a rapid reionization timescale of Δz<0.06 at the 95% confidence level.

### A featureless transmission spectrum for the neptune-mass exoplanet GJ 436b [^14ff64fb]. Nature (2014). Excellent credibility.

GJ436b is a warm--approximately 800 kelvin--exoplanet that periodically eclipses its low-mass (half the mass of the Sun) host star, and is one of the few Neptune-mass planets that is amenable to detailed characterization. Previous observations have indicated that its atmosphere has a ratio of methane to carbon monoxide that is 10(5) times smaller than predicted by models for hydrogen-dominated atmospheres at these temperatures. A recent study proposed that this unusual chemistry could be explained if the planet's atmosphere is significantly enhanced in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. Here we report observations of GJ 436b's atmosphere obtained during transit. The data indicate that the planet's transmission spectrum is featureless, ruling out cloud-free, hydrogen-dominated atmosphere models with an extremely high significance of 48σ. The measured spectrum is consistent with either a layer of high cloud located at a pressure level of approximately one millibar or with a relatively hydrogen-poor (three per cent hydrogen and helium mass fraction) atmospheric composition.

### A turbulent wake as a tracer of 30, 000 years of mira's mass loss history [^af2ffdd6]. Nature (2007). Excellent credibility.

Mira is one of the first variable stars ever discovered and it is the prototype (and also the nearest example) of a class of low-to-intermediate-mass stars in the late stages of stellar evolution. These stars are relatively common and they return a large fraction of their original mass to the interstellar medium (ISM) (ref. 2) through a processed, dusty, molecular wind. Thus stars in Mira's stage of evolution have a direct impact on subsequent star and planet formation in their host galaxy. Previously, the only direct observation of the interaction between Mira-type stellar winds and the ISM was in the infrared. Here we report the discovery of an ultraviolet-emitting bow shock and turbulent wake extending over 2 degrees on the sky, arising from Mira's large space velocity and the interaction between its wind and the ISM. The wake is visible only in the far ultraviolet and is consistent with an unusual emission mechanism whereby molecular hydrogen is excited by turbulent mixing of cool molecular gas and shock-heated gas. This wind wake is a tracer of the past 30,000 years of Mira's mass-loss history and provides an excellent laboratory for studying turbulent stellar wind-ISM interactions.

Overlaid in purple and dark cyan are the median retrieval models for the source with and without temperature inversion, respectively. Data uncertainties are shaded in grey. The 67% confidence intervals in the model posteriors are shaded in dark cyan and purple but are of comparable extent to the width of the plotted data.

Fig. 3 
Retrieved thermal profiles for W1935 with and without thermal inversion.

Median posterior profiles for the models are shown in purple and dark cyan, respectively. The 67% confidence intervals for the model posteriors are indicated with shading for each. Also plotted with dashed lines are the condensation curves (assuming solar composition gas) for possible cloud species.

Temperature inversions have been inferred before in substellar atmospheres, for both brown dwarfsand giant exoplanets, not to mention being nearly ubiquitous within the Solar System. The common feature of all of these cases is the presence of an irradiating star. However, the stratospheres of the gas planets in the Solar System display temperatures even higher than can be attributed to irradiation alone –. Our result represents a spectacular extension of this gas giant phenomenon without any stellar irradiation.

Much work has been dedicated to understanding the Solar System cases of enhanced stratospheric heating. Both external heating by auroral processes and internal energy transport by vertically propagating waves from deeper in the atmosphere are possible mechanisms –. The latter is a plausible explanation for the thermal inversion modelled for W1935. However, one would expect this process to be ubiquitous across a range of atmospheres. Given that this is the only non-irradiated example to date, such a universal mechanism is less likely to be responsible.

### Possible interaction between baryons and dark-matter particles revealed by the first stars [^61100819]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

The cosmic radio-frequency spectrum is expected to show a strong absorption signal corresponding to the 21-centimetre-wavelength transition of atomic hydrogen around redshift 20, which arises from Lyman-α radiation from some of the earliest stars. By observing this 21-centimetre signal-either its sky-averaged spectrum or maps of its fluctuations, obtained using radio interferometers-we can obtain information about cosmic dawn, the era when the first astrophysical sources of light were formed. The recent detection of the global 21-centimetre spectrum reveals a stronger absorption than the maximum predicted by existing models, at a confidence level of 3.8 standard deviations. Here we report that this absorption can be explained by the combination of radiation from the first stars and excess cooling of the cosmic gas induced by its interaction with dark matter. Our analysis indicates that the spatial fluctuations of the 21-centimetre signal at cosmic dawn could be an order of magnitude larger than previously expected and that the dark-matter particle is no heavier than several proton masses, well below the commonly predicted mass of weakly interacting massive particles. Our analysis also confirms that dark matter is highly non-relativistic and at least moderately cold, and primordial velocities predicted by models of warm dark matter are potentially detectable. These results indicate that 21-centimetre cosmology can be used as a dark-matter probe.

### Water vapour absorption in the clear atmosphere of a neptune-sized exoplanet [^82cbab0b]. Nature (2014). Excellent credibility.

Transmission spectroscopy has so far detected atomic and molecular absorption in Jupiter-sized exoplanets, but intense efforts to measure molecular absorption in the atmospheres of smaller (Neptune-sized) planets during transits have revealed only featureless spectra. From this it was concluded that the majority of small, warm planets evolve to sustain atmospheres with high mean molecular weights (little hydrogen), opaque clouds or scattering hazes, reducing our ability to observe the composition of these atmospheres. Here we report observations of the transmission spectrum of the exoplanet HAT-P-11b (which has a radius about four times that of Earth) from the optical wavelength range to the infrared. We detected water vapour absorption at a wavelength of 1.4 micrometres. The amplitude of the water absorption (approximately 250 parts per million) indicates that the planetary atmosphere is predominantly clear down to an altitude corresponding to about 1 millibar, and sufficiently rich in hydrogen to have a large scale height (over which the atmospheric pressure varies by a factor of e). The spectrum is indicative of a planetary atmosphere in which the abundance of heavy elements is no greater than about 700 times the solar value. This is in good agreement with the core-accretion theory of planet formation, in which a gas giant planet acquires its atmosphere by accreting hydrogen-rich gas directly from the protoplanetary nebula onto a large rocky or icy core.

### A probable keplerian disk feeding an optically revealed massive young star [^5a37511e]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

In summary, the probable Keplerian disk of the central high-mass star driving HH 1177 is, in almost all aspects, like its Milky Way counterparts. However, it stands out for two reasons. The first is that rather than being embedded in its natal molecular cloud like all other known MYSOs, it is the only optically revealed high-mass young stellar object. The second reason is the stability of the disk. We suggest that both of these are due to the low-metallicity and low-dust content of the birth environment of the HH 1177 system, which impact the physical processes governing the optical depth of the surrounding matter. At lower metallicities, stars yield a higher number of photons in the extreme ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Owing to less efficient cooling, the temperature of the surrounding gas is higher. This results in stronger thermal pressure feedback as well as higher photo-evaporation rates. Moreover, the lower dust content decreases the overall continuum optical depth. Conversely, although we cannot exclude that the outermost radii of the disk are unstable, internal irradiation is probably responsible for maintaining a high disk temperature by stabilizing it against fragmentation. Determining the consequences of these environmental differences provides important constraints for our theoretical understanding of the formation and evolution of massive stars and their circumstellar disks.

### Inefficient star formation in extremely metal poor galaxies [^27ad684e]. Nature (2014). Excellent credibility.

The first galaxies contain stars born out of gas with few or no 'metals' (that is, elements heavier than helium). The lack of metals is expected to inhibit efficient gas cooling and star formation, but this effect has yet to be observed in galaxies with an oxygen abundance (relative to hydrogen) below a tenth of that of the Sun. Extremely metal poor nearby galaxies may be our best local laboratories for studying in detail the conditions that prevailed in low metallicity galaxies at early epochs. Carbon monoxide emission is unreliable as a tracer of gas at low metallicities, and while dust has been used to trace gas in low-metallicity galaxies, low spatial resolution in the far-infrared has typically led to large uncertainties. Here we report spatially resolved infrared observations of two galaxies with oxygen abundances below ten per cent of the solar value, and show that stars formed very inefficiently in seven star-forming clumps in these galaxies. The efficiencies are less than a tenth of those found in normal, metal rich galaxies today, suggesting that star formation may have been very inefficient in the early Universe.

### Molecular hydrogen in the extremely metal-and dust-poor galaxy leo P [^7bbdc95f]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed unexpectedly rapid galaxy assembly in the early Universe, in tension with galaxy-formation models 1-3 . At the low abundances of heavy elements (metals) and dust typical in early galaxies, the formation of molecular hydrogen and its connection to star formation remain poorly understood. Some models predict that stars form in predominantly atomic gas at low metallicity 4,5 , in contrast to molecular gas at higher metallicities 6 . Despite repeated searches 7 , cold molecular gas has not yet been observed in any galaxy below 7% solar metallicity 8 . Here we report the detection of rotational emission from molecular hydrogen near the only O-type star in the 3% solar metallicity galaxy LeoP (refs. 9,10 ) with JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument/Medium Resolution Spectroscopy (MIRI-MRS) observing mode. These observations place a lower limit on LeoP's molecular gas content, and modelling of the photodissociation region illuminated by the O star suggests a compact (≤2.6pc radius), approximately 10 4 M ⊙ cloud. We also report a stringent upper limit on carbon monoxide (CO) emission from a deep search with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Our results highlight the power of MIRI-MRS to characterize even small ultraviolet-illuminated molecular clouds in the low-metallicity regime, in which the traditional observational tracer CO is uninformative. This discovery pushes the limiting metallicity at which molecular gas is present in detectable quantities more than a factor of two lower, providing crucial empirical guidance for models of the interstellar medium in early galaxies.

### The characteristic blue spectra of accretion disks in quasars as uncovered in the infrared [^de675648]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

Quasars are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes accreting surrounding gas. Central to this picture is a putative accretion disk which is believed to be the source of the majority of the radiative output. It is well known, however, that the most extensively studied disk model-an optically thick disk which is heated locally by the dissipation of gravitational binding energy-is apparently contradicted by observations in a few major respects. In particular, the model predicts a specific blue spectral shape asymptotically from the visible to the near-infrared, but this is not generally seen in the visible wavelength region where the disk spectrum is observable. A crucial difficulty has been that, towards the infrared, the disk spectrum starts to be hidden under strong, hot dust emission from much larger but hitherto unresolved scales, and thus has essentially been impossible to observe. Here we report observations of polarized light interior to the dust-emitting region that enable us to uncover this near-infrared disk spectrum in several quasars. The revealed spectra show that the near-infrared disk spectrum is indeed as blue as predicted. This indicates that, at least for the outer near-infrared-emitting radii, the standard picture of the locally heated disk is approximately correct.

### An extragalactic supernebula confined by gravity [^2d7c71dc]. Nature (2003). Excellent credibility.

Little is known about the origins of globular clusters, which contain hundreds of thousands of stars in a volume only a few light years across. Radiation pressure and winds from luminous young stars should disperse the star-forming gas and disrupt the formation of the cluster. Globular clusters in our Galaxy cannot provide answers; they are billions of years old. Here we report the measurement of infrared hydrogen recombination lines from a young, forming super star cluster in the dwarf galaxy NGC5253. The lines arise in gas heated by a cluster of about one million stars, including 4,000-6,000 massive, hot 'O' stars. It is so young that it is still enshrouded in gas and dust, hidden from optical view. The gases within the cluster seem bound by gravity, which may explain why the windy and luminous O stars have not yet blown away those gases. Young clusters in 'starbursting' galaxies in the local and distant Universe may also be gravitationally confined and cloaked from view.

### Measuring the density structure of an accretion hot spot [^7fe407cd]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

The total energy flux peaks along with the UV data (Fig. 2c). When the energy flux peaks on December 7, it is dominated by emission from a high-density region, which then drops substantially (Fig. 2d). This suggests that on December 7 we see the high-density region of the hot spot and that in the following three days most of this high-density region is no longer visible. Meanwhile, the hot-spot coverage of the star peaked about 1 day later, on December 8, along with the optical data (Fig. 2e), and the hot spot is dominated by emission from a low-density region (Fig. 2f). Because the low-density region of the accretion column emits its energy at longer wavelengths, it follows that the optical emission peaks when the hot spot is at its largest. The observed behaviour in the light curves may be interpreted by combining two effects: the stellar rotation and the different physical locations for the high-density and low-density regions. It then follows that the high-density region of the hot spot (whose energy appears mainly in the UV) will lead to a peak in the UV data when the high-density parts of the hot spot are visible to the observer. As the star rotates, we may be seeing a denser part of the hot spot first, which then rotates out of view.

Spectral fitting in Firefly Sparkle slit 1

The resulting 1D spectrum of Firefly Sparkle in slit 1, dominated by the cluster FF-6, is shown in Fig. 2.

The spectrum exhibits a Balmer jump at λ obs ~ 3.5 μm and a turnover at λ obs ≲ 1.4 μm, probably because of two-photon emission. These features suggest that the nebular continuum should dominate over the stellar continuum in the rest frame UV to optical spectrum within slit 1 (as found for a z = 5.9 galaxy in ref.). We thus model the continuum of the spectrum with nebular continuum using the photoionization code CLOUDY v.23 (ref.). To determine the dust attenuation value in the continuum model fitting, we first measure the Hγ/Hβ ratio by fitting the Gaussian profiles. The ratio agrees well with the case B recombination, and no significant dust attenuation is indicated. Therefore, in the continuum spectral modelling, we use pure hydrogen gas irradiated by an ionizing source having black-body SED without dust attenuation. We vary the effective temperature of the black body (T eff) and the electron temperature of the (ionized) hydrogen gas, and search for the best-fitting model continuum by χ 2 minimization. In the continuum fitting, we mask out emission line regions and all wavelengths λ obs < 1.2 μm at which the Lyman break is seen in the slit 2 spectrum, because this region may be affected by a neutral hydrogen damping wing. The best-fit model has log(T eff / K) = 5.10 and, which is fully consistent with the results in ref. The result of continuum fitting does not change if we consider a slight dust attenuation (A V = 0.1 mag) in the fitting. As discussed in ref. the effective temperature of log(T eff / K) = 5.10 is much hotter than typical massive type O stars and is suggestive of this star-forming cluster having a top-heavy IMF. The IMF of this cluster is further discussed in section ‘ SED fitting analysis ’.

### Large metallicity variations in the galactic interstellar medium [^d3c10277]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

The interstellar medium (ISM) comprises gases at different temperatures and densities, including ionized, atomic and molecular species, and dust particles 1 . The neutral ISM is dominated by neutral hydrogen 2 and has ionization fractions of up to eight per cent 3 . The concentration of chemical elements heavier than helium (metallicity) spans orders of magnitudes in Galactic stars 4 , because they formed at different times. However, the gas in the vicinity of the Sun is assumed to be well mixed and to have a solar metallicity in traditional chemical evolution models 5 . The ISM chemical abundances can be accurately measured with ultraviolet absorption-line spectroscopy. However, the effects of dust depletion 6-9 -which removes part of the metals from the observable gaseous phase and incorporates it into solid grains-have prevented, until recently, a deeper investigation of the ISM metallicity. Here we report the dust-corrected metallicity of the neutral ISM measured towards 25 stars in our Galaxy. We find large variations in metallicity over a factor of ten (with an average of 55±7per cent solar metallicity and a standard deviation of 0.28dex), including many regions of low metallicity, down to about 17per cent solar metallicity and possibly below. Pristine gas falling onto the Galactic disk in the form of high-velocity clouds can cause the observed chemical inhomogeneities on scales of tens of parsecs. Our results suggest that this low-metallicity accreting gas does not efficiently mix into the ISM, which may help us understand metallicity deviations in nearby coeval stars.

### Discrete clouds of neutral gas between the galaxies M31 and M33 [^6e8130b4]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

Spiral galaxies must acquire gas to maintain their observed level of star formation beyond the next few billion years. A source of this material may be the gas that resides between galaxies, but our understanding of the state and distribution of this gas is incomplete. Radio observations of the Local Group of galaxies have revealed hydrogen gas extending from the disk of the galaxy M31 at least halfway to M33. This feature has been interpreted to be the neutral component of a condensing intergalactic filament, which would be able to fuel star formation in M31 and M33, but simulations suggest that such a feature could also result from an interaction between both galaxies within the past few billion years (ref. 5). Here we report radio observations showing that about 50 per cent of this gas is composed of clouds, with the rest distributed in an extended, diffuse component. The clouds have velocities comparable to those of M31 and M33, and have properties suggesting that they are unrelated to other Local Group objects. We conclude that the clouds are likely to be transient condensations of gas embedded in an intergalactic filament and are therefore a potential source of fuel for future star formation in M31 and M33.

### Directed gas phase formation of silicon dioxide and implications for the formation of interstellar silicates [^49a3282b]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The origin of interstellar silicate grains—nanoparticles consisting primarily of olivine-type ((Mg,Fe) 2 SiO 4) refractory minerals—has remained a controversial topic for more than half a century, since interstellar silicates are faster destroyed by sputtering than formed during the late stages of stellar evolution through nucleation in circumstellar envelopes of oxygen-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) and Red Supergiant (RSG) stars –. These nanoparticles have been associated with the prebiotic evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM) through the synthesis of molecular building blocks of life such as amino acids and sugars on their ice-coated surfaces by ionizing radiation. Interstellar silicates also play a critical role in star formation and in the origin of solar systems contributing to the radiation balance and acting as a molecular feedstock, both through the formation of complex organics through the release of icy mantles that cover them and through disruption of grains in interstellar shocks,. In molecular clouds, they absorb light and hence shield complex organic molecules (COMs)—organics containing carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen like glycolaldehyde (HCOCH 2 OH) and formamide (HCONH 2)—from the destructive interstellar ultraviolet radiation field. Therefore, the elucidation of the origin of interstellar silicates is of vital importance to the astrochemistry, astrobiology, and astrophysics communities to eventually understand the fundamental processes that create a visible galaxy including our own.

### A WC / WO star exploding within an expanding carbon-oxygen-neon nebula [^cbab40dd]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

The final fate of massive stars, and the nature of the compact remnants they leave behind (black holes and neutron stars), are open questions in astrophysics. Many massive stars are stripped of their outer hydrogen envelopes as they evolve. Such Wolf-Rayet stars 1 emit strong and rapidly expanding winds with speeds greater than 1,000kilometresper second. A fraction of this population is also helium-depleted, with spectra dominated by highly ionized emission lines of carbon and oxygen (typesWC/WO). Evidence indicates that the most commonly observed supernova explosions that lack hydrogen and helium (typesIb/Ic) cannot result from massive WC/WO stars 2,3 , leading some to suggest that most such stars collapse directly into black holes without a visible supernova explosion 4 . Here we report observations of SN2019hgp, beginning about a day after the explosion. Its short rise time and rapid decline place it among an emerging population of rapidly evolving transients 5-8 . Spectroscopy reveals a rich set of emission lines indicating that the explosion occurred within a nebula composed of carbon, oxygen and neon. Narrow absorption features show that this material is expanding at high velocities (greater than 1,500kilometresper second), requiring a compact progenitor. Our observations are consistent with an explosion of a massive WC/WO star, and suggest that massive Wolf-Rayet stars may be the progenitors of some rapidly evolving transients.

### Possible thermochemical disequilibrium in the atmosphere of the exoplanet GJ 436b [^a13b5f3c]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

The nearby extrasolar planet GJ 436b-which has been labelled as a 'hot Neptune'-reveals itself by the dimming of light as it crosses in front of and behind its parent star as seen from Earth. Respectively known as the primary transit and secondary eclipse, the former constrains the planet's radius and mass, and the latter constrains the planet's temperature and, with measurements at multiple wavelengths, its atmospheric composition. Previous work using transmission spectroscopy failed to detect the 1.4-mum water vapour band, leaving the planet's atmospheric composition poorly constrained. Here we report the detection of planetary thermal emission from the dayside of GJ 436b at multiple infrared wavelengths during the secondary eclipse. The best-fit compositional models contain a high CO abundance and a substantial methane (CH(4)) deficiency relative to thermochemical equilibrium models for the predicted hydrogen-dominated atmosphere. Moreover, we report the presence of some H(2)O and traces of CO(2). Because CH(4) is expected to be the dominant carbon-bearing species, disequilibrium processes such as vertical mixing and polymerization of methane into substances such as ethylene may be required to explain the hot Neptune's small CH(4)-to-CO ratio, which is at least 10(5) times smaller than predicted.

### Laboratory infrared spectra and fragmentation chemistry of sulfur allotropes [^f178e779]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Sulfur is the tenth most abundant element in the universe, with a cosmic [S/H] ratio of 1.4·10 −5, which together with H, C, O, N and P, is regarded as one of the essential elements for life. Moreover, sulfur is found in nature in a rich variety of allotropic forms, only surpassed in number by those of carbon.

However, the pathway of sulfur from interstellar gas clouds to planets is a long-standing question –. While in low-density diffuse interstellar environments the observed atomic sulfur, expressed in its abundance ratio to atomic hydrogen, is close to the cosmic value,, in dense molecular clouds, star-forming regions and in planet forming disks that surround young stars, the gas phase sulfur concentration (measured as the sum of all atomic sulfur and sulfur atoms contained in gas phase molecules) is strongly depleted, by up to two orders of magnitude,. Volatile sulfur ice reservoirs such as OCS and SO 2 can account for at most a few per cent of the missing sulfur. In contrast, icy and rocky solar system bodies show abundant sulfur. Samples with a roughly solar [S/O] ratio were recovered by the Rosetta mission to the comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, with about 80 per cent of sulfur in some refractory form. Refractory sulfur is also abundant in primitive meteorites of the CI class, where it is found as sulfides and sulfates. The sample return mission to the CI asteroid Ryuguhas revealed similar high sulfur abundances. Recently, sulfur has for the first time been detected in the atmospheres of gas giant exoplanets,. These observations show that sulfur is efficiently converted from atomic to refractory reservoirs, even in icy objects like comets.

### Missing interstellar sulfur in inventories of polysulfanes and molecular octasulfur crowns [^ecf08458]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Even though the analog ices studied here can be utilized to model the transition of ices coated on dust from denser clouds to star-forming regions, a sulfur anomaly is reported towards planetary nebulae as well. Circumstellar sulfur deficits in oxygen-rich objects are predicted to be in small molecules of SO, SO 2, H 2 S, or CS, and in carbon-rich objects, via magnesium or iron sulfides, but underestimation of ionized sulfur species in the gas phase is seen in many current model studies,. Current models on protoplanetary disks favor interpreting the sulfur composition of interstellar dust available to incorporate in planet formation predominantly of FeS and other sulfide minerals at higher temperatures relying on the sublimation temperatures of water or smaller sulfur chains (S n) subliming below 200 K, the sublimation temperatures of higher order sulfanes and octasulfur identified in these hydrogen sulfide ices span up to 330 K. Simulations, or models can utilize these novel volatiles and possible reaction pathways to update the inventories, eventually reaching to realistic predictions about these regions of ISM. Visible residues left on the substrates at 330 K did not show any characteristic features in the mid-IR region, thus reiterating the functional limitations of FTIR in interstellar characterizations. Therefore, it should be noted that interstellar observations relying on a single technique, such as infrared, heavily undermine the present-day knowledge of realistic ice compositions. The identified products: sulfanes and octasulfur, should be observable subliming to the gas phase in warmer regions of the ISM above their respective sublimation temperatures, via radio or far infrared (400—200 cm –1) measurements.

### The formation of the first low-mass stars from gas with low carbon and oxygen abundances [^8beb0e52]. Nature (2003). Excellent credibility.

The first stars in the Universe are predicted to have been much more massive than the Sun. Gravitational condensation, accompanied by cooling of the primordial gas via molecular hydrogen, yields a minimum fragmentation scale of a few hundred solar masses. Numerical simulations indicate that once a gas clump acquires this mass it undergoes a slow, quasi-hydrostatic contraction without further fragmentation; lower-mass stars cannot form. Here we show that as soon as the primordial gas--left over from the Big Bang--is enriched by elements ejected from supernovae to a carbon or oxygen abundance as small as approximately 0.01-0.1 per cent of that found in the Sun, cooling by singly ionized carbon or neutral oxygen can lead to the formation of low-mass stars by allowing cloud fragmentation to smaller clumps. This mechanism naturally accommodates the recent discovery of solar-mass stars with unusually low iron abundances (10(-5.3) solar) but with relatively high (10(-1.3) solar) carbon abundance. The critical abundances that we derive can be used to identify those metal-poor stars in our Galaxy with elemental patterns imprinted by the first supernovae. We also find that the minimum stellar mass at early epochs is partially regulated by the temperature of the cosmic microwave background.

### A ground-based near-infrared emission spectrum of the exoplanet HD 189733b [^905fc266]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

Detection of molecules using infrared spectroscopy probes the conditions and compositions of exoplanet atmospheres. Water (H(2)O), methane (CH(4)), carbon dioxide (CO(2)), and carbon monoxide (CO) have been detected in two hot Jupiters. These previous results relied on space-based telescopes that do not provide spectroscopic capability in the 2.4-5.2 microm spectral region. Here we report ground-based observations of the dayside emission spectrum for HD 189733b between 2.0-2.4 microm and 3.1-4.1 microm, where we find a bright emission feature. Where overlap with space-based instruments exists, our results are in excellent agreement with previous measurements. A feature at approximately 3.25 microm is unexpected and difficult to explain with models that assume local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) conditions at the 1 bar to 1 x 10(-6) bar pressures typically sampled by infrared measurements. The most likely explanation for this feature is that it arises from non-LTE emission from CH(4), similar to what is seen in the atmospheres of planets in our own Solar System. These results suggest that non-LTE effects may need to be considered when interpreting measurements of strongly irradiated exoplanets.

### A continuum from clear to cloudy hot-jupiter exoplanets without primordial water depletion [^a968d8b4]. Nature (2016). Excellent credibility.

Thousands of transiting exoplanets have been discovered, but spectral analysis of their atmospheres has so far been dominated by a small number of exoplanets and data spanning relatively narrow wavelength ranges (such as 1.1-1.7 micrometres). Recent studies show that some hot-Jupiter exoplanets have much weaker water absorption features in their near-infrared spectra than predicted. The low amplitude of water signatures could be explained by very low water abundances, which may be a sign that water was depleted in the protoplanetary disk at the planet's formation location, but it is unclear whether this level of depletion can actually occur. Alternatively, these weak signals could be the result of obscuration by clouds or hazes, as found in some optical spectra. Here we report results from a comparative study of ten hot Jupiters covering the wavelength range 0.3-5 micrometres, which allows us to resolve both the optical scattering and infrared molecular absorption spectroscopically. Our results reveal a diverse group of hot Jupiters that exhibit a continuum from clear to cloudy atmospheres. We find that the difference between the planetary radius measured at optical and infrared wavelengths is an effective metric for distinguishing different atmosphere types. The difference correlates with the spectral strength of water, so that strong water absorption lines are seen in clear-atmosphere planets and the weakest features are associated with clouds and hazes. This result strongly suggests that primordial water depletion during formation is unlikely and that clouds and hazes are the cause of weaker spectral signatures.

### A close halo of large transparent grains around extreme red giant stars [^fef4acb6]. Nature (2012). Excellent credibility.

An intermediate-mass star ends its life by ejecting the bulk of its envelope in a slow, dense wind. Stellar pulsations are thought to elevate gas to an altitude cool enough for the condensation of dust, which is then accelerated by radiation pressure, entraining the gas and driving the wind. Explaining the amount of mass loss, however, has been a problem because of the difficulty of observing tenuous gas and dust only tens of milliarcseconds from the star. For this reason, there is no consensus on the way sufficient momentum is transferred from the light from the star to the outflow. Here we report spatially resolved, multiwavelength observations of circumstellar dust shells of three stars on the asymptotic giant branch of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. When imaged in scattered light, dust shells were found at remarkably small radii (less than about two stellar radii) and with unexpectedly large grains (about 300 nanometres in radius). This proximity to the photosphere argues for dust species that are transparent to the light from the star and, therefore, resistant to sublimation by the intense radiation field. Although transparency usually implies insufficient radiative pressure to drive a wind, the radiation field can accelerate these large grains through photon scattering rather than absorption--a plausible mass loss mechanism for lower-amplitude pulsating stars.

### A minimum column density of 1 g CM (-2) for massive star formation [^bdb00cf9]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

Massive stars are very rare, but their extreme luminosities make them both the only type of young star we can observe in distant galaxies and the dominant energy sources in the Universe today. They form rarely because efficient radiative cooling keeps most star--forming gas clouds close to isothermal as they collapse, and this favours fragmentation into stars of one solar mass or lower. Heating of a cloud by accreting low-mass stars within it can prevent fragmentation and allow formation of massive stars, but the necessary properties for a cloud to form massive stars-and therefore where massive stars form in a galaxy--have not yet been determined. Here we show that only clouds with column densities of at least 1 g cm(-2) can avoid fragmentation and form massive stars. This threshold, and the environmental variation of the stellar initial mass function that it implies, naturally explain the characteristic column densities associated with massive star clusters and the difference between the radial profiles of Halpha and ultraviolet emission in galactic disks. The existence of a threshold also implies that the initial mass function should show detectable variation with environment within the Galaxy, that the characteristic column densities of clusters containing massive stars should vary between galaxies, and that star formation rates in some galactic environments may have been systematically underestimated.

### Temperature inhomogeneities cause the abundance discrepancy in H II regions [^27b54a9d]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

H II regions are ionized nebulae surrounding massive stars. They exhibit a wealth of emission lines that form the basis for estimation of chemical composition. Heavy elements regulate the cooling of interstellar gas, and are essential to the understanding of several phenomena such as nucleosynthesis, star formation and chemical evolution 1,2 . For over 80years 3 , however, a discrepancy exists of a factor of around two between heavy-element abundances derived from collisionally excited lines and those from the weaker recombination lines, which has thrown our absolute abundance determinations into doubt 4,5 . Here we report observational evidence that there are temperature inhomogeneities within the gas, quantified by t 2 (ref. 6 ). These inhomogeneities affect only highly ionized gas and cause the abundance discrepancy problem. Metallicity determinations based on collisionally excited lines must be revised because these may be severely underestimated, especially in regions of lower metallicity such as those recently observed with the James Webb Space Telescope in high-z galaxies 7-9 . We present new empirical relations for estimation of temperature and metallicity, critical for a robust interpretation of the chemical composition of the Universe over cosmic time.

### Substantial reservoirs of molecular hydrogen in the debris disks around young stars [^76986e13]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

Circumstellar accretion disks transfer matter from molecular clouds to young stars and to the sites of planet formation. The disks observed around pre-main-sequence stars have properties consistent with those expected for the pre-solar nebula from which our own Solar System formed 4.5 Gyr ago. But the 'debris' disks that encircle more than 15% of nearby main-sequence stars appear to have very small amounts of gas, based on observations of the tracer molecule carbon monoxide: these observations have yielded gas/dust ratios much less than 0.1, whereas the interstellar value is about 100 (ref. 9). Here we report observations of the lowest rotational transitions of molecular hydrogen (H2) that reveal large quantities of gas in the debris disks around the stars beta Pictoris, 49 Ceti and HD135344. The gas masses calculated from the data are several hundreds to a thousand times greater than those estimated from the CO observations, and yield gas/dust ratios of the same order as the interstellar value.

### Energetic eruptions leading to a peculiar hydrogen-rich explosion of a massive star [^e59b2407]. Nature (2017). Excellent credibility.

Every supernova so far observed has been considered to be the terminal explosion of a star. Moreover, all supernovae with absorption lines in their spectra show those lines decreasing in velocity over time, as the ejecta expand and thin, revealing slower-moving material that was previously hidden. In addition, every supernova that exhibits the absorption lines of hydrogen has one main light-curve peak, or a plateau in luminosity, lasting approximately 100 days before declining. Here we report observations of iPTF14hls, an event that has spectra identical to a hydrogen-rich core-collapse supernova, but characteristics that differ extensively from those of known supernovae. The light curve has at least five peaks and remains bright for more than 600 days; the absorption lines show little to no decrease in velocity; and the radius of the line-forming region is more than an order of magnitude bigger than the radius of the photosphere derived from the continuum emission. These characteristics are consistent with a shell of several tens of solar masses ejected by the progenitor star at supernova-level energies a few hundred days before a terminal explosion. Another possible eruption was recorded at the same position in 1954. Multiple energetic pre-supernova eruptions are expected to occur in stars of 95 to 130 solar masses, which experience the pulsational pair instability. That model, however, does not account for the continued presence of hydrogen, or the energetics observed here. Another mechanism for the violent ejection of mass in massive stars may be required.

### Long-term Doppler imaging of the star XX trianguli indicates chaotic non-periodic dynamo [^4ee59cd8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Results

Spectral line profiles were recorded with STELLA between 11 and 28 times over the length of a stellar rotation (24 d), depending on weather and target visibility in the sky. It thus enabled a large number of viewing angles (phases) of the stellar surface because each line profile is a 1D representation of the visible surface in velocity space. These views are inverted into a 2D Doppler surface image approximately once per stellar rotation. The image parameter for our Doppler images is photospheric temperature as detailed in the Methods subsection Inversion parameters. For the line-profile inversion, we employ the i MAPcode, which is based on the combined input of many individual spectral lines per echelle spectrum, that is, per viewing phase of our target. For each of the 16 observing seasons, we obtained between 4 and 8 independent Doppler images, one per stellar rotation if weather permitted. It enabled a total of 99 independent surface images over the course of 16 years covering 237 stellar rotations (listed in Supplementary Data 1), which we then stack into a movie. A total of seven movies (Supplementary Movies 1 – 7) are presented.

### Carbon monoxide in clouds at low metallicity in the dwarf irregular galaxy WLM [^a11e8306]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is the primary tracer for interstellar clouds where stars form, but it has never been detected in galaxies in which the oxygen abundance relative to hydrogen is less than 20 per cent of that of the Sun, even though such 'low-metallicity' galaxies often form stars. This raises the question of whether stars can form in dense gas without molecules, cooling to the required near-zero temperatures by atomic transitions and dust radiation rather than by molecular line emission; and it highlights uncertainties about star formation in the early Universe, when the metallicity was generally low. Here we report the detection of CO in two regions of a local dwarf irregular galaxy, WLM, where the metallicity is 13 per cent of the solar value. We use new submillimetre observations and archival far-infrared observations to estimate the cloud masses, which are both slightly greater than 100,000 solar masses. The clouds have produced stars at a rate per molecule equal to 10 per cent of that in the local Orion nebula cloud. The CO fraction of the molecular gas is also low, about 3 per cent of the Milky Way value. These results suggest that in small galaxies both star-forming cores and CO molecules become increasingly rare in molecular hydrogen clouds as the metallicity decreases.

### Biosignatures as revealed by spectropolarimetry of earthshine [^fd701818]. Nature (2012). Excellent credibility.

Low-resolution intensity spectra of Earth's atmosphere obtained from space reveal strong signatures of life ('biosignatures'), such as molecular oxygen and methane with abundances far from chemical equilibrium, as well as the presence of a 'red edge' (a sharp increase of albedo for wavelengths longer than 700nm) caused by surface vegetation. Light passing through the atmosphere is strongly linearly polarized by scattering (from air molecules, aerosols and cloud particles) and by reflection (from oceans and land). Spectropolarimetric observations of local patches of Earth's sky light from the ground contain signatures of oxygen, ozone and water, and are used to characterize the properties of clouds and aerosols. When applied to exoplanets, ground-based spectropolarimetry can better constrain properties of atmospheres and surfaces than can standard intensity spectroscopy. Here we report disk-integrated linear polarization spectra of Earthshine, which is sunlight that has been first reflected by Earth and then reflected back to Earth by the Moon. The observations allow us to determine the fractional contribution of clouds and ocean surface, and are sensitive to visible areas of vegetation as small as 10 per cent. They represent a benchmark for the diagnostics of the atmospheric composition, mean cloud height and surfaces of exoplanets.

### Cold gas in the milky way's nuclear wind [^8c6a1d60]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

The centre of the Milky Way hosts several high-energy processes that have strongly affected the inner regions of our Galaxy. Activity from the super-massive black hole at the Galactic Centre, which is coincident with the radio source Sagittarius A*, and stellar feedback from the inner molecular ring 1 expel matter and energy from the disk in the form of a galactic wind 2 . Multiphase gas has been observed within this outflow, including hot highly ionized 3,4 (temperatures of about 10 6 kelvin), warm ionized 5,6 (10 4 to 10 5 kelvin) and cool atomic 7,8 (10 3 to 10 4 kelvin) gas. However, so far there has been no evidence of the cold dense molecular phase (10 to 100 kelvin). Here we report observations of molecular gas outflowing from the centre of our Galaxy. This cold material is associated with atomic hydrogen clouds travelling in the nuclear wind 8 . The morphology and the kinematics of the molecular gas, resolved on a scale of about one parsec, indicate that these clouds are mixing with the warmer medium and are possibly being disrupted. The data also suggest that the mass of the molecular gas outflow is not negligible and could affect the rate of star formation in the central regions of the Galaxy. The presence of this cold, dense and high-velocity gas is puzzling, because neither Sagittarius A* at its current level of activity nor star formation in the inner Galaxy seems to be a viable source for this material.

### Quenching of star formation from a lack of inflowing gas to galaxies [^b2e470e0]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Star formation in half of massive galaxies was quenched by the time the Universe was 3 billion years old 1 . Very low amounts of molecular gas seem to be responsible for this, at least in some cases 2-7 , although morphological gas stabilization, shock heating or activity associated with accretion onto a central supermassive black hole are invoked in other cases 8-11 . Recent studies of quenching by gas depletion have been based on upper limits that are insufficiently sensitive to determine this robustly 2-7 , or stacked emission with its problems of averaging 8,9 . Here we report 1.3 mm observations of dust emission from 6 strongly lensed galaxies where star formation has been quenched, with magnifications of up to a factor of 30. Four of the six galaxies are undetected in dust emission, with an estimated upper limit on the dust mass of 0.0001 times the stellar mass, and by proxy (assuming a Milky Way molecular gas-to-dust ratio) 0.01 times the stellar mass in molecular gas. This is two orders of magnitude less molecular gas per unit stellar mass than seen in star forming galaxies at similar redshifts 12-14 . It remains difficult to extrapolate from these small samples, but these observations establish that gas depletion is responsible for a cessation of star formation in some fraction of high-redshift galaxies.

### Regulation of star formation in giant galaxies by precipitation, feedback and conduction [^f83687fd]. Nature (2015). Excellent credibility.

The Universe's largest galaxies reside at the centres of galaxy clusters and are embedded in hot gas that, if left undisturbed, would cool quickly and create many more new stars than are actually observed. Cooling can be regulated by feedback from accretion of cooling gas onto the central black hole, but requires an accretion rate finely tuned to the thermodynamic state of the hot gas. Theoretical models in which cold clouds precipitate out of the hot gas via thermal instability and accrete onto the black hole exhibit the necessary tuning. Recent observational evidence shows that the abundance of cold gas in the centres of clusters increases rapidly near the predicted threshold for instability. Here we report observations showing that this precipitation threshold extends over a large range in cluster radius, cluster mass and cosmic time. We incorporate the precipitation threshold into a framework of theoretical models for the thermodynamic state of hot gas in galaxy clusters. According to that framework, precipitation regulates star formation in some giant galaxies, while thermal conduction prevents star formation in others if it can compensate for radiative cooling and shut off precipitation.

### South-polar features on venus similar to those near the north pole [^197210c0]. Nature (2007). Excellent credibility.

Venus has no seasons, slow rotation and a very massive atmosphere, which is mainly carbon dioxide with clouds primarily of sulphuric acid droplets. Infrared observations by previous missions to Venus revealed a bright 'dipole' feature surrounded by a cold 'collar' at its north pole. The polar dipole is a 'double-eye' feature at the centre of a vast vortex that rotates around the pole, and is possibly associated with rapid downwelling. The polar cold collar is a wide, shallow river of cold air that circulates around the polar vortex. One outstanding question has been whether the global circulation was symmetric, such that a dipole feature existed at the south pole. Here we report observations of Venus' south-polar region, where we have seen clouds with morphology much like those around the north pole, but rotating somewhat faster than the northern dipole. The vortex may extend down to the lower cloud layers that lie at about 50 km height and perhaps deeper. The spectroscopic properties of the clouds around the south pole are compatible with a sulphuric acid composition.

### Survival of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon knockout fragments in the interstellar medium [^c39b27fe]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

There is little doubt that large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium (ISM) –. PAHs were first proposed as carriers of unidentified infrared bands at 3.3, 6.2, 7.8, 8.6, and 11.3 μm originating from interstellar dust in the 1980s, and there are indications that they carry perhaps as much as 20% of the elemental carbon. They are expected to form the basis for carbonaceous grains,, act as catalysts for the formation of molecular hydrogen –, and to be potential precursors for closed-caged fullerene molecules as large PAHs are broken down by energetic photons or particles,. However, the mechanisms leading to the formation of PAH molecules and fullerenes in interstellar and circumstellar environments are still not fully understood –.

PAH molecules and ions are inherently stable systems with high ionization potentials and dissociation energies, which help explain their abundance in harsh interstellar regions. However, the processing of these molecules by UV radiation from young starsand by the impact of energetic particles from stellar winds and shockwaves, can partially break them down and increase their reactivity. This is one of the key steps in models aiming to describe the formation of fullerenes from large PAHs, and energy deposition is also required for certain H 2 production pathways involving PAHs,. When PAH molecules, or their fragments, are excited they can cool by dissociation, isomerization, or photon emission. Dissociation, a destructive process, will typically take place through the fragmentation channels with the lowest activation energies, i.e. through the loss of H, H 2, or C 2 H 2 units, all of which require about 5 eV for intact PAH precursors,. Other fragmentation pathways, such as the loss of a single C atom (or CH x unit), require significantly more energy and are statistically unlikely in cases where the internal energy is spread over all internal degrees of freedom of the molecule, for instance in photo-driven processes. However, there are mechanisms that may favor otherwise unexpected dissociation processes. One such example is collisions with atoms or ions,. An energetic ion colliding with a PAH molecule—or any other molecule for that matter—will not just transfer kinetic energy in the collision, but also momentum that is localized to the point of impact. This momentum transfer can in turn lead to individual atoms being knocked out of the molecule in a pool-ball-like scattering process –.

### A complex multi-notch astronomical filter to suppress the bright infrared sky [^3b5da926]. Nature Communications (2011). Medium credibility.

A long-standing and profound problem in astronomy is the difficulty in obtaining deep near-infrared observations due to the extreme brightness and variability of the night sky at these wavelengths. A solution to this problem is crucial if we are to obtain the deepest possible observations of the early Universe, as redshifted starlight from distant galaxies appears at these wavelengths. The atmospheric emission between 1,000 and 1,800nm arises almost entirely from a forest of extremely bright, very narrow hydroxyl emission lines that varies on timescales of minutes. The astronomical community has long envisaged the prospect of selectively removing these lines, while retaining high throughput between them. Here we demonstrate such a filter for the first time, presenting results from the first on-sky tests. Its use on current 8m telescopes and future 30m telescopes will open up many new research avenues in the years to come.

### A wolf-rayet-like progenitor of SN 2013cu from spectral observations of a stellar wind [^1ebe8315]. Nature (2014). Excellent credibility.

The explosive fate of massive Wolf-Rayet stars (WRSs) is a key open question in stellar physics. An appealing option is that hydrogen-deficient WRSs are the progenitors of some hydrogen-poor supernova explosions of typesIIb, Ib and Ic (ref. 2). A blue object, having luminosity and colours consistent with those of some WRSs, has recently been identified in pre-explosion images at the location of a supernova of typeIb (ref. 3), but has not yet been conclusively determined to have been the progenitor. Similar work has so far only resulted in non-detections. Comparison of early photometric observations of typeIc supernovae with theoretical models suggests that the progenitor stars had radii of less than 10(12)centimetres, as expected for some WRSs. The signature of WRSs, their emission line spectra, cannot be probed by such studies. Here we report the detection of strong emission lines in a spectrum of typeIIb supernova 2013cu (iPTF13ast) obtained approximately 15.5 hours after explosion (by 'flash spectroscopy', which captures the effects of the supernova explosion shock breakout flash on material surrounding the progenitor star). We identify Wolf-Rayet-like wind signatures, suggesting a progenitor of the WN(h) subclass (those WRSs with winds dominated by helium and nitrogen, with traces of hydrogen). The extent of this dense wind may indicate increased mass loss from the progenitor shortly before its explosion, consistent with recent theoretical predictions.

### Proposed energy-metabolisms cannot explain the atmospheric chemistry of venus [^96e024d2]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

It has historically been proposed that hypothetical Venusian life could have originated at the planet’s surface or been seeded from Earth, if Venus was ever habitable in its past. This surface-dwelling life would have subsequently migrated to the temperate region of the cloud layer as Venus underwent runaway greenhouse warming, residing in the clouds today as an aerial biosphere,,. Runaway greenhouse warming is instigated by an increase in the surface temperature of a planet which causes an increase in the evaporation of surface water to the atmosphere. Since H 2 O is a strong greenhouse gas, the increase in atmospheric H 2 O further exacerbates the warming effect, creating a positive climate feedback. Atmospheric H 2 O is eventually lost via photo-dissociation followed by hydrogen loss to space, and the record of the past water content is left imprinted in the atmospheric deuterium to hydrogen ratio (D/H). The enhanced D/H ratio measured in the atmosphere of Venus provides evidence of past water loss, however it is unclear whether this water was ever present as liquid at the surface or always as gas in a hot steam atmosphere. If liquid water was present at the surface of Venus in its past then the planet’s slow rotation rate would have enabled a stabilising cloud-climate feedback mechanism to be established, maintaining habitable surface conditions despite the increasing Solar luminosity over time. This phase of habitability could have lasted for up to ~900 Myrs if Venus has always been in a stagnant lid tectonic regime, or if early Venus had Earth-like plate tectonics then this habitable period could have lasted for up to 4 Gyrs, until runaway greenhouse was instigated by voluminous magmatism. In contrast, other modelling has suggested that, due to its proximity to the Sun, Venus could never have cooled sufficiently for liquid water to condense at the surface following its magma ocean phase, and thus a stabilising cloud feedback could never have been established. In this case, life in the clouds would likely require an aerial origin of life scenario within cloud droplets, utilising very different bio-chemistry to terran life.

### Turbulent heating in galaxy clusters brightest in X-rays [^10afb1ca]. Nature (2014). Excellent credibility.

The hot (10(7) to 10(8) kelvin), X-ray-emitting intracluster medium (ICM) is the dominant baryonic constituent of clusters of galaxies. In the cores of many clusters, radiative energy losses from the ICM occur on timescales much shorter than the age of the system. Unchecked, this cooling would lead to massive accumulations of cold gas and vigorous star formation, in contradiction to observations. Various sources of energy capable of compensating for these cooling losses have been proposed, the most promising being heating by the supermassive black holes in the central galaxies, through inflation of bubbles of relativistic plasma. Regardless of the original source of energy, the question of how this energy is transferred to the ICM remains open. Here we present a plausible solution to this question based on deep X-ray data and a new data analysis method that enable us to evaluate directly the ICM heating rate from the dissipation of turbulence. We find that turbulent heating is sufficient to offset radiative cooling and indeed appears to balance it locally at each radius-it may therefore be the key element in resolving the gas cooling problem in cluster cores and, more universally, in the atmospheres of X-ray-emitting, gas-rich systems on scales from galaxy clusters to groups and elliptical galaxies.

### Detection of carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the stratified surface of charon with JWST [^b5fbb7b9]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Charon, Pluto's largest moon, has been extensively studied, with research focusing on its primitive composition and changes due to radiation and photolysis. However, spectral data have so far been limited to wavelengths below 2.5 μm, leaving key aspects unresolved. Here we present the detection of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) on the surface of Charon's northern hemisphere, using JWST data. These detections add to the known chemical inventory that includes crystalline water ice, ammonia-bearing species, and tholin-like darkening constituents previously revealed by ground- and space-based observations. The H 2 O 2 presence indicates active radiolytic/photolytic processing of the water ice-rich surface by solar ultraviolet and interplanetary medium Lyman-α photons, solar wind, and galactic cosmic rays. Through spectral modeling of the surface, we show that the CO 2 is present in pure crystalline form and, possibly, in intimately mixed states on the surface. Endogenically sourced subsurface CO 2 exposed on the surface is likely the primary source of this component, with possible contributions from irradiation of hydrocarbons mixed with water ice, interfacial radiolysis between carbon deposits and water ice, and the implantation of energetic carbon ions from the solar wind and solar energetic particles.

### A light carbon isotope composition for the sun [^97c1703d]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Fig. 8 
An illustration of how CO condensation in the outer solar nebula could qualitatively affect O isotope reservoirs. Assuming that condensed CO remains in the outer nebula, and is not mixed back into the O reservoir from which planets were formed, then there will be a mass-dependent enrichment in the CO ice relative to the bulk initial CO from the parent cloud. If CO self-shielding yielded H 2 O at the other end of the mixing line (H 2 O ss), the dissociated CO gas must have been on or close to the CAI mixing line. Residual (undissociated) CO gas (CO ss) would have been highly depleted in 17 O and 18 O (refs.). If the initial bulk reservoir of H 2 O was isotopically similar to CO initial bulk, then it too must have been mass-dependently fractionated until it resided on or near the CAI mixing line. This seems an unlikely occurrence, suggesting that perhaps the CO condensed phase was not large enough to substantially alter the O (and C isotopes) of the CO and from which planets were formed. Mixing lines for FUN inclusions are also shown, but the mass-dependent displacement that defines the lower end of the FUN inclusion mixing linesare mostly likely derived from melting and evaporation of precursor CAIs, and not from the bulk initial CO and H 2 O reservoirs

### No thick carbon dioxide atmosphere on the rocky exoplanet TRAPPIST-1 C [^ee381019]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Seven rocky planets orbit the nearby dwarf star TRAPPIST-1, providing a unique opportunity to search for atmospheres on small planets outside the Solar System 1 . Thanks to the recent launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), possible atmospheric constituents such as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) are now detectable 2,3 . Recent JWST observations of the innermost planet TRAPPIST-1b showed that it is most probably a bare rock without any CO 2 in its atmosphere 4 . Here we report the detection of thermal emission from the dayside of TRAPPIST-1c with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on JWST at 15µm. We measure a planet-to-star flux ratio of f p /f ⁎ =421±94 parts per million (ppm), which corresponds to an inferred dayside brightness temperature of 380±31K. This high dayside temperature disfavours a thick, CO 2 -rich atmosphere on the planet. The data rule out cloud-free O 2 /CO 2 mixtures with surface pressures ranging from 10bar (with 10ppm CO 2 ) to 0.1bar (pure CO 2 ). A Venus-analogue atmosphere with sulfuric acid clouds is also disfavoured at 2.6σ confidence. Thinner atmospheres or bare-rock surfaces are consistent with our measured planet-to-star flux ratio. The absence of a thick, CO 2 -rich atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1c suggests a relatively volatile-poor formation history, with less than [Formula: see text] Earth oceans of water. If all planets in the system formed in the same way, this would indicate a limited reservoir of volatiles for the potentially habitable planets in the system.

### Photochemical and thermochemical pathways to sand polysulfur formation in the atmosphere of venus [^c10e6d02]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Spacecraft missions and Earth-based observations have reported images of the Venusian atmosphere at different wavelengths with the aim of characterizing the cloud morphology and the exotic chemical processes that take place in this planet. At visible wavelengths, the planet is bland and smooth, whereas recordings at near-ultraviolet light (around 365 nm) reveal intriguing “dark” and “light” areas indicating highly active UV absorption in the top clouds –.

The identity of the “unknown UV absorber(s)” in Venus represents an important enigma in the current field of research on planetary atmospheres. Even though several particulate and gaseous candidates have been proposed, the nature of the unidentified absorber remains an unsolved problem as no satisfactory match has been found yet in terms of atmospheric abundance and spectral properties. Since sulfur is abundant in the Venusian atmosphere, it is not surprising that many candidates are sulfur-based compounds,–,–. It has been proposed that 1 (SO) 2 isomers (mostly cis - and trans -OSSO) generated from the association reaction of 3 SO (Eq. 1),could be the UV absorber since the calculated absorption spectra match previous estimates of the spectral properties of the unknown UV absorber,,. The short photochemical lifetimes of 1 (SO) 2 (between 2 and 5 s) derived from photolysis ratesimply a short existence of these species during daytime, nevertheless, the chemical equilibrium with 3 SO will be continuously replenishing 1 (SO) 2. Since both 3 SO association (Eq. 1) and photochemical dissociation to 3 SO + 3 SO are swift processes, the global 1 (SO) 2 lifetime is controlled by 3 SO concentrations,–. These can vary greatly, in agreement with observations,. Since the lifetimes of the UV dark features range from minutes to hours, to an excess of 12 h, a long-lived absorber is unlikely since short lived features would then not be possible. Therefore, the UV absorber concentration is likely tied to something other than direct sunlight, which matches the 1 (SO) 2 behavior dependent on the 3 SO levels. Recent literature has brought into question the level of contribution of the two 1 OSSO isomers to the UV absorption –,, pointing to a too low 3 SO concentration at lower altitudes of the Venus middle atmosphere (ca. 60 km). However, there is still significant uncertainty in these 3 SO data, and 1 OSSO role as the UV absorber has not been fully refuted yet.

### Proposed energy-metabolisms cannot explain the atmospheric chemistry of venus [^aee662d4]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Comparing the resultant atmospheric chemistry with observational constraints

In order to reproduce the observed SO 2 -depletion biochemically, the predicted abundance of metabolic input species for each of the three metabolisms violates a separate observational constraint in the lower atmosphere of Venus. In Fig. 2 we plot the mixing ratios of SO 2, H 2 S and CO as functions of altitude, for the model atmosphere that best fits the SO 2 observations for each metabolic pathway. Alongside, we show the fiducial atmosphere, predicted from thermochemistry, photochemistry and chemical kinetics, which does not correctly predict the SO 2 observations, and the abiotic model atmosphere of Rimmer et al. which successfully predicts the SO 2 observations by hypothesising aqueous droplet chemistry. All three proposed metabolisms fit the SO 2 -depletion with a similar accuracy to the droplet-chemistry hypothesis, with metabolism A providing the closest fit of any hypothesis to the middle-atmosphere observations (Fig. 2). However, this comes at the cost of the other metabolic reagent species not then fitting their below-cloud observational constraints well.

Fig. 2 
Atmospheric profiles resulting from biochemical SO 2 -depletion.

Atmospheric profiles of (a) SO 2, (b) H 2 S and (c) CO mixing ratios as a function of altitude for the Rimmer et al. models (with and without droplet chemistry), compared with the three proposed metabolic pathways, under conditions that reproduce the SO 2 observations. Observational data and their 1 σ errors are shown in black except for the observation of H 2 S below 20 km altitude which is shown in grey, as this is possibly a spurious detection.

Metabolisms B and C each violate well-constrained lower-atmosphere observations of CO, requiring 300 ppm and 400 ppm of CO at the surface respectively, approximately ~15× and ~20× greater than observations indicate. Below-cloud CO has been measured in situ by gas chromatography instruments on-board the Venera 12 and Pioneer Venus descent probes,, by remote detection via IR spectra in a 2.3 μm atmospheric transparency window by the Venus Express orbiter,, and via remote Earth-based detection,. All of the data generally agree on deep atmosphere CO mixing ratios between 17 and 45 ppm and therefore a CO mixing ratio as high as that required by metabolisms B and C would be unexpected.

### Detection of carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the stratified surface of charon with JWST [^0d7b4df6]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

We developed a model that simultaneously fits the wavelength ranges 2.5–3.2 and 4.1–4.5 μm to model the CO 2 ν 1 + ν 3 combination band near 2.70 μm and the asymmetric stretching fundamental ν 3 at 4.27 μm. Analysis of spatially resolved data from New Horizons highlights a surface primarily composed of crystalline H 2 O ice and refractory materials, contributing to the gray coloration at visible wavelengths, with the north polar cap being an exception. An enhanced abundance of H 2 O ice and ammoniated species is noted in the bright ejecta blankets of geologically young craters. In light of these findings, and to incorporate the new detections of crystalline CO 2 and amorphous H 2 O ice on Charon’s surface, we formulated a compositional model to replicate these observed surface characteristics. This model consists of an areal mixture of two distinct surface units: the first comprises an intimate mixture of crystalline H 2 O ice, amorphous H 2 O ice, crystalline CO 2 ice, and tholin-like materials ; the second unit is characterized by a two-layer medium dominated by amorphous H 2 O ice and crystalline CO 2 on top of crystalline H 2 O ice and tholins. This model serves as a qualitative attempt to emulate the observed spectral features at long wavelengths, taking into account the known geology of Charon (see Fig. 3). In our model, we considered the Fresnel reflection occurring at the interface between the layered media. This reflection is attenuated by the extinction resulting from the particles present in the top layer. The optical constants of the top and bottom layers (n (λ), k (λ)) were estimated using the effective medium theory (specifically, the Bruggeman mixing formula).

We encountered challenges in developing a Hapke model similar to those described above to accurately reproduce the continuum near the 3.5-μm band of H 2 O 2. The optical constants of amorphous H 2 O ice in this region exhibit uncertainty, and the continuum cannot be faithfully reproduced using only the optical constants of crystalline H 2 O ice. Consequently, we resorted to employing a polynomial fit to define the continuum for this band, as described in the main body of the paper.

### Early turbulent mixing as the origin of chemical homogeneity in open star clusters [^f16a69c0]. Nature (2014). Excellent credibility.

The abundances of elements in stars are critical clues to stars' origins. Observed star-to-star variations in logarithmic abundance within an open star cluster--a gravitationally bound ensemble of stars in the Galactic plane--are typically only about 0.01 to 0.05 over many elements, which is noticeably smaller than the variation of about 0.06 to 0.3 seen in the interstellar medium from which the stars form. It is unknown why star clusters are so homogenous, and whether homogeneity should also prevail in regions of lower star formation efficiency that do not produce bound clusters. Here we report simulations that trace the mixing of chemical elements as star-forming clouds assemble and collapse. We show that turbulent mixing during cloud assembly naturally produces a stellar abundance scatter at least five times smaller than that in the gas, which is sufficient to explain the observed chemical homogeneity of stars. Moreover, mixing occurs very early, so that regions with star formation efficiencies of about 10 per cent are nearly as well mixed as those with formation efficiencies of about 50 per cent. This implies that even regions that do not form bound clusters are likely to be well mixed, and improves the prospects of using 'chemical tagging' to reconstruct (via their unique chemical signatures, or tags) star clusters whose constituent stars have become unbound from one another and spread across the Galactic disk.

### Efficient stabilization of cyanonaphthalene by fast radiative cooling and implications for the resilience of small PAHs in interstellar clouds [^0eeebe79]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) have long been thought to be ubiquitous in the Interstellar Medium (ISM), as evidenced by the infrared (IR) emission bands observed by astronomers at wavelengths coincident with their vibrational transition energies. These partially resolved bands, however, are common to PAHs as a class of molecules and cannot be used to identify specific species. To date, it has been generally held that PAHs in the interstellar medium must be fairly large, containing more than 50 carbon atoms, to be resilient against fragmentation after collisions or photon absorption. Here, we present experimental results demonstrating that a small, vibrationally hot PAH cation is stabilized much more rapidly than previously assumed, and that this occurs efficiently through Recurrent Fluorescence (RF).

Recently, McGuire et al.analyzed radio telescope observations of the dark molecular cloud TMC-1 to identify two isomers of cyanonaphthalene (C 10 H 7 CN, Fig. 1) – in which a nitrile/cyano (-CN) group replaces one of the hydrogen atoms of naphthalene. This is the first definitive assignment of a specific PAH molecule in space. As important as this assignment is for finally confirming the presence of PAH molecules in space, it is equally remarkable that the observed CNN abundances are six orders of magnitude higher than predicted by astrochemical modeling. Notably, the same model generally reproduces the observed abundances of linear and mono-cyclic nitriles, but underpredicts the abundance of bicyclic indene by four orders of magnitude. Laboratory studies have shown that nitrogen bearing aromatic molecules, as well as pure hydrocarbons like naphthaleneand indene,, may be readily formed in barrierless, gas-phase ion-molecule and radical-molecule reactions under conditions similar to those in interstellar clouds. On the other hand, the model of McGuire et al. indicates rapid depletion of CNN from TMC-1 through interactions with ions,and it predicts a limited abundance of its main precursor, naphthalene, which has also been shown to be a keystone in the formation of larger PAHs. McGuire et al. argue that radiative cooling of small PAH cations (< 20 atoms) is too slow to stabilize the molecules following ionizing interactions.However, this reasoning is based on the assumption that cooling only occurs via emission of IR photons from transitions between vibrational levels, which is indeed slow,. However, faster cooling may be possible due to emission of optical photons from thermally populated electronically excited states, i.e. Recurrent Fluorescence,, also called Poincaré fluorescence.

### Extreme deuterium enrichment in stratospheric hydrogen and the global atmospheric budget of H2 [^d44f575d]. Nature (2003). Excellent credibility.

Molecular hydrogen (H2) is the second most abundant trace gas in the atmosphere after methane (CH4). In the troposphere, the D/H ratio of H2 is enriched by 120 per thousand relative to the world's oceans. This cannot be explained by the sources of H2 for which the D/H ratio has been measured to date (for example, fossil fuels and biomass burning). But the isotopic composition of H2 from its single largest source--the photochemical oxidation of methane--has yet to be determined. Here we show that the D/H ratio of stratospheric H2 develops enrichments greater than 440 per thousand, the most extreme D/H enrichment observed in a terrestrial material. We estimate the D/H ratio of H2 produced from CH4 in the stratosphere, where production is isolated from the influences of non-photochemical sources and sinks, showing that the chain of reactions producing H2 from CH4 concentrates D in the product H2. This enrichment, which we estimate is similar on a global average in the troposphere, contributes substantially to the D/H ratio of tropospheric H2.

### Detection of carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the stratified surface of charon with JWST [^397173d6]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Exploring exogenous and endogenous processes requires putting Charon’s spectroscopic measurements in context with those of other icy moons in the Solar System and more primitive bodies (e.g. comets). Investigating the surface composition of these bodies can then offer insights into potentially common chemical compounds that might have been present in various regions of the solar nebula, as well as the possible formation of similar radiolytic and/or photolytic by-products on their surfaces.

In this work, we present observations of Charon acquired by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), extending beyond 2.5 μm up to 5.2 μm. We report the detection of CO 2 and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) on Charon’s frozen surface. Through spectral modeling analysis, comparison with laboratory measurements, and reference to JWST observations of Jupiter’s moon Europa,, we investigate the nature and sources of these compounds. Our results highlight insights into the chemical diversity and evolutionary processes on Charon.

### Direct formation of supermassive black holes via multi-scale gas inflows in galaxy mergers [^f72c5698]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

Observations of distant quasars indicate that supermassive black holes of billions of solar masses already existed less than a billion years after the Big Bang. Models in which the 'seeds' of such black holes form by the collapse of primordial metal-free stars cannot explain the rapid appearance of these supermassive black holes because gas accretion is not sufficiently efficient. Alternatively, these black holes may form by direct collapse of gas within isolated protogalaxies, but current models require idealized conditions, such as metal-free gas, to prevent cooling and star formation from consuming the gas reservoir. Here we report simulations showing that mergers between massive protogalaxies naturally produce the conditions for direct collapse into a supermassive black hole with no need to suppress cooling and star formation. Merger-driven gas inflows give rise to an unstable, massive nuclear gas disk of a few billion solar masses, which funnels more than 10(8) solar masses of gas to a sub-parsec-scale gas cloud in only 100,000 years. The cloud undergoes gravitational collapse, which eventually leads to the formation of a massive black hole. The black hole can subsequently grow to a billion solar masses on timescales of about 10(8) years by accreting gas from the surrounding disk.

### Sounding-rocket microgravity experiments on alumina dust [^9868186a]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

We performed in situ IR measurements on free-flying Al 2 O 3 in condensation experiments involving homogeneous nucleation in a ground-based laboratory; an IR spectrum of monodispersed Al 2 O 3 particles of uniform size and shape was successfully obtained. However, an α-Al 2 O 3 phase has never been directly synthesized by nucleation and growth processes in the vapor phase. We believe the reason for this is the rapid cooling of the nascent Al 2 O 3 particles by the thermal convection of the argon (Ar) buffer gas used to reduce the mean free path of the evaporated vapor, and thereby to reduce the physical scale of the experimental system. In the ground-based experiment, a strong convection (10–15 cm s −1) of Ar gas is induced by the hot evaporation source. By contrast, in a microgravitational environment, this thermal convection is completely suppressed, allowing the evaporated gases to cool more slowly. Consequently, the Al 2 O 3 nuclei have higher possibility to overcome a large barrier to form the most stable corundum phase. In addition, the slower cooling permits the gaseous atoms to collide more frequently and, on a longer timescale of gas cooling, provides a more realistic simulation of the grain formation in gas outflows from AGB stars. Based on this concept, we performed an ideal-nucleation experiment in a microgravitational environment of 2.2 × 10 −3 m s −2 (2.2 × 10 −4 G) aboard the sounding rocket S-520 30 and successfully reproduce a 13 μm band with a very narrow width of 0.5–0.6 μm. The experimental method will provide sufficient data to permit the identification of the unidentified stellar IR bands.

### Black holes regulate cool gas accretion in massive galaxies [^03451cde]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

The analysis above indicates that the HI mass in galaxies is determined by the relative strength between the binding energy of the halo and the energy released from BHs (E BH ∝ M BH). The binding energy of the halo determines how much gas can be accreted onto the dark matter halo, whereas the energy from BHs ejects or heats up the gas, preventing it from further cooling. The contest between the two determines how much accreted gas can be eventually cooled and settled down onto the central galaxies. For such a mechanism to be effective, a negative feedback loop involving gas accretion or cooling and BH accretion or feedback would be required,. The fact that the accreted cool gas could feed both star formation and BH accretion makes this possible. When gas accretion or cooling is elevated, stronger BH accretion is also triggered, resulting in more energy ejected into the ISM and CGM, which inhibits further cooling or accretion of the cool gas. This eventually brings down the cool gas content (and also the BH accretion rates). Conversely, a lower cool gas content would generally lead to weaker BH accretion with less energy ejection into the ISM and CGM, which will facilitate further cool gas accretion or cooling and increase f HI until it reaches the average relation. The same physical process applies to both star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and quiescent galaxies. The difference is that although both M BH and M ⋆ of SFGs can grow substantially through this process, most quiescent galaxies will probably maintain their M BH and M ⋆ when they are quenched because of their overall low BH accretion rates and star formation rates. This scenario is shown in Fig. 4.

### The heating of gas in a galaxy cluster by X-ray cavities and large-scale shock fronts [^38fc279b]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

Most of the baryons in galaxy clusters reside between the galaxies in a hot, tenuous gas. The densest gas in their centres should cool and accrete onto giant central galaxies at rates of 10-1,000 solar masses per year. No viable repository for this gas, such as clouds or new stars, has been found. New X-ray observations, however, have revealed far less cooling below X-ray temperatures than expected, altering the previously accepted picture of cooling flows. As a result, most of the gas must be heated to and maintained at temperatures above approximately 2 keV (ref. 3). The most promising heating mechanism is powerful radio jets emanating from supermassive black holes in the central galaxies of clusters. Here we report the discovery of giant cavities and shock fronts in a distant (z = 0.22) cluster caused by an interaction between a radio source and the hot gas surrounding it. The energy involved is approximately 6 x 10(61) erg, the most powerful radio outburst known. This is enough energy to quench a cooling flow for several Gyr, and to provide approximately 1/3 keV per particle of heat to the surrounding cluster.

### Heterogeneous chemistry in the atmosphere of mars [^7fc64dc9]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

Hydrogen radicals are produced in the martian atmosphere by the photolysis of water vapour and subsequently initiate catalytic cycles that recycle carbon dioxide from its photolysis product carbon monoxide. These processes provide a qualitative explanation for the stability of the atmosphere of Mars, which contains 95 per cent carbon dioxide. Balancing carbon dioxide production and loss based on our current understanding of the gas-phase chemistry in the martian atmosphere has, however, proven to be difficult. Interactions between gaseous chemical species and ice cloud particles have been shown to be key factors in the loss of polar ozone observed in the Earth's stratosphere, and may significantly perturb the chemistry of the Earth's upper troposphere. Water-ice clouds are also commonly observed in the atmosphere of Mars and it has been suggested previously that heterogeneous chemistry could have an important impact on the composition of the martian atmosphere. Here we use a state-of-the-art general circulation model together with new observations of the martian ozone layer to show that model simulations that include chemical reactions occurring on ice clouds lead to much improved quantitative agreement with observed martian ozone levels in comparison with model simulations based on gas-phase chemistry alone. Ozone is readily destroyed by hydrogen radicals and is therefore a sensitive tracer of the chemistry that regulates the atmosphere of Mars. Our results suggest that heterogeneous chemistry on ice clouds plays an important role in controlling the stability and composition of the martian atmosphere.

### Detection of carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the stratified surface of charon with JWST [^46279900]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The spectrum of Charon in the wavelength range between 2.66 and 2.80 μm, which includes both the ν 1 + ν 3 and 2 ν 2 + ν 3 CO 2 absorption bands, was modeled using the Hapke radiative transfer model. Specifically, the best-fit model consists of an areal mixture of 80% crystalline H 2 O ice, 18% amorphous H 2 O ice, and 2% crystalline CO 2 (for details, refer to the “Spectral modeling” section in the Methods and Supplementary Fig. 3).

We do not find evidence for the absorption bands of solid crystalline CO 2 at 1.97 μm (2 ν 1 + ν 3), 2.01 μm (ν 1 + 2 ν 2 + ν 3), and 2.07 μm (4 ν 2 + ν 3), consistent with the New Horizons data (Fig. 1 g and Supplementary Fig. 1). It is worth noting that, based on absorption coefficient considerations, the ν 1 + ν 3 and ν 3 CO 2 absorption bands probe penetration depths on the order of 1 μm and 0.1 μm, respectively. These depths refer to how far into a material the light can penetrate before being absorbed, directly relating to the depth below the surface that is being probed. In contrast, the short wavelength absorption bands (i.e. 2 ν 1 + ν 3, ν 1 +  2 ν 2 + ν 3, 4 ν 2 + ν 3) probe the occurrence of CO 2 at approximate depths of 50 μm for ν 1 + 2 ν 2 + ν 3, 100 μm for 2 ν 1 + ν 3, and 300 μm for 4 ν 2 + ν 3. The probe depths listed for the CO 2 absorption bands are based on measurements of pure CO 2. These depths will differ if CO 2 is dispersed in H 2 O ice, as we propose here on Charon based on the modeling of the 2.7-μm range (refer to the “Spectral modeling” section in the Methods). In this context, the values obtained for pure CO 2 represent a lower limit. Nevertheless, when accounting for CO 2 dispersed in H 2 O ice, the short wavelength bands near 2 μm will still probe hundreds of microns, contrary to the ν 1 + ν 3 and ν 3 bands that will probe approximately the first 5 and 1 μm, respectively. Therefore, the lack of detection of CO 2 absorption features at short wavelengths near 2 μm implies that this compound is sparse at penetration depths greater than several tens of microns, contrary to the case of the Uranian moonsand Triton.

### Missing interstellar sulfur in inventories of polysulfanes and molecular octasulfur crowns [^ecd46253]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Here, by exploiting tunable photoionization reflectron time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (PI-ReToF-MS), we reveal the inventory of sulfur and hydrogen bearing molecules synthesized in astrophysically relevant model ices of hydrogen sulfide exposed to proxies of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs)over typical lifetimes of cold molecular clouds from 10 6 to a few 10 7 years at temperatures of 5 K,. The transition from the cold molecular cloud to the star-forming region is simulated in the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) phase from 5 K to 330 K. The interstellar analog ices are characterized utilizing FTIR spectroscopy during the radiation processing to probe the consumption of the hydrogen sulfide reactants, whereas subliming species are identified in the gas phase by PI-ReToF-MS. Soft, single-photon photoionization with isomer selectivity via PI-ReToF-MS, coupled with isotopic studies, provided unique evidence in identifying the complex reservoir of sulfur-containing molecules synthesized in these processed ices. These studies provide experimental testimony on two key sinks of sulfur-carrying molecules: polysulfanes with up to eleven sulfur atoms (H 2 S n ; n = 2–11) and octasulfur (S 8), exclusively in the crown conformation, with up to 33% of the hydrogen sulfide reactants converted over molecular cloud lifetimes of 10 7 years. These observations provide fundamental knowledge as to why sulfur may be depleted on interstellar nanoparticles in cold, dense molecular clouds. Such results direct the astronomy community toward the search for polysulfanes in the gas phase of star-forming regions, where these molecules should be observable as a result of fractionated sublimation from dust grains. Our study further affords persuasive evidence on the molecular level of the source of cyclic octasulfur (S 8) detected recently in the carbonaceous asteroid (162173) Ryugu, thus documenting for the first time the link between interstellar matter and planetary bodies in solar systems, including our own.

### Missing interstellar sulfur in inventories of polysulfanes and molecular octasulfur crowns [^ae62e5c2]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Since the detection of the very first interstellar sulfur-containing molecule, carbon monosulfide (CS) in 1971, ~40 sulfur-containing molecules have been identified in the interstellar medium (ISM) (Fig. 1). In the gas phase, these molecules range from simple triatomics such as hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) to thiols (RSH), thioaldehydes (HCSR), thioketenes (RCCS), thioacids (HSOCR), and thioamides (RCSNR’) with R and R’ being organic side chains. Recent mid-infrared observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provided fundamental compositional insights of the icy grains in dense molecular clouds, such as in pristine cloud ices toward two background stars NIR38 and J110621, where carbonyl sulfide (OCS) and possibly sulfur dioxide (SO 2) have been detected. Water is ubiquitously found in the interstellar ices amongst the other major ice species: carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and ammonia (NH 3). Although the simplest sulfur-containing molecule: hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) has not been observed yet in interstellar ices via infrared observation –, chemical models predict that hydrogen sulfide is present in these ices. Since infrared interstellar ice analyses displayed evidence for compounds more volatile than hydrogen sulfide (such as methane) still remaining on the ices, non-detection of hydrogen sulfide is likely due to the weak infrared features. Since interstellar dust grains and cold molecular clouds provide essentially the raw material for protoplanetary disks and resulting solar systems, the astronomy community inferred that interstellar grains and sulfur-carrying molecules are at least partially incorporated into comets and other planetary bodies as the molecular clouds transform into star-forming regions,,.

### Ethylene industrial emitters seen from space [^b440572b]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Results

Ethylene hotspots

The IASI dataset used here consists of thirteen years (2008–2020) of daily global, cloud-free, hyperspectral infrared observations. For each spectrum, we calculated a hyperspectral range index (HRI) that quantifies the C 2 H 4 signal strength with a high sensitivity. Subsequently, we converted the HRI to gas column abundance by means of an artificial neural network (“Methods”). To take advantage of the extensive IASI time series, we applied a wind-adjusted super-resolution technique to the HRI dataset, which allows increasing the spatial resolution of satellite data beyond the native resolution of the sounder (“Methods”; Supplementary Figs. 1, 2). By doing so, we produced a 13-year averaged global distribution of ethylene at a 0.01° × 0.01° spatial resolution (Fig. 1). The HRI is used here as it directly expresses the integrated information on the target gas contained in the satellite measurement, and as it is a less noisy indicator of local gas enhancement than the retrieved column (Supplementary Fig. 3). The C 2 H 4 global distribution shows a variable background, with regionally higher values that we attribute, via thorough IASI spectra analysis, to ethylene over polluted environments (e.g. Europe), and to surface emissivity effects over certain types of soils (“Methods”). Zoom-ins over various regions of the global map (Fig. 1) unveil—thanks to its hyperfine spatial resolution—large local C 2 H 4 enhancements with typically a spatial extent of 20–50 km. Examples are shown over Iran and the Persian Gulf in Fig. 2, and over an industrial valley of the Shanxi Province, China, in Supplementary Fig. 4. We provide firm spectroscopic evidence that ethylene is the dominant contributor to such enhancements detected throughout the globe, confirming that those correspond to C 2 H 4 hotspots (“Methods”; Supplementary Fig. 5). Figure 2 and Supplementary Fig. 4 depict close-up views on some of these hotspots with visible satellite imagery, demonstrating that these point-sources can be traced back primarily to heavy industries and urban areas.

### Plasma-induced surface cooling [^3dcc5881]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Photoemission measurements

To understand the relative flux of species at the surface, optical emission spectroscopy was employed to measure both time-averaged broadband emission as well as time-resolved emission intensity of select lines. The geometry for these measurements is shown in Supplementary Fig. 4. A NIR spectrometer (Ocean Optics HR2000+) was used to measure the time-averaged emission spectrum from the jet using the geometry shown in Supplementary Fig. 4 a. Those results are shown in Supplementary Fig. 5 and indicate a wide range of photons - extending from UV to IR—are produced by the plasma jet. VUV and EUV photons (<200 nm) have also been observed in He jets, but are not observable in our experiments due to bandwidth limitations and strong absorption in air. The spectrum also indicates that, despite being produced in a helium flow, a wide variety of air-related products are produced in the plasma due to the downstream mixing of helium and air. While useful for species identification, the spectrum lacks any spatial or temporal information. To best understand the reflectivity results, the time-resolved flux of photons at the surface must be measured. To do this, we employed the geometry shown in Supplementary Fig. 4 b, which provides a line-of-sight along the axis of the jet and thus the ability to measure emission incident to the surface from ignition through the afterglow. Select emission lines were monitored using a scanning monochromator (2035 McPherson) with a photomultiplier tube (McPherson model number 654) connected to a multichannel scaler (Stanford Research Systems Model SR430 multichannel scaler) to accumulate the data. Those results are shown in Fig. 3 of the main article and compared to the time-dependent voltage and current measurements.

### Detection of carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the stratified surface of charon with JWST [^7ccb6308]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The spectrum of H 2 O ice containing approximately 2% CO 2 and irradiated to a dose of 10 18 electrons cm −2 at 70 K (dark green solid line in Fig. 2 d; see the “Laboratory experiments” section in the Methods for further information) displays a sharp feature at 4.27 μm, resembling the Lorentzian observed in Charon’s spectrum. Nonetheless, the exact width of this absorption band and its spectral shape, marked by its symmetric behavior, do not match perfectly the observations. This could imply the presence of CO 2 embedded within H 2 O ice that has been modified by irradiation, alongside the naturally occurring pure polycrystalline phase.

The JWST spectrum of Europa also displays a double-peak structure in the same wavelength range, (cyan points in Fig. 2), though its band distinctly contrasts with the feature in Charon’s spectrum. Specifically, the band in the Europa spectrum can be decomposed into two sharp Lorentzian components centered at 4.2462 ± 0.0003 μm and 4.2700 ± 0.0003 μm, with half FWHMs equal to 0.0150 ± 0.0005 μm and 0.0061 ± 0.0005 μm, respectively (red dashed line in Fig. 2 d). The combination of a Gaussian and a Lorentzian component does not satisfactorily reproduce the band shape. Moreover, unlike Charon’s feature, the intersection point between these two components in Europa’s spectrum is depressed relative to the band continuum. The spectral feature in the Europa spectrum has been ascribed to a complex water/organic-rich molecular environment, given the good agreement with the laboratory spectrum of an ice mixture containing CO 2, H 2 O, and CH 3 OH [1:0.8:0.9] at 114 K(orange dashed line in Fig. 2 d). The profile of the ν 3 CO 2 absorption band is known to be strongly distorted by the presence of polar (e.g. H 2 O and CH 3 OH) and non-polar species (e.g. CO, O 2, and CH 4) in the surrounding ice matrix,. While we do not provide a definitive assignment to this feature, we remain open to the possibility of CO 2 embedded in a complex water/organic-rich molecular environment (referred to as complexed CO 2), akin to that of Europa, as an explanation for the 4.23-μm absorption band observed in the spectrum of Charon.

### Venus water loss is dominated by HCOdissociative recombination [^04d27a77]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Despite its Earth-like size and source material 1,2 , Venus is extremely dry 3,4 , indicating near-total water loss to space by means of hydrogen outflow from an ancient, steam-dominated atmosphere 5,6 . Such hydrodynamic escape likely removed most of an initial Earth-like 3-km global equivalent layer (GEL) of water but cannot deplete the atmosphere to the observed 3-cm GEL because it shuts down below about 10-100m GEL 5,7 . To complete Venus water loss, and to produce the observed bulk atmospheric enrichment in deuterium of about 120times Earth 8,9 , nonthermal H escape mechanisms still operating today are required 10,11 . Early studies identified these as resonant charge exchange 12-14 , hot oxygen impact 15,16 and ion outflow 17,18 , establishing a consensus view of H escape 10,19 that has since received only minimal updates 20 . Here we show that this consensus omits the most important present-day H loss process, HCO + dissociative recombination. This process nearly doubles the Venus H escape rate and, consequently, doubles the amount of present-day volcanic water outgassing and/or impactor infall required to maintain a steady-state atmospheric water abundance. These higher loss rates resolve long-standing difficulties in simultaneously explaining the measured abundance and isotope ratio of Venusian water 21,22 and would enable faster desiccation in the wake of speculative late ocean scenarios 23 . Design limitations prevented past Venus missions from measuring both HCO + and the escaping hydrogen produced by its recombination; future spacecraft measurements are imperative.

### Missing interstellar sulfur in inventories of polysulfanes and molecular octasulfur crowns [^96c98a75]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The sulfur loss in the dense molecular clouds described as ‘the sulfur depletion problem’ has represented an enigma for astronomers and astrochemists. Laboratory simulation studies so far have failed to provide a comprehensive explanation, resorting to limitations in detection techniques utilized. The present laboratory study focuses on the identification of astrochemical changes and transformation of the hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) ice deposited on interstellar dust grains in the cold molecular cloud conditions upon the radiation exposure of GCR proxies in the order of 10 7 years via condensed phase FTIR and tunable VUV PI-ReToF-MS to identify the products isomer selectively during TPD in the gas phase. GCR proxy exposure of hydrogen sulfide ices identified a homologous series of sulfanes in the form of H 2 S n, ranging from two to eleven sulfur atoms, and molecular sulfur, only in one specific ring conformer of S 8, the thermodynamically most stable crown conformer, as irradiation products. Signals observed at mass channels corresponding to molecular sulfur (S n) are observed to be fragments of the higher order sulfane (H 2 S n+1), extending the observations by Carrascosa, H. et al. to all sulfanes observed. Isomer-specific identifications of HSSH (m/z = 66), HSSSH (m/z = 98) were possible for H 2 S 2 and H 2 S by fine-tuning the photoionization energy at the TPD phase. Overlapping ionization energies prevented the isomeric identifications of larger sulfanes. No previous study experimentally observed octasulfur in the processed ices, even if octasulfur was assumed to form on these model ices that identified molecular sulfurs (S n),–. These sulfanes and octasulfur (S 8) may hold the key to the missing sulfur of the dense clouds; polysulfanes undergo fractionated sublimation from 150 K to 297 K; octasulfur sublimed at 310 K in the warm-up phase, which simulates the molecules subliming into the gas phase once the molecular cloud transits to star-forming regions.

### The loss of ions from venus through the plasma wake [^32e1f68f]. Nature (2007). Excellent credibility.

Venus, unlike Earth, is an extremely dry planet although both began with similar masses, distances from the Sun, and presumably water inventories. The high deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio in the venusian atmosphere relative to Earth's also indicates that the atmosphere has undergone significantly different evolution over the age of the Solar System. Present-day thermal escape is low for all atmospheric species. However, hydrogen can escape by means of collisions with hot atoms from ionospheric photochemistry, and although the bulk of O and O2 are gravitationally bound, heavy ions have been observed to escape through interaction with the solar wind. Nevertheless, their relative rates of escape, spatial distribution, and composition could not be determined from these previous measurements. Here we report Venus Express measurements showing that the dominant escaping ions are O+, He+ and H+. The escaping ions leave Venus through the plasma sheet (a central portion of the plasma wake) and in a boundary layer of the induced magnetosphere. The escape rate ratios are Q(H+)/Q(O+) = 1.9; Q(He+)/Q(O+) = 0.07. The first of these implies that the escape of H+ and O+, together with the estimated escape of neutral hydrogen and oxygen, currently takes place near the stoichometric ratio corresponding to water.

### Binary progenitor systems for type Ic supernovae [^2f3d9f18]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Random locations, Type Ia, Type II, and Type Ic SNe are represented by black, blue, red, and grey error bars, respectively.

Median molecular gas densities increase from the values measured for the random pixels, through Type Ia SNe, to Type II and Ic SNe (and, respectively). The results are shown in Fig. 3. The random locations and Type Ia SNe have much lower median molecular gas densities than CCSNe. At the positions of Type II and Ic SNe we obtained similar molecular gas densities within the 1 σ confidence levels.

Under the assumption of single very massive star progenitors for Type Ic SNe (for masses of 30–100 M ⊙ with lifetimes of 7–3 Myr, respectively), it is expected that the respective parent GMC would not have been dispersed before the SN explosion due to a short progenitor lifetime, and the progenitors would not have enough time to shift away from their birthplaces significantly. Therefore, if progenitors of Type Ic SNe were very massive stars, then the distribution of Σ mol at their positions should be shifted toward higher values compared to that of Type II SNe. This is because the lower masses of progenitors of Type II SNe imply longer lifetimes, and therefore more time for the parent clouds to disperse and for the progenitors to move away. This scenario is not supported by our results. In the alternative scenario, the progenitors of Type II SNe evolve as single stars (or in wide binaries in which their hydrogen layers are not affected) and those of Type Ic SNe are similarly massive stars that evolve in binary systems with a companion being responsible for removing the external layers of hydrogen and helium. Then the progenitor masses, and therefore lifetimes, of both types are similar. Thereby, their distributions of Σ mol should be comparable, which is consistent with our data. See methods, subsection Timing the SN progenitor lifetime with molecular gas information for the justification of using the molecular gas densities to constrain the stellar population age.

### Detection of carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the stratified surface of charon with JWST [^d7c273f7]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

For the wavelength range between 2.66 and 2.8 μm, including the CO 2 band, we required an areal mixture of two components: crystalline H 2 O ice at 70 K and aggregates of amorphous H 2 O ice at 60 K with crystalline CO 2. For the aggregates, we estimated the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index as a function of wavelength, λ, using effective medium theory (specifically, the Bruggeman mixing formula). This technique preserves the spectral properties of each component within the aggregate and assumes that the medium’s end-members are distinct from one another at the molecular level. The free parameters in this case were the areal fraction and particle diameter of each component, and the percentage of crystalline CO 2 relative to amorphous H 2 O ice. Including crystalline CO 2 ice in amorphous H 2 O ice helped to attenuate the 2.78-μm absorption band compared to the 2.7-μm band. The best-fit model consisted of an areal mixture of 80% crystalline H 2 O ice (with approximately 115-μm particle diameter) and 20% amorphous H 2 O ice with 12% inclusions of crystalline CO 2 (with approximately 7-μm particle diameter). This corresponds to 2% crystalline CO 2 and 18% amorphous H 2 O ice. The comparison between the data and the best-fit model is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3.

### Theoretical evidence of H-He demixing under jupiter and saturn conditions [^a2ade35d]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The immiscibility of hydrogen-helium mixture under the temperature and pressure conditions of planetary interiors is crucial for understanding the structures of gas giant planets (e.g., Jupiter and Saturn). While the experimental probe at such extreme conditions is challenging, theoretical simulation is heavily relied in an effort to unravel the mixing behavior of hydrogen and helium. Here we develop a method via a machine learning accelerated molecular dynamics simulation to quantify the physical separation of hydrogen and helium under the conditions of planetary interiors. The immiscibility line achieved with the developed method yields substantially higher demixing temperatures at pressure above 1.5Mbar than earlier theoretical data, but matches better to the experimental estimate. Our results suggest a possibility that H-He demixing takes place in a large fraction of the interior radii of Jupiter and Saturn, i.e., 27.5% in Jupiter and 48.3% in Saturn. This indication of an H-He immiscible layer hints at the formation of helium rain and offers a potential explanation for the decrease of helium in the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn.

### Risk of the hydrogen economy for atmospheric methane [^f87e9a19]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

To maximize the climate benefit of hydrogen adoption, minimizing both H 2 and CH 4 losses across the supply chain of hydrogen production will need to be a priority. On the methane side, some governments and companies have already committed to reducing the leaks from the oil and gas sector, because this could be the most cost-effective and impactful action for near-term climate mitigation. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that, with the recent rise in natural gas prices, the abatement of methane emissions from the global gas and oil sector could be implemented at no net cost. Hence, the accomplishment of this mitigation is only a matter of political will for the limited number of companies involved.

On the hydrogen side, the global value chain still has to be built. This offers the advantage of tackling the hydrogen emission problem ahead of time. On the one hand, energy companies will have a great interest in minimizing economic loss and safety risks due to hydrogen leaks. On the other hand, however, many technological challenges still need to be addressed. First, H 2 containment may remain an issue even as technologies progress. The high diffusivity of the small H 2 molecule has already challenged the scientific community’s ability to measure the H 2 concentration in the atmosphereand in the firn air of ice sheets. Second, while more field-based estimates of H 2 losses are needed, there is currently no commercially available sensing technology able to detect small H 2 leaks at the ppb level. Third, global-space monitoring, which is bringing a much-needed transparency to the quantification of real methane emissions,, will also require new technology since H 2, unlike CH 4 or CO 2, does not absorb infrared radiation. For all these reasons, the uncertainty about future emissions from the H 2 value chain remains large.

Our versatile atmospheric model allowed a broad exploration of scenarios in a hydrogen-based energy system. Simulations with high resolution three-dimensional atmospheric chemistry models, which are more comprehensive but more computationally demanding, could refine our results for specific scenarios. In particular, a more detailed model could improve the assessment of H 2 displacement of fossil fuels by accounting for the emission changes of other chemical species, like CO and NO x, which impact the CH 4 –H 2 –OH dynamics. Further analyses could also refine the potential changes in emission inventories due to H 2 displacement of different fossil fuels.

### Inhomogeneous terminators on the exoplanet WASP-39 B [^4c9bc1cf]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

To explore the possibilities enabled by aerosols and chemical processes, we compared the observations to predictions from GCMs, which are hydrodynamics models that simulate the 3D wind and temperature structure in planetary atmospheres, self-consistently predicting differences between the evening and morning terminator. A range of processes influence terminator differences in the spectra, including temperature differences driven by atmospheric circulation, condensate clouds, photochemical hazes and the transport-induced disequilibrium chemistry of gaseous species (Fig. 3). No single GCM is currently able to self-consistently simulate all of these processes simultaneously. We thus explored multiple different models –.

### Detection of carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the stratified surface of charon with JWST [^e05e0651]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The same strategy described above was adopted to model the continuum in the wavelength range between 2.6 and 2.8 μm in order to isolate the 2.7-μm CO 2 band. To facilitate the modeling of the saturated H 2 O ice absorption in the 3-μm region, an isotropic phase function with ξ = 0 was employed. The need for distinct photometric properties to model the data at short wavelengths (below 2.5 μm) and longer near-IR wavelengths (beyond 2.5 μm) may be attributed to these wavelength ranges probing varying penetration depths with different microscopic properties. The spectral slope between 2.6 and 2.8 μm serves as a good metric for distinguishing amorphous from crystalline H 2 O ice, given that the former has a shallower slope than the latter. Adopting crystalline H 2 O ice only failed to replicate the data. The best-fit model was obtained as an intimate mixture of approximately 80 μm-diameter grains, with the fractional volume (V i) of crystalline H 2 O ice at 70 K being on the order of 90% and that of amorphous H 2 O ice at 60 K being about 10%. We also tested an areal mixture of crystalline H 2 O ice at 70 K and amorphous H 2 O ice at 60 K, achieving a statistically equivalent best fit with approximately 80 μm-diameter grains. In this mixture, the fractional area (F i) covered by crystalline H 2 O ice is 85%, while that covered by amorphous H 2 O ice is 15%. This model is illustrated in Fig. 2 a (red solid line).

### Detection of carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the stratified surface of charon with JWST [^29782242]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Spectra of pure amorphous CO 2 do not align with Charon’s 2.7-μm absorption feature. The ν 1 + ν 3 band of solid amorphous CO 2 peaks close to 2.70 μm. However, its band center is shifted toward longer wavelengths compared to crystalline CO 2. Additionally, the band profile for the amorphous phase is broader, with an FWHM approximately three times larger than that of its crystalline counterpart – (see olive dash-dot line in Fig. 2 c).

Solid CO 2, when mixed with other constituents, does not yield a close match to Charon’s 2.7 μm feature. For instance, irradiation of pure CO 2 ice with 100 keV protons (H +) results in CO 2 depletion and the accumulation of carbon monoxide (CO), oxygen (O 2), and minor species such as ozone (O 3) and carbon trioxide (CO 3). The changing matrix environment results in the broadening of the 2.7-μm feature, as shown by the pink dashed line in Fig. 2 c. Similar considerations apply to CO 2 diluted in H 2 O, both in its pure form (olive dashed line in Fig. 2 c, with a possible contribution from the dangling bond of solid H 2 O) and post irradiation (dark green solid line in Fig. 2 c). The observed shift toward longer wavelengths and the broadening of the ν 1 + ν 3 band upon diluting CO 2 in H 2 O, as seen in our laboratory data, are consistent with other laboratory studies. For a detailed description of our laboratory experiments on H 2 O–CO 2 ice mixtures, the reader is referred to the “Laboratory experiments” section in the Methods. CO 2 mixed with H 2 O and methanol (CH 3 OH) ices in nearly equal proportions, at temperatures relevant to the surface of Charon (approximately 50 K), is inconsistent with the observations. This discrepancy can be seen in the purple dash-dot line of Fig. 2 c.

### Detection of carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the stratified surface of charon with JWST [^0d9c90f4]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The width of the 3.5-μm absorption band can be slightly influenced by the choice of continuum, such as the polynomial order or the selection of the masking zone. Additionally, the shape of the 3.5-μm band undergoes a notable alteration with varying irradiation fluence on the H 2 O:CO 2 (1:0.02) mixture. As irradiation fluence increases, structures on the long-wavelength shoulder of the H 2 O 2 absorption become increasingly pronounced (see comparison between magenta dashed and dotted lines in Fig. 4 b). These structures are likely attributable to by-products like CH 3 OH. Specifically, the profile of the 3.5-μm absorption resulting from the irradiation of CO 2 diluted in H 2 O can be decomposed into two distinct components: the first component, centered around 3.5 μm, is associated with H 2 O 2 ; the second, sharper and centered at approximately 3.53 μm, is linked to other species like CH 3 OH. This latter feature, which becomes more pronounced with increasing irradiation fluence, subtly broadens the FWHM of the band, differentiating it from the H 2 O 2 absorption observed when pure H 2 O ice is irradiated.

### Detection of carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the stratified surface of charon with JWST [^9c0a09f6]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The radiolytic synthesis of H 2 O 2 is also consistent with the presence of amorphous H 2 O ice on Charon’s surface. Impinging radiation, as well as flash sublimation from impact heating followed by condensation on a cold surface, can break down the crystalline structure. The amorphized ice retains its disordered structure more effectively at Charon’s colder temperatures.

We find that the abundance of H 2 O 2 on Charon is approximately a factor of two lower compared to Europa. Charon’s surface temperature is cooler than Europa’s (approximately 50 Kversus 90–130 K). While laboratory studies suggest an increased production of H 2 O 2 at lower temperatures, the differences between Europa and Charon H 2 O 2 content could be attributed to different radiation environments encountered by the two satellites. Europa experiences intense bombardment from charged particles (H +, S n+, O n+) trapped in the Jovian magnetosphere, with energies ranging from tens of keV to MeV. These levels significantly exceed the keV solar wind impinging on Charon. Additionally, solid NH 3, present on Charon’s surface, can also react with and destroy H 2 O 2 at temperatures exceeding 50 K, which may partially explain the lower H 2 O 2 levels on Charon compared to Europa. Furthermore, different concentrations of CO 2 may also affect the abundance of radiolytic H 2 O 2. Systematic laboratory work investigating the impact of irradiation on H 2 O–CO 2 mixtures, with diverse dilution levels at various temperatures, is essential to further explore the similarities and differences between these two intriguing satellites.

To conclude, the inaugural observations of Charon by JWST have significantly advanced our comprehension of its surface composition, revealing a stratified surface rich in crystalline H 2 O ice with NH 3 diluted in H 2 O ice at penetration depths of approximately 100 μm. Additionally, a layer of pure crystalline CO 2 is evident at shallower penetration depths of about 5 μm. This feature is likely attributable to an endogenous source, unearthed by external impacts. This layering configuration is believed to cause a scattering effect, which may account for the peculiarly strong CO 2 absorption band at longer wavelengths. Moreover, the surface is undergoing continuous alteration by photolysis and radiolysis, which contribute to the CO 2 inventory and are responsible for the presence of H 2 O 2 and amorphous H 2 O ice.

### Artificial nighttime lighting impacts visual ecology links between flowers, pollinators and predators [^54068168]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Artificial nighttime lighting has brought great benefits to human societies, however, it also profoundly alters the timing, intensity and spectrum of natural light regimes,. Associated with human settlement, transport networks and industry, nearly a quarter of the global land area already lies under artificially light polluted nighttime skies. While the area experiencing direct light emissions is harder to estimate, both these extents are growing rapidly. The spectrum of this lighting is also changing, as previously often narrow spectrum lamps (e.g. low pressure sodium) are widely replaced with broad white light-emitting diode (LED) lamps.

Artificial light at night has both been predicted and empirically determined to have a wide diversity of biological impacts, including on organismal physiology, and behaviour,, the abundance and distribution of species,, and the structure and functioning of communities and ecosystems. It is also predicted to have profound impacts on the visual ecology of many organisms, and as a consequence both their intraspecific (e.g. sexual signalling) and interspecific interactions (e.g. pollination, ; anti-predator defences,). These interactions have often co-evolved for millions of years either to enhance the colours for signalling to a specific receiver, or to alter or mask an organism’s appearance from predators. In each case the colours have evolved against specific backgrounds to be viewed by the intended visual system under natural lighting (i.e. sunlight, moonlight or starlight). The emission spectra of artificial light sources differ from those that occur naturally, and could thus dramatically alter the visibility of these co-evolved coloration strategies.

### Infrared spectroscopic study of hydrogen bonding topologies in the smallest ice cube [^235facf5]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The water octamer with its cubic structure consisting of six four-membered rings presents an excellent cluster system for unraveling the cooperative interactions driven by subtle changes in the hydrogen-bonding topology. Despite prediction of many distinct structures, it has not been possible to extract the structural information encoded in their vibrational spectra because this requires size-selectivity of the neutral clusters with sufficient resolution to identify the contributions of the different isomeric forms. Here we report the size-specific infrared spectra of the isolated cold, neutral water octamer using a scheme based on threshold photoionization using a tunable vacuum ultraviolet free electron laser. A plethora of sharp vibrational bands features are observed. Theoretical analysis of these patterns reveals the coexistence of five cubic isomers, including two with chirality. The relative energies of these structures are found to reflect topology-dependent, delocalized multi-center hydrogen-bonding interactions. These results demonstrate that even with a common structural motif, the degree of cooperativity among the hydrogen-bonding network creates a hierarchy of distinct species. The implications of these results on possible metastable forms of ice are speculated.

### Lenghu on the tibetan plateau as an astronomical observing site [^e615646c]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

AOT statistics

The clear night is derived by using both LH-Cam images analysis and the smoothness of integrated sky brightness records of the SQM. Lenghu has almost no artificial light pollution. Therefore, on LH-Cam images, any cloud will block the star background on a new moon night or when the moon is 18° or more under the horizon, leaving a dark patch on the image. When the moon is in the view of the camera, clouds will be directly visible. On sky brightness curves of the SQM, clouds make darkening or brightening fluctuations patterns depending on the moon age, and the amplitudes of such variations are correlated well with cloud coverage/thickness on the images, as demonstrated in Extended Data Fig. 2. In the left panel, three LH-cam images show a typical clear time (right), small clumpy cloud passage between clear time (left) and overcast (middle) cases, on the night of 6 October 2019, together with the SQM light curve. The right panel shows the distribution of clear time (cyan) in 2019 as an example of annual observing time statistics, based on the method described above.

### Detection of carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the stratified surface of charon with JWST [^4b525e12]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Hydrogen peroxide detection

The JWST reflectance spectrum of Charon features a distinctive plateau around 3.50 μm (Fig. 4 a). To determine whether this spectral feature can be attributed to H 2 O 2, we conducted a thorough comparison with JWST observations of Europaand laboratory spectra of irradiated H 2 O ice films,. Notably, H 2 O 2 has been conclusively identified on Europa’s surface via the 3.5-μm infrared absorption band,, and it is recognized as a product of radiolytic processes of H 2 O ice,,. Considering the identification of CO 2 on Charon’s surface as well as on Europa, the results of our irradiation experiments with H 2 O–CO 2 ice mixtures—containing a 2% CO 2 concentration comparable to that on Charon—are especially relevant for this analysis (see the “Laboratory experiments” section in the Methods for a detailed description of these experiments).

### An unexpectedly low oscillator strength as the origin of the fe XVII emission problem [^f7db44a5]. Nature (2012). Excellent credibility.

Highly charged iron (Fe(16+), here referred to as FeXVII) produces some of the brightest X-ray emission lines from hot astrophysical objects, including galaxy clusters and stellar coronae, and it dominates the emission of the Sun at wavelengths near 15 ångströms. The FeXVII spectrum is, however, poorly fitted by even the best astrophysical models. A particular problem has been that the intensity of the strongest FeXVII line is generally weaker than predicted. This has affected the interpretation of observations by the Chandra and XMM-Newton orbiting X-ray missions, fuelling a continuing controversy over whether this discrepancy is caused by incomplete modelling of the plasma environment in these objects or by shortcomings in the treatment of the underlying atomic physics. Here we report the results of an experiment in which a target of iron ions was induced to fluoresce by subjecting it to femtosecond X-ray pulses from a free-electron laser; our aim was to isolate a key aspect of the quantum mechanical description of the line emission. Surprisingly, we find a relative oscillator strength that is unexpectedly low, differing by 3.6σ from the best quantum mechanical calculations. Our measurements suggest that the poor agreement is rooted in the quality of the underlying atomic wavefunctions rather than in insufficient modelling of collisional processes.

Methods

Overview of the CLOUD facility

The CLOUD experiment at CERN is designed to study the effects of cosmic rays on aerosols, cloud droplets and ice particles, under precisely controlled laboratory conditions. The 3-m-diameter stainless-steel CLOUD chamber and its gas system have been built to the highest technical standards of cleanliness and performance. The CLOUD chamber is periodically cleaned by rinsing the walls with ultra-pure water, followed by heating to 373 K and flushing at a high rate with humidified synthetic air and elevated ozone (several parts per million by volume). Contaminant levels of condensable vapours are in the sub-p.p.t.v. range. The high cleanliness of the chamber, together with its large volume (26.1 m 3) and highly stable operating conditions, allows particle formation to be studied under atmospheric conditions at nucleation rates between about 0.001 cm −3 s −1 and 100 cm −3 s −1. The loss rate of condensable vapours and particles onto the chamber walls is comparable to the ambient condensation sink of the pristine boundary layer.

Ion production in the chamber can be controlled using an internal electric clearing field (which creates an ion-free environment), GCRs or an adjustable π + beam, from the CERN Proton Synchrotron. The π + beam is de-focused to a transverse size of about 1.5 m × 1.5 m when it passes through the CLOUD chamber. With the electric field set to zero, the equilibrium ion-pair concentration in the chamber due to GCRs is around 700 cm −3. With the π + beam, this can be increased to any value up to about 3,000 cm −3. Hence, ion concentrations corresponding to any altitude in the troposphere can be generated in the CLOUD chamber.

The experiment has precise control of the trace vapours inside the chamber and also of the environmental temperature between 300 K and 203 K. Uniform mixing is achieved with magnetically coupled stainless-steel fans mounted at the top and bottom of the chamber. The characteristic gas mixing time in the chamber is a few minutes, depending on the fan speeds. Photochemical processes are initiated by illumination with an ultraviolet fibre-optic system, providing highly stable gas-phase reactions with a precise start time. The contents of the chamber are continuously analysed by instruments connected to sampling probes that project into the chamber. The sampling analysers are tailored for each experimental campaign, but typically comprise around 30–35 instruments, of which up to 10 are mass spectrometers.

### Generation and characterization of ultrathin free-flowing liquid sheets [^bdb4f8d9]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The physics and chemistry of liquid solutions play a central role in science, and our understanding of life on Earth. Unfortunately, key tools for interrogating aqueous systems, such as infrared and soft X-ray spectroscopy, cannot readily be applied because of strong absorption in water. Here we use gas-dynamic forces to generate free-flowing, sub-micron, liquid sheets which are two orders of magnitude thinner than anything previously reported. Optical, infrared, and X-ray spectroscopies are used to characterize the sheets, which are found to be tunable in thickness from over 1μm  down to less than 20nm, which corresponds to fewer than 100 water molecules thick. At this thickness, aqueous sheets can readily transmit photons across the spectrum, leading to potentially transformative applications in infrared, X-ray, electron spectroscopies and beyond. The ultrathin sheets are stable for days in vacuum, and we demonstrate their use at free-electron laser and synchrotron light sources.

Results

Acquisition schemes

The basic idea of molecular-beam 2D spectroscopy is not to attempt measuring the coherently emitted nonlinear signal within a four-wave-mixing geometry because, at the very low particle densities of a molecular beam, this signal would be much too weak to be useful. Instead, we take up the concept of action-based detection and measure the photogenerated ions as a function of the time delays and relative phases of an excitation pulse sequence. This approach has the advantage of providing both single-particle detection efficiency and fully coherent spectroscopic information despite the employment of an incoherent observable. Additionally, one obtains 2D spectra not only for the parent molecule but simultaneously for all fragments arising after a photochemical reaction.

Specifically, the measurement scheme (Fig. 1) comprises an ultraviolet (UV) pulse with a center wavelength of 267 nm and a visible pulse with a wavelength of 540 nm that are collinearly combined and focused into the interaction region of a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The visible pulse can be shaped into a collinear four-pulse sequence utilizing a pulse shaper in the beam path, enabling different experimental configurations: coherent 2D spectroscopy using only the visible four-pulse sequence (Fig. 1a), transient 2D spectroscopy combining the UV pulse and the visible probe sequence (Fig. 1b), and conventional pump–probe spectroscopy using a single UV and a single visible pulse (Fig. 1c). The ion yield of each cation in the resulting mass spectrum (Fig. 1d) serves as a reporter of the final-state population after photoexcitation of the gaseous molecules and is recorded as a function of the respective time delays and, in the case of a four-pulse sequence, of the relative phases between the visible pulses (Fig. 1e). The dependence of the ion yield on the relative phases is employed in a 27-step phase-cycling scheme to disentangle different nonlinear signal contributions, such as rephasing (photon-echo) and nonrephasing, to the overall signal during data analysis (see Methods section). 2D spectra are obtained for all types of third-order signal contributions simultaneously from the same raw data set after 2D Fourier transformation, typically with respect to the time delays τ and t.

### Phase transitions in natural C-O-H-N-S fluid inclusions-implications for gas mixtures and the behavior of solid HS at low temperatures [^400c0658]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Spectral features of complex gas mixtures

Systematic shifts of Raman peak positions are observed for all inclusion gas species during the measurements. They are most pronounced for H 2 S and CH 4 due to their high concentrations in the studied gas-rich inclusions (Figs. 5 and 6). Experimental studies have shown that changes in pressure, temperature and density of a single gas component as well as CH 4 –CO 2 gas mixtures have an influence on the Raman peak positions –. Modifications of gas peak positions in H 2 S-bearing ternary, as well as any more complex gas mixtures, have not been studied so far.

Our results show that the Raman band positions are shifted to higher wavenumbers for more volatile components and to lower wavenumbers for less volatile components, relative to the original peak positions of the gas mixture at room temperature (Fig. 5). This tendency is also marked by systematic trends in diagrams illustrating H 2 S and CH 4 band positions (cm − 1) versus temperature (Fig. 9 and Source Data). It is observed that the FWHM (full width at half maximum) of the peaks of gaseous, liquid, and solid CH 4 phases, which exsolved from the CH 4 -H 2 S-CO 2 -N 2 gas mixture, consistently decrease with decreasing temperatures (Fig. 5). The above-mentioned features reflect well differential partitioning between the co-existing phases in an individual inclusion upon cooling, which is the strongest at the lowest recorded temperatures of about −190 °C (Fig. 9). The observations also reveal that gases of the highest volatility, i.e. N 2 and CH 4, partition into the inner vapor phase, whereas CO 2 and H 2 S partition into the outer liquid phases. Similar distribution of gaseous components between the phases has been described for binary gas mixtures. Our study shows that the composition of the gas mixture affects the wavenumbers of its gas components, e.g. CH 4 peak measured in the gas mixture at room temperature is positioned at 2911 cm − 1, whereas at −190 °C it shifts to 2917 cm − 1 (Fig. 9), which is the wavenumber typical of pure CH 4 gas. The band position downshifts can also be indirectly related to the density difference between gas, liquid, and solid physical states of the inclusion components, i.e. solid H 2 S or CH 4 show shifts to the lowest wavenumbers: 2522 and 2904 cm − 1, respectively (Fig. 9).

### Nanosecond X-ray diffraction of shock-compressed superionic water ice [^9f3b66af]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

Since Bridgman's discovery of five solid water (H 2 O) ice phases 1 in 1912, studies on the extraordinary polymorphism of H 2 O have documented more than seventeen crystalline and several amorphous ice structures 2,3 , as well as rich metastability and kinetic effects 4,5 . This unique behaviour is due in part to the geometrical frustration of the weak intermolecular hydrogen bonds and the sizeable quantum motion of the light hydrogen ions (protons). Particularly intriguing is the prediction that H 2 O becomes superionic 6-12 -with liquid-like protons diffusing through the solid lattice of oxygen-when subjected to extreme pressures exceeding 100 gigapascals and high temperatures above 2,000 kelvin. Numerical simulations suggest that the characteristic diffusion of the protons through the empty sites of the oxygen solid lattice (1) gives rise to a surprisingly high ionic conductivity above 100 Siemens per centimetre, that is, almost as high as typical metallic (electronic) conductivity, (2) greatly increases the ice melting temperature 7-13 to several thousand kelvin, and (3) favours new ice structures with a close-packed oxygen lattice 13-15 . Because confining such hot and dense H 2 O in the laboratory is extremely challenging, experimental data are scarce. Recent optical measurements along the Hugoniot curve (locus of shock states) of water ice VII showed evidence of superionic conduction and thermodynamic signatures for melting 16 , but did not confirm the microscopic structure of superionic ice. Here we use laser-driven shockwaves to simultaneously compress and heat liquid water samples to 100-400 gigapascals and 2,000-3,000 kelvin. In situ X-ray diffraction measurements show that under these conditions, water solidifies within a few nanoseconds into nanometre-sized ice grains that exhibit unambiguous evidence for the crystalline oxygen lattice of superionic water ice. The X-ray diffraction data also allow us to document the compressibility of ice at these extreme conditions and a temperature- and pressure-induced phase transformation from a body-centred-cubic ice phase (probably ice X) to a novel face-centred-cubic, superionic ice phase, which we name ice XVIII 2,17 .
