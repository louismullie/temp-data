## Question

What is the diagnosis when a patient's pregnancy test was initially positive but is now negative?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the diagnosis when a pregnancy test was initially positive but is now negative. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact test types and timing for both results. Then, I should verify the patient's symptoms and pretest probability for early loss versus ectopic pregnancy. Next, I will review the key differentials and what data definitively separate them. Finally, I will outline a safe plan using serial quantitative β-hCG, targeted ultrasound, and assay troubleshooting, while emphasizing pitfalls like heterophile antibodies and the hook effect.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because interpretation hinges on it; I need to check which tests were used for the "positive" and the "negative" result (home urine, qualitative serum, or quantitative serum β-hCG), how many days elapsed between them, whether the patient has pain or bleeding, and whether the initial positive was very early after a missed period, as very early positives often represent biochemical pregnancies that resolve quickly [^111VneQh] [^112HNY4h].

> Now, I will formulate a prioritized differential, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; the most likely explanation is early biochemical pregnancy loss with a transient positive followed by a negative, yet I must also consider a false-positive initial serum from heterophile antibody interference, a resolving ectopic pregnancy, a false-negative second test from a hook effect, and plain laboratory or sampling error, each of which has distinct clues and risks that I should verify systematically [^111VneQh] [^111Uqy19] [^113MMHeZ] [^117LAAnf].

> Next, I should review what serial quantitative β-hCG can and cannot tell me; over 48–72 hours, a viable intrauterine pregnancy typically shows a substantial rise, whereas a falling value or a suboptimal rise argues for a nonviable intrauterine pregnancy or ectopic, but wait, I need to ensure I do not use β-hCG dynamics alone to assign location without imaging or clinical context [^1143nGXz].

> I will now examine serum–urine concordance to exclude assay interference; if serum is positive while urine is negative at the same time, I should suspect heterophile interference, then confirm by repeating on a different assay platform and by using heterophile-blocking reagents, because otherwise patients risk unnecessary procedures or methotrexate based on spurious values, and I should double-check that the discordance resolves with these steps [^111Uqy19] [^112Gv5Bw] [^115mNjtN].

> Next, I should review transvaginal ultrasound strategy; once the discriminatory zone is reached, an intrauterine gestational sac should be visualized, and if not, pregnancy of unknown location protocols combining serial β-hCG and repeat ultrasound are indicated, but wait, I should verify that I do not over-rely on any point-of-care quantitative test with limited sensitivity as a substitute for lab serum β-hCG in PUL management [^116uyMXM] [^113RL99M].

> Hold on, I should verify the possibility of a false-negative second test from the hook effect; in the setting of very high hCG or variant hCG forms, some urine point-of-care assays can read negative, so I need to check for this by performing a 1:10 urine dilution or sending serum, and I should keep molar pregnancy and advanced ectopic in mind if symptoms and ultrasound suggest trophoblastic overgrowth despite a negative urine test [^117LAAnf] [^1178AV8V].

> Let me interpret likely scenarios carefully; a rapid decline of quantitative β-hCG to nonpregnant levels with concordant negative urine and an empty uterus favors a biochemical loss, while a plateau or suboptimal rise with indeterminate ultrasound keeps ectopic in the differential and warrants continued surveillance or methotrexate per guideline, and serum-positive with urine-negative suggests heterophile interference rather than true gestation, but wait, even a negative urine test does not absolutely exclude ectopic, so I must maintain vigilance if symptoms or risks are present [^111VneQh] [^113MMHeZ] [^115iRgDd].

> I need to ensure safe management; for suspected biochemical loss, expectant follow-up to a β-hCG of zero is appropriate, for pregnancy of unknown location with concerning trends or symptoms I should continue serial β-hCG with repeat ultrasound and consider methotrexate per ACOG protocols, and I must not use β-hCG values alone to diagnose a normal intrauterine pregnancy given overlap with nonviable and ectopic gestations, so I should confirm with imaging and clinical correlation [^113MMHeZ] [^116uyMXM] [^112uiwwp].

> Let me reconsider potential pitfalls so I do not miss them; sample mislabeling or degradation, variable sensitivity or timing of urine tests, and reliance on inadequately sensitive point-of-care quantitative devices can all mislead, so I should confirm key results with laboratory-based assays and repeat testing when the clinical picture and the numbers diverge [^113RL99M] [^114zkLvw].

> Finally, I should confirm how I communicate results; I need to distinguish screening from diagnostic testing and explain uncertainty to avoid false reassurance or undue alarm, and although this is a different domain, evidence shows that labeling results as "positive" or "negative" without context can distort risk perception, so clear, numeric, and pathway-oriented counseling is prudent while we complete serial testing [^11513NCy].

The most likely diagnosis for a patient who initially had a positive pregnancy test but now has a negative result is **early pregnancy loss (biochemical pregnancy)** [^111VneQh], defined as a very early miscarriage before 5 weeks' gestation, often detected only by transient hCG rise [^1143nGXz]. Alternative explanations include **false-positive initial test** (e.g. assay interference, heterophilic antibodies) [^111Uqy19] [^112Gv5Bw], **false-negative follow-up test** (e.g. hook effect [^117LAAnf], dilute urine) [^114zkLvw], or **resolved ectopic pregnancy** [^113MMHeZ]. Confirm the diagnosis with serial quantitative serum hCG [^1143nGXz] and transvaginal ultrasound [^116uyMXM] if indicated; if hCG falls to zero without ultrasound evidence of pregnancy, biochemical pregnancy is confirmed [^112uiwwp].

---

## Differential diagnosis

### Early pregnancy loss (biochemical pregnancy)

- **Definition**: Spontaneous loss before 13 weeks, often before 5 weeks, detected only by transient hCG rise [^111VneQh] [^112uiwwp].
- **Pathophysiology**: Chromosomal abnormalities are the most common cause [^111VneQh].
- **Clinical course**: Initial positive test followed by rapid hCG decline and negative test within days to a week [^1143nGXz].

---

### False-positive initial pregnancy test

- **Assay interference**: Heterophilic antibodies or nonactive hCG forms can cause false positives [^111Uqy19] [^112Gv5Bw].
- **Medications**: Promethazine [^111YnCd9] and others may cause false positives.
- **Laboratory error**: Rare but possible.

---

### False-negative follow-up pregnancy test

- **Hook effect**: Very high hCG can cause false negatives [^114zkLvw] [^117LAAnf] [^1178AV8V].
- **Dilute urine**: Excess fluid intake or diuretics can lower hCG below detection [^114zkLvw].
- **Improper testing**: User error or expired tests [^114zkLvw].

---

### Resolved ectopic pregnancy

An ectopic pregnancy that **resolves spontaneously**, characterized by an initial positive test with a subsequent negative result as hCG declines [^113MMHeZ] [^1143nGXz]. Clinical course: The test becomes negative as **hCG falls**.

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

### Step 1: confirm initial positive result

Review documentation to verify the **initial positive result** and method used, and repeat testing with a **quantitative serum hCG** [^1143nGXz] to confirm current status.

---

### Step 2: serial quantitative serum hCG measurements

Serial hCG should be measured **every 48 hours** [^1143nGXz] to assess the trend. Falling hCG to zero supports **biochemical pregnancy**; rising or plateauing hCG suggests **ectopic** or persistent trophoblastic tissue [^116uyMXM] [^114xv27n].

---

### Step 3: transvaginal ultrasound

If hCG is **rising or plateauing**, perform transvaginal ultrasound [^116uyMXM] to localize the pregnancy. No intrauterine pregnancy with rising hCG suggests **ectopic pregnancy** [^113MMHeZ].

---

### Step 4: evaluate for assay interference

Consider **Heterophilic antibodies** [^111Uqy19] if the initial positive was serum-based; use heterophile blocking agents or alternative assays [^112Gv5Bw]. Repeat testing with a **different assay or laboratory** to confirm results.

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Early pregnancy loss (biochemical pregnancy)**: Provide **reassurance**, as most women have successful future pregnancies. No intervention is needed if **hCG returns to zero** and there are no retained products [^111VneQh].

- **False-positive initial test**: Explain **assay interference** or error; no pregnancy occurred. No further action is needed if the **negative result is confirmed** [^111Uqy19].

- **False-negative follow-up test**: Confirm with **serum hCG and ultrasound** if indicated. Explain the limitations of urine tests and the importance of **confirmatory testing** [^114zkLvw].

- **Resolved ectopic pregnancy**: Ensure **hCG returns to zero** and monitor symptoms [^113MMHeZ]. Discuss future pregnancy planning and the need for **early monitoring**.

---

The most likely diagnosis for a patient with an initial positive pregnancy test followed by a negative result is **early pregnancy loss (biochemical pregnancy)**. Alternative explanations include a false-positive initial test, a false-negative follow-up test, or a resolved ectopic pregnancy. Confirm the diagnosis with serial quantitative serum hCG and transvaginal ultrasound when indicated [^1143nGXz] [^116uyMXM].

### What serial hCG can tell you, and cannot tell you, about an early pregnancy [^1143nGXz]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

The serial measurement of serum hCG concentrations is an important clinical tool used to differentiate normal from abnormal pregnancies. At hCG values below which ultrasonography can be diagnostic, the comparison of a patient's hCG dynamics to those of established expected curves of rise or fall can aid the clinician in determining when to follow expectantly and when to intervene. Still, this method has some limitations and should never supersede clinical judgment based on symptoms or signs.

### False-negative urine human chorionic gonadotropin testing in the clinical laboratory [^114zkLvw]. Laboratory Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) assays are used to detect pregnancy, and urine point-of-care tests are frequently used to triage patients. Under certain conditions, urine tests can fail to detect pregnancy, which can have serious consequences for patient management.

- **Objectives**: To understand the prevalence of different factors contributing to false-negative urinary hCG testing results at our institution.

- **Methods**: Clinical data for patients with negative urine hCG results and subsequent positive or equivocal serum hCG results within a 1-year period were reviewed.

- **Results**: Out of 9447 negative urine hCG results, 11 potential missed diagnoses were identified, with early gestational age as the most common factor, followed by β-core hook effects.

- **Conclusions**: Although false-negative urine hCG test results are rare, understanding the commonly encountered reasons for inaccurate testing results can help clinical centers develop strategies to minimize risk for patients.

### False-positive serum human chorionic gonadotropin results: Causes, characteristics, and recognition [^111Uqy19]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

False-positive serum human chorionic gonadotropin results are estimated to occur in 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 10,000 tests. Most of these false-positive results are due to interference by non-human chorionic gonadotropin substances, especially human luteinizing hormone and anti-animal immunoglobulin antibodies, as well as the detection of pituitary human chorionic gonadotropin.

- **Characteristics**: These false-positive human chorionic gonadotropin measurements are characterized by serum levels that are generally less than 1000 mIU/mL, the absence of human chorionic gonadotropin in the urine, nonparallelism of the human chorionic gonadotropin levels in serial dilutions of the serum with the human chorionic gonadotropin standard, results that are not consistent with the clinical or operative findings, the absence of a substantial change in the serum levels over time or after therapy, and the finding of a negative result when an alternative type of human chorionic gonadotropin assay is used.

An algorithm is presented to aid in the recognition of false-positive human chorionic gonadotropin results in patients.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 200: Early pregnancy loss [^111VneQh]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on early pregnancy loss:

- **Definition**: Early pregnancy loss is defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 13 weeks of gestation.

- **Pathophysiology**: The majority of early pregnancy losses are due to chromosomal abnormalities, found in approximately 50–82% of cases. The most common are autosomal trisomies, particularly trisomy 15, 16, 21, and 22, along with triploidy, monosomy X, and structural rearrangements. These losses typically occur between 5 and 9 weeks of gestation. Immunologic factors, such as impaired regulatory T cell function or abnormal endometrial decidualization, can disrupt maternal tolerance of the fetus and contribute to early pregnancy loss. Infections including CMV, HIV, rubella, and malaria have also been implicated through direct placental infection, immune-mediated disruption, or maternal systemic illness.

- **Epidemiology**: Early pregnancy loss occurs in approximately 10–20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, with about 80% of losses taking place during the first trimester. The true incidence is likely underestimated, as many early miscarriages are not clinically diagnosed and may be misattributed to delayed or heavy menstrual bleeding.

- **Risk factors**: Advanced maternal age is a major nonmodifiable risk factor for early pregnancy loss, with risk increasing significantly after age 35 and reaching over 50% by age 45. Other maternal factors include a prior history of early pregnancy loss, adverse outcomes in previous pregnancies (such as preterm birth or stillbirth), and Black ethnicity.

### "False positive" urine pregnancy test results after successful medication abortion [^1169S6pD]. Contraception (2021). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the proportion of high-sensitivity urine pregnancy test (HSPT) results that were positive over time following a successful medication abortion.

- **Study design**: We used data from an ongoing study that provides mifepristone and misoprostol for medication abortion through direct-to-patient telemedicine and mail. Providers evaluated abortion outcomes based on patient interviews and clinical tests, according to clinical judgment and participant preference. We identified all participants enrolled from July 2016 to September 2020 who had an HSPT result and no indication of viable pregnancy after treatment. Logistic regression was employed to examine the association between the timing of the initial post-treatment HSPT, gestational age, and the proportion of positive HSPT results.

- **Results**: Of the 472 participants in our analysis, 88 (19%) had positive initial HSPTs. The proportions of positive results at ≤ 20 days, 21 to 27 days, 28 to 34 days, and ≥ 35 days after mifepristone ingestion were 14 of 29 (48%), 15 of 58 (26%), 49 of 258 (19%), and 10 of 127 (8%), respectively (p < 0.001). Gestational age at mifepristone ingestion was not significantly related to positive HSPT results (p = 0.28). Multivariable logistic regression confirmed both findings and did not identify a statistically significant interaction between these variables. In the 67 participants who relied solely on further HSPTs to confirm abortion outcomes, the median interval between the initial positive test and the first negative test was 14 days.

- **Conclusions**: The proportion of participants with positive HSPTs declined over time.

### Prenatal screening for Down syndrome: The problem of recurrent false-positives [^113xBVMv]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2004). Low credibility.

It has been reported that in prenatal screening programs for Down syndrome, women who have false-positive results in one pregnancy have an increased risk of a false-positive result in a subsequent pregnancy. We examined the effect of this in the screening program conducted at the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine with a view to determining the magnitude of the effect and describing a method to avoid the problem.

- **Methods**: Six thousand four hundred and forty-eight women were identified who had two singleton pregnancies without Down syndrome in the screening program based at the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine. Both pregnancies were screened using a Quadruple test, which includes maternal age with alphafetoprotein (AFP), unconjugated oestriol (uE3), total or free beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), and either free alpha-hCG or inhibin-A as the fourth serum marker.

- **Results**: Among women who had a false-positive result in their initial pregnancy, the false-positive rate in the subsequent pregnancy was high: 20% (46/229), about three times higher than both the overall observed false-positive rate (6.6%) and the expected false-positive rate in subsequent pregnancies that were false-positive in their initial pregnancy (7.5%) (p < 0.001). This arises because serum marker levels in one pregnancy are associated with the levels in a subsequent pregnancy. Using the slope, or regression coefficient (b), of each marker level in a subsequent pregnancy regressed on the value in the first pregnancy, it is possible to adjust all marker values.

### Accuracy of a point-of-care test for quantifying human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) in the management of pregnancy of unknown location in an abortion service [^113RL99M]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2019). Low credibility.

Women may seek abortion at gestations when there is no visible intrauterine pregnancy on ultrasound scanning. Clinical protocols for pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) require measurement of serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommending that values above 1500 IU/L be further investigated to exclude ectopic pregnancy. Our aim was to determine whether a point-of-care test (POCT) could be used instead of laboratory serum hCG measurement.

- **Methods**: Over 12 months, women who presented to an abortion service with a PUL had a POCT for blood or urine hCG and laboratory serum hCG measurement. The POCT machine used provides a discrete hCG value below 1000 IU/L and above this gives results as a range. The sensitivity and specificity of the POCT in identifying cases where laboratory serum hCG results were above 1500 IU/L were calculated.

- **Results**: A total of 118 women presented with a PUL, of whom 70 had a POCT on blood (n = 49) or urine (n = 21) and a corresponding laboratory serum hCG. The sensitivity of the blood POCT was 0.67 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.87) and the specificity was 0.97 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.99). The sensitivity of the urine POCT was 0.25 (CI 0.01 to 0.78) and the specificity was 0.94 (CI 0.69 to 0.99).

- **Conclusion**: Although both the blood and urine POCTs had a high level of specificity, neither test was acceptably sensitive. While promising, this POCT for hCG is not sufficiently reliable to replace laboratory serum hCG testing in the management of women with PUL in an abortion service.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: executive summary [^115NU7im]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for preeclampsia, specifically with respect to laboratory testing, the SOGC 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining the following laboratory tests in early pregnancy for patients with preexisting hypertension:

- **Serum creatinine**: Measure to assess kidney function and detect any dysfunction early.
- **Serum potassium**: Important for evaluating electrolyte balance and cardiovascular health.
- **Fasting blood glucose**: This helps in identifying preexisting or developing gestational diabetes.
- **Urinalysis**: Required to detect proteinuria or other abnormalities that may indicate worsening preeclampsia.

### Self-testing for pregnancy among women at risk: A randomized controlled trial [^113KgkSX]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2009). High credibility.

The timing of pregnancy recognition affects early pregnancy and the timing of prenatal care. Little research has been done on how to make women at risk more alert to the possibility of pregnancy.

- **Design**: The study was an RCT performed and analyzed between 2006 and 2007.

- **Setting/Participants**: Participants were low-income, adult women who were having unprotected intercourse and were not actively trying to conceive.

- **Intervention**: Women in the intervention group received a free home-pregnancy test kit and were able to order more kits as needed. Six-month follow-up information was obtained.

- **Main outcome measures**: The main outcome measures were suspicion and testing for pregnancy.

- **Results**: Ninety-one percent of the 198 participants completed the study. Women in the intervention group suspected pregnancy 2.3 times during the 6-month period compared to 1.2 times for women in the control group (p < 0.0001). Women in the intervention group tested for pregnancy 93% of the time when they suspected pregnancy, while women in the control group tested for pregnancy only 64% of the time when they suspected pregnancy (p < 0.0001).

- **Conclusions**: Women who were having unprotected intercourse were more likely to suspect and test for pregnancy if they were supplied with a free home-pregnancy test kit.

### Principles of screening [^116Cvfd4]. Seminars in Perinatology (2005). Low credibility.

Screening and diagnostic testing are sequentially oriented procedures used for progressively analyzing risk. Screening is broadly based and aims to identify those at high risk of a disease or condition. In contrast, diagnostic testing is designed to more definitively determine whether a person has a disease or condition. Understanding the differences among four key measures of evaluation for tests — sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value — is necessary for the proper utilization of screening tests.

### Does labeling prenatal screening test results as negative or positive affect a woman's responses [^11513NCy]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

We tested whether adding interpretive labels (e.g. "negative test") to prenatal genetic screening test results changes perceived risk and preferences for amniocentesis.

Women (N = 1688) completed a hypothetical pregnancy scenario on the Internet. Participants were randomly assigned into two groups: a high risk of fetal chromosomal problems (12.5/1000) or a low risk (2/1000). After prenatal screening, the estimated risk was identical (5/1000) for all participants, but results were provided either alone or with interpretive labels.

- **Study findings**: When receiving test results without labels, all participants reacted similarly. With labels, participants who received "positive" or "abnormal" results reported a higher perceived risk [P < .001], greater worry [P < .001], and greater interest in amniocentesis (57% vs. 37%; P < .001) than participants who received "negative" or "normal" results.

Interpretive labels for test results can induce larger changes to a woman's risk perception and behavioral intention than numeric results alone, which create decision momentum. This finding has broad clinical implications for patient-provider communication.

### The complex interpretation and management of Zika virus test results [^112qjw2o]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Zika virus disease provides the latest example of a critical nexus between public health and clinical practice. Interpreting Zika virus test results is complicated by the absence of a single testing approach with superior validity across contexts and populations. Molecular tests are highly specific, variably sensitive, and have a short window period. Serologic tests identify antibodies against Zika virus and are more likely than molecular tests to cross-react with other related viruses, reducing specificity.

- **Testing approach**: The type of test performed and timing relative to possible Zika virus exposure depend on public health guidance, testing algorithms, test availability, and capacity. Guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health departments has changed throughout the course of the US epidemic based on prevalence, geography, and clinical concerns.

- **Pretest probability considerations**: Women with a low pretest probability of infection should be counseled against testing. Women with a high pretest probability of Zika virus infection should still receive enhanced prenatal monitoring and newborn evaluation, regardless of the test result.

Appropriate interpretation of results depends on what tests are used, patient characteristics, and reasons for testing. Clinicians should take these factors into account in shared decision-making discussions with pregnant women about Zika virus testing.

### Pomalyst [^115YF6EY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Females and males of reproductive potential should be aware that Pomalyst can cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. It is imperative to verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Pomalyst therapy and during therapy. Females of reproductive potential are advised to avoid pregnancy 4 weeks before starting therapy, while taking Pomalyst, during any dose interruptions, and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy.

Two negative pregnancy tests are required for females of reproductive potential before initiating Pomalyst. The first test should be performed within 10–14 days, followed by a second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing Pomalyst. During the treatment and any dose interruptions, pregnancy testing should occur weekly during the first 4 weeks of use. Pregnancy testing should then be conducted every 4 weeks for females with regular menstrual cycles. If menstrual cycles are irregular, testing should occur every 2 weeks. If a patient misses her period or experiences any abnormality in menstrual bleeding, pregnancy testing and counseling are necessary, and Pomalyst treatment must be discontinued during this evaluation.

- **Contraception for females**: Females of reproductive potential must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use 2 methods of reliable birth control simultaneously. One must be a highly effective form of contraception, such as tubal ligation, IUD, or hormonal methods (e.g. birth control pills, injections, hormonal patches, vaginal rings).

The 2016 guidelines from the American Thyroid Association recommend that for women with Graves' disease who are planning a pregnancy, a pregnancy test should be obtained within 48 hours before administering radioactive iodine therapy. It is crucial to confirm a negative pregnancy test result before proceeding with the radioactive iodine treatment.

### Empty follicle syndrome — does repeat administration of hCG really work [^112Tff8S]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

In this retrospective case series with historic control subjects, repeat administration of hCG after failure to retrieve oocytes from the first ovary in the setting of unexpectedly low serum hCG levels resulted in unsuccessful IVF outcomes. This represents the largest case series at the time of writing regarding repeat administration of hCG in so-called "false" empty follicle syndrome cycles and indicates that patients should be counseled regarding the low likelihood of cycle success after repeat administration of hCG in this setting.

### Amnesteem [^116Jh584]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients who can become pregnant must have had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial Amnesteem prescription. The first test, a screening test, is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue qualification of the patient for Amnesteem. The second pregnancy test, a confirmation test, must be done in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days. For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test must be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of Amnesteem therapy and after the patient has used two forms of contraception for one month. For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of Amnesteem therapy and after the patient has used two forms of contraception for one month. Each month of therapy, patients must have a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test. A pregnancy test must be repeated each month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, prior to the patient who can become pregnant receiving each prescription.

- **Lipids**: Pretreatment and follow-up blood lipids should be obtained under fasting conditions. After the consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before these determinations are made. It is recommended that these tests be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the lipid response to Amneste

### Reproductive factors and subsequent pregnancy outcomes in patients with prior pregnancy loss [^117SqFKB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

At present, individualized interventions can be given to patients with a clear etiology of pregnancy loss to improve subsequent pregnancy outcomes, but the reproductive status of the patient cannot be changed. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between female reproductive status and subsequent pregnancy outcome in patients with prior pregnancy loss (PL).

- **Methods**: A prospective, dynamic population cohort study was carried out at the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University. From September 2019 to February 2022, a total of 1955 women with at least one previous PL were enrolled. Maternal reproductive status and subsequent reproductive outcomes were recorded through an electronic medical record system and follow-up. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between reproductive status and the risk of subsequent reproductive outcomes.

- **Results**: Among all patients, the rates of subsequent infertility, early PL, late PL, and live birth were 20.82%, 24.33%, 1.69%, and 50.77%, respectively. In logistic regression, we found that age (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04–1.13) and previous cesarean delivery history (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.27–4.76) were risk factors for subsequent infertility in patients with PL. Age (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03–1.10), age at first pregnancy (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03–1.10), BMI (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02–1.11), previous PL numbers (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.04–1.57), and lack of pre-pregnancy intervention (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.35–2.24) were risk factors for non-live birth. Age (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03–1.09), age at first pregnancy (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03–1.10), BMI, and previous PL statistics continue to affect outcomes.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for opioid use disorder, specifically with respect to initial laboratory testing, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend testing female patients of childbearing potential for pregnancy. They also suggest questioning all females of childbearing potential regarding methods of contraception.

### Acitretin [^1127A5dc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Understanding pregnancy and acitretin**:
	- Unless I have had a hysterectomy or my prescriber confirms that I have completely gone through menopause, I must have two negative pregnancy test results before I can get a prescription to start acitretin capsules. If the second pregnancy test is negative, I must begin taking my acitretin capsules within seven days of the specimen collection. I will then undergo pregnancy tests monthly during therapy with acitretin capsules, as instructed by my prescriber. Additionally, for at least three years after stopping acitretin capsules, I will have a pregnancy test every three months.

- **Starting acitretin**:
	- I understand that I should not begin taking acitretin capsules until I am certain I am not pregnant and have received negative results from two pregnancy tests.

- **Emergency contraception information**:
	- I have received information on emergency contraception (birth control), including details on its availability over-the-counter.

- **Contraception counseling**:
	- During therapy with acitretin capsules on a monthly basis, and every three months for at least three years after ceasing acitretin capsules, I should receive counseling from my prescriber about contraception and behaviors associated with an increased risk of pregnancy.

### Improving global estimates of syphilis in pregnancy by diagnostic test type: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114fyBdF]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2015). Low credibility.

"Probable active syphilis" is defined as seroreactivity in both non-treponemal and treponemal tests. A correction factor of 65%, namely the proportion of pregnant women reactive in one syphilis test type that were likely reactive in the second, was applied to reported syphilis seropositivity data reported to WHO for global estimates of syphilis during pregnancy.

- **Objectives**: To identify more accurate correction factors based on the test type reported.

- **Search strategy**: A Medline search was conducted using the terms "Syphilis [Mesh] and Pregnancy [Mesh]", "Syphilis [Mesh] and Prenatal Diagnosis [Mesh]", and "Syphilis [Mesh] and Antenatal [Keyword]".

- **Selection criteria**: Eligible studies must have reported results for pregnant or puerperal women for both non-treponemal and treponemal serology.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We manually calculated the crude percent estimates of subjects with both reactive treponemal and reactive non-treponemal tests among subjects with reactive treponemal and among subjects with reactive non-treponemal tests. We summarized the percent estimates using random effects models.

- **Main results**: Countries reporting both reactive non-treponemal and reactive treponemal testing required no correction factor. Countries reporting non-treponemal testing or treponemal testing alone required a correction factor of 52.2% and 53.6%, respectively. Countries not reporting test type required a correction factor of 68.6%.

- **Conclusions**: Future estimates should adjust reported maternal syphilis seropositivity by test type to ensure accuracy.

### Accutane [^1159vaxe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Laboratory tests:

- **Pregnancy test**: Patients who can become pregnant must have had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial Accutane prescription. The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue qualification of the patient for Accutane. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) must be done in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days.

- For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test must be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of Accutane therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month.

- For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of Accutane therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month.

- Each month of therapy, patients must have a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test. A pregnancy test must be repeated each month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, prior to the patient who can become pregnant receiving each prescription.

### Pregnancy of unknown location: Evaluation and management [^116uyMXM]. Seminars in Perinatology (2019). Low credibility.

Early diagnosis of an extrauterine pregnancy is important for safe and effective management. However, the location of a pregnancy often cannot be easily determined with abnormal implantations or prior to 5–6 weeks' gestation. Multiple testing strategies exist to diagnose an abnormal pregnancy when the location is unknown, but caution is needed to avoid a false diagnosis. Medical treatment is optimal when an abnormal pregnancy is diagnosed early.

Since most of these pregnancies are intrauterine, additional testing to localize the pregnancy will allow the correct choice of therapy and avoid unnecessary exposure to toxic therapy. This testing strategy should be reserved for patients with significant concerns for ectopic pregnancy, based on either risk factors or clinical findings. Overuse of this approach can lead to the interruption of normal pregnancies.

### Coping with worry while waiting for diagnostic results: A qualitative study of the experiences of pregnant couples following a high-risk prenatal screening result [^111hSZLZ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Many couples described how they turned to home and everyday life as a meaningful counterbalance to their high-risk status, expressing a renewed and humble awareness of all the good things they already had in their lives: amazing children, fulfilling lifestyles, and loving relationships. Cristina, a 42-year-old mother of one, stated, "I tried to focus on my daughter and how blessed we are to have her".

Turning focus away from statistics and uncertainty towards the blessings of everyday life foregrounded everything that was not at risk and would persist beyond an abnormal test result. Choosing this perspective allowed the couples to create situated meaning and certainty in the midst of uncertainty, thus creating a positive counterbalance to worry.

Discussions about what to do in case of an abnormal test result were notably absent in the majority of the couples' accounts of waiting. When asked about this during interviews, they provided two main reasons:

- **Certainty about termination**: The majority of couples were certain that they would terminate the pregnancy in case of an abnormal result.

- **Postponing the decision**: Those who expressed uncertainty about termination preferred to postpone the final decision until the final result was available. This bracketing of the potential abnormal result allowed the couples to continue and hold on to a 'normal' pregnancy.

Many couples described how they consciously employed an 'innocent-till-proven-guilty' approach to deal with their worries about the fetus's health.

In summary, the couples coped with worry by using reassuring interpretations of the uncertain situation.

### The clinical utility of DNA-based screening for fetal aneuploidy by primary obstetrical care providers in the general pregnancy population [^113aUKoK]. Genetics in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The initial cfDNA test failure rate was 5.6% (150/2,681; 95% CI, 4.8 to 6.5%) and all were subject to active outcome ascertainment. For the 85 plasma samples subsequently submitted for cfDNA testing, 65 (76%) results were reported; all were screen-negative. An additional 63 women relied on reflexive serum/ultrasound results; 54 (86%) were screen-negative and 9 (14%) were screen-positive. Eight of these nine women delivered a normal infant (four also had a subsequent screen-negative cfDNA test). The ninth woman was diagnosed with a mosaic condition following a positive cfDNA test from another sequencing laboratory; a normal female infant was delivered. Figure 2 lists outcomes for the remaining pregnancies with test failures.

Our follow-up revealed that none of these 150 women chose invasive testing. To verify provider awareness that open neural tube defect screening is indicated despite normal cfDNA test results, records from 100 women consecutively screened in May 2015 (near the end of the study) were reviewed: 72% had serum alpha-fetoprotein screening for open neural tube defects, with no screen-positive results (≥ 2.0 MoM). It was not possible to determine whether the 28% of women who did not undergo open neural tube defect screening were not offered serum screening, declined serum screening, or underwent alternative testing such as a level II ultrasound.

### Vaccine effectiveness against mild and severe covid-19 in pregnant individuals and their infants in England: Test negative case-control study [^114DJpr5]. BMJ Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Our large study investigated the effectiveness of maternal covid-19 vaccines on both maternal and infant health. The test negative case-control design has been well validated and used for the evaluation of covid-19 vaccines. One of the key strengths of our study is that this approach helps in dealing with unmeasured confounders related to differences in health-seeking behaviors and infectious disease exposure between individuals who are vaccinated and those who are not vaccinated.

The study had several limitations. We found some apparent protection in the early period after vaccination before a true effect would be expected, as in our previous test negative case-control studies. We suspect that this effect is likely related to a combination of deferral of vaccination in individuals who knew they were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus because of a positive test result from a lateral flow test at home and a healthy vaccinee effect (i.e. those with early symptoms of covid-19 were more unwell than controls and consequently less likely to be vaccinated).

Our estimates of vaccine effectiveness were only for those pregnancies that resulted in a delivery (a live birth or stillbirth), and pregnancies resulting in miscarriage or termination at less than 24 weeks' gestation were not included. Our estimates were similar to other estimates of vaccine effectiveness in non-pregnant individuals and hence should also be generalizable to all pregnancies.

Coding errors in the electronic database of the Hospital Episode Statistics could result in misclassification.

### Falsely elevated human chorionic gonadotropin leading to unnecessary therapy [^115mNjtN]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Analysis of serum beta-hCG aids in the diagnosis and treatment of intrauterine pregnancies, ectopic gestations, and gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Beta-hCG concentrations are specific for trophoblastic tissue and are thus rarely questioned.

- **Cases**: An 18-year-old nullipara experienced bleeding and had a positive beta-hCG. Ultrasound showed no pregnancy. She passed tissue and stopped bleeding. Serum beta-hCG remained elevated despite uterine curettage and three courses of methotrexate. Results of urine beta-hCG were negative, as was the reference laboratory serum assay. A 31-year-old nullipara suffered a spontaneous abortion, but her serum beta-hCG remained elevated. Uterine curettage revealed secretory endometrium, yet serum beta-hCG levels persisted. Urine beta-hCG was negative, as was the reference laboratory serum assay.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with histories incongruent with serum beta-hCG findings should undergo urine beta-hCG analysis.

### Point: Universal screening for gestational diabetes mellitus [^112dj5je]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Universal screening with a GCT or universal testing with a GTT? If universal testing is preferred for the variety of very practical reasons outlined above, then there is another dimension to consider. The gold standard for the diagnosis of GDM is a GTT — irrespective of how it is performed and with all its known imperfections. In a similar vein to our determination that selective testing for case identification is unsatisfactory, should we also critically look at the GCT?

The GCT has a significant false-negative rate, is more likely to be positive in the afternoon, and the results can vary depending on the time since the last meal. Women who have a positive GCT must return on a second occasion, which is inconvenient and must inevitably result in a delay to the initiation of treatment. Does this delay compromise pregnancy outcomes? To our knowledge, this question has not specifically been addressed; however, Langer et al. reported poorer outcomes for women who are diagnosed late and effectively have inadequate treatment.

It has also been shown that up to 23% of women who screen positive on a GCT fail to attend their diagnostic GTT. Even in the Toronto Tri-Hospital Gestational Diabetes Project, where subjects were recruited with the explicit understanding that they would have a GTT following a GCT, 10% did not proceed with the GTT. Data on the subject of how many women fail to attend the diagnostic GTT or who have it late are inadequate, but clearly there will be women with possible GDM who are disadvantaged by this two-stage procedure.

### Adolescent girls with negative pregnancy tests [^111LXyyE]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

- **Study objectives and design**: This descriptive study assessed the background characteristics and attitudes about pregnancy held by adolescent girls presenting for pregnancy tests and receiving negative results. An additional aim was to determine types of health care services that would be of perceived benefit to them to reduce their risk of subsequent pregnancy.

- **Setting**: Two health care sites in an urban community included a hospital-based adolescent clinic and a hospital-based women's health care clinic.

- **Participants**: Sixty-five adolescent, low-income, single women with negative pregnancy test results in a consecutive sample were included in the study. Participants had a mean age of 16.9 (± 1.3) years and described themselves as 64.1% African American, 26.6% Latina, and 9.4% white, with 81.5% enrolled or recently graduated from high school.

- **Main outcome measures**: The following variables were included: demographic characteristics, reproductive health history, personal and perceived partner attitude about the negative pregnancy test result, perceived parental influences, and teens' suggestions for health care services to prevent unintended pregnancy.

- **Results**: Health history data revealed a high-risk status for unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STI). Among participants, 28.5% were ambivalent or disappointed with their negative result, while 71.4% were pleased. The majority felt that their partners would be more disappointed with the negative result than they were. Health care services that teens felt would be most helpful were one-on-one contraceptive counseling and education.

### Performance of a checklist to exclude pregnancy at the time of contraceptive initiation among women with a negative urine pregnancy test [^112nyFGe]. Contraception (2015). Low credibility.

Our objective was to measure the sensitivity and specificity of a six-item "pregnancy checklist" at excluding early- or luteal-phase pregnancy among women with a negative urine pregnancy test who were initiating contraception.

This was a secondary analysis of the Contraceptive CHOICE Project, a prospective cohort study of 9,256 women in the St. Louis region. Women who had a negative urine pregnancy test on the day of enrollment were included in this analysis. Women with a positive urine pregnancy test or without urine pregnancy testing were excluded. We identified all luteal-phase pregnancies that occurred among women with a negative urine pregnancy test. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value (NPV), and likelihood ratios of the pregnancy checklist for excluding luteal-phase pregnancies.

- **Results**: There were 6,929 women included in this analysis; 69% of these women met at least one checklist criterion to exclude pregnancy ("negative screen"). There were 36 luteal-phase pregnancies (0.5%) subsequently diagnosed among women with a negative urine pregnancy test. The sensitivity and specificity of the checklist were 77.7% and 69.1%, respectively. The NPV of the checklist was 99.8% and the positive predictive value was 1.3%.

Among women with a negative urine pregnancy test, the pregnancy checklist can be used to safely exclude more than 99% of early pregnancies at the time of contraceptive initiation.

### "Hook-like effect" causes false-negative point-of-care urine pregnancy testing in emergency patients [^117LAAnf]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Failure to detect pregnancy in the emergency department (ED) can have important consequences. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin (uhCG) point-of-care (POC) assays are valued for rapidly detecting early pregnancy with high sensitivity. However, under certain conditions, POC uhCG tests can fail to detect pregnancy.

- **Objectives**: In investigating a series of late first-trimester false-negative pregnancy tests in our ED, a novel and distinct causative phenomenon was recently elucidated in our institution. We discuss uhCG POC tests, review our false-negative rate, and describe mechanisms for false negatives and potential remedies.

- **Discussion**: The false-negative POC uhCG rate is very low, but in the setting of a large volume of tests, the numbers are worth consideration. In positive uhCG POC tests, free and fixed antibodies bind hCG to form a "sandwich"; hCG is present in several variant forms that change in their concentrations at different stages of pregnancy. When in excess, intact hCG can saturate the antibodies, preventing sandwich formation (hook effect phenomenon). Some assays may include an antibody that does not recognize certain variants present in later stages of pregnancy. When this variant is in excess, it can bind one antibody avidly and the other not at all, resulting in a false-negative test (hook-like phenomenon). In both situations, dilution is key to an accurate test.

- **Conclusions**: Manufacturers should consider that uhCG tests are routinely used at many stages of pregnancy. Characterizing uhCG variants recognized by their tests and eliminating lot-related errors is crucial for accuracy.

### High rates of persistent and recurrent chlamydia in pregnant women after treatment with azithromycin [^115NDHif]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2020). High credibility.

There are four explanations commonly cited for repeat positive chlamydia tests after treatment: (1) reinfection, (2) medication non-adherence, (3) false-positive NAAT result, and (4) treatment failure. Although we cannot distinguish among these possibilities given our retrospective design, we discuss the likelihood of each.

Because the prevalence of chlamydia in pregnancy in our cohort was 10% overall, and 9% of women with repeat testing had reinfection, we suspect that most cases of repeat positivity were caused by reinfection. This study and others emphasize the urgent need to improve access to expedited partner therapy (EPT) for sex partners of pregnant women with chlamydia. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has recommended partner therapy for pregnant women with chlamydia when sex partners are unable or unwilling to seek medical care since 2018. Conjoint patient-partner antibiotic therapy reduced reinfection in pregnancy in an observational cohort study by Mmeje et al, showing 0% recurrence in the intervention arm versus 18% in the standard referral arm. Alabama is one of only five states in the United States where EPT is "potentially allowable" instead of "permissible". This restriction may contribute to the high rates of repeat positive testing that we observed.

Medication non-adherence may have explained some of our study findings. Non-adherence to electronically prescribed medication is reported, but young women and pregnant women generally have higher rates of adherence, and single-dose oral azithromycin is a simple regimen. On chart review, some women experienced…

### Guideline no. 393-diabetes in pregnancy [^1161yXga]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2019). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, the SOGC 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining screening for diabetes in all pregnant individuals between 24–28 weeks of gestation. This should be done using a standardized non-fasting 50-g glucose challenge screening test with plasma glucose measured 1 hour later. Further testing is not required if the value is < 7.8 mmol/L. A 2-hour 75-g OGTT with fasting plasma glucose, 1-hour plasma glucose, and 2-hour plasma glucose should be obtained if the value of the glucose challenge screening is between 7.8–11.0 mmol/L.

### Accutane [^112TWjMT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test should be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after the patient has used two forms of contraception for one month.

For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive form that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after the patient has used two forms of contraception for one month.

The patient must have had a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test in a CLIA-certified laboratory before receiving each subsequent course of isotretinoin. A pregnancy test must be repeated every month in a CLIA-certified laboratory prior to the patient who can become pregnant receiving each prescription.

The patient has selected and committed to using two forms of effective contraception simultaneously, at least one of which must be a primary form, unless the patient commits to continuous abstinence, not having any sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy, or if the patient has undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or has been medically confirmed to be post-menopausal. Patients must use two forms of effective contraception for at least one month prior to the initiation of isotretinoin therapy, during isotretinoin therapy, and for one month after discontinuing isotretinoin therapy. Counseling about contraception and behaviors associated with an increased risk of pregnancy must be repeated on a monthly basis.

### Promethazine [^111YnCd9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Drug/laboratory test interactions**: The following laboratory tests may be affected in patients who are receiving therapy with promethazine hydrochloride:
	- **Pregnancy tests**: Diagnostic pregnancy tests based on immunological reactions between HCG and anti-HCG may result in false-negative or false-positive interpretations.
	- **Glucose tolerance test**: An increase in blood glucose has been reported in patients receiving promethazine hydrochloride.

- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility**: Long-term animal studies have not been performed to assess the carcinogenic potential of promethazine, nor are there other animal or human data concerning carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility with this drug. Promethazine was nonmutagenic in the Salmonella test system of Ames.

- **Pregnancy**:
	- **Teratogenic effects - Pregnancy Category C**: Teratogenic effects have not been demonstrated in rat-feeding studies at doses of 6.25 mg/kg and 12.5 mg/kg of promethazine hydrochloride. These doses are from approximately 2.1 to 4.2 times the maximum recommended total daily dose of promethazine for a 50-kg subject, depending upon the indication for which the drug is prescribed. Daily doses of 25 mg/kg intraperitoneally have been found to produce fetal mortality in rats. Specific studies to test the action of the drug on parturition, lactation, and development of the animal neonate were not done; however, a general preliminary study in rats indicated no effect on these parameters. Although antihistamines have been found to produce fetal mortality in rodents, the pharmacological effects of promethazine have not shown the same outcomes.

### Qualitative investigation of the factors that generate ambivalent feelings in women who give birth after receiving negative results from non-invasive prenatal testing [^113hTScK]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

Ambivalent feelings comprised five subcategories: "Options in the case of a positive result", "Guilt towards the child", "Criticisms on NIPT from others", "Denial of disabled people", and "How to tell the child".

Some respondents "stated their decision" with regard to the course of action in case of a positive NIPT result, whereas others expressed "difficulty stating their decision" regarding continuing or terminating their pregnancy. In both cases, respondents seemed agonized over their decision in the case of positive results.

"I had decided that if the results came out positive, I would not give birth to the baby. However, even though I now know that the results were negative, I haven't told my own parents that I took the test. At the same time that I feel negative about the idea that we were picking and choosing who to keep if the results were positive, I also blame myself for my lack of confidence in raising the child, even though it is because I have health problems myself".

- **Components of ambivalence**: Some women seemed to have a sense of "guilt towards the child" after giving birth and parenting the child, knowing that they were deciding the life of the child.

"I don't think I would have taken the test if I were younger. Some people criticize that people take the test too casually because it places very little stress on the mother or child. But I believe that anybody who chose to take the test did so after putting lots of thought into it".

### Improving global estimates of syphilis in pregnancy by diagnostic test type: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111NsZ6s]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2015). Low credibility.

"Probable active syphilis" is defined as seroreactivity in both non-treponemal and treponemal tests. A correction factor of 65%, namely the proportion of pregnant women reactive in one syphilis test type that were likely reactive in the second, was applied to syphilis seropositivity data reported to WHO for global estimates of syphilis during pregnancy.

- **Objectives**: To identify more accurate correction factors based on test type reported.

- **Search strategy**: Medline search using: "Syphilis [Mesh] and Pregnancy [Mesh]", "Syphilis [Mesh] and Prenatal Diagnosis [Mesh]", and "Syphilis [Mesh] and Antenatal [Keyword]".

- **Selection criteria**: Eligible studies must have reported results for pregnant or puerperal women for both non-treponemal and treponemal serology.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We manually calculated the crude percent estimates of subjects with both reactive treponemal and reactive non-treponemal tests among subjects with reactive treponemal and among subjects with reactive non-treponemal tests. We summarized the percent estimates using random effects models.

- **Main results**: Countries reporting both reactive non-treponemal and reactive treponemal testing required no correction factor. Countries reporting non-treponemal testing or treponemal testing alone required a correction factor of 52.2% and 53.6%, respectively. Countries not reporting test type required a correction factor of 68.6%.

- **Conclusions**: Future estimates should adjust reported maternal syphilis seropositivity by test type to ensure accuracy.

### Heterophile antibody blocking agent to confirm false positive serum human chorionic gonadotropin assay [^112Gv5Bw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Persistently false positive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test results in the absence of an intrauterine pregnancy may lead to a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy or gestational trophoblastic neoplasia and unnecessary testing and therapy.

- **Case**: A 38-year-old woman on oral contraceptives and a 53-year-old perimenopausal woman presented with persistently elevated serum beta-hCG levels from 30 to 225 mIU/mL. Both women had a history of working with mice. Urine hCG testing was negative. Serum beta-hCG levels for both patients were negative after pretreatment of their serum with a heterophile antibody blocking agent.

- **Conclusion**: These cases illustrate that serum heterophile antibodies can interfere with the hCG enzyme immunoassay and result in false positive values. The addition of a heterophile blocking agent to the serum can exclude false positives, thereby preventing unnecessary evaluation and treatment.

### Hemorrhagic shock from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy in a patient with a negative urine pregnancy test result [^115iRgDd]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Ectopic pregnancy has been increasing in frequency over the past two decades. The sudden rupture of a fallopian tube caused by ectopic pregnancy can lead to hemorrhagic shock and death if not diagnosed and treated in a timely fashion. The emergency physician is often the health professional called upon to diagnose and coordinate timely and effective intervention. The first step in diagnosing ectopic pregnancy is demonstrating pregnancy through a rapidly performed and sensitive qualitative urine test for the beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG). A negative urine pregnancy test result will generally be used to exclude ectopic pregnancy from further consideration.

This report discusses a patient presenting to an emergency department with hypovolemic shock, along with two negative urine beta-hCG analysis results and a quantitative serum beta-hCG level of 7 mIU/mL. This value is less than the lower limit of detection for the highly sensitive qualitative urine and serum tests. This case report demonstrates the importance of considering the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy even when faced with a negative urine pregnancy test result.

### SPL drug information for pomalidomide [^115fKyjQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Avoid the use of pomalidomide PO (also known as Pomalyst) in pregnant patients in all trimesters due to evidence of fetal harm in humans. Two negative pregnancy tests must be obtained before therapy initiation. The first test should be performed within 10 to 14 days and the second within 24 hours prior to therapy initiation, then weekly during the first 4 weeks. Thereafter, they should be conducted every 4 weeks in women with regular menstrual cycles or every 2 weeks in women with irregular menstrual cycles.

- **Females of reproductive potential**: Even with a history of infertility (unless due to hysterectomy), these patients must avoid pregnancy by abstaining from heterosexual sex or using two forms of contraception. This precaution should begin 4 weeks prior to therapy initiation, continue during therapy and dose interruptions, and be maintained for 4 weeks following therapy discontinuation. If pregnancy occurs, if a female patient misses her period, or if there is any abnormality in menstrual bleeding, therapy should be immediately discontinued and the patient referred to a physician specializing in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.

- **Male patients**: The drug is present in the semen of male patients; hence, they must not donate semen or sperm. Even following a successful vasectomy, male patients must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females during therapy and for 28 days after therapy completion.

Patients must not donate blood during therapy and for 1 month following therapy discontinuation to prevent their blood from being given to a pregnant female.

Regarding medical management of ectopic pregnancy, specifically in relation to methotrexate, the ACOG 2018 guidelines recommend selecting a methotrexate protocol based on the initial hCG level and discussing the benefits and risks of each approach with the patient. A single-dose protocol is preferred for patients with a relatively low initial hCG level or when there is a plateau in hCG values. The two-dose regimen should be considered as an alternative, particularly for patients with a high initial hCG value.

### Claravis [^115TnMfE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Pregnancy test

- Patients who can become pregnant must have two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial Claravis prescription. The first test, a screening test, is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue qualification of the patient for Claravis. The second pregnancy test, a confirmation test, must be done in a CLIA-certified laboratory, with an interval of at least 19 days between the two tests.

- For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test must be done during the first five days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of Claravis therapy and after the patient has used two forms of contraception for one month.

- For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or those using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of Claravis therapy, and after the patient has used two forms of contraception for one month.

- Each month of therapy, patients must have a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test. This test must be repeated each month in a CLIA-certified laboratory prior to a patient who can become pregnant receiving each prescription.

Lipids

Pretreatment and follow-up blood lipids should be obtained under fasting conditions. After the consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before these determinations are made. It is recommended that these tests be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the lipid response to Claravis is established.

### Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels and the likelihood of ectopic pregnancy in emergency department patients with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding [^114xv27n]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Strategies for diagnosing ectopic pregnancy that defer endovaginal ultrasound in women with suggestive symptoms and serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) levels less than 1500 mIU/mL ignore the increased risk of ectopic pregnancy in these patients.

- **Objective**: To quantify this increased risk by establishing and comparing the beta-hCG distributions of symptomatic women with ectopic pregnancies, abnormal intrauterine pregnancies, and normal intrauterine pregnancies.

- **Methods**: The authors reviewed the records of a cohort of women who visited an urban emergency department (ED) during a 34-month period with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding and non-zero quantitative beta-hCG levels. Explicit criteria were used to determine whether the pregnancy ultimately turned out to be intrauterine and normal, intrauterine and abnormal, or ectopic. Probability distributions were compared using frequency distributions, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and likelihood ratios.

- **Results**: Of 730 ED patients included in the analysis, 96 (13%) had ectopic pregnancies, 253 (35%) had abnormal intrauterine pregnancies, and 381 (52%) had normal intrauterine pregnancies. The beta-hCG distributions of patients with ectopic pregnancies and abnormal intrauterine pregnancies were similar and much lower than the beta-hCG distribution of patients with normal intrauterine pregnancies. A beta-hCG level less than 1500 mIU/mL more than doubled the odds of ectopic pregnancy (likelihood ratio = 2.24). Of the 158 patients with beta-hCG below 1500 mIU/mL, 40 (25%; 95% confidence.

### Science-based approach to harmonize contraception recommendations in clinical trials and pharmaceutical labels [^114bph2d]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). High credibility.

Pregnancy testing can enhance safety alongside contraception recommendations. The CTFG guideline suggests monthly pregnancy testing for high-risk categories. For the "middle" risk category, testing is recommended "at least at the end of relevant exposure", while the lowest risk category may not require pregnancy testing. These requirements apply during clinical trials whenever women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) are enrolled, ensuring prompt identification of pregnancy so appropriate actions can be taken. Pregnancy testing is not necessary for female subjects without reproductive potential.

The CTFG provides flexibility regarding pregnancy testing. For example, one pharmaceutical company approaches this as follows:

- **Pregnancy testing prior to treatment initiation**: Testing must occur within 7 days before administration or dispensing of the pharmaceutical, with results being negative before subject enrollment and pharmaceutical administration or dispensing. Depending on the study design, more than one test might be required before the first administration if there is more than a 7-day gap between enrollment and treatment or if pregnancy is suspected.

- **Pregnancy testing for short-duration studies**: For studies lasting 2 weeks or less, a test should be conducted immediately before study initiation and immediately after the last dose.

### Accuracy of single progesterone test to predict early pregnancy outcome in women with pain or bleeding: Meta-analysis of cohort studies [^112HNY4h]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain are the most common causes of consultation in early pregnancy; 30% of women will experience pain or bleeding in their first trimester. These symptoms lead to anxiety and can be the first signs of a possible miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy. Miscarriage occurs in 10–20% of all recognized pregnancies, and the prevalence of ectopic pregnancies in the United Kingdom is 1.6%, which increases to 3% in women with symptoms. Most women seeking medical advice have a transvaginal ultrasound scan to confirm a viable pregnancy, a miscarriage, or an ectopic pregnancy. However, even with expert use of transvaginal ultrasound, confirming if a pregnancy is intrauterine or extrauterine may not be possible in 8–31% of cases at the first visit. An observational study of pregnancies with inconclusive ultrasound results has shown that 50% spontaneously resolve (decreasing concentrations of β human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-hCG)), 27% are subsequently diagnosed as viable, and 14% are diagnosed as ectopic pregnancies. The high incidence of miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies in women with inconclusive ultrasound results warrants further tests to reach a diagnosis. Measurement of serum β-hCG can be useful, but often more than one β-hCG measurement is needed to make a diagnosis.

Serum progesterone has been proposed as a useful test to distinguish a viable pregnancy from a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. Low progesterone values are associated with miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies, both considered non-viable pregnancies, and high progesterone concentrations indicate a potentially viable pregnancy.

### Guideline no. 460: Diagnosis and management of intrauterine early pregnancy loss [^112uiwwp]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for early pregnancy loss, more specifically with respect to hCG, the SOGC 2025 guidelines recommend avoiding the use of β-hCG values alone to diagnose normal intrauterine pregnancy due to overlap with non-viable intrauterine pregnancy, viable intrauterine pregnancy, and ectopic pregnancy.

### Reconsidering the use of urine drug testing in reproductive settings [^116QG7Zy]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2023). Low credibility.

The urine drug test is ubiquitous within reproductive healthcare settings. Although the test can have evidence-based use for a patient and clinician, in practice, it is often applied in ways that are driven by bias and stigma, do not correctly inform decisions about clinical aspects of patient care, and cause devastating ripple effects through social and legal systems. This paper proposes a framework of guiding questions to prompt reflection on:

- **The question the clinical team is trying to answer**: Consider whether a urine drug test answers the question at hand.
- **Comparative analysis of benefits and risks**: Evaluate how testing benefits compare with the associated risks.
- **Alternative tools for decision-making**: Identify a more effective tool for clinical decision-making if the urine drug test does not meet the standards for use.
- **Impact of biases on decision-making**: Reflect on individual and institutional biases affecting decision-making.

We demonstrate the use of this framework using three common uses of the urine drug test within abortion care and labor and delivery settings.

### Outcomes of a negative rapid influenza diagnostic test in pregnant women [^1148vUek]. American Journal of Perinatology (2019). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the negative predictive value (NPV) of a rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) compared with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in pregnant women.

- **Study design**: Retrospective cohort study of pregnant women with a negative RIDT followed by confirmatory PCR for influenza A, H1N1, and B during the influenza seasons from 2012 to 2015.

- **Results**: The NPV of the RIDT was 85.4% (211 of 247), 93.5% (231 of 247), and 97.9% (242 of 247) for influenza A, H1N1, and B, respectively. Antiviral treatment was administered to 47.2% (17 of 36) of women with a false-negative RIDT for influenza A compared with 9.0% (19 of 211) of women with a true-negative RIDT (p < 0.001). Patients were more likely to receive antiviral treatment if they were feverish (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 6.05, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.83–20.03), had cough (aOR: 6.43, 95% CI: 1.06–39.26), dyspnea (aOR: 6.41, 95% CI: 1.63–25.29), or had a subsequently positive PCR (aOR: 9.41, 95% CI: 3.13–28.31).

- **Conclusion**: Up to 14.5% of women with a negative RIDT in pregnancy had positive influenza A by PCR, of whom more than half did not receive antiviral treatment.

### Could routine pregnancy self-testing facilitate earlier recognition of unintended pregnancy? A feasibility study among South African women [^114Se3Ra]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2022). Low credibility.

We explored whether routine pregnancy self-testing is feasible and acceptable to women at risk of late recognition of pregnancy as a strategy to facilitate early entry into either antenatal or abortion care.

- **Methods**: A feasibility study was conducted among South African sexually active women not desiring pregnancy within one year and not using long-acting or injectable contraceptives. At recruitment, we provided five free urine pregnancy tests for self-testing on the first day of each of the next three months. We sent monthly text reminders to use the tests with requests for no-cost text replies. Our main outcome was the proportion of participants self-testing within five days of the text reminder over three consecutive months. Other outcomes included ease of use of tests, preference for self-testing versus clinic testing, acceptability of routine self-testing (all binary responses followed by open response options), and response to text messages (four-point Likert scale).

- **Results**: We followed up with 71 out of 76 (93%) participants. Two confirmed new pregnancies at the first scheduled test and completed exit interviews, and 64 out of 69 (93%) self-reported completing all three monthly tests. Self-testing was easy to do (66 out of 71, 93%); advantages were convenience (21 out of 71, 30%) and privacy (18 out of 71, 25%), while the main disadvantage was the absence of a nurse to advise (17 out of 71, 24%). Most participants would recommend monthly testing (70 out of 71, 99%). Text reminders were generally not bothersome (57 out of 71, 80%); 35 out of 69 (51%) participants replied with test results over all three months.

- **Conclusion**: Providing free pregnancy tests to women at risk can effectively facilitate early recognition of unintended pregnancies by promoting self-testing, although the absence of immediate professional advice remains a notable disadvantage.

### Accuracy of three screening tools for prenatal substance use [^114VXeN4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Low credibility.

Biological screening tests, although considered the gold standard, are not without flaws. Both urine and hair testing have been shown to produce false-positive results and are unable to give information regarding timing or dosage of drug use. Urine tests, although relatively easy to obtain, are subject to variable excretion rates, meaning that a negative toxicology test does not necessarily exclude the possibility of recent use, particularly for those drugs with a short half-life. Although hair sampling tests for a longer duration of exposure, its collection is more arduous and not likely to be employed in most obstetric practices.

Although our study has the strength of using two biological tests to confirm use, these tests evaluate for a different group of substances, with hair testing not including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or tricyclic antidepressants, which makes comparison of the two difficult. Neither biological test measured alcohol use, which was not a focus of this study. This may explain why the sensitivity of the screening tools decreased slightly when a combination of hair and urine was taken into account. Drugs are typically eliminated much sooner from the urine than from hair, resulting in different timeframes of use being tested. In our study, 13 participants had inconclusive hair sampling. Although the number of inconclusive hair samples was relatively low in this sample, exclusion of inconclusive tests from analysis may have resulted in an underestimation of the actual sensitivity of these screening tools.

### Negative urine pregnancy test in a molar pregnancy: Is it possible [^1178AV8V]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

A urine pregnancy test is commonly used to detect pregnancy and is based on finding intact β-human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) molecules in the urine by an immunoassay system. However, the significantly large amount of β-hCG in molar pregnancy may paradoxically lead to a false-negative result due to a phenomenon known as the 'high dose hook effect'. A case of molar pregnancy with a negative urine pregnancy test but very high serum β-hCG is reported. Every obstetrician should be aware of this limitation in the presence of a high index of suspicion of gestational trophoblastic disease but a negative urine pregnancy test.

### Reproductive factors and subsequent pregnancy outcomes in patients with prior pregnancy loss [^114kMv3Z]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

At present, individualized interventions can be given to patients with a clear etiology of pregnancy loss to improve the subsequent pregnancy outcomes, but the reproductive status of the patient cannot be changed. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between female reproductive status and subsequent pregnancy outcome in patients with prior pregnancy loss (PL).

- **Methods**: A prospective, dynamic population cohort study was carried out at the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University. From September 2019 to February 2022, a total of 1955 women with at least one previous PL were enrolled. Maternal reproductive status and subsequent reproductive outcomes were recorded through an electronic medical record system and follow-up. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between reproductive status and the risk of subsequent reproductive outcomes.

- **Results**: Among all patients, the rates of subsequent infertility, early PL, late PL, and live birth were 20.82%, 24.33%, 1.69%, and 50.77%, respectively. In logistic regression, we found that age (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04–1.13) and previous cesarean delivery history (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.27–4.76) were risk factors for subsequent infertility in patients with PL. Age (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03–1.10), age at first pregnancy (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03–1.10), BMI (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02–1.11), previous PL numbers (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.04–1.57), and lack of pre-pregnancy intervention (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.35–2.24) were risk factors for non-live birth. Age (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03–1.09), age at first pregnancy (OR 1.06, 95% CI…

### Claravis [^113ZrSQD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test should be conducted during the first five days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy. This should occur after the patient has used two forms of contraception for one month.

For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or those using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately before the beginning of isotretinoin therapy. This test should also follow the use of two forms of contraception for one month. The patient must return a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test in a CLIA-certified laboratory before receiving each subsequent course of isotretinoin. A pregnancy test is to be repeated each month in a CLIA-certified laboratory before each prescription for a patient who can become pregnant.

The patient must select and commit to using two forms of effective contraception simultaneously, with at least one being a primary form. Exceptions to this include patients who commit to complete abstinence from sexual contact capable of resulting in pregnancy, have undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or are medically confirmed to be postmenopausal. Patients are required to use two forms of effective contraception for at least one month prior to the initiation of isotretinoin therapy, during isotretinoin therapy, and for one month after discontinuing isotretinoin therapy. Additionally, counseling about contraception and behaviors associated with an increased risk of pregnancy must be repeated monthly.

### ESHRE guideline: Recurrent pregnancy loss [^114KokZt]. Human Reproduction Open (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for recurrent pregnancy loss, specifically with respect to genetic testing of products of conception, the ESHRE 2018 guidelines recommend not to obtain a routine genetic analysis of pregnancy tissue. However, they suggest considering genetic analysis for explanatory purposes. It is advised to use array-based comparative genomic hybridization due to its reduced maternal contamination effect for genetic analysis of the pregnancy tissue.

### Clinical relevance of SARS-CoV-2 infection in late pregnancy [^1173gDvU]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

Some limitations of our study should be acknowledged. Firstly, the reliability of the diagnostic tests is still a source of debate. Even if SARS-CoV-2 infection was investigated using three different modalities, the accuracy of all the tests used is yet uncertain. The nasopharyngeal swab could detect only ongoing infections, and the sensitivity in affected cases was reported to be only 63%. Preliminary evidence is comforting for the other two tests employed to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, but available studies for validation are not optimal. In particular, no attempts have yet been made to investigate the accuracy of these tests for asymptomatic or poorly symptomatic cases. Inferring results obtained in patients with moderate or severe forms of the disease to the whole population is arguable. More generally, the clinical and biological significance of the different types of antibodies remains to be ascertained.

Noteworthy, in our experience, agreement between the two tests was not excellent since only 17 women were found to be positive to both tests, while 7 were positive only to one of the two. In addition, our test mainly evaluated IgG antibodies (only one of the two kits included also other types of antibodies). Including precise evidence also for IgM and IgA could provide a more complete figure of the situation. On the other hand, misdiagnoses were unlikely, considering that all women also performed the nasopharyngeal swab. Recent infections that could have not yet generated the immunological response were expected to be identified by the RT-PCR.

### Science-based approach to harmonize contraception recommendations in clinical trials and pharmaceutical labels [^115SebdW]. Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics (2023). Low credibility.

For other clinical studies not discussed in the four points above, pregnancy tests are not typically required more than once per month during study treatment unless there is a specific pregnancy safety concern for the pharmaceutical. If protocol-scheduled visits are more than one month apart, then testing is conducted at scheduled visits. If scheduled visits occur infrequently, additional tests may be needed between visits. Extra tests may also be conducted if the subject or investigator suspects pregnancy or before a protocol-required procedure that would increase the risk to a pregnant subject.

A pregnancy test should be repeated before pharmaceutical re-administration when the administration of the pharmaceutical is disrupted for more than seven days and there was also a lapse in contraceptive use, regardless of the reason for the disruption (e.g. temporary discontinuation of study treatment for an adverse experience or if required by the study design, such as during a washout period before the second arm of a crossover study).

After completion of pharmaceutical dosing, pregnancy testing should continue, at a minimum, until plasma levels of the pharmaceutical fall to clinically insignificant levels, i.e. after at least five terminal phase half-lives, or until any pharmacologic or toxicologic effects relevant to the risk of fetal harm have diminished.

Pregnancy testing without contraception may suffice in the case of drugs with very short exposure times (e.g. imaging agents like contrast media) or if study participants remain in-house (e.g. in a phase I unit during the study).
