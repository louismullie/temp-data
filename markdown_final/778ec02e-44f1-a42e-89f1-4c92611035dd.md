## Question

Is there a study of vitamin d and autoimmune disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there are studies of vitamin D and autoimmune disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes a "study" in this context and how to classify the evidence hierarchy. Then, I should verify the breadth of autoimmune diseases covered across observational, interventional, and genetic designs. Next, I will examine the highest-quality randomized trial signal, followed by Mendelian randomization and large observational cohorts. After that, I should review disease-specific data for multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and thyroid autoimmunity. Finally, I will synthesize the strength of evidence and note limitations and gaps before concluding with a clear answer and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the scope so I don't miss anything important. By "study", I should include randomized controlled trials, Mendelian randomization, prospective cohorts, case-control studies, and systematic reviews or meta-analyses, and I should consider both prevention and treatment contexts across diverse autoimmune diseases, not just a single condition or design type [^e2bbfcbc] [^58e5e37f].

> I will now examine the highest-quality randomized evidence. The VITAL randomized trial, with more than 25,000 participants and a median follow-up of 5.3 years, found that 2000 IU/day of cholecalciferol reduced incident autoimmune disease by 22% versus placebo, with the effect emerging after 2 years and appearing stronger in those without obesity, which is a pivotal RCT signal for primary prevention in the general adult population [^58e5e37f] [^4fea203e].

> Wait, let me verify the Mendelian randomization data because they help address confounding and reverse causation. Multiple large MR studies consistently show that genetically predicted lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels increase the risk of multiple sclerosis, supporting a causal contribution of vitamin D status to MS susceptibility, and a recent MR analysis also suggests a causal link between higher vitamin D and lower MS disease activity, which triangulates with observational and interventional signals in MS [^58e5e37f] [^0fc46c1d].

> Next, I should review large prospective cohorts and nested case-control studies to ensure consistency. Prospective biobank data show that 25(OH)D levels ≥ 75 nmol/L are associated with substantially lower MS risk, and in established MS, higher 25(OH)D predicts fewer relapses in a dose-dependent fashion, reinforcing the plausibility of vitamin D as a modifiable factor in MS pathophysiology and course [^86bdcfc1] [^7242f755].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all autoimmune diseases. I need to check disease-specific RCTs and MR for type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, and thyroid autoimmunity. For type 1 diabetes, several trials and observational studies suggest potential benefit from vitamin D, especially with early-life supplementation or in islet autoimmunity, but results are heterogeneous and some contemporary cohorts are null, so causality remains probable but not definitive pending larger, well-timed interventions [^2caa0063] [^dfc6aac7] [^95f0ef39]. For RA, observational links and mechanistic plausibility exist, but MR studies generally do not support a causal effect of circulating vitamin D on RA risk, and clinical RCTs have not shown consistent disease-modifying effects, so evidence is mixed and largely hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^046c6b95] [^5c04b4c2]. For SLE, vitamin D deficiency is common and correlates with activity in some cohorts, and small trials suggest modest improvements in activity with repletion, but high-quality RCTs are limited and confounding remains a concern [^f908e394] [^53a85a96]. For thyroid autoimmunity, observational data frequently show lower vitamin D in Hashimoto's and Graves', and some trials report reductions in thyroid antibodies with supplementation, but causality is unsettled and guideline positions remain cautious [^78baa87c] [^a4c8c66d].

> I should double-check the mechanistic plausibility because it strengthens inference when human data are imperfect. Vitamin D signaling is abundant in innate and adaptive immune cells, promoting tolerogenic dendritic cells, enhancing regulatory T cells, and shifting cytokine profiles away from Th1/Th17 toward Th2/Treg, which provides a coherent biological rationale for effects on autoimmunity, even if clinical effect sizes vary by disease and timing of intervention [^d1b2996f] [^3a89c8f7].

> But wait, what about study quality and bias across the broader literature. Umbrella reviews highlight that while hundreds of studies link vitamin D to autoimmune outcomes, many associations are observational and vulnerable to confounding, and randomized evidence remains sparse for several diseases, which means I should be cautious about overgeneralizing beyond MS and the VITAL primary prevention signal to other autoimmune conditions or to treatment rather than prevention [^e2bbfcbc] [^8ac5eb9a].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure I'm not overstating. Yes, there are numerous studies of vitamin D and autoimmune disease spanning RCTs, MR, prospective cohorts, case-control studies, and systematic reviews, with the strongest causal evidence for a preventive effect in MS and a general primary prevention signal in VITAL, while evidence for therapeutic modification of established autoimmune disease is promising but less definitive and varies by condition, so clinical decisions should be individualized and guided by disease-specific data and patient risk profiles [^58e5e37f] [^0fc46c1d] [^e2bbfcbc].

---

There are **multiple studies** linking vitamin D to autoimmune disease, including observational, Mendelian randomization, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [^e2bbfcbc] [^58e5e37f]. Observational studies consistently show that **low vitamin D is associated with higher risk** of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and systemic lupus erythematosus [^2caa0063] [^6d59a17b]. Mendelian randomization provides **causal evidence** that lower genetically predicted vitamin D increases MS risk [^58e5e37f] [^54f2243e]. The VITAL RCT found that **vitamin D supplementation reduced autoimmune disease incidence by 22%** in adults, supporting a causal role in prevention [^58e5e37f] [^4fea203e]. However, evidence varies by disease, and more trials are needed to define optimal dosing, timing, and which autoimmune diseases respond best [^4fea203e] [^df6ff90c].

---

## Observational studies

Observational studies consistently show that **low vitamin D levels are associated with increased risk and severity** of autoimmune diseases:

- **Multiple sclerosis (MS)**: Higher serum 25(OH)D is associated with lower MS risk and relapse rates [^86bdcfc1] [^7242f755].
- **Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)**: Lower vitamin D is linked to higher RA risk and activity [^2caa0063] [^046c6b95].
- **Type 1 diabetes (T1D)**: Lower vitamin D in pregnancy and early life is associated with higher T1D risk in offspring [^bbda0270] [^2caa0063].
- **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**: Vitamin D deficiency is common and correlates with higher disease activity [^f908e394] [^53a85a96].

---

## Mendelian randomization studies

Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to infer causality, reducing confounding and reverse causation. MR studies provide **strong evidence** that lower genetically predicted vitamin D increases MS risk, supporting a causal relationship [^58e5e37f] [^54f2243e]. Evidence for other autoimmune diseases (e.g. RA, T1D, SLE) is less consistent, with some MR studies showing no causal effect, suggesting disease-specific mechanisms [^5c04b4c2] [^58e5e37f].

---

## Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)

RCTs are the gold standard for establishing causality. The VITAL trial (25,871 adults, 5.3 years) found that **2,000 IU/day vitamin D reduced autoimmune disease incidence by 22%** versus placebo, with effects emerging after 2 years [^58e5e37f] [^4fea203e]. Smaller RCTs in MS and other autoimmune diseases show mixed results, likely due to heterogeneity in populations, doses, and outcomes [^02a34e6b] [^b72447e4].

---

## Mechanistic evidence

Vitamin D exerts **immunomodulatory effects** that plausibly influence autoimmunity:

- **Regulatory T cells**: Enhances Treg function, promoting immune tolerance [^d1b2996f] [^3a89c8f7].
- **Th1/Th17 suppression**: Reduces pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 responses [^d1b2996f] [^f47331e4].
- **Antigen-presenting cells**: Induces tolerogenic dendritic cells, limiting autoreactive T cell activation [^d1b2996f] [^d2aaf4e1].

---

## Limitations and gaps

Despite growing evidence, **key limitations remain**:

- **Dose and timing**: Optimal dosing, duration, and timing (e.g. early life) are unclear [^4fea203e] [^321e992a].
- **Disease specificity**: Effects likely vary by disease; more disease-specific RCTs are needed [^4fea203e] [^df6ff90c].
- **Population differences**: Genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors may modify effects [^54f2243e] [^b3077737].

---

## Clinical implications

Current evidence supports maintaining **sufficient vitamin D status** (≥ 30 ng/mL) for bone health and potential autoimmune benefits, especially in high-risk populations or those with autoimmune disease [^77c24184] [^58e5e37f]. Routine screening is not universally recommended, but targeted testing and supplementation are reasonable in deficient or high-risk individuals [^e5a371cc] [^77c24184].

---

There are **multiple studies** linking vitamin D to autoimmune disease, with strong observational and MR evidence for MS and emerging RCT evidence for prevention. Vitamin D supplementation is a low-risk, potentially beneficial strategy, but further research is needed to define optimal use across diseases and populations [^58e5e37f] [^4fea203e].

### Can supplementation with vitamin D reduce the risk or modify the course of autoimmune diseases? A systematic review of the literature [^003a98df]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether vitamin D levels are related to the risk of developing autoimmune diseases and whether supplementation with vitamin D can modify the course of the diseases.

Methods

We reviewed the most relevant papers published from January 1973 to October 2011, using Medline and EMBASE and the search terms "vitamin D"; "autoimmune disease"; "autoimmunity"; "rheumatoid arthritis"; "systemic lupus erythematosus"; "scleroderma"; "systemic sclerosis"; "type 1 diabetes"; "multiple sclerosis"; and "undifferentiated connective tissue disease". We selected studies on the environmental, genetic and epidemiologic association of vitamin D with autoimmune diseases. Using the strategy described, we identified 1268 articles. 331 articles were eliminated on the basis of the title and another 703 on the basis of the abstract, since they were considered irrelevant for the purposes of the study. Full-text examination was performed on the remaining 234 studies, and a further 15 studies were excluded from the review, since the results had been confirmed or superseded by more recent research. Finally, a systematic review was conducted on 219 articles concerning cross-sectional data on: vitamin D levels and autoimmune diseases; interventional data on vitamin D supplementation in autoimmune diseases; prospective data linking vitamin D level or intake to autoimmune disease risk.

Results

Physiopathology studies confirm that hypovitaminosis D, in genetically predisposed subjects, can impair self tolerance by compromising the regulation of dendritic cells, of regulatory T-lymphocytes and of Th1 cells. Cross-sectional studies show that levels of vitamin D <30 ng/mL are present in a significant percentage, not only in patients with autoimmune disease, but also in healthy subjects (30-77%), and link profound deficiency (<10 ng/mL) with aggravation of symptomatology, while genetic studies associate polymorphism of vitamin D receptors to various autoimmune diseases. Among experimental studies on humans, only those on type-1 diabetes prove that the risks are significantly reduced in infants treated with vitamin D after the 7th month (OR 0.71, 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.84) and that a dose-response effect exists.

Conclusions

Basic, genetic, and epidemiological studies indicate a potential role of vitamin D in the prevention of autoimmune diseases, but randomized and controlled trials are necessary to establish the clinical efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in ill or at-risk subjects.

### Regulation of immune function by vitamin D and its use in diseases of immunity [^2cbe7db8]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Evidence exists for a role for vitamin D and its active metabolites in modulating immune functions. In animal models, vitamin D deficiency is associated with a higher risk for autoimmunity in genetically predisposed subjects and increases in susceptibility to infections. In addition, high-dose vitamin D can improve immune health, prevent autoimmunity, and improve defense against infections. In humans, evidence exists on associations between vitamin D deficiency and impaired immune function, leading to autoimmunity in genetically predisposed people and increased risk for infections; data on therapeutic immune effects of vitamin D supplementation when vitamin D levels are already sufficient are lacking.

### Vitamin D deficiency and risk for rheumatic diseases: an update [^f47331e4]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The role of vitamin D in situations other than calcium homeostasis and bone health has become very topical. It is apparent that vitamin D has significant effects on the immune system and as such may contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease. This review examines the evidence-to-date that vitamin D has a role in immune-mediated rheumatic disorders.

Recent Findings

Low vitamin D status is reported in many inflammatory rheumatic conditions. In some this extends to an association with disease activity. Vitamin D acts on a number of cells involved in both innate and acquired immunity biasing the adaptive immune system away from Th17 and Th1, towards Th2 and Tregs. Deficiency accordingly could encourage autoimmunity. Direct evidence for this plausible mechanism in specific diseases remains largely to be demonstrated. To date, there is a dearth of controlled trials of vitamin D in prophylaxis or therapy.

Summary

Vitamin D deficiency may well be an important factor in autoimmune rheumatic disease, including initial disease development and worsening the disease once present. This is testable and there is a pressing need for therapeutic studies.

Autoimmune diseases

Conversely, from the innate immune system, the adaptive immune system is downregulated by 1,25(OH) 2 D in animal models. Thus, vitamin D deficiency might predispose to autoimmune diseases. Observational studies have suggested this effect might apply to humans.

The VITAL RCT showed that vitamin D supplementation decreased the risk of autoimmune diseases, especially rheumatoid arthritis and polymyalgia rheumatica, and at least 8 large MR studies all agree that genetically predicted lower 25(OH)D levels increased the risk of developing multiple sclerosis either during adolescence or adulthood. In any case, the low number of intervention studies so far conducted does not allow clarification of the relationship between vitamin D and autoimmune diseases. However, these studies to date seem promising.

### Identification of genetic variants affecting vitamin D receptor binding and associations with autoimmune disease [^02a65acb]. Human Molecular Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Understanding complex disease will also need the determination of how functional genetic variants interact with environmental factors. One such factor is Vitamin D, a class of fat-soluble secosteroids that enhance intestinal absorption of dietary minerals, which are synthesised in the skin upon exposure to sunlight. Many observational studies have yielded associations between low serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and the risks of developing diverse diseases. However, Mendelian randomisation studies, for example on susceptibility to multiple sclerosis and all-cause mortality have indicated a causal role for this hormone. Identifying a molecular basis to these statistical associations would also indicate a direct causal role for vitamin D levels in these diseases. Vitamin D signalling occurs principally following the binding of calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, to its cognate nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) which binds DNA in a heterodimer with the Retinoid X receptor (RXR). We previously have shown that VDR binding in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) occurs at 2,776 locations and preferentially (>2-fold) within intervals genetically associated with diseases, such as Crohn’s disease and Multiple Sclerosis. On one hand, these enrichments could indicate a direct modifying effect of VDR-binding on disease risk. On the other hand, they could, more trivially, reflect a general association between regulatory regions and disease-associated genomic intervals. These enrichments of VDR binding within these intervals also are not informative of whether altered VDR binding to DNA functional elements explains genetic contributions to disease risk. If this is the case, we then also wish to determine whether it is a gain or loss of VDR binding that causally increases disease risk.

### Identification of genetic variants affecting vitamin D receptor binding and associations with autoimmune disease [^f74165f6]. Human Molecular Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

We have provided the first quantitative association-based analysis to explain the genetic effect on binding affinity variation for a nuclear receptor, and to propose a mechanistic model for disease susceptibility. Our results support the hypothesis that DNA variants altering transcription factor binding at enhancers contribute to complex disease aetiology and suggest that altered VDR binding, and by inference variable vitamin D levels, explain, in part, altered autoimmune and other complex disease risk.

### Vitamin D in systemic and organ-specific autoimmune diseases [^9bac64c0]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Lately, vitamin D has been linked with metabolic and immunological processes, which established its role as an essential component of human health preservation. Vitamin D has been defined as natural immune modulators, and upon activation of its receptors (VDRs), it regulates calcium metabolism, cellular growth, proliferation and apoptosis, and other immunological functions. Epidemiological data underline a strong correlation between poor vitamin D status and higher risk for chronic inflammatory illnesses of various etiologies, including autoimmune diseases. Epidemiological, genetic, and basic studies indicated a potential role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis of certain systemic and organ-specific autoimmune diseases. These studies demonstrate correlation between low vitamin D and prevalence of diseases. In addition, VDRs' polymorphisms observed in some of these autoimmune diseases may further support a plausible pathogenic link. Notably, for some autoimmune disease, no correlation with vitamin D levels could be confirmed. Thus, in the current review we present the body of evidence regarding the plausible roles of vitamin D and VDR's polymorphism in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. We summarize the data regarding systemic (i.e., systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.) and organ-specific (i.e., multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus, primary biliary cirrhosis, etc.) autoimmune diseases, in which low level of vitamin D was found comparing to healthy subjects. In addition, we discuss the correlations between vitamin D levels and clinical manifestations and/or activity of diseases. In this context, we address the rational for vitamin D supplementation in patients suffering from autoimmune diseases. Further studies addressing the mechanisms by which vitamin D affects autoimmunity and the proper supplementation required are needed.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^e5a371cc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Numerous studies demonstrate associations between serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and a variety of common disorders, including musculoskeletal, metabolic, cardiovascular, malignant, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. Although a causal link between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and many disorders has not been clearly established, these associations have led to widespread supplementation with vitamin D and increased laboratory testing for 25(OH)D in the general population. The benefit-risk ratio of this increase in vitamin D use is not clear, and the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain.

Objective

To develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower the risk of disease in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and systematic literature review, identified and prioritized 14 clinically relevant questions related to the use of vitamin D and 25(OH)D testing to lower the risk of disease. The panel prioritized randomized placebo-controlled trials in general populations (without an established indication for vitamin D treatment or 25[OH]D testing), evaluating the effects of empiric vitamin D administration throughout the lifespan, as well as in select conditions (pregnancy and prediabetes). The panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that (a) exceeds the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) and (b) is implemented without testing for 25(OH)D. Systematic reviews queried electronic databases for publications related to these 14 clinical questions. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and guide recommendations. The approach incorporated perspectives from a patient representative and considered patient values, costs and resources required, acceptability and feasibility, and impact on health equity of the proposed recommendations. The process to develop this clinical guideline did not use a risk assessment framework and was not designed to replace current DRI for vitamin D.

Results

The panel suggests empiric vitamin D supplementation for children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years to prevent nutritional rickets and because of its potential to lower the risk of respiratory tract infections; for those aged 75 years and older because of its potential to lower the risk of mortality; for those who are pregnant because of its potential to lower the risk of preeclampsia, intra-uterine mortality, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, and neonatal mortality; and for those with high-risk prediabetes because of its potential to reduce progression to diabetes. Because the vitamin D doses in the included clinical trials varied considerably and many trial participants were allowed to continue their own vitamin D-containing supplements, the optimal doses for empiric vitamin D supplementation remain unclear for the populations considered. For nonpregnant people older than 50 years for whom vitamin D is indicated, the panel suggests supplementation via daily administration of vitamin D, rather than intermittent use of high doses. The panel suggests against empiric vitamin D supplementation above the current DRI to lower the risk of disease in healthy adults younger than 75 years. No clinical trial evidence was found to support routine screening for 25(OH)D in the general population, nor in those with obesity or dark complexion, and there was no clear evidence defining the optimal target level of 25(OH)D required for disease prevention in the populations considered; thus, the panel suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in all populations considered. The panel judged that, in most situations, empiric vitamin D supplementation is inexpensive, feasible, acceptable to both healthy individuals and health care professionals, and has no negative effect on health equity.

Conclusion

The panel suggests empiric vitamin D for those aged 1 to 18 years and adults over 75 years of age, those who are pregnant, and those with high-risk prediabetes. Due to the scarcity of natural food sources rich in vitamin D, empiric supplementation can be achieved through a combination of fortified foods and supplements that contain vitamin D. Based on the absence of supportive clinical trial evidence, the panel suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in the absence of established indications. These recommendations are not meant to replace the current DRIs for vitamin D, nor do they apply to people with established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing. Further research is needed to determine optimal 25(OH)D levels for specific health benefits.

### Emerging role of vitamin D in autoimmune diseases: an update on evidence and therapeutic implications [^6d59a17b]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D plays a key role in in calcium homeostasis and, thus, provides an important support in bone growth by aiding in the mineralization of the collagen matrix. However, vitamin D performs various immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-fibrotic actions. Autoimmune diseases result from an aberrant activation of the immune system, whereby the immune response is directed against harmless self-antigens. Does vitamin D play a role in the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases? And, if so, what is its role? In the last decade, researchers' interest in vitamin D and its correlations with autoimmune diseases has considerably increased. We conducted a literature review, covering the period January 1, 2009 through March 30, 2019, in PubMed. We analyzed more than 130 studies in order to find a correlation between vitamin D levels and its effect upon several autoimmune diseases. The analysis demonstrated an inverse association between vitamin D and the development of several autoimmune diseases, such as SLE, thyrotoxicosis, type 1 DM, MS, iridocyclitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis vulgaris, seropositive RA, polymyalgia rheumatica. International multicenter study could allow us to confirm the data already present in the literature in the single clinical studies and to evaluate when to effectively supplement vitamin D in patients who do not take corticosteroids.

### Vitamin D levels and risk of juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a mendelian randomization study [^79759236]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

JIA is the most common rheumatic disease affecting children, with a prevalence of approximately 1/1000. JIA is considered a complex autoimmune disease, influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. Whilst there is a growing appreciation of genetic influences – on JIA, we have much less clarity regarding environmental effects on disease risk.Identification of modifiable environmental factors which predispose to JIA or can be used to risk stratify or alter disease outcome has huge potential benefit for patients.

Observationally, low vitamin D levels have been associated with increased incidence and disease activity of many other autoimmune disorders. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble steroid hormone whose synthesis requires multiple steps involving biologically inactive precursors (Figure 1). The major circulating form of vitamin D measured in blood is 25-(OH)D, however the downstream derivative 1,25-(OH) 2 D is the biologically active form. Vitamin D levels are predominantly influenced by sunlight; ultraviolet light induces conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to pre-vitamin D3 in the skin. Some vitamin D is also obtained via the gut from diet and exogenous supplementation. Vitamin D acts via the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and plays a key role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. However the VDR is also extensively expressed on immune cells and vitamin D has been shown to have a number of immune-modulatory effects.

The role of vitamin D in JIA has recently been examined in a scoping review.The studies included in this review predominantly examine the role of vitamin D in a) JIA activity/disease course or b) report vitamin D status of JIA patients versus healthy controls after disease onset, with mixed results. Further literature review identified few published studies examining the vitamin D status of JIA patients prior to disease onset. Thorsen et al found no evidence of association between cord blood 25-(OH)D levels and later JIA risk (adjusted OR 1.2 95% CI 0.9-1.6) in 300 matched case-control pairs, however observational studies of vitamin D levels and JIA risk at other pre-disease timepoints are lacking. Conversely, a recent study of 202 JIA case-control pairs found a potentially protective association between maternal prenatal or early childhood ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure and JIA, with vitamin D proposed as a mediator.Thus the role of vitamin D in JIA incidence remains unclear.

Conclusions

The role of vitamin D in bone health has long been established. The involvement of this vitamin in autoimmune disease is however heavily debated. We provide here an in vivo mechanism as to how vitamin D deficiency may influence autoimmune disease risk, by directly interacting with disease associated genes. Vitamin D sufficiency has been suggested to have a threshold of approximately 75 nmol/L; we provide here biological evidence in support of this, with significant public health implications.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: current evidence and outstanding questions [^2caa0063]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Human data

Observational data have consistently confirmed an association between poor vitamin D status and all major autoimmune diseases. As detailed above, topical 1,25(OH) 2 D or its analogs have demonstrated efficacy against psoriasis, which is characterized by increased keratinocyte proliferation, but has inflammatory and autoimmune components as well. The relationship between vitamin D deficiency and MS has also attracted extensive interest. A large nested control study in US white army recruits demonstrated that a low vitamin D status (defined by serum 25OHD levels <50 nmol/L) at the time of recruitment conveyed a nearly twofold risk of later onset of MS compared with whites with a better vitamin D baseline status. The Finnish Maternity Cohort study reached similar conclusions. A similar study in patients with type 1 diabetes generated similar results. Several retrospective studies, albeit not optimally designed, showed that that vitamin D supplementation early in life reduced the risk of developing type 1 diabetes later in life by ∼30%. The dose of vitamin D required for this effect has not been clearly defined but a daily dose (up to 2000 IU) during the first year of life was most effective. This dose is markedly higher than the presently accepted or recommended dose for infants (200 to 400 IU/d). There are also well-established links between vitamin D deficiency and RA. In >29,000 women followed for 11 years, RA (152 cases in total) was inversely associated with intake of vitamin D (highest vs lowest tertile). A small-scale MR study did not find a link between genetically predicted serum 25OHD and outcome parameters in patients with RA, but the study did not evaluate the risk of developing this disease (Table 2).

### Vitamin D treatment in multiple sclerosis [^7781bc51]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis is an immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system caused by a complex interplay between several different genetic as well as environmental factors. Vitamin D is one of the most attractive candidates among various environmental factors suggested to be involved in the development of the disease. Epidemiological evidence combined with clinical and laboratory analyses, and experimental animal models, suggest a possible influence of vitamin D on MS susceptibility as well as clinical disease activity. Supplement with vitamin D may reduce the risk of developing MS. An intervention may also reduce the risk of conversion from a first clinical event suggestive of MS to clinical definite MS, as well as reduce the relapse rate among patients with relapsing remitting MS. More studies are, however, needed to determine optimal dose and serum level for vitamin D, as well as target populations and optimal timing for intervention.

### Vitamin D and diabetes [^ba9577bb]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

There is no doubt that vitamin D deficiency is the cause of several metabolic bone diseases, but vitamin D status is also linked to many major human diseases including immune disorders. Mounting data strengthen the link between vitamin D and diabetes, in particular T1D and T2D. Despite some inconsistencies between studies that associate serum 25(OH)D levels with the risk of developing T1D or T2D, there seems to be an overall trend for an inverse correlation between levels of 25(OH)D and both disorders. There is also compelling evidence that 1,25(OH)2D regulates b-cell function by different mechanisms, such as influencing insulin secretion by regulating intracellular levels of Ca2+, increasing β-cell resistance to apoptosis, and perhaps also increasing β-cell replication. The capacity of vitamin D, more specifically 1,25(OH)2D, to modulate immune responses is of particular interest for both the therapy and prevention of diabetes. In the case of T1D, vitamin D supplementation in prediabetic individuals could help prevent or reduce the initiation of autoimmune processes possibly by regulating thymic selection of the T-cell repertoire, decreasing the numbers of autoreactive T cells, and inducing Treg cells. Although immune modulation is generally discussed for the treatment of T1D, it is also relevant for T2D. Indeed, recent studies have shown that T2D patients have increased systemic inflammation and that this state can induce β-cell dysfunction and death. Supplementation trials with regular vitamin D for the protection against the development of T1D and T2D have generated some contradictory data, but many weaknesses can be identified in these trials as most were underpowered or open-labeled. However, the overwhelming strength of preclinical data and of the observational studies make vitamin D or its analogues strong candidates for the prevention or treatment of diabetes or its complications. However, proof of causality needs well-designed clinical trials and if positive, adequate dosing, regimen, and compound studies are needed to define the contribution of vitamin D status and therapy in the global diabetes problem. There are many confounding factors that need to be taken into consideration when translating successful vitamin D therapies in animal models into humans, for example, gender, age, lifestyle, and genetic background. To come to solid conclusions on the potential of vitamin D or its analogues in the prevention of or therapy for all forms of diabetes, it is clear that large prospective trials with carefully selected populations and end points will be needed, but should also receive high priority.

### Cistromic and genetic evidence that the vitamin D receptor mediates susceptibility to latitude-dependent autoimmune diseases [^f5b7c5ae]. Genes and Immunity (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of autoimmune risk genes, many shared across diseases., The challenge now is to use this genetic road map to better define the pathogenesis of the diseases and develop novel effective therapies and clinically useful biomarkers. The prevalence of many autoimmune diseases increases with distance from the equator in genetically similar populations in many countries.,,, These associations have been attributed to reduced exposure to UV radiation, and consequent Vitamin D (Vit D) deficiency. This is supported by evidence of the importance of Vit D in immunomodulation.,,,,

Several recent lines of unrelated investigation provide further strong support for a key role of Vit D in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders. Two of the autoimmune-associated genes, CYP27B1 and CYP24A1, control the availability of the ligand for the endogenous Vit D receptor (VDR), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (1,25D3): CYP27B1 converts the precursor 25D3 to 1,25D3 and CYP24A1 enhances catabolism of 1,25D3. These genes (CYP27B1 / CYP24A1 / VDR), singly or collectively, have been identified as risk factors in multiple autoimmune diseases.,,,, Second, Vit D supplementation has been found to be of therapeutic benefit in animal models of autoimmune disease, including in autoimmune encephalomyelitis, collagen-induced arthritis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune thyroiditis and systemic lupus erythematosus.Further, at a clinical level, higher serum Vit D levels are associated with reduced risk of autoimmune diseases,,,,,,, and the function of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in patients has been shown to be proportional to serum 25D3 levels.As a result of these findings, Vit D has been considered a promising target pathway for therapeutic intervention and clinical trials have commenced (ahead of more detailed knowledge of the microenvironment in which Vit D immunomodulation occurs).

### Is hypovitaminosis D one of the environmental risk factors for multiple sclerosis? [^b106fd8a]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

The role of hypovitaminosis D as a possible risk factor for multiple sclerosis is reviewed. First, it is emphasized that hypovitaminosis D could be only one of the risk factors for multiple sclerosis and that numerous other environmental and genetic risk factors appear to interact and combine to trigger the disease. Secondly, the classical physiological notions about vitamin D have recently been challenged and the main new findings are summarized. This vitamin could have an important immunological role involving a number of organs and pathologies, including autoimmune diseases and multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, human requirements for this vitamin are much higher than previously thought, and in medium- or high-latitude countries, they might not be met in the majority of the general population due to a lack of sunshine and an increasingly urbanized lifestyle. Thereafter, the different types of studies that have helped to implicate hypovitaminosis D as a risk factor for multiple sclerosis are reviewed. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, vitamin D has been shown to play a significant immunological role. Diverse epidemiological studies suggest that a direct chain of causality exists in the general population between latitude, exposure to the sun, vitamin D status and the risk of multiple sclerosis. New epidemiological analyses from France support the existence of this chain of links. Recently reported immunological findings in patients with multiple sclerosis have consistently shown that vitamin D significantly influences regulatory T lymphocyte cells, whose role is well known in the pathogenesis of the disease. Lastly, in a number of studies on serum levels of vitamin D in multiple sclerosis, an insufficiency was observed in the great majority of patients, including at the earliest stages of the disease. The questionable specificity and significance of such results is detailed here. Based on a final global analysis of the cumulative significance of these different types of findings, it would appear likely that hypovitaminosis D is one of the risk factors for multiple sclerosis.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^4fea203e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D—research gaps for adults aged 50 to 74 years: The age group 65 to 74 years requires more attention, since the risks of chronic diseases and the outcomes being examined are higher than in those aged 50 to 64 years. Studies with longer follow-up may be needed, as some outcomes may become apparent only after 5 years. In secondary, exploratory analyses, vitamin D in this age group has been implicated in the prevention of autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and autoimmune thyroid disease, and these data need confirmation by additional RCTs. Studies of the effect of vitamin D fortification on vitamin D status in different populations at risk of low vitamin D status are needed.

### Vitamin D and rheumatoid arthritis: an ongoing mystery [^4b636032]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the value of vitamin D and its effects on autoimmunity. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on the association between vitamin D and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in terms of prevalence, disease activity, clinical expression, serology and gene polymorphisms of vitamin D receptors.

Recent Findings

Studies have shown contrasting findings concerning the association between vitamin D levels and RA. Vitamin D seems to have immunomodulatory properties. Therefore, low vitamin D levels could contribute to increased immune activation. However, the potential role of vitamin D supplementation in preventing RA manifestation and its beneficial role as a component of RA treatment remain controversial. The relationship between RA susceptibility and vitamin D polymorphisms is also unclear.

Summary

Despite advancements synthesized by some recent meta-analyses, the relationship between vitamin D and RA requires further evaluation. Further research is needed to confirm the relationship between RA susceptibility and vitamin D polymorphisms and to determine whether vitamin D plays a role in preventing the manifestation of RA. Finally, additional studies are required to determine the impact and optimal amount of vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of RA patients.

### High-dose vitamin dsupplementation in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: a randomised clinical trial [^a5bfa41d]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D supplementation trials, many quite small, in other autoimmune diseases in which insufficiency thereof has been proposed as a risk or prognostic factor have had mixed results. It is difficult to reconcile the results herein with the strong associations in MS observational studies of lower vitamin D levels with greater risk of disease incidence or disease activity. Some studies have suggested that sunlight or ultraviolet radiation exerts a possible effect on risk of MS disease activity, independent of vitamin D pathways; if true, vitamin D supplementation would not likely alter outcomes. It is also plausible that low sunlight exposure or low vitamin D serum levels could be reflective of an MS prodromal phase or of greater accumulated subclinical disease activity.Were these conditions true, lower vitamin D levels might appear to be a risk factor for MS or a prognostic factor for worse MS outcomes, when in reality, the MS caused lower vitamin D levels due to related behavioral change (reverse causality). These are interesting areas for future research.

### Vitamin D: an evidence-based review [^0f69a2ba]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays an important role in bone metabolism and seems to have some anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating properties. In addition, recent epidemiologic studies have observed relationships between low vitamin D levels and multiple disease states. Low vitamin D levels are associated with increased overall and cardiovascular mortality, cancer incidence and mortality, and autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Although it is well known that the combination of vitamin D and calcium is necessary to maintain bone density as people age, vitamin D may also be an independent risk factor for falls among the elderly. New recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics [corrected] address the need for supplementation in breastfed newborns and many questions are raised regarding the role of maternal supplementation during lactation. Unfortunately, little evidence guides clinicians on when to screen for vitamin D deficiency or effective treatment options.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: current evidence and outstanding questions [^14b56ae5]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

There is broad and growing evidence that VDR and vitamin D metabolic enzymes are present in the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, and, more significantly, that vitamin D signaling in the immune system is physiologically important and of clinical significance in patients with deficiencies. Overall, the data suggest a role of vitamin D status in sensitivity to infections and autoimmune diseases, whereas the risk of atopic diseases is less evident. Three MR studies all showed a clear significant link between genetically predicted lower serum 25OHD concentrations and the prevalence of juvenile or adult onset MS. Intervention studies to date show particular promise in CD. However, similar to RCTs in other immune-related disorders, definitive conclusions concerning therapeutic benefit are limited by study sizes. Nonetheless, the data are sufficiently compelling to merit larger-scale RCTs for CD and other immune conditions, in particular in patients with early stage type 1 diabetes or in patients at risk for developing the disease.

Thus, a link between the vitamin D endocrine system and the immune system is highly plausible, but whether vitamin D deficiency in humans has real implications for infections or autoimmune diseases has yet to be confirmed by large-scale RCTs. It will be important to perform such trials because data accumulated to date indicate that low vitamin D status enhances the risk of upper respiratory infections and that vitamin D deficiency during early life predisposes the immune system to a higher later risk of autoimmune diseases or allergy.

### Adjuvant therapeutic effect of vitamin D on Hashimoto's thyroiditis (...) [^f69e6ee4]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic Effect of Vitamin D on Hashimoto's ThyroiditisClinicalTrials. gov ID. Dietary vitamin D supplementation has been evaluated as a way to protect the thyroid from autoimmune damage, but results from randomized clinical trials have been inconclusive. Clinical studies have shown that vitamin D3 supplementation has a unique advantage in reducing TPO antibody titers. In 2014, AACE guidelines indicated that vitamin D can be used as a complementary treatment for Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in HT patients is as high as 50%-90%. Studies have shown that VD is widely used in vivo. VD can be used as an immune factor to participate in the process of immune regulation. Cells of the immune system can synthesize active metabolites of vitamin D due to the expression of 1α-hydroxylase, which shows immunomodulatory properties.

Existing genetic studies have found that most VDR can be restricted by CYP1α and vitamin D binding proteins, showing the relationship between VDR, DBP and CYP1α gene polymorphisms and thyroid autoimmune system, which affect T and B lymphocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages, as well as enzymes with CYP1α and VDR. Therefore, Vitamin D is thought to be an immune modulator. Clinical studies have confirmed that vitamin D deficiency is more common in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease, both in children and the elderly, and in both low and high latitudes. Combining vitamin D with anti-thyroid drugs or thyroid hormones can help treat AITD by suppressing autoimmune responses and lowering serum levels of thyroid autoantibodies. However, studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency is not associated with AITD, especially early AITD.

However, a study based on Asian Indian communities found only a weak inverse association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D values and TPO antibody titers. A 2015 meta-analysis demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in AITD subjects and that these subjects have low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, suggesting that lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D is associated with AITD disease.

### Genome-wide association study in 79, 366 European-ancestry individuals informs the genetic architecture of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels [^54f2243e]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are mainly determined by modifiable environmental factors, and contrary to estimates from previous twin studies, our large-scale analyses suggest a SNP-heritability rate that is relatively modest in magnitude when considering common variants. Our study also showed that common genetic variants are unlikely to have a strong modifying effect on increases in 25-hydroxyvitamin D following typical dietary intakes, suggesting that consideration of genetic background is not required when determining population based vitamin D intake recommendations. However, our results support the role of vitamin D in immunological diseases as we observed from cell-type-specific analysis for clustering of vitamin D and autoimmune diseases, and the evidence for signal enrichment for immune and hematopoietic tissues. These findings are in line with previous Mendelian Randomization studies which found a putative causal association between vitamin D and autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes. The additional genetic instruments identified by our results could also be used in future Mendelian Randomization analyses of the association between vitamin D and complex traits.

### Vitamin D: evidence for its role as a prognostic factor in multiple sclerosis [^15d77cee]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin D insufficiency has been shown to be associated with increased susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS), but until recently, it was unclear if vitamin D status also influences the prognosis of the disease. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model of MS, the administration of vitamin D reduces the severity of the disease. Initial reports in MS of inverse associations between vitamin D levels and disability or relapse rate were encouraging, but the cross-sectional or retrospective study designs limited their interpretability. More recently, studies of pediatric-onset and adult MS have demonstrated that among those with established MS, those with lower vitamin D levels are at higher risk for subsequent relapse. These observational data provide strong support for randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation in MS.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^a12b4b2e]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D—extraskeletal effects in skin and immunity are outlined with epidemiologic context: the vitamin D receptor is present in multiple tissues and organs, epidemiologic studies over the last 2 decades suggest immune and cancer-related effects but confounding remains possible and adjusted attributable risk for many cancers remains considerable, and long-term prospective supplementation studies are awaited; keratinocytes express the vitamin D receptor and exposure to vitamin D inhibits growth and stimulates differentiation, supporting topical vitamin D analog use for psoriasis; vitamin D modulates B- and T-lymphocyte function, vitamin D deficiency is associated with autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis, one-year-old vitamin D–deficient children have a reported fourfold higher risk of developing type 1 diabetes than vitamin D–sufficient children, and multiple sclerosis risk is higher above 35° latitude with an inverse relationship between vitamin D concentrations and multiple sclerosis risk.

### Vitamin D and systemic lupus erythematosus-the hype and the hope [^73de5b29]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Over the past 20years, much has been written about the potential role of vitamin D in on adverse health outcomes. In recent years, evidence has accumulated regarding the effect of vitamin D on the immune system, and its different cells. Some studies have noted lower vitamin D concentrations in patients with SLE. These epidemiological data still not answer the question: is vitamin D deficiency the cause or the effect? To answer this, we will discuss the association between vitamin D deficiency and SLE and review the evidence from interventional studies.

### Effects of vitamin D on the peripheral adaptive immune system: a review [^3a89c8f7]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Epidemiological studies have shown that a poor vitamin D status is associated with an increased risk of several diseases, including autoimmune diseases. The immune regulatory function of vitamin D is thought to have an important role in these associations. Cells of the adaptive immune system have shown to be direct targets of the vitamin D metabolites. Besides being direct targets, cells of the adaptive immune system express the enzymes involved in the metabolism of vitamin D, enabling them to locally convert 25(OH)D into its active metabolite 1,25(OH)2D. In this review, the effects of vitamin D on cells of the adaptive immune system are described. Experimental data in vitro show that vitamin D skews cells of the adaptive immune system toward a more tolerogenic status which might be exploited in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. However, it should be noticed that in vivo effects may differ from in vitro effects due to the cross-talk between different vitamin D sensitive cells, but data support the view that vitamin D is positively involved in maintaining or restoring immune homeostasis. Upcoming vitamin D supplementation trials will further elucidate the in vivo effects of vitamin D on the immune system and its potency to serve as an immune regulating agent in autoimmune diseases.

### Genome-wide association study in 79, 366 European-ancestry individuals informs the genetic architecture of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels [^b3077737]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Through partitioning the SNP-heritability of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, we observed a significant enrichment in immune and hematopoietic tissues; likewise, the cell-type-specific analysis revealed clustering of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and autoimmune diseases, indicating that these traits share a majority of common cell types. The link between vitamin D deficiency and increased risk for autoimmune inflammatory diseases has long been recognized by epidemiological investigations,. Although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, it is now evident that vitamin D is involved in many biological processes that regulate both innate and adaptive immune responses, through ligand-receptor binding, activation, interaction with response elements in the promoter regions of different genes, and eventually lead to functional changes in a wide variety of immune cells including Th1, Th2, Th17, T regulatory and natural killer T cells,. The shared cell type enrichments between vitamin D and autoimmune diseases observed in our study, further suggest that vitamin D not only affects autoimmune diseases through its direct effect (as a ligand), but also through their shared genetic etiology. Thus, individuals with vitamin D deficiency may be more susceptible to these disorders, both because of environmental and genetic influences.

Our genome-wide interaction analysis between genetic variants and dietary intake of vitamin D did not identify new signals. All significant associations observed in the joint test of main genetic and interaction effects were of equal or higher significance level (i.e. lower P -values) in the GWAS of marginal genetic effect performed in the same individuals, indicating no major contribution of interaction effects at these loci. Indeed, only one of the top 5 loci from the overall marginal GWAS showed nominally significant interaction effect, and none passed Bonferroni corrections. While smaller gene-diet interaction effects remain to be discovered, our results provide some evidence against large interactions between common SNPs and dietary vitamin D intake. Still, one cannot completely rule out the possibility of interaction, but only conclude that genetic effects appear stable within vitamin D intake range in the populations studied. Indeed, as for any gene-environment interaction tests, statistical power is highly dependent on the variance of exposure in the samples analyzed, and interactions would remain unobserved if the exposure is homogeneous among individuals. Also, we were not able to capture vitamin D supplementation adequately to include this in the dietary intake variable, and were not able to estimate sunlight exposure as a source of vitamin D production in the skin.

### Vitamin D supplementation as a potential cause of U-shaped associations between vitamin D levels and negative health outcomes: a decision tree analysis for risk of frailty [^df3193dc]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent worldwide and has been recognized as a public health problem. Low vitamin D has been extensively studied and shown to be associated with various negative health outcomes, such as osteoporosis, fracture, muscle weakness, falls, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. Optimizing deficient vitamin D levels with supplementation can result in mostly favorable results, although definitive evidence from well-designed randomized controlled clinical trials is lacking. In light of the accumulating evidence on the beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation and its relatively safe side-effect profile, vitamin D supplementation has been recommended by multiple authorities and guidelines.

One of the recent controversies in vitamin D research is a “U-shaped association”, in which both high and low levels of vitamin D are associated with elevated disease risks. Regarding all-cause mortality, most observational population-based studies have shown that low vitamin D predicted premature death, which is supported by recent meta-analyses. However, there were a considerable number of studies that showed U-shaped or reverse J-shaped associations between vitamin D and mortality. One of the meta-analysis studies showed the possibility that mortality risk may become higher again at a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) level of 112.5 nmol/l or more. The association between high vitamin D and high mortality appears counterintuitive and the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Criticisms of this paradoxical finding were that it was due to chance, a lack of adequate adjustment, an analytical bias due to serum vitamin D assays, a small number of the highest serum vitamin D group, or vitamin D intoxication.

### Association of vitamin D polygenic risk scores and disease outcome in people with multiple sclerosis [^54324dbd]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorder of the CNS. Disease course in people with MS typically follows a pattern of intermittent inflammatory disease activity that evolves into a state in which progressive neurologic deficits accumulate.Notably, disease course in people with MS is highly variable, and contributors to this variability remain poorly understood.

Observations of higher MS risk in individuals with low vitamin D intake or low circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels, and the results implicating a potential worse MS prognosis in individuals with low 25(OH)D levels suggest that vitamin D may contribute to MS disease processes.Small experimental vitamin D supplementation studies have also reported a beneficial role of supplementation on immunologic, radiologic, and clinical outcomes. However, the results from larger scale randomized clinical trials to date have been less clear.

### Maternal serum levels of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D during pregnancy and risk of type 1 diabetes in the offspring [^bbda0270]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that is one of the most common chronic diseases during childhood. With the exception of certain susceptibility genes, the causes of type 1 diabetes are essentially unknown. During recent years, there has been increasing interest in the immunomodulating actions of vitamin D in type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune diseases.

The classical function of vitamin D is related to calcium and phosphate homeostasis and bone mineralization. Research over the last 30 years has revealed that vitamin D receptors are present in almost all body tissues, and there is increasing evidence that vitamin D is involved in a variety of processes in the body, including immunity. Furthermore, immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells as well as activated T cells and B cells, express the enzyme 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), which is responsible for converting the major circulating metabolite of vitamin D, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25-OH D), to 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH) 2 D], the active form of vitamin D. In autoimmune diseases, vitamin D is thought to have a protective effect, probably by enhancing immunologic tolerance.

Development of the immune system starts in early fetal life. Earlier studies in humans based on parental reports of vitamin D supplement use suggest that vitamin D supplementation during the 1st year of life may be associated with a reduced risk of type 1 diabetes. Exogenous protective factors such as vitamin D may be of importance in utero. Some studies indicate an association between maternal intake of vitamin D during pregnancy and the development of diabetes-associated autoantibodies in the children. On the other hand, a study from Finland did not find such associations with either autoantibodies or overt diabetes in the offspring. We have previously found that the use of cod liver oil (which is an important source of vitamin D in Norway) during the 1st year of life, and by the mother during pregnancy, was less frequent in cases of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes than in control subjects. In addition to oral intake of vitamin D, the conversion of 7-dihydrocholesterol into vitamin D 3 in the skin upon exposure to sunlight is an important source of vitamin D. The fact that the highest incidence of type 1 diabetes (with some exceptions) exists in the northern part of the world, where sunshine hours are reduced for several months during the year, has been taken as support for the hypothesis that insufficient vitamin D status may increase the risk of type 1 diabetes.

### Study details | NCT00279461 | Vitamin D deficiency causes immune dysfunction and enables or perpetuates the development of rheumatoid arthritis (...) [^d2aaf4e1]. ClinicalTrials (2006). Low credibility.

Study Overview Rationale: Low vitamin D levels hinders the ability of the macrophage to produce activated 1-25Dihydroxyvitamin at sites of inflammation. 1-25Dihydroxyvitamin D has important immunoregulatory functions including down-regulation of antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells. Under the influence of 1-25Dihydroxyvitamin D, these dendritic cells become tolerogenic
- as opposed to immunogenic
- and abrogate an immune response at early stages. Immunogenic dendritic cells play a key role in the development of autoimmune diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis by "presenting" self-antigens to the immune system. Vitamin D levels are frequently low in patients with RA. Restoring vitamin D availability to normal levels in patients with RA may induce improvement of disease manifestations through expansion of the tolerogenic dendritic cell subset.

Key Objectives:
- Conduct a double-blind randomized clinical trial, to test the hypothesis that vitamin D administered to patients with active RA has beneficial effects on this disease.
- Determine if vitamin D administered to patients with RA. induces expansion of the tolerogenic dendritic cell subset by analyzing patterns of cell surface marker expression on dendritic cells at different time points during the clinical trial. RA subjects who qualify to receive the study treatment will be randomized to receive oral vitamin D 2, 000 units or placebo daily for 6 months. Patients will be examined on a monthly basis and will be drawn a 20 ml blood sample every 2 months for monitoring purposes for a period of 12 month. The participants within the clinical trial who also participate in the translational studies on dendritic cells, will be drawn an additional blood sample of 40 ml on the first month and at the end of the study to isolate their blood dendritic cells.
- Because cancer and other autoimmune diseases may be more frequent in individuals with a moderate deficiency of vitamin D, subjects with a history of these conditions will be excluded. Because of the remote possibility of vitamin D-induced hypercalcemia, we are aiming at recruiting patients with RA who are otherwise healthy. We will exclude patients who in the past had or currently have cancer, kidney stones, chronic renal failure, congestive heart failure, arrythmia requiring treatment with antiarrythmics, pulmonary conditions requiring ambulatory oxygen, abnormal levels of calcium or elevated PTH.

### Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and risk of islet autoimmunity [^dfc6aac7]. Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

We examined the association between plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration and islet autoimmunity (IA) and whether vitamin D gene polymorphisms modify the effect of 25(OH)D on IA risk. We followed 8,676 children at increased genetic risk of type 1 diabetes at six sites in the U.S. and Europe. We defined IA as positivity for at least one autoantibody (GADA, IAA, or IA-2A) on two or more visits. We conducted a risk set sampled nested case-control study of 376 IA case subjects and up to 3 control subjects per case subject. 25(OH)D concentration was measured on all samples prior to, and including, the first IA positive visit. Nine polymorphisms in VDR , CYP24A, CYP27B1, GC, and RXRA were analyzed as effect modifiers of 25(OH)D. Adjusting for HLA-DR-DQ and ancestry, higher childhood 25(OH)D was associated with lower IA risk (odds ratio = 0.93 for a 5 nmol/L difference; 95% CI 0.89, 0.97). Moreover, this association was modified by VDR rs7975232 (interaction P = 0.0072), where increased childhood 25(OH)D was associated with a decreasing IA risk based upon number of minor alleles: 0 (1.00; 0.93, 1.07), 1 (0.92; 0.89, 0.96), and 2 (0.86; 0.80, 0.92). Vitamin D and VDR may have a combined role in IA development in children at increased genetic risk for type 1 diabetes.

### Vitamin D and autoimmune rheumatologic disorders [^ac82d297]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Vitamin D levels depend on many variables, including sun exposure, age, ethnicity, body mass index, use of medications and supplements. A much higher oral vitamin D intake than the current guidelines is necessary to maintain adequate circulating 25(OH)D levels in the absence of UVB radiation of the skin. In addition to the traditional known metabolic activities, vitamin D has been shown to modulate the immune system, and its deficiency has been linked to the development of several autoimmune disorders including type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. Experimental use of vitamin D has revealed a novel role in the immunopathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Behçet's, polymyositis/dermatomyositis and systemic scleroderma have all been associated to some extent to vitamin D deficiency. If vitamin D deficiency occurs at a higher rate in patients with autoimmune disorders, then appropriate supplementation may be indicated.

### Vitamin D and increasing incidence of type 1 diabetes-evidence for an association? [^dc6c4d95]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

There has been an important shift in the views about the actions of vitamin D during the past decade. In addition to its well-established role in the regulation of calcium metabolism, vitamin D deficiency has been associated with the risk of several extra-skeletal diseases, including type 1 diabetes among other chronic conditions. It is notable that 1,25(OH)(2)D is known to regulate the expression of over 200 different genes, including the ones related to apoptosis and immune modulation. Increased vitamin D intake is currently considered as one of the most promising candidates for the prevention of type 1 diabetes, and it has been suggested that changes in vitamin D intake during the past decades have contributed to the recent trends in the incidence of the disease. This study reviews the evidence for the role of vitamin D in type 1 diabetes development, demonstrating that support has been obtained from various lines of investigation and that the possible biological mechanisms are plausible. However, much of the evidence has been obtained from animal experiments or observational studies in humans and there is an urgent need for well-designed, randomized, controlled trials to show whether the observed associations are indeed causal.

### Autoimmune thyroid disease and type 1 diabetes mellitus: same pathogenesis ; new perspective? [^37c177c7]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D and the vitamin D receptor pathway

1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3 or VD3), which is generated by hydroxylation of the precursor 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) in the kidney, is the main active form of vitamin D (VD). VD3 is involved in the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune systems. VD deficiency seems to be a high risk factor for autoimmune diseases such as T1DM and AITD. –

A large Norwegian case-control study of 35,940 pregnant women with a 15-year follow up showed that the lower the maternal serum levels of 25(OH)D3, the higher the risk of T1DM in the offspring. Accumulating evidence from clinical studies has shown that 25(OH)D3 levels are insufficient or deficient in patients with AITD with high TPOAb and TGAb levels, and that treatment via VD supplementation has a beneficial effect on TGAb levels. These findings suggest that VD is associated with the pathogenesis and development of AITD. – A VD deficiency has been proposed to increase the immune response through activating the production of autoimmune thyroid antibodies in T helper-2 cells (Th-2) and B cells.

Most studies have universally demonstrated that decreased VD levels are associated with T1DM through their impact on insulin sensitivity and pancreatic islet beta-cell function, indicating that VD is involved in the progression and pathogenesis of T1DM. – Furthermore, earlier VD supplementation increases serum 25(OH)D3 levels, improves insulin secretion and glucose control, and decreases the risk of T1DM development in children and pregnant women.– Moreover, a study on the effect of a high-dose VD3 treatment in nondiabetic children with positive islet autoantibodies is ongoing and results will be declared on completion (DiAPREV-IT2;).

Nevertheless, the DAISY study demonstrated no significant association between VD or 25(OH)D3 intake levels in childhood and islet autoimmunity risk or T1DM.These results are in agreement with a Swedish study,and the recently published Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study.However, it may be difficult to control the factors that have led to different results, such as diet and additional environmental determinants. –

### Plasma 25, OH vitamin D concentrations are not associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-related autoantibodies in individuals at elevated risk for RA [^39f7dcf0]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the association between rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-related autoantibodies and plasma 25,OH vitamin D in subjects at risk for RA.

Methods

In 1210 subjects without RA, 76 were positive for anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies or for at least 2 rheumatoid factors (RF; by nephelometry: RF-IgM, RF-IgG, RF-IgA). 25,OH vitamin D was measured in these cases and 154 autoantibody-negative controls from this cohort.

Results

25,OH vitamin D levels did not differ between cases and controls (adjusted OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.93-1.63).

Conclusion

Vitamin D concentrations are not associated with RA-related autoimmunity in unaffected subjects at increased risk for RA.

### Inherited variation in vitamin D genes is associated with predisposition to autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes [^0d082dbb]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

The most associated 25(OH)D concentration locus, GC, only showed some evidence of an effect on type 1 diabetes in the case/control collection, despite the fact that type 1 diabetic patients have lower levels of 25(OH)D than the general population and two other 25(OH)D concentration loci, DHCR7 and CYP2R1, were associated with type 1 diabetes. One possible explanation is that the GC locus may only affect the levels of 25(OH)D bound to the DBP, without altering the amount of free and unbound 25(OH)D. Most circulating 25(OH)D is bound to DBP (80–90%) and to albumin (10–20%), with <1% unbound. An additional consideration is the difference in affinities of 25(OH)D 2 and 25(OH)D 3 to DBP and VDR, which makes D 3 more bioavailable than D 2. Standard immunoassays detect the bound and unbound forms. Because the relationship between 25(OH)D levels and immune responsiveness remains largely undefined and the biological relationship between circulating 25(OH)D and type 1 diabetes risk remains to be determined, we can only assume that 25(OH)D concentrations may be an indirect surrogate for vitamin D signaling within immune cells.

Recent studies suggest that the vitamin D metabolism gene CYP27B1, associated with both type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis, has a role in vitamin D signaling within immune cells. Inducible CYP27B1 and VDR expression has been identified within monocytes, macrophages, and T-cells as being critical in responses to mycobacterial infection and possibly in naïve T-cell activation and proliferation (–,). Consequently, the inducibility of CYP27B1 or VDR expression and/or 1,25(OH) 2 D concentrations within the immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and T-cells could be a relevant quantitative phenotype in additional analyses of the relationship between vitamin D metabolism and the development of autoimmune disease. In such future studies, children with type 1 diabetes–affected siblings and mothers with a family history of type 1 diabetes and their newborns should provide additional insight into the association of vitamin D metabolism and susceptibility to type 1 diabetes and perhaps to other autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: current evidence and outstanding questions [^321e992a]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Although there are preclinical and observational data to suggest that maintenance of vitamin D sufficiency should help prevent the onset of autoimmunity, current evidence for the therapeutic benefit of supplementation is inconclusive, and many studies are limited by group sizes. For example, in MS, a number of trials of vitamin D supplementation have been performed, generating contradictory results concerning parameters such as size of MRI lesions, rates of relapse, and effects on functionality. However, studies with type 1 diabetes [many of which used 1,25(OH) 2 D supplementation], although inconclusive, are more promising as they suggest that early intervention may preserve β -cell function. Moreover, 1,25(OH) 2 D induces a VDR-dependent transcriptional program underpinning β -cell survival. One trial concluded that a protective effect of 1,25(OH) 2 D only occurred in cases with recent (<1 year) onset of the disease. These findings are in line with the idea that vitamin D supplementation may contribute to prevention of type 1 diabetes, but lose its benefit once β -cells are largely destroyed. RCTs are needed to confirm this observation and, if so, to define the optimal timing (e.g. early in life?) and safe dosage. As type 1 diabetes as well as MS have a long silent evolution before the onset of clear clinical symptoms, such studies may require a long follow-up of subjects at increased risk for such diseases.

For other autoimmune disorders, no reliable intervention trials are yet available, but the preclinical data and observational studies on IBD are promising so that such trials deserve a high-priority score. Two large-scale studies also evaluated the preventive effects of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on the incidence of allergy (asthma) in their offspring (up to age 3) and the combined results showed small beneficial effects.

### Is vitamin D a player or not in the pathophysiology of autoimmune thyroid diseases? [^cebdac0a]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D is a steroid hormone derived from vitamin D, playing an important role in maintaining an adequate serum level of calcium and phosphorus. It is now clear that vitamin D exerts an endocrine action on the cells of the immune system, generating anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects. The mechanisms underlying the role of vitamin D in autoimmunity are not completely understood. Lower vitamin D levels have been found in several autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, autoimmune thyroid diseases (i.e. Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease) and autoimmune gastritis. Several genetic studies have demonstrated an association between thyroid autoimmunity susceptibility and gene polymorphisms of vitamin D receptor, vitamin D binding protein, 1-alpha-hydroxylase and 25-hydroxylase. Of note, some papers do not confirm this connection. With regard to the role of vitamin D in autoimmune thyroid diseases, available data remain controversial. Only few reports have analyzed the supposed association between autoimmune thyroid diseases and vitamin D concentration with inconclusive results. In our experience, low serum levels of vitamin D do not correlate either with Hashimoto's thyroiditis or with Graves' disease. The inability to achieve an unambiguous conclusion is in part due to the limitations in study design. In fact, most of the studies are cross-sectional surveys with a small number of subjects. In addition, the heterogeneity of the study population, seasonal variation of blood sampling, inter-method analytical variability of vitamin D assays and different definitions of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency contribute to contradicting results. Therefore, further randomized, controlled, prospective trials are needed in order to demonstrate the causality of vitD in AITD and consequently the role of vitamin D supplementation in prevention or improvement of AITD, providing also information on the best formulation, dose and timing of supplementation.

### Inherited variation in vitamin D genes is associated with predisposition to autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes [^ebf9f9a1]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] <50 nmol/L) is commonly reported in both children and adults worldwide, and growing evidence indicates that vitamin D deficiency is associated with many extraskeletal chronic disorders, including the autoimmune diseases type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis.

Research Design and Methods

We measured 25(OH)D concentrations in 720 case and 2,610 control plasma samples and genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms from seven vitamin D metabolism genes in 8,517 case, 10,438 control, and 1,933 family samples. We tested genetic variants influencing 25(OH)D metabolism for an association with both circulating 25(OH)D concentrations and disease status.

Results

Type 1 diabetic patients have lower circulating levels of 25(OH)D than similarly aged subjects from the British population. Only 4.3 and 18.6% of type 1 diabetic patients reached optimal levels (≥75 nmol/L) of 25(OH)D for bone health in the winter and summer, respectively. We replicated the associations of four vitamin D metabolism genes (GC, DHCR7, CYP2R1, and CYP24A1) with 25(OH)D in control subjects. In addition to the previously reported association between type 1 diabetes and CYP27B1 (P = 1.4 × 10(-4)), we obtained consistent evidence of type 1 diabetes being associated with DHCR7 (P = 1.2 × 10(-3)) and CYP2R1 (P = 3.0 × 10(-3)).

Conclusions

Circulating levels of 25(OH)D in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes vary seasonally and are under the same genetic control as in the general population but are much lower. Three key 25(OH)D metabolism genes show consistent evidence of association with type 1 diabetes risk, indicating a genetic etiological role for vitamin D deficiency in type 1 diabetes.

### Role of vitamin D in the onset, progression, and severity of multiple sclerosis [^9744a7da]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To review and assess the role of vitamin D in the onset, progression, and relapse of multiple sclerosis (MS), based on evidence acquired from the analysis of preclinical, observational, and interventional studies.

Methods

All English language literature in MEDLINE (January 1969 through April 2012) was searched for observational and interventional studies on the dosage effect of vitamin D on the onset, progression, and relapse rate of MS. The medical subject heading (MeSH) terms used in the search included Vitamin D and Multiple Sclerosis. Additional publications and abstracts were identified from review articles and from the references cited in the previously found articles. In addition to the experimental studies, only those human studies that specified the population size, doses of vitamin D used, and the resulting effect on MS were considered.

Results

Vitamin D deficiency is very common among MS patients. Multiple preclinical studies have shown that vitamin D is a potent regulator of inflammation in MS. Most observational studies support an association between high vitamin D levels and a reduced risk of developing MS. However, conflicting results have been reported by observational studies on the correlation between vitamin D and MS severity and by interventional studies using vitamin D as a therapeutic agent for MS.

Conclusion

Vitamin D deficiency in MS patients should be avoided. In addition, the risk of developing MS might be reduced by maintaining optimal vitamin D levels in the healthy population. Larger randomized interventional trials are needed to clarify the therapeutic effect of vitamin D in MS.

### Vitamin D and autoimmunity: new aetiological and therapeutic considerations [^5001d426]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is frequently prescribed by rheumatologists to prevent and treat osteoporosis. Several observations have shown that vitamin D inhibits proinflammatory processes by suppressing the enhanced activity of immune cells that take part in the autoimmune reaction. Moreover, recent evidence strongly suggests that vitamin D supplementation may be therapeutically beneficial, particularly for Th1-mediated autoimmune disorders. Some reports imply that vitamin D may even be preventive in certain disorders such as multiple sclerosis and diabetes type 1. It seems that vitamin D has crossed the boundaries of calcium metabolism and has become a significant factor in a number of physiological functions, specifically as a biological inhibitor of inflammatory hyperactivity.

### Hospital admissions for vitamin D related conditions and subsequent immune-mediated disease: record-linkage studies [^39ee8a43]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Immune-mediated diseases cumulatively represent one of the most common chronic disease groups in medicine today, affecting approximately 10% of first world populations. There is substantial evidence in support of these disorders being determined by both genetic and environmental factors. One candidate environmental risk factor implicated in immune-mediated disease susceptibility is vitamin D deficiency [-].

Historically, vitamin D was thought to play a restricted role in calcium homeostasis; however, a wealth of studies now suggests that it exerts more widespread effects. Functional laboratory studies have shown that vitamin D can modulate the immune response and a number of epidemiological findings have implicated the involvement of vitamin D deficiency in the risk of developing immune-mediated diseases [-]. These include the ecological findings of the prevalence of diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren’s syndrome, positively correlating with latitude and reduced ultraviolet radiation exposure (the primary determinant of vitamin D levels). Further support comes from studies showing low serum vitamin D levels in patients suffering from a wide range of immune disorders, including MS, type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis. These findings may, however, be biased by reverse causation.

To investigate further any association between vitamin D and immune-mediated disease, we undertook record linkage studies to determine the risk of immune-mediated disease in individuals admitted for vitamin D deficiency or a marker of vitamin D deficiency (rickets or osteomalacia) using an English national linked Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) dataset.

### Vitamin D insufficiency in infants with increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes: a secondary analysis of the POInT study [^95f0ef39]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

There is also controversy and discussion about the correct supplementation regime. The Endocrine Society recommends the following for vitamin D intake: 400–1000 IU, 600–1000 IU and 1500–2000 IU daily for children under 1 year, children 1–18 years and all adults, respectively, to treat and prevent vitamin D deficiency.The expert consensus paper recommends supplementing healthy children 0–18 years of age with a minimum of 400 IU and a maximum of 800 IU of vitamin D per day.

The importance of vitamin D in the regulation of both the innate and adaptive immune system was demonstrated by the discovery of the presence of VDR expression in almost all cells of the immune system.Essentially, adequate levels of vitamin D result in a shift in the immune status towards a more tolerogenic status.This makes vitamin D an appealing immune modulator in the treatment of immune-mediated diseases. Epidemiological data showed an association between 25-(OH)D 3 deficiency and the incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D),but that VDI is a causal factor in T1D development remains unproven.

Studies in animal models of autoimmune diseases showed that restoring serum 25-(OH)D 3 levels using high doses of vitamin D metabolites or analogues could alter the course of autoimmune diseases like T1D, multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis.In humans, the European Diabetes Centre’s EURODIAB Study showed a significant decrease in T1D diagnosis in children receiving vitamin D supplementation,while other studies indicated that maternal vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy did not reduce the risk of T1D in the offspring.In a recent study of 395 children with T1D between 3 and 18 years old without vitamin D supplementation, 64% were vitamin D insufficient.

The goal of this subanalysis of the Primary Oral Insulin Trial (POInT Study) was to investigate the presence of VDI and the evolution of these insufficiencies over time, and to analyse the effect of country-specific supplementation guidelines and participant characteristics.

### Vitamin D and multiple health outcomes: umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies and randomised trials [^e2bbfcbc]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The associations between vitamin D concentrations and various conditions and diseases have been assessed in a large and rapidly expanding literature. In addition to observational studies, numerous randomised trials have examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation on a range of outcomes. Historically, vitamin D had been linked to skeletal disease including calcium, phosphorus, and bone metabolism,osteoporosis,fractures,muscle strength,and falls.In the 2000s, growing scientific attention turned to non-skeletal chronic diseases as vitamin D deficiency was linked to cancer,cardiovascular diseases,metabolic disorders,infectious diseases,and autoimmune diseases,as well as mortality.If causal, these associations might be of great importance for public health, as vitamin D deficiency has been found to be highly prevalent in populations residing at high latitudes or leading an indoors oriented lifestyle.However, the composite literature is often confusing and has led to heated debates about the optimal concentrations of vitamin D and related guidelines for supplementation.

To provide an overview of the breadth and validity of the claimed associations of vitamin D with diverse outcomes, we have done an umbrella review of the evidence across existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We aimed to do a comprehensive evaluation of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies that examined associations of vitamin D concentrations with a range of clinical outcomes, as well as meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation. We also compared the findings of the observational studies with those from meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation, whenever these could be juxtaposed. We sought to summarise the health outcomes that have been associated with vitamin D concentrations, evaluate whether evidence exists of biases in this literature, identify health outcomes without evidence of biases, and examine the consistency of inferences from the meta-analyses of observational studies and of randomised controlled trials.

### Identification of genetic variants affecting vitamin D receptor binding and associations with autoimmune disease [^6973b838]. Human Molecular Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

Large numbers of statistically significant associations between sentinel SNPs and case-control status have been replicated by genome-wide association studies. Nevertheless, few underlying molecular mechanisms of complex disease are currently known. We investigated whether variation in binding of a transcription factor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR), whose activating ligand vitamin D has been proposed as a modifiable factor in multiple disorders, could explain any of these associations. VDR modifies gene expression by binding DNA as a heterodimer with the Retinoid X receptor (RXR). We identified 43,332 genetic variants significantly associated with altered VDR binding affinity (VDR-BVs) using a high-resolution (ChIP-exo) genome-wide analysis of 27 HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines. VDR-BVs are enriched in consensus RXR::VDR binding motifs, yet most fell outside of these motifs, implying that genetic variation often affects the binding affinity only indirectly. Finally, we compared 341 VDR-BVs replicating by position in multiple individuals against background sets of variants lying within VDR-binding regions that had been matched in allele frequency and were independent with respect to linkage disequilibrium. In this stringent test, these replicated VDR-BVs were significantly (q < 0.1) and substantially (>2-fold) enriched in genomic intervals associated with autoimmune and other diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn’s disease and rheumatoid arthritis. The approach’s validity is underscored by RXR::VDR motif sequence being predictive of binding strength and being evolutionarily constrained. Our findings are consistent with altered RXR::VDR binding contributing to immunity-related diseases. Replicated VDR-BVs associated with these disorders could represent causal disease risk alleles whose effect may be modifiable by vitamin D levels.

### Vitamin D is associated with reduced risk of Sjögren's syndrome: a mendelian randomization study [^cf6b27cc]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

, SS is an autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands, but also systemic features such as arthritis, vasculitis, pulmonary and neurological dysfunction. Despite its impact on quality of life and physical function, no disease-modifying drugs have been approved. Some observational studies have linked vitamin D deficiency to increased risk of SS, but these findings are susceptible to confounding and reverse causation. Clinical trial evidence suggests that vitamin D supplementation reduces overall autoimmune disease risk, but whether this applies to SS is not known. Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate the effect of an exposure on an outcome that is typically more robust to these biases. Prior MR studies found no evidence for a link between vitamin D and SS, but were limited by poor case definition and/or statistical power. The aim of this MR study was to estimate the effect of genetically predicted vitamin D level on risk of primary SS.

### Vitamin D and multiple health outcomes: umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies and randomised trials [^0c5f2b65]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the breadth, validity, and presence of biases of the associations of vitamin D with diverse outcomes.

Design

Umbrella review of the evidence across systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations and randomised controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, and screening of citations and references.

Eligibility Criteria

Three types of studies were eligible for the umbrella review: systematic reviews and meta-analyses that examined observational associations between circulating vitamin D concentrations and any clinical outcome; and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials assessing supplementation with vitamin D or active compounds (both established and newer compounds of vitamin D).

Results

107 systematic literature reviews and 74 meta-analyses of observational studies of plasma vitamin D concentrations and 87 meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation were identified. The relation between vitamin D and 137 outcomes has been explored, covering a wide range of skeletal, malignant, cardiovascular, autoimmune, infectious, metabolic, and other diseases. Ten outcomes were examined by both meta-analyses of observational studies and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials, but the direction of the effect and level of statistical significance was concordant only for birth weight (maternal vitamin D status or supplementation). On the basis of the available evidence, an association between vitamin D concentrations and birth weight, dental caries in children, maternal vitamin D concentrations at term, and parathyroid hormone concentrations in patients with chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis is probable, but further studies and better designed trials are needed to draw firmer conclusions. In contrast to previous reports, evidence does not support the argument that vitamin D only supplementation increases bone mineral density or reduces the risk of fractures or falls in older people.

Conclusions

Despite a few hundred systematic reviews and meta-analyses, highly convincing evidence of a clear role of vitamin D does not exist for any outcome, but associations with a selection of outcomes are probable.

### The implication of vitamin D and autoimmunity: a comprehensive review [^74442fa8]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Historically, vitamin D has been associated with the regulation of bone metabolism. However, increasing evidence demonstrates a strong association between vitamin D signaling and many biological processes that regulate immune responses. The discovery of the vitamin D receptor in multiple immune cell lineages, such as monocytes, dendritic cells, and activated T cells credits vitamin D with a novel role in modulating immunological functions and its subsequent role in the development or prevention of autoimmune diseases. In this review we, discuss five major areas in vitamin D biology of high immunological significance: (1) the metabolism of vitamin D; (2) the significance of vitamin D receptor polymorphisms in autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and systemic lupus erythematosus; (3) vitamin D receptor transcriptional regulation of immune cell lineages, including Th1, Th17, Th2, regulatory T, and natural killer T cells; (4) the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency in patients with multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and systemic lupus erythematosus; and finally, (5) the therapeutic effects of vitamin D supplementation on disease severity and progression.

### Does vitamin D reduce the risk of dementia? [^13c5ca67]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2009). Low credibility.

The understanding of the role of vitamin D in maintaining optimal health has advanced sharply in the past two decades. There is mounting evidence for beneficial roles for vitamin D in reducing the risk of bone diseases and fractures, many types of cancer, bacterial and viral infections, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. Recently, several reports have also been published regarding the role of vitamin D in neuroprotection. This article develops the hypothesis that vitamin D can reduce the risk of developing dementia, presenting the evidence from observational and laboratory studies. The observational evidence includes that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] has been associated with increased risk for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, depression, dental caries, osteoporosis, and periodontal disease, all of which are either considered risk factors for dementia or have preceded incidence of dementia. The laboratory evidence includes several findings on the role of vitamin D in neuroprotection and reducing inflammation. Although this evidence is supportive, there do not appear to be observational studies of incidence of dementia with respect to prediagnostic serum 25(OH)D or vitamin D supplementation. Such studies now appear to be warranted.

### Association between vitamin D metabolism gene polymorphisms and risk of islet autoimmunity and progression to type 1 diabetes: the diabetes autoimmunity study in the young (DAISY) [^55dcd7eb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Vitamin D metabolism genes have been associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D) risk; however, these genes have not been investigated for association with the preclinical phase of T1D, islet autoimmunity (IA). Studies of vitamin D metabolism genes may elucidate the role of vitamin D in complex diseases.

Objective

The objective of the study was to explore the association between seven vitamin D metabolism gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the risk of IA and progression to T1D.

Design

The Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young is a longitudinal, observational study.

Setting

Newborn screening for human leukocyte antigen, sibling and offspring recruitment, and follow-up took place in Denver, Colorado.

Participants

A total of 1708 children at increased genetic risk of T1D participated in the study: 148 developed IA and 62 IA-positive children progressed to T1D.

Main Outcome Measures

IA, defined as positivity for glutamic acid decarboxylase, insulin, or IA-2 autoantibodies on two or more consecutive visits, and T1D, diagnosed by a physician, were the main outcome measures.

Results

The risk of IA was associated with DHCR7/NADSYN1 rs12785878 and CYP27B1 rs4646536 [hazard ratio 1.36, 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.73 (for each additional minor allele) and hazard ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.39-0.89 (for A/G compared with the A/A genotype), respectively]. None of the vitamin D SNPs typed was associated with progression to T1D in IA-positive children. Six of the seven SNPs were significantly associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.

Conclusions

DHCR7/NADSYN1 rs12785878 and CYP27B1 rs4646536 may play an important role in islet autoimmunity, the preclinical phase of T1D. These findings should be replicated in larger cohorts for confirmation.

### The role of vitamin D in multiple sclerosis [^d9ac2ff3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the literature about the role of vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS).

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1966-April 2006) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-April 2006) searches were performed. In addition, pertinent references from identified articles were obtained. Key search terms included vitamin D, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, vitamin D deficiency, and multiple sclerosis.

Data Synthesis

Vitamin D supplementation prevented the development and progression of experimental autoimmune encephalitis, an animal model of MS, in mice. A large, prospective, cohort study found that vitamin D supplementation was associated with a 40% reduction in the risk of developing MS. Four small, noncontrolled studies suggested that vitamin D supplementation may decrease exacerbation of MS symptoms.

Conclusions

Vitamin D supplementation may help prevent the development of MS and may be a useful addition to therapy. However, current studies are in small populations and are confounded by other variables, such as additional vitamin and mineral supplementation.

### Increased levels of the vitamin D metabolite ratio are protective against progression from islet autoimmunity to T1D [^d64a9d86]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Context

Increased levels of 25OHD have been protective against islet autoimmunity (IA), a pre-clinical T1D disease state. However, the role of 25OHD and downstream metabolites in progression from IA to T1D is not well understood.

Objective

We hypothesized that downstream vitamin D metabolites and metabolite ratios would be associated with progression from IA to T1D.

Design

We quantified vitamin D3, 25OHD2, 3-epi-25OHD3, 25OHD3, 24,25(OH)2D3, and 1α,25(OH)2D3 metabolites from plasma samples using LC-MS/MS. We calculated the vitamin D metabolite ratio (VMR) (ie, 24,25(OH)2D3/25OHD3) and the epimer ratio (3-epi-25OHD3/25OHD3). We also tested the correlation between metabolite levels and gene expression in a subset of participants (n=53).

Setting

Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY) a T1D birth cohort study.

Patients Or Participants

Participants at high genetic risk for T1D who developed IA (n=143).

Main Outcome Measure

Development of clinical T1D (57/143 progressed to T1D).

Results

Higher VMR (Hazard Ratio per 1 standard deviation increase (HR): 0.65, 95% CI: 0.49-0.88) and levels of 24,25(OH)2D3 (HR per 1 standard deviation increase: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.55-0.94) at IA seroconversion were associated with a lower risk of progression to T1D, adjusting for seroconversion age, season, HLA-DR3/4 genotype, and ancestry. Functional enrichment analysis suggests higher VMR resulted in a gene expression pattern in whole blood characteristic of decreased activation of inflammatory pathways related to neutrophil infiltration.

Conclusions

A higher VMR, a more functional measure of vitamin D status, was protective against T1D progression, perhaps by decreasing activation of inflammatory pathways.

### Vitamin D: the alternative hypothesis [^bbb9549f]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Early studies on vitamin D showed promise that various forms of the "vitamin" may be protective against chronic disease, yet systematic reviews and longer-term studies have failed to confirm these findings. A number of studies have suggested that patients with autoimmune diagnoses are deficient in 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-D) and that consuming greater quantities of vitamin D, which further elevates 25 D levels, alleviates autoimmune disease symptoms. Some years ago, molecular biology identified 25 D as a secosteroid. Secosteroids would typically be expected to depress inflammation, which is in line with the reports of symptomatic improvement. The simplistic first-order mass-action model used to guide the early vitamin studies is now giving way to a more complex description of action. When active, the Vitamin D nuclear receptor (VDR) affects transcription of at least 913 genes and impacts processes ranging from calcium metabolism to expression of key antimicrobial peptides. Additionally, recent research on the Human Microbiome shows that bacteria are far more pervasive than previously thought, increasing the possibility that autoimmune disease is bacterial in origin. Emerging molecular evidence suggests that symptomatic improvements among those administered vitamin D is the result of 25-D's ability to temper bacterial-induced inflammation by slowing VDR activity. While this results in short-term palliation, persistent pathogens that may influence disease progression, proliferate over the long-term.

The discovery of the vitamin D endocrine system and a receptor for the hormonal form, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3), has brought a new understanding of the relationship between vitamin D and metabolic bone diseases, and has also established the functions of vitamin D beyond the skeleton. This has ushered in many investigations into the possible roles of vitamin D in autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular disorders, infectious diseases, cancers and granuloma-forming diseases. This article presents an evaluation of the possible roles of vitamin D in these diseases. The potential of vitamin D-based therapies in treating diseases for which the evidence is most compelling is also discussed.

### Vitamin D and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: hype or reality? [^b7fd4d3c]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Abundant laboratory findings show the important role vitamin D has in the innate and adaptive immune system. In human beings, observational studies have associated vitamin D deficiency with an increased risk for different inflammatory, infectious, and autoimmune diseases. With regard to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), conflicting data have been reported. Most epidemiological studies have been restricted by their design, and larger longitudinal studies of population-based samples and of cohorts with COPD are warranted. An alternative explanation for the discordant results in COPD might be related to the complexity of the intracellular vitamin D signalling pathway, which is not shown in systemic levels of the precursor 25-hydroxyvitamin D. For COPD in particular, we speculate that local downregulation of vitamin D signalling from and beyond the receptor might clarify why pro-inflammatory processes in the airways are not or are insufficiently countered by vitamin D-dependent control mechanisms. In a disease already characterised by glucocorticoid resistance, the potential activation and reactivation of an intrinsic comprehensive system of immune control should attract more attention to design appropriate interventions with promising therapeutic potential.

### Association between vitamin deficiencies and ophthalmological conditions [^a50472c0]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that results in the demyelination of central nervous system axons. As vitamin D is an important immunomodulator, it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of MS. Numerous studies have indicated that there is a correlation between vitamin D levels and MS where higher serum vitamin D levels indicate lower risk of developing MS.A Finnish case-control showed that low maternal pre-natal vitamin D levels can increase the risk of MS in the offspring.Adequate vitamin intake has also been shown to reduce the activity and progression of MS.Lastly, the effect of vitamin D supplementation on MS progression is conflicting with some reports indicating that vitamin D supplementation can reduce the risk of MS relapses, disease activity, and improve quality of life in patients with MS,,while other studies have shown no effect of vitamin D supplementation in patients with sufficient serum vitamin D levels.Optic neuritis, a common first symptom of MS, is characterized by demyelination of axons of the optic nerve. Studies have shown that severity of acute optic neuritis (AON) inversely correlated with serum 25(OH)D3 levels, where patients with vitamin deficiency presented with more severe AON suggesting that vitamin may offer neuroprotection in AON.

Graves’ disease is an autoimmune thyroid disease that has been linked to vitamin D deficiency. Several studies indicate that people with Graves’ disease have lower vitamin D levels compared to the general population.Thyroid eye disease (TED) is an ocular manifestation that develops in up to 25% of people with Graves’ disease. Similar to results seen in Graves’ disease, a retrospective case-control study showed that patient with TED had insufficient or deficient vitamin D levels.Furthermore, Graves’ disease patients with lower serum 25(OH)D levels were more at risk to develop TED, suggesting vitamin D may play a protective role in the development of TED.

Vitamin D has been connected to roles in cell differentiation and anti-neoplasm. Since sunlight exposure is necessary for the activation of 25(OH)D, it has been associated with decreased risk for cancer. Cancers, such as retinoblastoma (RB) have been shown to have 25(OH)D receptors which may be how vitamin D mediates its anti-neoplastic effect.One study showed that combination of vitamin D with chemotherapy significantly reduced tumor growth in patients with RB.A more recent study showed that infants with higher sunlight exposure had a reduced risk of developing sporadic RB.Together, these studies suggest a relationship between vitamin D and RB, however, further studies are needed to confirm the association.

### Vitamin D and multiple health outcomes: umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies and randomised trials [^8ac5eb9a]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Our umbrella review identified 107 systematic literature reviews and 74 meta-analyses of observational studies of plasma vitamin D concentrations and 87 meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation. The role of vitamin D has been explored in relation to an impressive number of outcomes (137 in total), covering a wide range of diseases, including among others skeletal, malignant, cardiovascular, autoimmune, infectious, and metabolic diseases. We identified a gap in the literature concerning autoimmune disease outcomes, as we found no formal meta-analyses of either observational studies or randomised controlled trials and these were examined only by systematic reviews. Furthermore, cancer, cognitive, and infectious disease outcomes were examined only in observational studies of plasma vitamin D concentrations (either systematic reviews or formal meta-analyses), and we found no meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation. Comparisons of syntheses of observational versus randomised evidence were possible for only 14 of the 137 outcomes. Largely, this unevenness in observational versus randomised evidence may reflect the low frequency of many of these outcomes, which would be difficult to study conclusively with randomised trials.

### Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations at birth in children screened for HLA-DQB1 conferred risk for type 1 diabetes [^71ece4ca]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

This and the other studies in which no differences regarding later risk of T1D was observed, had very low median 25(OH)D levels. It might be possible that a difference could be detected in a more vitamin D sufficient population. However, in another autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis, it was the lower spectrum of levels where the risk of the disease was most prominent. Accordingly it is unlikely that there is any detectable difference in relation to T1D, which was further supported by our finding that no difference were seen even in the highest 25(OH)D concentration quartile where the median levels were very close to normal.

Cord serum 25(OH)D concentrations may have a long-term influence on later health and associations have been reported with childhood metabolic profiles and early childhood growth together with neural development. Maternal vitamin D levels have been shown to have more influence on cord serum 25(OH)D than the genetic factors of the offspring. As we showed here, maternal intake of vitamin D during pregnancy has a clear impact on cord serum 25(OH)D levels and quite surprisingly, vitamin D intake was not associated with energy intake or maternal age. The factors behind the higher 25(OH)D concentrations in the cord serum samples of older mothers, which has been reported also in other studies, would require further research.

### Vitamin D levels and risk of juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a mendelian randomization study [^5c04b4c2]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Using summary level data from the most recent 25-(OH)Dand JIA, GWAS studies in European populations, we undertook the first two sample MR study in JIA to investigate the presence and magnitude of the causal effect of vitamin D on disease risk. Despite utilising multiple, complementary MR methodologies and sensitivity analyses, we found no evidence of a causal relationship between genetically predicted vitamin D levels and JIA (all subtypes). We were also unable to demonstrate a causal effect of genetically predicted oligoarticular and RF- polyarticular JIA on circulating vitamin D levels.

A causal role for low vitamin D in increasing multiple sclerosis risk has been robustly established using MR methodology –, however the results of our study are in keeping with the growing number of other MR studies which have found no causal relationship between vitamin D and other immune-mediated disorders such as RA, SLE, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes, childhood asthma, and eczema,. Therefore, although we cannot exclude small effects of vitamin D levels on JIA incidence, our results show that higher genetically predicted vitamin D levels do not reduce JIA risk and that attempts to increase circulating vitamin D levels, e.g. through supplementation, are unlikely to substantially reduce the incidence of JIA in European populations.

The role of vitamin D in JIA outcome has also been considered within the literature with regards to the level of disease activity, and incidence of JIA-associated complications e.g. uveitis. However, corresponding trial data of vitamin D supplementation is lacking with regard to reducing disease activity. Accordingly, our study has not demonstrated a causal effect of genetically predicted oligoarticular and RF- polyarticular JIA on circulating vitamin D levels. However, exploring the precise role of vitamin D in JIA disease activity in a two sample MR context would require datasets which identify genetic variants proxying JIA outcome within a JIA population. Such datasets are not currently available, thus this study cannot exclude a role for vitamin D in JIA severity, disease activity or prognosis and thus vitamin D supplementation may have a role as a treatment adjunct in JIA.

### Associations between vitamin D, disease activity, and clinical response to therapy in rheumatoid arthritis [^b8e0c45d]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Vitamin D deficiency is a potential risk factor for autoimmunity. Prior studies of the association between vitamin D levels and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity have yielded conflicting results.

Methods

Serum 25(OH)vitamin D levels were measured at baseline in 499 participants with active RA, ages 18-85 years, enrolled in a randomised clinical trial of golimumab (Go-Before Trial). Subjects were methotrexate and biologic therapy naïve. Multivariable linear regression was used to assess associations between vitamin D levels and disease activity scores (DAS28), van der Heijde-Sharp (vdHS) erosion scores, and serum inflammatory markers. Generalised estimating equations were used to evaluate the associations between vitamin D status and the response to therapy over 52 weeks, using the DAS28 and ACR response.

Results

Forty-eight percent of participants were vitamin D deficient, defined as serum 25(OH)vitamin D <20 ng/mL. Deficiency was not associated with greater DAS28 (β-0.021 [95% CI -0.22, 0.18]), adjusted for age, race, sex, BMI, disease duration and glomerular filtration rate. Vitamin D deficiency was not associated with baseline vdHS scores or inflammatory markers in adjusted or unadjusted models. There was no association between baseline vitamin D deficiency and change in DAS28 (β = -0.024 [-0.30, 0.25]), proportion meeting ACR response (OR 0.82 [0.56, 1.20]), or radiographic progression at 52 weeks (OR 0.91 [0.59-1.40]).

Conclusions

Vitamin D levels were not associated with RA disease activity, inflammatory markers, or vdHS scores at baseline. Furthermore, there was no association between baseline vitamin D level and response to therapy or radiographic progression.

### Vitamin D in systemic lupus erythematosus [^69141ced]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There is growing interest in the contribution of vitamin D deficiency to autoimmunity. It is therefore timely to review the immunologic actions of vitamin D and the evidence linking vitamin D deficiency to autoimmune disease in animal models and to systemic lupus erythematosus in epidemiologic studies.

Recent Findings

A number of recent studies have highlighted the association between systemic lupus erythematosus and vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency skews the immunologic response towards loss of tolerance. Adding vitamin D in vitro reverses immunologic abnormalities characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus.

Summary

Multiple systemic lupus erythematosus cohorts have low vitamin D levels. The physiologic and clinical consequences of vitamin D deficiency in systemic lupus erythematosus are not entirely known. Prospective studies of vitamin D in systemic lupus erythematosus are limited, but most cross-sectional studies show an inverse relationship between levels of vitamin D and disease activity. This suggests that repletion of vitamin D may have benefits beyond bone health for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.

### Systematic review of association between vitamin D levels and susceptibility and disease activity of ankylosing spondylitis [^662b1fe3]. Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Vitamin D appears to have significant effects on both innate and acquired immunity and deficiency may be associated with both susceptibility and disease severity in some autoimmune conditions. There has been little focus on the potential immunomodulatory role of vitamin D in AS. This study systematically reviews the evidence for an association between vitamin D deficiency and disease susceptibility and severity in AS.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted using Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science and conference abstracts of the European League Against Rheumatism (2002-13), British Society for Rheumatology (1993-2013) and ACR (2006-13).

Results

Fifteen original articles and five conference abstracts met the criteria for inclusion. All were cross-sectional in design. Seven of 11 studies identified lower concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) in AS patients compared with healthy controls. A significant inverse correlation between 25OHD and disease activity was observed in 5 of 11 studies. The majority of studies that failed to demonstrate significant findings used inappropriate statistical methods.

Conclusion

Cross-sectional studies using appropriate statistical analyses have highlighted that AS is associated with lower vitamin D concentrations. Within groups of AS patients there is some evidence that low vitamin D concentrations are associated with higher disease activity. However, there are insufficient published data to support an immunomodulatory role for vitamin D in AS. Further study with a longitudinal design is required to understand whether optimizing vitamin D in AS has potential as a disease-modifying intervention.

### Vitamin D and thyroid disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^78baa87c]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin D is an essential fat-soluble nutrient with hormone-like activity. Vitamin D deficiency is among the most common health problems in the world in all age groups, even in low latitude countries with sufficient UV radiation or industrialized countries with a long history of vitamin D fortification strategies. Previous studies have indicated that about one billion people around the world have been diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency. Recent evidence has shown the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in both developed and developing countries, which in Europe is 13% and in the United States 19%. Vitamin D deficiency has increased in recent years in Iran, and reports have revealed that the vitamin D deficiency rate is nearly 50%. Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency include aging, female sex, winter season, obesity, malnutrition, lack of sun exposure, and dark skin pigmentation. Accordingly, sufficient attention to vitamin D deficiency diagnosis is needed for treatment to decrease its undesirable effects on human health.

Over the last decades, numerous studies have indicated that low serum vitamin D levels are associated with a series of diseases such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, cancer, mood disorders, multiple sclerosis, and autoimmune diseases. This vitamin exerts its biological actions through nuclear vitamin D receptors (VDR) that reside in most human cells and tissues. Hence, vitamin D plays its role through the regulation of gene expression in places where its receptors exist, such as the endocrine system.

The thyroid gland is one of the largest endocrine glands with many roles for homeostatic control, including growth, energy expenditure, and metabolism. Any thyroid disorder could result in a cluster of metabolic ailments. Recent literature has illustrated the presumed association between serum vitamin D and thyroid diseases. This association results from the presence of similar receptors for vitamin D and thyroid hormones, named steroid or nuclear hormone receptors. These shreds of evidence show the importance of the role of vitamin D in thyroid function and the association between vitamin D deficiency and thyroid diseases. However, some studies observed no significant relationship. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to survey all observational studies regarding the association between serum vitamin D levels and thyroid disorders, including hypothyroidism, autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT), and Graves’ disease (GD) among the adult population.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: current evidence and outstanding questions [^d1b2996f]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D, adaptive immunity, and autoimmunity

Preclinical data

We have known since the 1980s that the VDR is present in T lymphocytes and that 1,25(OH) 2 D is an inhibitor of T cell proliferation and activation. T lymphocytes are composed of several subsets, including CD4 + helper T cells, cytotoxic CD8 + T cells, regulatory T (Treg) cells, natural killer cells, γδ T cells, and memory cells. The effects of vitamin D signaling on T cell subtypes have been reviewed extensively elsewhere (Fig. 4). In general terms, vitamin D acts to suppress T cell–driven inflammation and enhance the effects of suppressive Treg cells. The communication between antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells appears to be particularly important in this regard. The intracrine production of 1,25(OH) 2 D induces a more tolerogenic DC phenotype, characterized by the production of IL-10 (Fig. 5), which stimulates the production of Treg cells. Recent studies have suggested that 1,25(OH) 2 D controls the phenotype of DCs by altering their metabolic profile. These anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D signaling on DCs and T cells have stimulated extensive interest in the relationship between vitamin D status, inflammation, and autoimmunity. In autoimmune diabetes-prone NOD mice vitamin D deficiency early in life only (with normal intake later on) substantially and highly significantly increased the subsequent risk of disease in two independent studies. In other work, dietary 1,25(OH) 2 D reduced arthritic lesions in two mouse models of autoimmune arthritis, murine Lyme arthritis, and collagen-induced arthritis. Very similar data have been made for experimental allergic encephalomyelitis [a mouse model for human multiple sclerosis (MS)] and IBDs. These data provide support for human studies exploring a role for vitamin D in the prevention or therapy of autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, IBD, MS, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus.

### Vitamin D and systemic lupus erythematous: a review of immunological and clinical aspects [^f908e394]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the relationships between vitamin D status and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) concerning immunological, clinical aspects and possible effects of supplementation in disease modulation.

Methods

The literature was reviewed up to January 2017 for studies regarding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, immunological aspects, clinical implications and supplementation strategies. The focus was mainly on studies with implications on every day clinical practice.

Results

Vitamin D interacts with immune system mechanisms, therefore, it may be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. The literature is concordant on vitamin D insufficiency being endemic in SLE patients. Data on the correlation between SLE disease activity and circulating levels of vitamin D are controversial, as well as those related to the immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D supplementation. Novel areas of study are the relationship between constitutional symptoms and cognitive involvement of SLE and hypovitaminosis D, and the possible role of vitamin D in the formation of the atherosclerotic plaque, opening new avenues for the modulation of the cardiovascular risk.

Conclusions

Future studies are needed to fully understand the relationship between hypovitaminosis D and different aspects of SLE. The most challenging topic will be to clarify supplementation strategies with vitamin D analogues that can be effective in modulating disease activity.

### Lower vitamin D levels are associated with higher systemic lupus erythematosus activity, but not predictive of disease flare-up [^53a85a96]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Given its relative safety, there is optimism that giving high doses of vitamin D will lead to better outcomes for patients with SLE. In the first interventional study published in SLE,no significant association was found between the variation of the 25(OH)D levels and the variation of the SLEDAI score. However, this study was not randomised and the supplementation modalities were at the discretion of the attending physician so that the level of 30 ng/mL, which is usually considered as sufficient, was obtained in less than 30% subjects. Abou-Raya et al conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 2000 UI/day vitamin D3 supplementation for 12 months. In this trial, secondary outcome measure was the improvement in the SLEDAI score, and a significant improvement in disease activity was observed in the vitamin D group.In another prospective study, 763 patients with SLE with 25(OH) below 40 ng/mL among 1006 patients with SLE were supplemented with vitamin D2. A 20 ng/mL increase in 25(OH)D was associated with a significant decrease in mean SELENA-SLEDAI by 0.22, but the authors questioned the clinical relevance of this minor improvement.

Our study was limited by a lack of details regarding the supplemental vitamin D intake and the single cross-sectional measurement of 25(OH)D levels. The study may be limited by the relatively low SLE activity in the patients included in the trial so that we cannot extrapolate our results in more active patients with SLE. The duration of follow-up can also be considered as a limitation. It was strengthened by its prospective design with follow-up every 2 months, the size of the population and the homogeneity of the patients in terms of treatment received.

In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are highly prevalent in patients with SLE. There is a statistically significant association between vitamin D levels and high SLE activity, with dubious clinical consequences. Well-conducted trials are still needed to confirm or not that low vitamin D levels is a modifiable risk factor for morbidity in patients with SLE.

### Vitamin D for the treatment of multiple sclerosis: a meta-analysis [^02a34e6b]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

There is an association between latitude, relative vitamin D deficiency and risk of multiple sclerosis (MS), and an association between vitamin D and disease progression. We have performed a meta-analysis with the aim of investigating the role of therapeutic vitamin D in MS.

Methods

A systematic search of databases was performed to identify clinical trials assessing vitamin D in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Studies were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software.

Results

Twelve studies involving 950 patients were included in the final analysis. Studies were divided into four groups because of heterogeneity in study design. Studies were judged to be at low or unclear risk of bias, except in three studies, and this was confirmed by funnel plots. No statistically significant difference was seen for any of the outcome measures. There were non-significant trends in favour of vitamin D for all outcome measures, particularly when only placebo-controlled studies were included. Dose comparison studies showed a significant increase in annualised relapse rate (mean difference 0.15 [95%CI 0.01-0.30]) and non-significant trends of increased Expanded Disability Status Scale and gadolinium-enhancing lesions for the higher-dose arms.

Conclusion

These findings suggest that vitamin D supplementation may have a therapeutic role in the treatment of MS. However, there is uncertainty with regard to the most appropriate dose, with high doses potentially being associated with worse outcomes. There remains the need for further well-performed randomised, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled trials of vitamin D in MS.

### Month of birth, vitamin D and risk of immune-mediated disease: a case control study [^e9e31da8]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The susceptibility to different ID in the UK is influenced by the season of birth. This is particularly clear in patients with MS, RA, UC and SLE and suggests that at least some proportion of ID risk is preventable. Gestational vitamin D deficiency appears to be a plausible causative agent. The identification of the seasonal factor or factors responsible for such observations will be crucial for disease prevention strategies.

### Vitamin D and thyroid disease: to D or not to D? [^a4c8c66d]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

The main role of vitamin D is to maintain calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, thus preserving bone health. Recent evidence has demonstrated that vitamin D may also have a role in a variety of nonskeletal disorders such as endocrine diseases and in particular type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, adrenal diseases and polycystic ovary syndrome. Low levels of vitamin D have also been associated with thyroid disease, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Similarly, patients with new-onset Graves' disease were found to have decreased 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. Impaired vitamin D signaling has been reported to encourage thyroid tumorigenesis. This review will focus on the role of vitamin D in thyroid diseases, both autoimmune diseases and thyroid cancer, and will summarize the results of vitamin D supplementation studies performed in patients with thyroid disorders. Although observational studies support a beneficial role of vitamin D in the management of thyroid disease, randomized controlled trials are required to provide insight into the efficacy and safety of vitamin D as a therapeutic tool for this dysfunction.

### Hospital admissions for vitamin D related conditions and subsequent immune-mediated disease: record-linkage studies [^881d807e]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies have suggested that there may be an association between vitamin D deficiency and the risk of developing immune-mediated diseases.

Methods

We analyzed a database of linked statistical records of hospital admissions and death registrations for the whole of England (from 1999 to 2011). Rate ratios for immune-mediated disease were determined, comparing vitamin D deficient cohorts (individuals admitted for vitamin D deficiency or markers of vitamin D deficiency) with comparison cohorts.

Results

After hospital admission for either vitamin D deficiency, osteomalacia or rickets, there were significantly elevated rates of Addison's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, chronic active hepatitis, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, diabetes mellitus, pemphigoid, pernicious anemia, primary biliary cirrhosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, thyrotoxicosis, and significantly reduced risks for asthma and myxoedema.

Conclusions

This study shows that patients with vitamin D deficiency may have an increased risk of developing some immune-mediated diseases, although we cannot rule out reverse causality or confounding. Further study of these associations is warranted and these data may aid further public health studies.

### Vitamin D deficiency in systemic lupus erythematosus [^422efcd0]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Evidence from animal models and prospective studies of RA, multiple sclerosis, and type-1 diabetes suggest an important role for vitamin D as a modifiable environmental factor in autoimmune disease. This role has not been well studied in human SLE. We compared serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels between recently diagnosed SLE cases and matched controls, and examined disease characteristics in relationship to 25(OH)D among cases. Data from a population-based cohort of 123 recently diagnosed SLE patients and 240 controls were used. We found a trend toward lower 25(OH)D levels in cases compared to controls, which was statistically significant in Caucasians (p=0.04), controlling for age, sex, season, and smoking. Overall, 67% of the subjects were vitamin D deficient, with mean levels significantly lower among African Americans (15.9 ng/ml) compared to Caucasians (31.3 ng/ml). Critically low vitamin D levels (<10 ng/ml) were found in 22 of the SLE cases, with presence of renal disease being the strongest predictor (OR 13.3, p<0.01) followed by photosensitivity (OR 12.9, p<0.01). These results suggest vitamin D deficiency as a possible risk factor for SLE and provide guidance for future studies looking at a potential role of vitamin D in the prevention and/or treatment of SLE.

### High-dose vitamin dsupplementation in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: a randomised clinical trial [^b72447e4]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating and neurodegenerative autoimmune disease of the central nervous system with known environmental and genetic risk factors.Vitamin D is a known immunomodulator, and low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is associated with higher risk of developing MS and with increased clinical and radiological activity in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS).,However, most evidence suggesting a role for vitamin D in MS activity arises from observational studies with inherent possible limitations, including confounding and reverse causality.Two early pilot trials demonstrated potential promise but had limitations and were not designed as definitive trials, so it remained unclear after their completion if vitamin D supplementation impacts the course of established RRMS. Three randomised clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation did not demonstrate an apparent benefit with respect to the primary outcome but also were limited in duration or size and had some other limitations that reduce confidence in the results.These trials also tested the effect of vitamin D supplementation as add-on to interferon beta as the MS disease-modifying therapy, where there is a possible interaction between vitamin D and interferon beta, underscoring the importance of evaluating the effect of vitamin D supplementation in the context of other MS therapies.We sought to test whether vitamin D supplementation as add-on to a first-line disease-modifying therapy (DMT) reduces disease activity among people with active MS.

- Change in Thyroid antibody
- Correlate changes in thyroid antibody expression in patients who develop thyroid toxicity and correlation with vitamin D level. Thyroid antibody blood tests assessed pre-treatment and rechecked if develop thyroid toxicity and positivity of antibodies compared at the two timepoints. In 2015 concurrent treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab was FDA-approved on the basis of a 57. 6% response rate.

Autoimmune endocrinopathies have been reported in 6-25% of patients on anti-PD-1 therapies in different case series. With concurrent CTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibition the rate of thyroid immune mediated toxicity is approximately 15%. Autoimmune thyroid disease can easily be detected on routine blood tests before the patient develops symptoms, is associated with known autoantibodies that have clinical assays, and autoimmune thyroid disease can be treated with thyroid hormone replacement, if needed. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels have been inversely correlated with the levels of anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies in some cohorts. Vitamin D deficiency has also been linked to an increased risk of autoimmune thyroid disease. Vitamin D supplementation has been reported to suppress CD4+ T cell and NK cell function in pre-clinical and clinical studies.

It is not known whether vitamin D deficiency plays a role in the development of the irAEs in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Furthermore, it is not known if vitamin D deficiency or supplementation alters the rate of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels have been inversely correlated with the levels of anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies in some cohorts. Vitamin D deficiency has also been linked to an increased risk of autoimmune thyroid disease. This study plans to determine if baseline deficiency in serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels correlates with altered risk of developing immune mediated toxicity of the thyroid gland in patients being treated with anti-PD1/PD-L1 immunotherapy.

### Vitamin D and microbiome: molecular interaction in inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis [^f89e62b1]. The American Journal of Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Studies of systemic autoimmune diseases point to characteristic microbial patterns in various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Autoimmune diseases, and IBD in particular, show a predisposition to vitamin D deficiency, leading to alterations in the microbiome and disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. This review examines the role of the gut microbiome in IBD and discusses how vitamin D-vitamin D receptor (VDR)-associated molecular signaling pathways contribute to the development and progression of IBD through their effects on gut barrier function, the microbial community, and immune system function. The present data demonstrate that vitamin D promotes the proper function of the innate immune system by acting as an immunomodulator, exerting anti-inflammatory effects, and critically contributing to the maintenance of gut barrier integrity and modulation of the gut microbiota, mechanisms that may influence the IBD development and progression. VDR regulates the biological effects of vitamin D and is related to environmental, genetic, immunologic, and microbial aspects of IBD. Vitamin D influences the distribution of the fecal microbiota, with high vitamin D levels associated with increased levels of beneficial bacterial species and lower levels of pathogenic bacteria. Understanding the cellular functions of vitamin D-VDR signaling in intestinal epithelial cells may pave the way for the development of new treatment strategies for the therapeutic armamentarium of IBD in the near future.

### Vitamin D affects the risk of disease activity in multiple sclerosis [^0fc46c1d]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin D (VitD) affects the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS), but the impact on disease activity is controversial. We assessed whether VitD is associated with the No-Evidence of Disease Activity-3 (NEDA-3) status at 2years from disease-modifying treatment (DMT) start, and whether this association is causal or the result of confounding factors. Furthermore, we explored if a genetic predisposition to higher VitD levels affects the risk of disease activity.

Methods

230 untreated relapsing-remitting MS patients underwent serum 25-OH-vitamin-D measurement, and the association between seasonally adjusted VitD and disease activity was tested. Modelling a Polygenic Risk Score from a Genome-Wide Association Study on ~400000 individuals, we studied the impact of genetic predisposition to higher VitD on the NEDA-3 status in 1408 independent MS patients. Two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) was used to assess causality.

Results

Lower baseline VitD was associated with decreased probability of NEDA-3 at 2years (p=0.019). Particularly, VitD levels <20ng/mL conferred an over twofold risk of disease activity (OR 2.36, 95%CI 1.30 to 3.88, p=0.0037). Genetic predisposition to higher VitD levels was associated with delayed age at MS onset (p=0.018) and with a higher probability of NEDA-3 status (p=0.034). MR confirmed causality between VitD and the risk of disease activity (p=0.041).

Conclusions

VitD levels before DMT start affect the risk of disease activity in MS. Genetic predisposition to higher VitD levels confers a lower risk of disease activity and is associated with delayed MS onset. Our work prompts future prospective studies regarding VitD supplementation and lifestyle interventions to hamper disease activity in MS.

### Vitamin D levels and potential impact in systemic sclerosis [^5e932812]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is essential not only for calcium and bone metabolism, but it also may exert other biological activities, including immunomodulation through the expression of vitamin D receptor in antigen-presenting cells and activated T cells. Evidence from animal models and human prospective studies of rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, type I diabetes, and systemic lupus erythematosus, indeed suggested an important role for vitamin D as a modifiable environmental factor in autoimmune diseases. In systemic sclerosis (SSc), this role has not been completely dissected, although recent studies clearly evidenced a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Moreover, some degree of association between vitamin D deficiency and disease activity or phenotype characteristics has also been observed. Vitamin D deficiency in SSc may be related to several factors: insufficient sun exposure due to disability and skin fibrosis, insufficient intake because of gut involvement and malabsorption. Although it is advisable to regularly check vitamin D status in these patients, there is no consensus about which vitamin D supplementation regimen might be sufficient to modulate immunological homeostasis, and possibly reduce disease activity or severity, thus further prospective studies are needed. Moreover, novel vitamin D analogues with more pronounced immune modulatory effect and lower activity on calcium metabolism are in the pipeline, and might represent a great innovative opportunity for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency in such autoimmune disorders.

### Vitamin D as a protective factor in multiple sclerosis [^86bdcfc1]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels and the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS) in blood samples collected prospectively and during gestation.

Methods

In this nested case-control study, 2 population-based biobanks with 291,500 samples from 164,000 persons collected since 1975 in the northern half of Sweden were used. We identified prospectively collected blood samples from MS cases (n = 192, controls matched 2:1) and gestational samples from pregnant mothers where the offspring had later developed MS (n = 37, control mothers matched 5:1). 25(OH)D levels were measured using an ELISA, and the risk of MS was analyzed using matched logistic regression.

Results

Levels of 25(OH)D ≥75 (vs <75) nmol/L in prospectively collected blood samples were associated with a decreased risk of MS (odds ratio [OR] 0.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.16-0.98). No decrease in MS risk was found in the offspring exposed to gestational 25(OH)D levels ≥75 (vs <75) nmol/L (OR 1.8, 95% CI 0.53-5.8). The prevalence of 25(OH)D levels ≥75 nmol/L in female controls decreased gradually during 1976-2005 (p trend = 0.005).

Conclusion

This study supports the presence of an association between high 25(OH)D levels during the years preceding disease onset and a decreased risk of MS. In the very limited material with samples drawn in early pregnancy, where month-of-birth effects were controlled for, we found no association between gestational 25(OH)D levels and MS risk in the offspring. Decreasing 25(OH)D levels in the population may contribute to explain the increasing MS incidence that is suggested from epidemiologic studies.

### Hospital admissions for vitamin D related conditions and subsequent immune-mediated disease: record-linkage studies [^ce2b026b]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

We present evidence associating vitamin D deficiency (or proxies of vitamin D deficiency) with risks of or protection against developing subsequent immune-mediated disease. Previous studies have linked inherited forms of rickets with MS and type 1 diabetes, but no study has attempted an analysis similar to the one we present here. Addison’s disease and thyrotoxicosis were significantly associated in all analyses, and asthma was significantly low in all but one. The combined analysis found associations with a greater number of immune-mediated diseases - a lack of significance in the individual rickets, osteomalacia or vitamin D deficiency cohorts may reflect the lower power of these individual analyses.

The associations described warrant further attention. Mechanistically, it is possible that vitamin D deficiency predisposes to the development of immune-mediated disease by perturbing the immune response. Another explanation is reverse causality - that the disease (either sub-clinically or clinically present but not recorded with a hospital admission prior to the vitamin D deficiency admission) reduces vitamin D levels as a result of an inflammatory state and/or causes the individual to spend less time outdoors. The increasing awareness of vitamin D may also lead to an increase in requests for vitamin D testing, and subsequent diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency. However, under either of these hypotheses the apparent protective effects of vitamin D deficiency on asthma and myxoedema are not easy to reconcile. There are reports, however, that state that higher levels of vitamin D in childhood may increase the risk of asthma. For disorders such as celiac disease there may be an issue with regards to intake and/or malabsorption of vitamin D; with Addison’s disease, glucocorticoid deficiency may lead to suppression of the parathyroid hormone-vitamin D axis.

### Identification of genetic variants affecting vitamin D receptor binding and associations with autoimmune disease [^1299340b]. Human Molecular Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Complex trait-associated variants influence VDR binding

To investigate whether susceptibility to specific diseases could be influenced by VDR-BVs, we considered their locations relative to GWAS variants significantly associated with 472 diverse diseases or traits from 688 studies in the largest catalogue available (GRASP v2.0) with at least 5 associated genome-wide significant SNPs (P <5 × 10 −8) (Supplementary Material). All traits available in these catalogues were considered so as not to bias subsequent findings. Again, we employed stringent procedures, matching variants for allele frequency and LD-dependence and discarding VDR-BVs in the MHC region as well as again comparing against a background of all VDR-binding regions (`Test 3’, p. 34 of the Supplementary Material).

VDR-BVs were significantly and up to 2-fold enriched within LD intervals associated with 17 diseases or traits (Fig. 4). It is notable that these are not drawn randomly from all 472 traits considered, but are mostly immune- or inflammatory-related disorders, such as sarcoidosis, Graves’ disease, Crohn’s disease, irritable bowel syndrome and type I diabetes (Fig. 4A). The most enriched trait is Alzheimer’s disease, for which 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is a proposed causal risk factor.

Figure 4 
VDR-BVs are enriched in GWAS LD blocks for autoimmune, inflammatory and other diseases. (A,B) Traits and diseases showing enrichment of VDR-BVs (A) or VDR-rBVs (B). Diseases/trait associations were acquired from the GRASP catalog v2.0. Statistical association was computed between VDR-BVs and strong-LD (Supplementary Material) intervals around genome-wide significant (P <5 × 10 −8) disease tag-SNPs from the GRASP catalog. All available GRASP diseases and traits represented by at least 5 SNPs were analysed and those showing significant enrichment of VDR binding beyond a 1% FDR threshold were retained; disease associations supported by only 1 VDR-BV were discarded (full data are presented in the Supplementary Material). The sizes of black squares indicate the statistical significance of enrichments.

For the 341 VDR-rBVs, intervals from six disorders contained more VDR-rBVs than expected from sets of DAF-matched LD-accounted regions that bind VDR (Fig. 4B). We emphasise that this represents a highly stringent analysis that accounts for all known confounding effects, namely potential biases from called VDR-binding sites, population stratification and physical linkage.

### Association between vitamin D deficiency and hypothyroidism: results from the national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES) 2007-2012 [^c80801c3]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is characterized by hemopoietic lymphocytic infiltration and subsequent autoimmune mediated destruction of the thyroid follicles resulting in variable clinical presentations, ranging from euthyroid to subclinical to frank hypothyroid state with or without evident goiter. Different clinicopathological types have been reported and is characterized by circulating antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg). TPO is primarily involved in the synthesis of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3) while Tg sequesters thyroid hormones within thyroid follicles. Epidemiologically, the incidence is more common in females than in males and lower among alcoholics and smokers. Etiopathogenesis involves genetic predisposition and environmental factor that are newly associated with vitamin D and selenium deficiency. Vitamin D has immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory functions such as regulating the activity of the adaptive immune system, especially the low dendritic cell differentiation, enhanced Th2 helper cells (shifting from Th1 to Th2 helper cells) maturation, and activation of T regulatory (Treg) cells. Low vitamin D levels are significantly correlated with the development of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, and autoimmune thyroid diseases. A meta-analysis that looked for vitamin D levels in autoimmune thyroiditis showed that both Hashimoto thyroiditis and Grave’s disease were associated with lower vitamin D levels. Conversely, some studies have shown that there was no significant association between vitamin D and auto immune thyroiditis. In this study, we observed the relationship between vitamin D and hypothyroidism using a large nationally representative NHANES data.

### Higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D is associated with lower relapse risk in multiple sclerosis [^7242f755]. Annals of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

A protective association between higher vitamin D levels and the onset of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been demonstrated; however, its role in modulating MS clinical course has been little studied. We investigated whether higher levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D) were associated with a lower risk of relapses in people with MS.

Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort study of 145 participants with relapsing-remitting MS from 2002 to 2005. Serum 25-OH-D levels were measured biannually, and the hazard of relapse was assessed using survival analysis.

Results

There was an inverse linear relationship between 25-OH-D levels and the hazard of relapse over the subsequent 6 months, with hazard ratio (HR) 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.97) per 10 nmol/l increase in 25-OH-D level (p = 0.006). When variation due to timing of blood collection was removed by estimating 25-OH-D at the start of each season, this association persisted, with HR 0.90 (95% CI, 0.83-0.98) per 10 nmol/l increase (p = 0.016). Taking into account the biological half-life of 25-OH-D, we estimated 25-OH-D at monthly intervals, resulting in a slightly enhanced association, with HR 0.88 (95% CI, 0.82-0.95) per 10 nmol/l increase (p = 0.001). Adjusting for potential confounders did not alter these findings.

Interpretation

In this prospective population-based cohort study, in a cohort largely on immunomodulatory therapy, higher 25-OH-D levels were associated with a reduced hazard of relapse. This occurred in a dose-dependent linear fashion, with each 10 nmol/l increase in 25-OH-D resulting in up to a 12% reduction in risk of relapse. Clinically, raising 25-OH-D levels by 50 nmol/l could halve the hazard of a relapse.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^77c24184]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on vitamin D deficiency: 
- Definition: Vitamin D deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level < 20 ng/mL and 21-29 ng/mL is considered insufficiency.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of vitamin D deficiency primarily involves inadequate cutaneous synthesis due to decreased exposure to sunlight, leading to impaired intestinal absorption of calcium and secondary hyperparathyroidism. This can result in increased bone turnover and defective mineralization of the collagenous matrix. Other mechanisms of deficiency include inadequate dietary intake, reduced gastrointestinal absorption in gastrointestinal disorders, impaired hepatic 25-hydroxylation due to certain medications or liver disease, increased metabolism of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in cancer, granulomatous diseases, or primary hyperparathyroidism, and rarely, loss of vitamin D-binding protein due to nephrotic syndrome or peritoneal dialysis.
- Epidemiology: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency varies significantly by geographic region, population group, and age. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the US is estimated at 24.6%.
- Risk factors: Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency include inadequate sunlight exposure, malabsorption syndromes, bariatric procedures, renal or hepatic disease, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and certain medications such as anticonvulsants and glucocorticoids. People with dark skin, residing at higher latitudes (> 33° north or south), older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with obesity are at higher risk.
- Disease course: The clinical course of vitamin D deficiency can range from asymptomatic to severe, depending on the extent of the deficiency and the presence of comorbid conditions. Symptoms can include diffuse musculoskeletal pain, bone pain, and muscle weakness. In severe cases, it can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, osteopenia, osteomalacia, and bone fractures in adults and rickets in children. Vitamin D deficiency has also been associated with an increased risk of CVDs, T2DM, preeclampsia, infections, and cognitive impairment.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis of vitamin D deficiency is generally good with appropriate treatment, which typically involves supplementation with vitamin D3. However, untreated deficiency can result in long-term skeletal and extra-skeletal consequences and has been linked to an increased risk of mortality.

### The autoimmune ecology: an update [^9001dbe3]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The autoimmune ecology refers to the interactions between individuals and their environment leading to a breakdown in immune tolerance and, therefore, to the development of one or more autoimmune diseases in such an individual. Herein, an update is offered on four specific factors associated with autoimmune diseases, namely, vitamin D, smoking, alcohol and coffee consumption from the perspective of exposome and metabolomics.

Recent Findings

Smoking is associated with an increased risk for most of the autoimmune diseases. Carbamylation of proteins as well as NETosis have emerged as possible new pathophysiological mechanisms for rheumatoid arthritis. Low-to-moderate alcohol consumption seems to decrease the risk of systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, and studies of vitamin have suggested a beneficial effect on these conditions. Coffee intake appears to be a risk factor for type 1 diabetes mellitus and rheumatoid arthritis and a protective factor for multiple sclerosis and primary biliary cholangitis.

Summary

Recent studies support the previously established positive associations between environmental factors and most of the autoimmune diseases. Nevertheless, further studies from the perspective of metabolomics, proteomics and genomics will help to clarify the effect of environment on autoimmune diseases.

### Identification of genetic variants affecting vitamin D receptor binding and associations with autoimmune disease [^ecc754da]. Human Molecular Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Genetic variants can alter transcription factor (TF) binding, chromatin status and gene expression and can be explanatory of disease susceptibility variation. Rather than residing in protein-coding sequence, the majority (approximately 93%) of disease- or trait-associated variants lie in non-coding sequence. Furthermore, non-coding variants in regulatory elements explain 8-fold more heritability of complex traits than protein-coding variants. If we are to better understand the mechanistic bases to complex disease (and their interaction with environmental factors) then we will need to understand how sequence differences in TF binding sites (TFBSs) across multiple genotypes contribute to disease susceptibility. Variations in TF affinities will then need to be cross-referenced not just with the sentinel variant from genome-wide association studies (GWASs), which has a very low probability (∼5%) of being causal and is on average 14 kb from the true causal variant, but also with all other variants with which it lies in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD). True causal variants will be enriched in cis -regulatory elements, especially in enhancers and, to a lesser extent, in gene promoters. These elements are often active in only a few cell types and at limited developmental time points, which provides an opportunity for relating genetic variation — via molecular observations (TF binding differences) — to cellular or organ-based aetiologies.

### Vitamin D supplementation vs. placebo and incident type 2 diabetes in an ancillary study of the randomized vitamin D and omega-3 trial [^31e5c177]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Several prior RCTs of vitamin D supplementation provide conflicting evidence and on average, indicate no effect on intermediate biomarkers of glycemic and insulin homeostasis. A previous meta-analysis combined RCTs with various doses, formulations, and comparator interventions and reported no treatment effect for vitamin D on fasting glucose, HbA1c, or HOMA-IR levels after 4 to 52 weeks intervention. We also did not observe an effect of 2000 IU/d of cholecalciferol vs. placebo on these biomarkers after 2 years of treatment. In the placebo group, there was a decline in insulin sensitivity over time characterized by the Matsuda ISI, paralleling the increase in post-load insulin, and this did not occur for the vitamin D group. However, treatment group differences were not statistically significant. Our biomarker analyses further stratified by baseline characteristics did not indicate any statistically significant interactions of vitamin D with age, self-reported sex, omega-3 treatment group, race/ethnicity, or low vitamin D blood levels. Further, despite the suggested protective effect of vitamin D vs. placebo among BMI < 30 in the combined RCT meta-analysis, there were no statistically significant differences in glycemic trait outcomes by BMI. Collectively, while our findings suggest that the potential efficacy of vitamin D supplementation for T2D prevention, there is minimal impact of vitamin D vs. placebo on related glycemic traits after 2 years.

Findings from VITAL for other clinical endpoints indicate a modifying effect of BMI on the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation vs. placebo for reducing cancer incidenceand mortality, and incidence of autoimmune diseases, with benefits limited to participants without obesity at enrollment. Moreover, vitamin D at levels above current clinical thresholds for deficiency may support glycemic health and/or protect against pancreatic β-cell destruction through several biological processes previously linked to vitamin D, including immune-modulation through blockade of dendritic cell differentiation, inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation, and suppression of local or systemic inflammation. Previously published in the VITAL-CTSC, there was a significant 19% reduction in high sensitivity C-reactive protein with vitamin D that was sustained at 4 y. An effect was not observed for other biomarkers of inflammation, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, or tumor necrosis factor-α. Thus, it is plausible that vitamin D has systemic and broad-spectrum effects on immune function and other pathways that underlie potential benefits for several health outcomes and that may be modified by adiposity.

### Hypovitaminosis D among rheumatology outpatients in clinical practice [^3ea6a331]. Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Inadequate levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) are not only detrimental to musculoskeletal health and calcium homeostasis but may also have a role in immunopathology. Understanding of the role of the active vitamin D hormone (1,25-hydroxyvitamin D) in immunodysregulation via down-regulation of Th1 immunity is increasing. Indeed, it is even hypothesized that the latitude-related prevalence of autoimmune diseases is at least in part due to regional differences in the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D. Recently, 25OHD levels were found to inversely correlate with disease activity scores in RA, inflammatory arthritis and SLE but little has been published regarding the assessment and management of 25OHD (the stored and readily assayed metabolite) in routine clinical practice. Just as understanding of cardiovascular risk and its profiling in rheumatological practice has increased, so rheumatologists are ideally placed to assess and manage hypovitaminosis D in the outpatient clinic setting. We wished to audit patterns of investigation and treatment of hypovitaminosis D (by serum 25OHD assay) in general rheumatology patients and osteoporotic patients among local physicians.

For rheumatology patients, there is a dearth of formal guidance on investigation for hypovitaminosis D levels in high-risk individuals (with no specific recommendations to guide routine rheumatological practice). However, from a general medical perspective, a recent consensus position statement (CSP; from Australia) identified high-risk groups in whom a serum 25OHD assay should be performed. Here we assess whether these guidelines would adequately identify hypovitaminosis D in rheumatology patients.

For patients with low bone mass, we audited our vitamin D treatment against existing UK clinical guidelines. However, it is increasingly clear that there is no ‘One size fits all’ approach to supplementing or treating osteoporotic patients, and we sought to investigate whether new guidelines are needed.

### Anti-vitamin D antibodies [^91bf8001]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Low vitamin D levels are commonly observed in autoimmune diseases, suggesting a potential role in disease pathogenesis. The presence of anti-vitamin D antibodies may contribute to these deficiencies and influence autoimmune processes.

Objective

To review and analyze studies investigating the occurrence of anti-vitamin D antibodies in autoimmune diseases.

Results

Three studies, comprising a total of 345 patients, were reviewed. The autoimmune conditions included systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma (SSc), primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (pAPS), and pemphigus vulgaris (PV). Patient mean ages ranged from 26.8 to 31 years, with the proportion of female participants ranging from 87 % to 96 %. The duration of disease varied between 6.3 and 12.3 years. Serum vitamin D levels ranged from 11.71 ± 7.21 to 28.4 ± 9.6 ng/mL, with 57.1 % to 82.1 % of patients presenting vitamin D deficiency. The prevalence of anti-vitamin D antibodies was reported as follows: 87 % in SSc, 11 % in PV, 4 % to 6.1 % in SLE, and 3.5 % in pAPS. Associations with other disease markers were also noted: in SLE, anti-vitamin D antibodies were associated with anti-dsDNA antibodies; while in SSc, their presence was linked to the disease itself.

Conclusion

Anti-vitamin D antibodies were identified in 3.5 % to 87 % of patients with SLE, SSc, pAPS, and PV. These antibodies are associated either with the autoimmune condition itself or with other autoantibodies, suggesting their potential role in disease mechanisms and progression.

### Health effects of vitamin D supplementation: lessons learned from randomized controlled trials and mendelian randomization studies [^df6ff90c]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D plays an important role in calcium homeostasis and many cellular processes. Although vitamin D supplements are widely recommended for community-dwelling adults, definitive data on whether these supplements benefit clinically important skeletal and extraskeletal outcomes have been conflicting. Although observational studies on effects of vitamin D on musculoskeletal and extraskeletal outcomes may be confounded by reverse causation, randomized controlled studies (RCTs) and Mendelian randomization (MR) studies can help to elucidate causation. In this review, we summarize the recent findings from large RCTs and/or MR studies of vitamin D on bone health and risk of fractures, falls, cancer, and cardiovascular disease, disorders of the immune system, multiple sclerosis, and mortality in community-dwelling adults. The primary analyses indicate that vitamin D supplementation does not decrease bone loss, fractures, falls, cancer incidence, hypertension, or cardiovascular risk in generally healthy populations. Large RCTs and meta-analyses suggest an effect of supplemental vitamin D on cancer mortality. The existence of extraskeletal benefits of vitamin D supplementations are best documented for the immune system especially in people with poor vitamin D status, autoimmune diseases, and multiple sclerosis. Accumulating evidence indicates that vitamin D may reduce all-cause mortality. These findings, in mostly vitamin D-replete populations, do not apply to older adults in residential communities or adults with vitamin D deficiency or osteoporosis. The focus of vitamin D supplementation should shift from widespread use in generally healthy populations to targeted vitamin D supplementation in select individuals, good nutritional approaches, and elimination of vitamin D deficiency globally. © 2023 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).

### Vitamin D deficiency in non-autoimmune hypothyroidism: a case-control study [^48faa8b4]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin D receptors exist in many body organs. Through these receptors, vitamin D has various functions, including the regulation of ion homeostasis, cell growth, cell differentiation, and cellular immunity. Vitamin D plays an important role in preventing the occurrence of many inflammatory diseases, infections, and autoimmune diseases. In numerous studies, the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and a variety of diseases, including musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, kidney disease, diabetes and infections had been shown. The thyroid gland is also one of the organs that have a receptor for vitamin D. The vitamin D receptor in the thyroid is a member of a large group of receptors called nuclear receptors, which also belong to the thyroid hormones receptor. Some studies indicated that vitamin D deficiency is associated with various autoimmune diseases. Today, Hashimoto is one of the most common acquired hypothyroidism and autoimmune disease in children and adults. The onset of autoimmune-thyroid disease with vitamin D deficiency is very common. Plenty of evidence has shown the role of vitamin D in the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, regulatory T cell, and immune response. It seems that vitamin D deficiency leads to an increase in the risk of autoimmune diseases. Vitamin D also can reduce the pathogenesis of DCs cells, macrophage, CD4 + T, CD8 + T, and B cells. Besides, it has been shown as a selective immune inhibitor that plays an important role in suppressing and preventing the development of autoimmune diseases such as encephalopathy, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, diabetes type 1, and intestinal inflammatory diseases. Recent studies have shown the role of vitamin D deficiency in autoimmune thyroids, such as Hashimoto thyroiditis. To the best of our knowledge, there is contradictory research about the relationship between thyroid diseases, especially hypothyroidism and vitamin D deficiency; therefore, in the present study, we aimed to evaluate the vitamin D level in hypothyroidism patients. Besides, there was no study comparing the vitamin D level in immune and non-immune hypothyroidism, and the relationship between the anti-TPO level and vitamin D, as well as the disease treatment status and vitamin D; hence, in the present study we evaluated the mentioned issues.

### Lower vitamin D levels are associated with higher systemic lupus erythematosus activity, but not predictive of disease flare-up [^e79b02c9]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

We found that lower 25(OH)D levels were associated with high disease activity, which is consistent with most previous studies.The absence of association found by some studiesmight be explained by some bias: the low number of subjects,the very low disease activityand the heterogeneity of treatments, particularly HCQ.The association between lower vitamin D levels and high SELENA-SLEDAI score suggests that vitamin D may be beneficial in preventing and attenuating some manifestations of SLE. As previously stated, mounting evidence exists for beneficial effects of vitamin D in SLE. The clinical relevance of the modest association between vitamin D and high disease activity can be questioned. Moreover, all of the studies to date reporting this association were cross-sectional so that we cannot be certain that vitamin D status affects disease activity rather than vice versa. It has been proposed that VDR hyperexpression in activated lymphocytes induced by SLE activity results in increased turnover of vitamin Dso that vitamin D deficiency could possibly serve as a biomarker of disease flare.Additionally, active patients with SLE might better respect photoprotection.

Our study assesses the relationship between 25(OH)D levels and the risk of further SLE flare-ups during a 6-month follow-up. We did not find an association between baseline vitamin D levels and relapse-free survival rate. It can be argued that 6 months may be a too short period to evaluate disease flare. This finding may also reflect the dual effects of sunlight exposure in SLE: ultraviolet B rays are the main vitamin D source in the absence of vitamin D supplements, and on the same time a possible trigger of a SLE flare-up. Another explanation might be that most subjects in our study had deficient or insufficient 25(OH)D levels making it difficult to capture the effect of 25(OH)D status. The threshold of 30 ng/mL is essential for bone health, but the serum 25(OH)D level needed for optimal health is unknown.We have shown that beneficial immunological effects of vitamin D in patients with SLE in vivo were more pronounced with a mean 25(OH)D level of 51.4 ng/mL than with a mean 25(OH)D level of 41.5 ng/mL.Finally, the lack of association of vitamin D levels with relapse-free survival may be explained by the absence of clinically meaningful association between vitamin D and SLE activity.

### Cistromic and genetic evidence that the vitamin D receptor mediates susceptibility to latitude-dependent autoimmune diseases [^eedd867b]. Genes and Immunity (2016). Low credibility.

The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates gene expression in many cell types, including immune cells. It requires binding of 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D 3 (1,25D3) for activation. Many autoimmune diseases show latitude-dependent prevalence and/or association with vitamin D deficiency, and vitamin D supplementation is commonly used in their clinical management. 1,25D3 is regulated by genes associated with the risk of autoimmune diseases and predominantly expressed in myeloid cells. We determined the VDR cistrome in monocytes and monocyte-derived inflammatory (DC1) and tolerogenic dendritic cells (DC2). VDR motifs were highly overrepresented in ChIP-Seq peaks in stimulated monocyte (40%), DC1 (21%) and DC2 (47%), P< E −100 for all. Of the nearly 11 000 VDR-binding peaks identified across the genome in DC1s, 1317 were shared with DC2s (91% of DC2 sites) and 1579 with monocytes (83% of monocyte sites). Latitude-dependent autoimmune disease risk polymorphisms were highly overrepresented within 5 kb of the peaks. Several transcription factor recognition motifs were highly overrepresented in the peaks, including those for the autoimmune risk gene, BATF. This evidence indicates that VDR regulates hundreds of myeloid cell genes and that the molecular pathways controlled by VDR in these cells are important in maintaining tolerance.

### Vitamin D level in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: its relationship to disease course and bone mineral density [^90531101]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin D plays a leading role among the factors associated with autoimmune inflammatory diseases.Its deficiency is an important link in the pathogenesis of many diseases (diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, glomerulonephritis and hyperuricaemia). Vitamin D is known to be involved in maintaining calcium and phosphorus levels and regulating bone metabolism. Vitamin D is now increasingly recognised as a potent immunomodulator that regulates both innate and adapted immune responses.In recent years, interest in vitamin D has been linked to the potential for its therapeutic use to reduce inflammatory activity and improve patients’ quality of life in many autoimmune diseases. In particular, several studies have confirmed a statistically significant downward change in the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) in patients with SLE in response to vitamin D administration,as well as an improvement in the total score of the Fatigue Severity Scale.Experimental and clinical studies have shown that vitamin D status often determines the features of the SLE clinical course, severity and activity.

Population studies showed that vitamin D insufficiency occurs in two-thirds and deficiency in every five patients with SLE.Among the causes of hypovitaminosis D in SLE are kidney failure, long-term use of certain medications such as glucocorticoids (GCs), antiepileptic drugs and sunscreens, production of antibodies to vitamin D, etc.Vitamin D deficiency is also known to be quite common across the population of Ukraine compared with other European regions.Therefore, it is logical to determine levels of this vitamin not only in patients with SLE but in a particular, the population of this region.

In recent years, studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency in patients with SLE is strongly associated with reduced bone mineral density (BMD) determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).At the same time, information on the relationship between vitamin D levels and bone turnover markers (BTMs) remains poorly elucidated today. The association of vitamin D with other risk factors for osteoporosis (age, disease duration, GC therapy) in patients with SLE also requires further investigation. The association of vitamin D with disease severity and activity is also quite controversial.

The objective was to determine vitamin D levels in patients with SLE and evaluate their relationship to BMD and the disease course.

### Vitamin D in rheumatoid arthritis-towards clinical application [^046c6b95]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2016). Medium credibility.

In addition to its well-documented involvement in mineral homeostasis, vitamin D seems to have broad effects on human health that go beyond the skeletal system. Prominent among these so-called nonclassical effects of vitamin D are its immunomodulatory properties. In vitro studies have shown anti-inflammatory effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), the active form of vitamin D. In addition, epidemiological analysis of patients with established inflammatory disease identified associations between vitamin D deficiency (low serum concentrations of inactive 25-hydroxyvitamin D, abbreviated to 25(OH)D) and inflammatory conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The association of vitamin D deficiency with RA severity supports the hypothesis of a role for vitamin D in the initiation or progression of the disease, or possibly both. However, whether 25(OH)D status is a cause or consequence of RA is still incompletely understood and requires further analysis in prospective vitamin D supplementation trials. The characterization of factors that promote the transition from preclinical to clinical phases of RA has become a major focus of research, with the aim to facilitate earlier diagnosis and treatment, and improve therapeutic outcomes. In this Review, we aim to describe the current knowledge of vitamin D and the immune system specifically in RA, and discuss the potential benefits that vitamin D might have on slowing RA progression.

### The relevance of vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms for vitamin D research in multiple sclerosis [^435262cd]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

A poor vitamin D status has been associated with several autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). The receptor for the biologically active metabolite of vitamin D appears to be a key player in these associations, not only as a mediator of the biological effects of vitamin D, but also as a mediator of the regulation of vitamin D metabolism itself. In this concise review, we will discuss the mostly investigated genetic polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), and their consequences for VDR functionality and immune regulation. Next, we will discuss the association of these polymorphisms with MS, and their relation with vitamin D metabolism. We conclude that polymorphisms of the VDR have major effects on vitamin D function and metabolism, and should therefore be assessed in studies on vitamin D and MS.
