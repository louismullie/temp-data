## Question

i have a 72 years old male patient. 10 years ago, he had a radical prostatectomy because of malignant disease. PSA is getting elevated, no findings on imaging. he has at least stagnating norocytic anemia (hgb 130, mcv 86) at least for the last 6 years. ferritin is 25 ug/l, reticulocyte count 88 G/l, fecal occult blood negative 2x. what is the next step, what exam is next or what to give?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage a 72-year-old man with rising PSA after radical prostatectomy, negative imaging, and a long-standing normocytic anemia with ferritin 25 µg/L, reticulocyte count 88 G/L, and two negative fecal occult blood tests. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the biochemical recurrence and the implications for prognosis. Then, I should verify the anemia classification and whether this ferritin reflects absolute iron deficiency versus anemia of chronic disease. Next, I will consider the next best imaging modality for biochemical recurrence and when it changes management. After that, I need to outline evidence-based options for salvage therapy and when to add androgen deprivation. Finally, I will address the anemia workup and treatment, including iron repletion and when to escalate to gastrointestinal evaluation or marrow studies, while integrating guideline-based follow-up intervals and shared decision-making points [^c451db7c] [^e89b763a] [^54ed22b4].

> Let me first confirm the biochemical recurrence definition and its prognostic meaning. Biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy is typically defined as a detectable or rising PSA greater than 0.2 ng/mL with a confirmatory value, and this state signals residual local, locoregional, or micrometastatic disease even when conventional imaging is negative, which is common in early biochemical recurrence [^c451db7c] [^aacc2469]. Hold on, I should verify the timing implications: salvage radiotherapy is more effective at lower PSA levels, so earlier detection and treatment planning matter for outcomes, and patients should be counseled accordingly [^2b280af2] [^e8f554c6].

> Next, I should review the anemia carefully. The hemoglobin of 130 g/L is technically not anemic for an adult male, but wait, let me verify the ferritin threshold. With ferritin 25 µg/L, this fits absolute iron deficiency even in the absence of frank anemia, and the reticulocyte count of 88 G/L is low for a compensated state, which aligns with iron-restricted erythropoiesis rather than a robust marrow response [^e89b763a] [^9e85c12f]. I need to ensure I am not missing anemia of chronic disease; in inflammatory states, ferritin can be misleadingly normal or high, but here ferritin is unequivocally low, supporting true iron deficiency despite the normocytic indices, which can occur early or with mixed etiologies in older adults [^d25c3489] [^871c0f7d].

> I will now examine the imaging strategy for biochemical recurrence. Conventional cross-sectional imaging and bone scan have limited sensitivity at low PSA, so I should confirm whether next-generation imaging is indicated. Prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/CT is recommended when PSA is persistently greater than 0.2 ng/mL and results will influence management, given its superior detection of local and distant disease at low PSA burdens [^aa22790c] [^b9129ef9]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; if the patient is not a candidate for salvage local therapy or declines it, additional imaging may not change management and should be individualized, which is emphasized by ASCO guidance on imaging in rising PSA with negative conventional studies [^54ed22b4].

> Let me consider salvage therapy options and timing. Early salvage radiotherapy to the prostate bed improves metastasis-free and overall survival compared with delayed treatment, and effectiveness declines as PSA rises, so earlier administration at lower PSA is preferred when feasible [^2b280af2] [^e8f554c6]. I should confirm whether to add androgen deprivation therapy; in patients with high-risk features such as higher postoperative PSA, faster PSA doubling time, or adverse pathologic features, adding ADT to salvage radiotherapy is recommended, whereas in low-risk biochemical recurrence, radiotherapy alone may suffice [^4bc0c3c2] [^1dc7dd6d]. But wait, what if the patient prefers observation? Observation or clinical trial enrollment is reasonable in selected patients with low-risk biochemical recurrence and no demonstrable metastases, with decisions individualized to comorbidity and preferences [^52a8a79e].

> Next, I should review the anemia workup and treatment. Given ferritin 25 µg/L with otherwise unexplained iron deficiency in a 72-year-old man, I need to check for occult gastrointestinal blood loss even though two fecal occult blood tests were negative, because guaiac-based tests have limited sensitivity and iron deficiency in men is gastrointestinal until proven otherwise [^f7fc4df2]. I should double-check for other causes: review medications, evaluate for malabsorption, and consider celiac serology if indicated, and if the source remains unclear after noninvasive evaluation, proceed to bidirectional endoscopy guided by risk and patient preference [^f7fc4df2]. For treatment, oral iron is first-line; if intolerance or malabsorption is suspected, IV iron is reasonable, and I should monitor hemoglobin and ferritin response to confirm repletion and reassess for ongoing blood loss if the response is suboptimal [^f7fc4df2].

> I need to ensure the follow-up plan is aligned with guidelines. After definitive therapy, PSA should be monitored every 3–6 months initially, then annually after 5 years, with imaging triggered by rising PSA or new symptoms; in biochemical recurrence, restaging with cross-sectional imaging and bone scan, or PSMA PET where available, is appropriate based on PSA kinetics and risk features [^7aa42dd0] [^184eee51]. Hold on, I should verify that we are not over-imaging low-risk patients; imaging is risk-adapted and should be individualized to the likelihood of metastasis and the potential for salvage benefit [^54ed22b4].

> Let me synthesize the immediate next steps. First, confirm the PSA recurrence with a repeat value and document the PSA doubling time to stratify risk and guide salvage timing. Second, obtain PSMA PET/CT if PSA is persistently greater than 0.2 ng/mL and results will change management. Third, discuss early salvage radiotherapy with or without ADT based on risk features and patient preferences. Fourth, initiate iron replacement for confirmed iron deficiency and arrange gastrointestinal evaluation for occult blood loss, recognizing the limitations of fecal occult blood testing. Finally, schedule close PSA surveillance and symptom-directed imaging going forward [^c451db7c] [^aa22790c] [^2b280af2] [^e89b763a].

---

The next step is to **confirm iron deficiency** and start **oral iron therapy** [^e89b763a] [^f7fc4df2], as ferritin 25 µg/L with normocytic anemia and low reticulocytes indicates iron deficiency despite negative FOBT [^e89b763a]. Evaluate for **occult GI blood loss** with colonoscopy and, if indicated, upper endoscopy [^f7fc4df2], because iron deficiency in older men is gastrointestinal until proven otherwise [^f7fc4df2]. For the rising PSA after prostatectomy, obtain a PSMA PET/CT [^aa22790c] if PSA is > 0.2 ng/mL and results will change management [^aa22790c]; if unavailable, use multiparametric MRI [^notfound] or conventional imaging based on PSA kinetics and risk [^184eee51]. Manage biochemically recurrent prostate cancer with observation or clinical trial enrollment if low risk [^52a8a79e], and consider salvage radiotherapy ± ADT if high risk or if PSMA PET identifies local disease [^2b280af2] [^4bc0c3c2].

## Anemia evaluation and management

### Confirm iron deficiency

- **Ferritin < 30 µg/L**: Confirms absolute iron deficiency in the absence of inflammation [^9e85c12f].
- **Transferrin saturation (TSAT)**: Calculate; TSAT < 20% supports iron deficiency [^ce0ba136].
- **C-reactive protein (CRP)**: Assess for inflammation that can elevate ferritin and mask deficiency [^d25c3489].

---

### Initiate iron replacement

Start **oral iron** (e.g. ferrous sulfate 325 mg once daily or every other day) [^f7fc4df2] and monitor for tolerance and response. If oral iron is not tolerated or malabsorption is suspected, consider **IV iron** [^f7fc4df2].

---

### Evaluate for occult gastrointestinal blood loss

Even with negative FOBT, **colonoscopy is indicated** in older men with iron deficiency [^f7fc4df2]. If colonoscopy is negative or unrevealing, consider **upper endoscopy** to evaluate for upper GI sources of bleeding [^f7fc4df2].

---

## Prostate cancer evaluation and management

### Confirm biochemical recurrence

Biochemical recurrence is defined as a **PSA > 0.2 ng/mL** with a confirmatory value [^c451db7c]. Document **PSA kinetics** (PSA doubling time) to stratify risk and guide management [^dd03705e].

---

### Imaging for biochemical recurrence

- **PSMA PET/CT**: Preferred if PSA > 0.2 ng/mL and results will influence management [^aa22790c] [^b9129ef9].
- **Multiparametric MRI**: Consider if PSMA PET/CT is unavailable [^notfound].
- **Conventional imaging**: Use CT/MRI and bone scan based on PSA kinetics and risk [^184eee51].

---

### Management of biochemical recurrence

- **Observation or clinical trial**: For low-risk patients (slow PSA rise, low-grade disease) [^52a8a79e].
- **Salvage radiotherapy**: Offer early salvage radiotherapy ± androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for high-risk features or localized disease on imaging [^2b280af2] [^4bc0c3c2].
- **ADT**: Consider intermittent ADT if systemic therapy is indicated [^d6138101].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical issue** | **Next step** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Iron deficiency anemia | - Confirm with ferritin, TSAT, CRP <br/> - Start oral iron <br/> - Colonoscopy ± upper endoscopy | - Ferritin < 30 µg/L confirms deficiency [^9e85c12f] <br/> - GI evaluation for occult blood loss [^f7fc4df2] |
| Rising PSA after prostatectomy | - Confirm biochemical recurrence <br/> - PSMA PET/CT if PSA > 0.2 ng/mL <br/> - Manage based on risk and imaging | - Early detection guides salvage therapy [^2b280af2] <br/> - PSMA PET improves detection [^b9129ef9] |

---

The priority is to **confirm iron deficiency and start iron therapy** [^e89b763a], then evaluate for occult GI blood loss [^f7fc4df2]. Concurrently, confirm biochemical recurrence, obtain PSMA PET/CT if indicated [^aa22790c], and manage based on risk and imaging results [^52a8a79e].

### Optimum imaging strategies for advanced prostate cancer: ASCO guideline [^54ed22b4]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for prostate cancer, more specifically with respect to management of biochemical recurrence, evaluation, ASCO 2020 guidelines recommend to decide on the imaging in patients with rising PSA after prostatectomy and negative conventional imaging (either initial PSA undetectable with a subsequent rise or PSA never nadirs to undetectable) based on the goal of therapy and the potential use of salvage local therapies, as both disease states indicate potentially undetected, residual local, locoregional, or micrometastatic disease and imaging options are not distinct or different between these scenarios. Do not obtain additional next-generation imaging in patients ineligible for or unwilling to receive salvage local or regional therapy.

If the PSA level continues to rise—especially if it rises quickly—or if a lump is detected during a DRE, the doctor may recommend additional tests. These may include additional blood- or urine-based tests, or imaging tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging or high-resolution micro-ultrasound.
- 3 men would avoid developing metastatic cancer.
- 5 men would die from prostate cancer despite having screening, diagnosis, and treatment.
- 240 men would have a positive PSA test result, many of whom would have a biopsy that shows that the result was a false-positive; some men who had a biopsy would experience at least moderately bothersome symptoms from the procedure.
- 100 men would be diagnosed with prostate cancer. Of those, 80 would be treated with surgery or radiation.

Many of these men would have a serious complication from treatment, with 50 experiencing sexual dysfunction and 15 experiencing urinary incontinence.
- 200 men would die of causes other than prostate cancer. How is the PSA test used in people who have been treated for prostate cancer. The PSA test is used to monitor people after surgery or radiation therapy for prostate cancer to see if their cancer has recurred. If a person’s PSA level begins to rise after prostate cancer treatment, it may be the first sign of a recurrence. Such a “biochemical relapse” typically appears months or years before the recurrence causes symptoms. However, a single elevated PSA measurement in someone who has a history of prostate cancer does not always mean that the cancer has come back. Someone who has been treated for prostate cancer should discuss an elevated PSA level with their doctor.

The doctor may recommend repeating the PSA test or performing other tests to check for evidence of a recurrence. The doctor may look for a trend of rising PSA level over time rather than a single elevated PSA level.
- prevent an unnecessary biopsy among people with an elevated blood PSA
- screen for prostate cancer.

Conclusion

Anemia is a common sign with protean causes and manifestations. A systematic approach to evaluation and management of anemia ensures appropriate care that may optimize hemoglobin and potentially ameliorate anemia-related morbidity while minimizing unnecessary testing. Nevertheless, further research is necessary because often anemia in older age has no discernible cause or proven therapy.

### Evaluation and management of anemia in the elderly [^761ab40c]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia is now recognized as a risk factor for a number of adverse outcomes in the elderly, including hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. What constitutes appropriate evaluation and management for an elderly patient with anemia, and when to initiate a referral to a hematologist, are significant issues. Attempts to identify suggested hemoglobin levels for blood transfusion therapy have been confounded for elderly patients with their co-morbidities. Since no specific recommended hemoglobin threshold has stood the test of time, prudent transfusion practices to maintain hemoglobin thresholds of 9-10 g/dL in the elderly are indicated, unless or until evidence emerges to indicate otherwise.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^5945ef78]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion of case 1

This is a case of an older adult with a long-standing history of normocytic anemia and no overt etiology on routine testing. This is a common consult in hematology clinics and raises the question of both the necessary and sufficient evaluation. A focused history for bleeding or predisposition to bleeding (eg, antiplatelet or anticoagulants); major medical conditions related to inflammation, cancer, or gastrointestinal malabsorption; and personal or family history of anemia are important. The depth and duration of anemia are critical. In older age, a slow decline in hemoglobin of around 1 g/dL over 15 years can be expected.

In the absence of findings to direct the evaluation by history, we embark on a standard laboratory evaluation of anemia when testing has not been recently performed. These include a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, reticulocyte count, and peripheral smear review (Figure 1). The peripheral smear specifically assesses for RBC abnormalities, MDS, and leukemia disorders.

### Prostate cancer screening: common questions and answers [^4b6235dc]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer is the most diagnosed noncutaneous malignancy and the second most common cause of cancer death among men in the United States. Risk factors include older age, family history of prostate cancer, and Black race. Screening via prostate-specific antigen testing may lead to a small reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality, with no reduction in all-cause mortality, but it can cause significant harms related to false-positive test results, unnecessary biopsies, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment. Shared decision-making is strongly recommended by all national guidelines before initiating screening. Most guidelines recommend screening every 2 to 4 years in men 55 to 69 years of age at average risk. After a positive prostate-specific antigen test result (more than 4 ng/mL), the test should be repeated. If the prostate-specific antigen level is still elevated, next steps include multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, assessment of urine or blood biomarkers, and referral to urology. Active surveillance is increasingly accepted as the preferred standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed low-risk prostate cancer, because it is associated with similar long-term survival and better quality of life than curative treatment. The primary intent of screening is to identify patients with clinically significant prostate cancer who may benefit from curative treatment while minimizing the detection of clinically insignificant cancer.

Radical prostatectomy—patient selection and long-term outcomes state that radical prostatectomy is appropriate for any patient whose cancer appears clinically localized to the prostate, but because of potential perioperative morbidity it should generally be reserved for patients whose life expectancy is 10 years or more. In long-term follow-up, a 15-year prostate cancer-specific mortality of 12% was reported in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, including 5% for patients with low-risk disease. In a randomized trial of 695 patients with early-stage prostate cancer (mostly T2), with a median follow-up of 12.8 years, those assigned to the radical prostatectomy group had significant improvements in disease-specific survival, OS, and risk of metastasis and local progression.

### Advances in the multimodality management of high-risk prostate cancer [^c295e39e]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease with marked variability in its natural progression and response to therapeutic interventions. It is the most commonly diagnosed visceral cancer of men living in western countries, yet it is life-threatening in only a minority of cases. Thus, appropriate patient selection for treatment based on tumor as well as patient characteristics is essential to achieve optimal outcomes. The combination of early cancer detection and technical improvements in local treatment has led to a reduction in disease burden and an increase in cancer survivorship. However, treatment failure remains common among high-risk cases.

CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATION OF ANEMIA

The NKF clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis and management of anemia in patients with CKD recommend a routine history and physical examination, a complete blood count, a reticulocyte count, evaluation of serum iron and total iron binding capacity and serum ferritin level, and a fecal test for occult blood for evaluation of anemia. Additional tests to evaluate anemia should be guided by this initial evaluation (e.g. serum folic acid, vitamin B12 level, Coombs test, etc.). Despite the high prevalence of anemia in the CKD population, treatment with erythropoietin or iron often is not used in the predialysis period. For example, nearly 70% of patients initiated on dialysis are anemic by the NKF definition but are not treated with erythropoietin, and >50% of these patients have severe anemia (hematocrit <30%).

### Abstract (...) [^450f3652]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

ENDOCRINE DEFICIENCY RENAL FAILURE Anemia occurs in acute and chronic renal failure. The anemia is usually normocytic but may be microcytic. In renal failure, anemia occurs in part because uremic metabolites decrease the lifespan of circulating red blood cells and reduce erythropoiesis. Anemia secondary to uremia is characterized by inappropriately low erythropoietin levels, in contrast to the normal or high levels that occur with most other causes of anemia. To further confuse the presentation, serum iron levels and the percentage of iron saturation are often low, apparently because of negative acute-phase reactions. 2 In patients with a mild homogeneous normocytic anemia and a known chronic disease, anemia of chronic disease is highly likely, and bone marrow biopsy may not be necessary.

3, 9, 10 The corrected reticulocyte index, along with the white blood cell and platelet counts, indicates whether the bone marrow is functioning appropriately. The corrected reticulocyte index should be elevated in patients with an acute anemia but a competent bone marrow. The CBC revealed a normocytic anemia, with a red blood cell distribution width of 41 fL. A reticulocyte count and “draw and hold” specimens were ordered. The corrected reticulocyte index was 1. 0 percent. Ferritin and serum iron levels were obtained from the stored specimens. These tests revealed an elevated ferritin level and a low serum iron level, findings consistent with a diagnosis of anemia of chronic disease related to the patient's rheumatoid arthritis. Case 2. A 44-year-old woman presented with the complaint of fatigue. Her physical examination was unremarkable.

Developed countries, such as the United Kingdom, are experiencing a change in demographics resulting in the largest proportion of adults over 65years of age that our health systems have ever experienced. As such, haematologists must be prepared to evaluate and treat anaemia in a more complicated patient population, but sufficient evidence-based guidelines are lacking. Critical next steps that must be taken to ensure the best care of this population include the determination of appropriate haemoglobin concentrations for older adults in light of age, gender, race, and comorbidities; the development of interventional trials that address physical performance outcomes in addition to haemoglobin targets; and translational studies which address the molecular pathogenesis of anaemia in older adults with the most advanced scientific approaches.

Prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment rates have increased significantly since the introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening. Although it was initially thought that most prostate cancers would lead to death or significant morbidity, recent randomized trials have demonstrated that many patients with screening-detected cancer will not die of their disease. Modifications to PSA screening, screening guideline statements, and novel screening markers have been developed to minimize the risk and morbidity associated with overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Less aggressive management strategies such as active surveillance may lead to lower treatment rates in men who are unlikely to benefit while maintaining cure rates.

Anemia is a decreased number of circulating red blood cells and is a common medical condition faced in clinical practice. Anemia is caused by loss of red blood cells, destruction of red blood cells, decreased production of red blood cells, or a combination of these processes. Through a clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation the provider must identify the process by which the patient is anemic. Often the cause of anemia is straightforward; however, the cause can be challenging, requiring a thorough knowledge of both hematology and general medicine.

### New horizons in iron deficiency anaemia in older adults [^f7fc4df2]. Age and Ageing (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common in older adults and associated with a range of adverse outcomes. Differentiating iron deficiency from other causes of anaemia is important to ensure appropriate investigations and treatment. It is possible to make the diagnosis reliably using simple blood tests. Clinical evaluation and assessment are required to help determine the underlying cause and to initiate appropriate investigations. IDA in men and post-menopausal females is most commonly due to occult gastrointestinal blood loss until proven otherwise, although there is a spectrum of underlying causative pathologies. Investigation decisions should take account of the wishes of the patient and their competing comorbidities, individualising the approach. Management involves supplementation using oral or intravenous (IV) iron then consideration of treatment of the underlying cause of deficiency. Future research areas are outlined including the role of Hepcidin and serum soluble transferrin receptor measurement, quantitative faecal immunochemical testing, alternative dosing regimens and the potential role of IV iron preparations.

NCCN Prostate cancer—radical prostatectomy in clinically localized disease indicates that radical prostatectomy is appropriate for any patient whose cancer appears clinically localized to the prostate; however, because of potential perioperative morbidity, radical prostatectomy should generally be reserved for patients whose life expectancy is 10 years or more. Stephenson and colleagues reported a low 15-year prostate cancer-specific mortality of 12% in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (5% for patients with low-risk disease). In a randomized trial of 695 patients with early-stage prostate cancer (mostly T2), with a median follow-up of 12.8 years, those assigned to the radical prostatectomy group had significant improvements in disease-specific survival, overall survival (OS), and risk of metastasis and local progression. The reduction in mortality was confirmed at 18 years of follow-up, with an absolute difference of 11%, and overall 8 patients needed to be treated to avert one death, falling to 4 for patients <65 years of age. Longer-term results showed the cumulative incidence of death from prostate cancer was 19.6% versus 31.3% for radical prostatectomy versus watchful waiting, respectively, at 23 years, with a mean increase of 2.9 years of life in the radical prostatectomy group.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^9320e156]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Decision making with calculated risks in two clinical scenarios: For Man A (age 55 years) with PSA 1.0 ng/mL, abnormal-nodule on rectal examination, no family history, Caucasian race, and no prior negative prostate biopsy, the calculated risk of cancer is 29.1%, low-grade cancer 26.3%, and high-grade cancer 2.8%. For Man B (age 65 years) with PSA 2.5 ng/mL, normal rectal examination findings, no family history, African American race, and no prior negative prostate biopsy, the risk of cancer is 26.5%, low-grade cancer 15.7%, and high-grade cancer 10.8%; Man B “has a 4-fold higher risk of potentially life-threatening cancer than Man A.” PSA indicates prostate-specific antigen.

### Prostate cancer, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^4c47b9c4]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

Observation—applicable to patients who are older or frail with comorbidity that will likely out-compete prostate cancer for cause of death—aims to maintain quality of life by avoiding curative treatment when unlikely to affect mortality or morbidity; monitoring should include prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and physical exam no more often than every 6 months and will not involve surveillance biopsies or radiographic imaging, and when symptoms develop or are imminent, patients can begin palliative androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Reported long-term outcomes include that only 13% of patients developed metastases 15 years after diagnosis of T0–T2 disease and only 11% had died from prostate cancer.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^44a745d9]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines—ferritin cutoff for diagnosing iron deficiency in anemia states: In patients with anemia, the AGA recommends using a cutoff of 45 ng/mL over 15 ng/mL when using ferritin to diagnose iron deficiency. This is a Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. In patients with inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, other laboratory tests such as C-reactive protein, transferrin saturation, or soluble transferrin receptor may be needed in conjunction with ferritin to diagnose iron deficiency anemia.
